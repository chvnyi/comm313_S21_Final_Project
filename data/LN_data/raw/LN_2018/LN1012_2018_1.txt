Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee Issues Testimony From State Deputy Assistant Secretary BusbyTargeted News ServiceDecember 4, 2018 Tuesday 3:47 PM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 3733 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific and International Cybersecurity Policy issued the following testimony by Scott Busby, deputy assistant secretary of State for human rights and labor, at a hearing entitled "China Challenge, Part 3: Democracy, Human Rights, and the Rule of Law":"Chairman Gardner, Ranking Member Markey, and Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the invitation to appear before you today to testify on the human rights situation in China. This hearing is particularly timely coming one week before the 70th anniversary of the United Nation's adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This Declaration, which the General Assembly adopted by consensus, states that every individual has the rights to freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief, expression, peaceful assembly and association."Defending these universal rights and fundamental freedoms has been, and will continue to be, an essential element of American foreign policy, including U.S. policy toward China. As the President's National Security Strategy states, "the United States supports those who seek freedom, individual dignity, and the rule of law...and we will advocate on behalf of religious freedom and threatened minorities." Governments that respect human rights remain the best vehicle for prosperity, human happiness, and peace."Vice-President Pence aptly summed up the situation in China in his speech at the Hudson Institute on October 4: "For a time, Beijing inched toward greater liberty and respect for human rights. But in recent years, China has taken a sharp U-turn toward control and oppression of its own people.""Today, the Chinese Communist Party is implementing a system where, to quote President Xi Jinping, "the Party exercises overall leadership over all areas of endeavor in every part of the country." Space for civil society and free thought continue to shrink. There is mass detention of Uighurs, ethnic Kazakhs, and members of other Muslim minority groups in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region (Xinjiang). Surveillance is intrusive and omnipresent, not only in Xinjiang but also in many other parts of China. The government blocks U.S. press and social media websites and imprisons its own people for sharing their opinions online. Those who call on China to live up to its own laws and commitments to protect human rights have been punished. And China is doing the same to Chinese citizens abroad, including harassing political dissidents on foreign soil, detaining journalists' family members who remain in China, and coercing members of Chinese Muslim minority groups to return from overseas."Some of the worst human rights abuses are occurring unchecked in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region. Since April 2017, Chinese authorities have detained at least 800,000, and possibly more than 2 million, Uighurs and members of other Muslim minorities in internment camps for indefinite periods of time. This is the U.S. government assessment, backed by our intelligence community and open source reporting. Reports suggest that most of those detained are not being charged with crimes, and their families lack information about their whereabouts, their well-being, and for how long they will be held. The reasons given for detention appear to vary widely; in some cases, police have claimed they are detaining someone merely because they travelled abroad, or because they have family abroad. There appears to be no ability to contest such detention."At first, China denied such camps existed. As numerous public reports emerged through the testimony of brave victims and intrepid researchers and journalists, the international community began to speak out about the mass internments. Chinese authorities have recently asserted that these internment camps are "vocational education centers" designed to help young, unemployed people in Xinjiang learn job skills and the Chinese language, glossing over the fact that renowned Uighur intellectuals and retired professionals are also detained there. Former detainees who have reached safety have spoken of relentless indoctrination and harsh conditions. They report mandatory classes where detainees are required to recite Communist slogans and sing songs praising the Chinese Communist Party. Failure to quickly learn these lessons leads to beatings and food deprivation. There are reports of the use of stress positions, cold cells, and sleep deprivation in the camps. We have also seen reports of other forms of torture or cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment, including sexual abuse. One common goal in reports from former detainees seems to be to forcing detainees to renounce Islam and embrace the Chinese Communist Party. For example, praying and using common Muslim greetings are forbidden in the camps. There are reports that authorities constantly surveil detainees to ensure that they do not pray, even in their own beds in the middle of the night. Detainees are reportedly forced to eat pork and drink alcohol. Some have reported being forcibly medicated with unknown substances."Life in Xinjiang outside these internment camps is not much better. The Chinese government is engaged in an effort to monitor every aspect of life for Uighurs and members of other Muslim minority groups. Families have been forced to accept Communist officials into their homes for extended "home stays." Thousands of mosques have been shuttered or destroyed; some have even been converted into Communist propaganda centers. Those that are still open are often guarded and monitored, and entry is limited via checkpoints with electronic ID scanners. Neighborhoods also have entry and exit checkpoints manned by armed police. The pervasive surveillance in place across Xinjiang today has been frequently described as an "open-air prison.""Unfortunately, fleeing China is not enough to escape the long arm of the Chinese Communist Party. China has routinely pressured other countries to return Uighurs, ethnic Kazakhs, and members of other Muslim minority groups to China, many of whom are seeking asylum overseas. In 2015, Thailand returned nearly 100 Uighurs to China and roughly 50 remain in detention in Thailand today. In July 2017, Egyptian authorities deported two dozen Uighurs, who promptly disappeared upon arriving in China. According to civil society groups, most Uighurs involuntarily returned to China face arbitrary imprisonment, disappearance, torture, or summary execution. In some cases, most recently in Malaysia, foreign governments have resisted Chinese pressure - often at the urging of the United States and other like-minded countries - and refused to deport or return Uighur individuals to China, instead considering their asylum claims or allowing them to travel onwards to safe destinations."Even when Uighurs, ethnic Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups reach safety, Chinese security services and their proxies continue to harass and intimidate them. In 2017, Uighurs worldwide reported being contacted by Chinese police and ordered to return home. Those who complied often disappeared; those who did not received calls from family members begging them to return, for fear of retribution. The government also threatens the family members of Uighurs abroad whose work the government opposes. For example, six Uighur journalists for Radio Free Asia (RFA) living in the United States have reported that family members have been disappeared or detained. Of those, five have said Chinese authorities raised their work at RFA with their families prior to the disappearances and detentions of family members. China has also exploited international law enforcement cooperation mechanisms, like INTERPOL, in attempts to persuade countries to arrest Uighur dissidents on politically motivated charges. For instance, Dolkun Isa, the president of the World Uyghur Congress, has been repeatedly detained and harassed around the world due to an INTERPOL Red Notice issued based on China's false accusation of terrorism. INTERPOL rescinded this Red Notice in February."While the focus is often on Uighurs, who at 45% of the population of Xinjiang are the largest of the Muslim minority groups targeted by China's repressive campaign, it is not limited to them. . Several ethnic Kazakh Chinese nationals have given public interviews about their own experiences in camps. We also have reports from family members in the United States that ethnic Uzbeks have also been detained by Chinese authorities."China's repression of minority groups does not end in Xinjiang. China's repressive policies toward minority Muslim groups have spread hundreds of miles away to Hui Muslim communities with plans to shut down mosques in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. Tibetans also face continued repression and pervasive surveillance; the Tibetan Autonomous Region (TAR) was the testing ground for many of the techniques now used in Xinjiang, especially the pervasive surveillance based on ethnicity. Outside the TAR, the Chinese government maintains harsh controls on Tibetans and religious and educational centers focused on the study of Tibetan Buddhism. For example, within the past few years, authorities have reduced the number of people living in the monastic communities of Larung Gar and Yachen Gar by forcibly evicting thousands of monks, nuns, and laypersons and destroying thousands of their homes. According to RFA, authorities forced many monks and nuns evicted from Larung Gar to attend patriotic re-education classes for up to six months, with eerie parallels to the repressive practices on Muslims in Xinjiang."Chinese authorities also continue to restrict the freedom of religion of Christian communities in China. Unregistered Protestant "house churches" like the Zion Church in Beijing and the Early Rain Covenant Church in Chengdu continue to be shut down throughout the country; in one notable case in January, authorities used dynamite to demolish a house church in Shanxi province. Even officially registered churches are under increased government scrutiny, with the government requiring the removal of crosses and, in some cases, the hanging pictures of Xi Jinping and Mao Zedong inside the church and the installation of surveillance equipment. We have received reports of officials destroying or limiting the access to religious materials, like the allegations that Chinese authorities have burned both Bibles and Qurans. In September, the Holy See and China signed a two-year provisional agreement on the selection of bishops in China. The agreement has not been made public, however reports suggest the Vatican committed to filling vacant bishop positions from a slate of candidates selected by the Chinese government-run Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association (CCPA). Such procedures raise concerns regarding the freedom of religion. Falun Gong members and members of the Church of Almighty God also reportedly continue to face detention, forced labor, and torture on account of their religious beliefs."China's repression is not limited, though, to members of religious groups or ethnic minorities. The Chinese government continues to abuse lawyers, human rights defenders, and other activists. Despite the restrictions China puts on information gathering, the Congressional-Executive Commission on China maintains a database with detailed information on more than 1,400 current Chinese political prisoners. I would like to highlight a few of the most egregious cases. Authorities have held Wang Quanzhang incommunicado for over three years because of his work defending in court those whose human rights were abused. In April, his wife, Li Wenzu, attempted to walk the 100 kilometers from their home to Beijing to the Tianjin detention facility where Wang was rumored to be held. Chinese authorities forced her to turn around and placed her under house arrest instead. Her courage and dedication in the face of adversity is inspiring, and we highlighted Li Wenzu's story during our series on women human rights heroes in March."Huang Qi, who founded the Tianwang Center for Missing Persons, later renamed the Tianwang Human Rights Center, is another priority case. His initial mission was to stop trafficking in persons, and he created a website to track missing persons thought to have been trafficked. Over time, the site began tracking all manner of human rights abuses. Since 1998, Huang has been in and out of prison, but has not given up his fight for human rights. In 2016, authorities arrested him again. Reports suggest he is suffering from a number of illnesses and is at risk of dying in prison. Despite this, the government reportedly has stopped providing him with necessary medical care. Moreover, officials have reportedly tortured him to extract a confession to "leaking state secrets overseas." Despite this, he has persevered and refused to confess."Students, independent labor activists, and others advocating for fair and safe working conditions are also increasingly under threat. For example, in August, authorities in Guangdong, Beijing, and other parts of China detained approximately 50 workers and students from several universities who had been supporting workers that had been dismissed for trying to organize an independent trade union. This case is only the latest in a long-standing crackdown on independent labor organizers, which includes coordinated efforts by the Chinese government at all levels to disrupt labor rights advocacy. Workers' ability to freely associate and advocate for decent working conditions are both human rights and critical to ensuring a level playing field in global supply chains. The only unions allowed in China are affiliated with the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, or ACFTU, which is a Chinese Communist Party organ chaired by a member of the Politburo. This ban on independent unions contravenes workers' freedom of association."We also have ongoing concerns about forced labor in China. Despite China officially ending its "re-education through labor" system, we continue to receive reports of detainees compelled to perform menial labor in "administrative detention facilities" and "drug rehabilitation centers" without appropriate compensation or judicial processes. And though information is limited, we've also heard anecdotal reports about forced labor in Xinjiang's internment camps as well. Every year, the Department addresses forced labor around the world in our Trafficking in Persons report; China remains a Tier 3 country, the lowest ranking."Any organizing or political mobilization in China to raise collective concerns or advocate for social change runs the risk of intimidation and harassment by Chinese authorities. Women's rights advocates are routinely evicted from their homes on the orders of police. LGBTI content is routinely removed from the Chinese internet. Prior to one event to celebrate "International Day Against Homophobia," students were warned to avoid the event as it was being organized by "an illegal organization that may collude with Western powers." In November 2017, Beijing authorities evicted tens of thousands of migrant workers without advance notice, despite the freezing weather. When locals organized to assist those evicted, authorities evicted them from their homes and offices as well."And despite changing the infamous one-child policy to a two-child rule, coerced abortions and sterilization continue across China. National Public Radio recently published a story about Chinese authorities forcing an ethnic Kazakh woman to abort her baby, because she already had two children, by threatening to detain her brother in the internment camps in Xinjiang. After she had the abortion, officials detained him anyway."Journalists also continue to have their rights abused. The Committee to Protect Journalists ranks China as the country with the second highest number of journalists jailed. The government controls most media outlets, dictating what stories journalists can cover and often the language they must or cannot use. Regulations passed in 2017 requires online content providers to obtain licenses from the government or be shut down, subjecting online content to censorship. China's restrictions are not limited to domestic media outlets. U.S. and international journalists in China face various undue restrictions and harassment, including limitations on visa issuances or renewals in retaliation for objectionable content."China's weak adherence to the rule of law only exacerbates these issues. The new "liuzhi" detention system, which replaced the Party "shuanggui" system by formally combining Chinese State and Communist Party investigatory mechanisms, does not represent any improvement. Under the old system, Party members could be informally held and subjected to solitary confinement, beatings, sleep deprivation, and stress positions to force a confession. The new system, legally codified under the National Supervision Law, can target any public official, and those held are not entitled to appeals or to file suit against their captors. This is the rule by law, not the rule of law."China's human rights abuses are being assisted by the government's increasing technological sophistication. For example, Chinese authorities have many capabilities to filter and block access to objectionable online content, known collectively as "the Great Fire Wall." These techniques include the ability to inspect data at a deep level in transit, to reset connections with sites sending data with blacklisted keywords, and to identify and block the use of encrypted protocols. China is also capable of attacking sites it dislikes and it employs various methods to interrupt or intercept online content. The online activities of Tibetans, Uighurs, and others are frequently subject to monitoring."China is also investing heavily in artificial intelligence and machine learning, especially in pattern recognition software. The security services seek to use facial and voice recognition to rapidly identify and track individuals in a crowd. To support these systems, the authorities have initiated the mass collection of biometric information including voice samples, pictures, fingerprints, and DNA."In total, we see a concerted effort by the Chinese Communist Party to use both new advanced technologies and old-fashioned repression to intensify control or constraints on social interaction and civil liberties in China. One concerning example is the creation of a "social credit system" to provide real-world incentives to people for being "good citizens" and punish those who are not."The United States continues to advocate for human rights in China. While my colleague, Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Laura Stone, can speak better to the bilateral relationship, our bureau is implementing $10 million of FY2018 Economic Support Funds for human rights in China. This funding will support programs that improve rights awareness, strengthen citizen participation in policy formation, promote transparency and accountability, increase the ability of rights-focused civil society groups to work together, promote internationally recognized labor rights, and engage on rights-focused issues of broad concern to the Chinese public. Our strategy is to support existing reform trends within Chinese society where they exist, seeking out reformers and activists who are already having success advocating for and protecting the rights of their fellow citizens, and giving them the tools and support they need to deepen and expand their impact."The operating environment in China continues to be highly constrained due to the intensified Chinese government crackdown on civil society organizations, lawyers, and activists; increasing restrictions on and closures of organizations receiving foreign funding and partnering with foreign organizations; and heightened scrutiny of foreign NGOs and their staff. The Foreign NGO Management Law that went into effect on January 1, 2017 also has cast a shadow over the operating environment by subjecting international NGOs to greater scrutiny, leading many international funders to suspend their China programs. In the face of these difficulties, Chinese activists, lawyers, and civil society continue to request U.S. government support for their work, and DRL programs make progress within their areas of focus as implementers work creatively and courageously faced with these Chinese government restrictions."We are also using multilateral fora to encourage China to improve its human rights situation. Prior to China's Universal Periodic Review in November, for example, we submitted advance questions to push China to answer for its human rights abuses on a range of topics, including Xinjiang, Tibet, religious freedom, and the rule of law. During our intervention at the review, we specifically stated our concern about the situation for Muslim minority groups in China and called on China to abolish arbitrary detention, including within the internment camps in Xinjiang; cease the harassment, detention, and abduction of human rights defenders; amend the definition of subversion to remove all exercise of an individual's human rights and fundamental freedoms from its scope; and cease interference in the selection and education of religious leaders, such as Tibetan Buddhist lamas."We also continue to push back against China's vision of a closed internet under state control. The United States, through the State Department and the U.S. Agency for Global Media, is funding several programs, including proven anti-censorship technologies and the creation of protocols to be adopted by tool developers to make their technology less susceptible to censorship or interception."We welcome the spotlight that this hearing shines on the human rights situation in China. The Chinese people deserve a government that respects their human rights and governs under the rule of law. We continue to call on the Chinese government to end the counter-productive repression in Xinjiang, to release all political prisoners, and to respect the fundamental freedoms of all in China. We will continue to work closely with this subcommittee to support the efforts of those in China who are seeking to realize their rights."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6538186 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: December 6, 2018End of Document

Continue reading Automakers give the Chinese government access to location data of electric carsChina s government has spent the last few years pressuring automakers and citizens to adopt hybrid and electric vehicles to cut into the country s pollution levels. But many of these so-called  new energy vehicles  have also been tracking the location of drivers, and a number of government officials and entities have had access to this data, according to a sweeping new report from The Associated Press.More than 200 manufacturers (both national and foreign) transmit the data to  government-backed monitoring centers,  according to the report, including one called  The Shanghai Electric Vehicle Public Data Collecting, Monitoring and Research Center  and another known as the  National Big Data Alliance of New Energy Vehicles. China s government started mandating the systems at the beginning of 2017Chinese officials told the AP that this data   which includes the real-time location of cars, plus  dozens of other data points    is collected to  improve public safety  and  facilitate industrial development and infrastructure planning.  The officials say the data is also used to  prevent fraud  in the government s subsidy program for new energy vehicles, which offers steep discounts on clean cars. The monitoring systems have been in place since the beginning of 2017, according to a report by the International Council on Clean Transportation from last year.Staffers at the data monitoring centers are able to look at a map, click on a car, and see things like make and model, mileage, and battery charge, according to the AP report.Daimler (the parent company of Mercedes-Benz) told The Verge that the company shares this data with the government because it is mandated, but that customers are  comprehensively informed  on how it is used. Volkswagen offered a similar explanation but added that customers have to agree to the data-sharing agreement. A representative for NIO, which is an EV startup based in China, said the company complies  with the local rules and regulations of the markets we are doing business in.  Ford declined to comment. Representatives for Nissan, BMW, and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.The new focus on the data sharing mandate raises questions for automakers around the world as they are all clamoring to increase their presence in China. China is the largest market for electric vehicles in the world, and many of these companies have spent the last few years (and in some cases, decades) establishing themselves in the country. They ve partnered with Chinese car companies in joint ventures mandated by the government. They lobbied to create special economic zones that would allow foreign companies to manufacture cars on Chinese soil, before China announced a rule change this year; Tesla is in line to be the first foreign EV company to open a factory there.But making a concession around data is a potentially fraught proposition. Even if the data remains anonymized   which isn t guaranteed, according to the report   it could still become a powerful tool when placed next to the deep array of surveillance strategies employed by China s president Xi Jinping. The Chinese government had previously been working on a program that would require new cars to be equipped with trackable RFID chips. More broadly, Xi has dramatically increased the data collection capabilities of his government in recent years, established a  social credit  system that ranks citizens on their behavior, and equipped cities (and police) with facial recognition software. It s also using many of these technologies to identify and detain as many as 1 million Muslims in modern-day gulags.Tags: See Campaign:https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/30/18120148/car-companies-china-location-data-electric-cars-mercedes-teslaContact Information:Sean O'KaneTags:,            Wire,            Artificial Intelligence Newswire,            United States,            EnglishLoad-Date: December 2, 2018End of Document

Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee Issues Testimony From State Department on China ChallengeTargeted News ServiceDecember 4, 2018 Tuesday 3:47 PM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2249 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific and International Cybersecurity Policy issued the following testimony by Laura Stone, acting deputy assistant secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific affairs, at a hearing entitled "China Challenge, Part 3: Democracy, Human Rights, and the Rule of Law":"Chairman Gardner, Ranking Member Markey, and distinguished Members of the Subcommittee, I appreciate the invitation to appear before you today to testify on the human rights situation in China. President Trump wants a constructive, results-oriented relationship with China grounded in principles of fairness, reciprocity, and respect. Improving China's respect for and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms is essential to our ability to achieve this vision and realize a sustainable U.S.-China relationship."Today, however, China is doubling down on repressive domestic controls in stark contrast to the universal values that the United States and its partners have championed for many decades. In recent years, we have witnessed a regression in terms of China's respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, including religious freedom; the rule of law; and civil society. China's mass detentions of members of Muslim minority groups in Xinjiang, while perhaps the most egregious example, is only one of many recent actions taken by the Chinese leadership that run counter not only to China's international human rights commitments, but also to Chinese law."Today I will share with you the actions that the State Department is taking to reinforce our support for human rights and fundamental freedoms in China in the face of these challenges.China's Human Rights Situation"The State Department's annual Human Rights Report and its International Religious Freedom Report document how China routinely and severely restricts freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly, association, and religion or belief. Deputy Assistant Secretary Busby outlined many of them in his testimony."Chinese security officials reportedly elicit forced confessions through torture and other abuse, target members of religious and ethnic minority groups, arrest human rights lawyers, censor media and online speech, and restrict citizen participation in the political process. The death of Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Liu Xiaobo while in custody in July 2017, and the prolonged, unfounded house arrest of his wife, Liu Xia, are glaring symbols of China's mistreatment of those seeking to defend the rights of all individuals to exercise their fundamental freedoms."Beijing is also significantly strengthening censorship controls on the internet, media, and academia. Its 2016 law on foreign nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) constricts the activities of these groups by imposing stringent registration requirements and granting"supervisory authority to public security agencies. Many of the American NGOs that have been negatively affected by this law have contributed significantly to China's economic and social development over several decades and have facilitated important people-to-people exchanges between our two countries."There have been continued reports that Tibetan Buddhists have been subjected to forced disappearance, physical abuse, arbitrary detention, and arrest. The Chinese government asserts authority over the selection, approval, and veneration of reincarnations of Tibetan Buddhist lamas and supervises their religious education. We remain concerned about the lack of meaningful autonomy for Tibetans, and we regularly urge China to cease restrictions on the rights of Tibetans, as well as their unique religious, linguistic, and cultural traditions and practices."Recently, oppressive activities aimed at residents of the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous region reportedly have severely intensified, as documented by the dogged reporting of diplomats, reporters, academics, and Muslim communities abroad. The concluding observations on China by the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination further shined a spotlight on the worsening human rights crisis there. Under the guise of fighting "terrorism" and so-called "religious extremism," China's leadership is intensifying long-standing repressive policies targeting individuals who practice non-violent cultural and religious practices in Xinjiang, including by reportedly torturing and abusing prisoners held for their beliefs and forcing individuals to renounce their religion and pledge allegiance to the Communist Party."We are particularly alarmed by reports that since April 2017, extremely large numbers of Uighurs and other members of Muslim minority groups have been detained in camps. Detainees are reportedly trained to diminish their ethnic identities, religious beliefs, and nonviolent cultural and religious practices. There are reports of abuse, including torture, and deaths in these camps. China's claims that these camps are all "humane job-training centers" are preposterous. These brutal tactics risk creating the very radicalization to violence that China seeks to avoid. We consistently urge China to reverse its counterproductive policies that conflate terrorism with the peaceful expression of religious beliefs or political views."We have received reports that U.S. lawful permanent residents (LPRs), family members of U.S. citizens, and individuals who have participated in State Department exchange programs have been detained in these internment camps. This treatment of U.S. citizens, U.S. LPRs, and their family members is unacceptable. We regularly raise these cases with Chinese authorities and insist that China provide information about the locations and medical conditions of those detained and immediately release them."We are also concerned by Chinese security services harassing Uighurs abroad in order to compel them to act as informants against other Uighurs, or return to Xinjiang, sometimes by detaining their family members in these centers, or keep silent about the situation there. This includes harassment of American citizens, LPRs, and individuals legally residing in the United States. China has applied similar pressure to dual nationals or family members of citizens in other countries. The detention and persecution of Uighur and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang"reportedly have compelled them to stop communicating with their family and friends based abroad, including in the United States, for fear of retribution by authorities.U.S. Policy and Advocacy Regarding Human Rights"The Administration regularly condemns human rights violations and abuses in China. We routinely raise and advocate for individual cases of concerns with our Chinese counterparts. The Secretary has made clear in his engagements, including this past month with his counterpart in the Politburo and China's Defense Minister, that the United States would continue to advocate for human rights and fundamental freedoms. The Vice President spoke about this publicly in early October, and UN Ambassador Haley did the same in speaking about the security challenges that China's campaign in Xinjiang pose to the international community."Department of State officials regularly attend the trials and sentencings of Chinese human rights lawyers and activists, and hold meetings privately with the wives and family members of those who have been detained. We press for the release of all political prisoners, including but not limited to prominent figures like Ilham Tohti, Tashi Wangchuk, Li Yuhan, Yu Wensheng, Pastor Cao "John" Sanqiang, and Huang Qi. Last July, State Department officials highlighted the third anniversary of the Chinese government's nationwide campaign of intimidation against defense lawyers and rights defenders and the fact that Wang Quanzhang has been detained more than three years without trial. We expressed concerns about the detention of Swedish citizen and Hong Kong bookseller Gui Minhai, the sentencing of Chinese human rights defenders Wu Gan and Xie Yang, and the conviction of human rights lawyer Jiang Tianyong. Though we were unsuccessful in our intensive efforts to secure the freedom of Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Liu Xiaobo, persistent, public and private advocacy secured the long-sought release of his widow Liu Xia in July this year. Ambassador Branstad has been especially active in engaging China's leadership on cases such as these."Speaking out publicly is just one tool we have. The Department of State has also taken actions to promote accountability for those responsible for human rights abuses in China, including Chinese government and party officials. In December 2017, the Department of Treasury, in consultation with the Department of State, designated a former Chinese prison official, Gao Yan, for the detention and torture of human rights activist Cao Shunli using Executive Order 13818, which builds on and implements the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act. We have also used our high-level meetings with the Chinese to urge China to address our concerns on China's foreign NGO management law and unfair exit bans placed on U.S. citizens."Last month in Geneva, the United States delivered comprehensive and strong recommendations on human rights at China's Universal Periodic Review. At every opportunity, we urge China to address policies in Tibetan areas that threaten the rights and distinct religious, cultural, and linguistic identity of the Tibetan people, and to end counterproductive policies in Xinjiang that restrict peaceful expression and religious freedom and risk inciting radicalization to violence. The United States will continue to stand up and speak out when the Chinese government cracks down on civil society, imprisons peaceful reformers, silences legitimate dissent, or enacts legislation at odds with the freedom of religion and expression, including for members of the press. When we speak up, we will do so in concert with allies and partners throughout the world that are similarly worried about China's human rights abuses.U.S. Policy and Advocacy Regarding Xinjiang"The most severe human rights crisis in China - perhaps since the Cultural Revolution - is the mass detention and deployment of high-tech surveillance technologies to systematically repress Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other Muslim minority groups in Xinjiang. In April, Spokesperson Nauert met with the six brave U.S.-based Radio Free Asia (RFA) journalists, who shared troubling reports of Uighurs and other Muslims in Xinjiang, including their families, who have been harassed and arbitrarily or unlawfully detained. Secretary Pompeo and Vice President Pence highlighted our concerns about the situation in Xinjiang at the Ministerial to Advance International Religious Freedom in July, where they also met with Survivors of Religious Persecution representing China's Christian, Uighur Muslim, and Tibetan Buddhist communities. The Secretary raised this again at the U.S.-China Diplomatic and Security Dialogue last month."Department officials meet with members of the Uighur diaspora and coordinate with U.S. law enforcement agencies to address the harassment of Uighurs in the United States. The Department of State has conducted outreach to U.S. and Chinese companies with business in Xinjiang to draw attention to the risks of their exposure to China's abuses and to underscore the U.S. commitment to avoid complicity. There is a steady drip of asylum seekers from Xinjiang seeking refuge outside of China for fear of detention, torture, or worse. U.S. embassies around the world are providing assistance to survivors of Xinjiang's camps, including Ms. Miriguli Tuerson Mahmoud, who testified here before Congress last week and spoke about the horrifying abuses in these camps. In addition to consistently pressing China to end its campaign of repression, we have engaged dozens of foreign governments to successfully prevent the refoulement to China of Uighurs and other members of Muslim minority groups whose lives or freedom would be threatened on account of their religion or where there are substantial grounds to believe they are in danger of being subjected to torture."The State Department is leading interagency efforts within the Administration to review and develop a U.S. whole-of-government strategy to address the campaign of repression in Xinjiang. Elements of this strategy could include utilizing a number of tools to promote accountability of Chinese officials for human rights abuses, preventing China's use of U.S. goods and services to perpetrate its egregious activities in Xinjiang, and strengthening our diplomatic and public diplomacy efforts throughout the world, not just in the West. If we are to fundamentally change China's behavior in Xinjiang, the international community must act together.Conclusion"America's critical role in protecting and promoting human rights and fundamental freedoms in China is more important today than in many years. There is more the United States can do to lead on global human rights; this is part of our moral responsibility as Americans, and it is profoundly in our interests. We look forward to working closely with this subcommittee to support the efforts of the Chinese people to realize their human rights and fundamental freedoms and promote accountability for those who seek to violate or abuse those rights and freedoms."Thank you. I look forward to your questions."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6538180 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: December 6, 2018End of Document

U.S. Trade Representative Updates Section 301 InvestigationTargeted News ServiceNovember 20, 2018 Tuesday 9:00 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2112 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe U.S. Trade Representative issued the following news release:The Office of the United States Trade Representative today released a report updating information on its Section 301 investigation of China's acts, policies and practices related to technology transfer, intellectual property and innovation."We completed this update as part of this Administration's strengthened monitoring and enforcement effort," Ambassador Robert Lighthizer said. "This update shows that China has not fundamentally altered its unfair, unreasonable, and market-distorting practices that were the subject of the March 2018 report on our Section 301 investigation."* * *I. OverviewA. BackgroundOn August 14, 2017, the President instructed the U.S. Trade Representative to determine under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 19741 whether to investigate China's laws, policies, practices, or actions that may be unreasonable or discriminatory and that may be harming American intellectual property rights, innovation, or technology development.2 On August 18, 2017, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) initiated a Section 301 investigation of China's acts, policies, and practices related to technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation.3 On the date of initiation, USTR requested consultations with the Government of China concerning the issues under investigation.4 Instead of accepting the request, China's Ministry of Commerce expressed "strong dissatisfaction" with the United States and decried the investigation as "irresponsible" and "not objective."5On March 22, 2018, USTR issued the Findings of the Investigation into China's Acts, Policies, and Practices Related to Technology Transfer, Intellectual Property, and Innovation under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 (the "Section 301 Report").6 Based on this report, USTR determined the following Chinese actions are unreasonable or discriminatory and burden or restrict U.S. commerce:1. China uses foreign ownership restrictions, such as joint venture (JV) requirements and foreign equity limitations, and various administrative review and licensing processes, to require or pressure technology transfer from U.S. companies.2. China's regime of technology regulations forces U.S. companies seeking to license technologies to Chinese entities to do so on non-market based terms that favor Chinese recipients.3. China directs and unfairly facilitates the systematic investment in, and acquisition of, U.S. companies and assets by Chinese companies to obtain cutting-edge technologies and intellectual property and generate the transfer of technology to Chinese companies.4. China conducts and supports unauthorized intrusions into, and theft from, the computer networks of U.S. companies to access their sensitive commercial information and trade secrets.7After USTR issued the Section 301 Report, the United States continued to engage China to resolve the unfair trade acts, policies, and practices included in the investigation. A cabinet-level U.S. delegation traveled to Beijing on May 4, 2018, to discuss a range of bilateral economic issues, including China's policies addressed in the Section 301 Report.8 This high-level engagement continued on May 17, 2018, when senior administration officials hosted a trade delegation from China in Washington, D.C.9 Another high-level U.S. delegation met with its Chinese counterparts in Beijing on June 2 and 3, 2018 for additional discussions on trade and other issues.10 Each of these meetings gave China an opportunity to address U.S. concerns - but China failed to do so adequately.The United States has also worked closely with the European Union (EU) and Japan, who share many of the concerns expressed by the United States regarding China's acts, policies, and practices related to technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation.* At the conclusion of trilateral meetings held in May 2018, the trade ministers of the United States, Japan, and the EU (the "Ministers") "confirmed their shared view that no country should require or pressure technology transfer from foreign companies to domestic companies, including, for example, through the use of JV requirements, foreign equity limitations, administrative review and licensing processes, or other means."11* At the conclusion of trilateral meetings held in September 2018, the Ministers "further recalled their shared view that no country should require or pressure technology transfer from foreign companies to domestic companies, including, for example, through the use of JV requirements, foreign equity limitations, administrative review and licensing processes, or other means. The Ministers found such practices to be deplorable."12 The Ministers also "affirmed their commitment to effective means to stop harmful forced technology transfer policies and practices, and to this end, deepen discussions on enforcement and rule-making as tools to address these problems."13Despite repeated U.S. engagement efforts and international admonishments of its trade technology transfer policies, China did not respond constructively and failed to take any substantive actions to address U.S. concerns.As a result of China's ongoing failure to respond constructively to U.S. concerns, USTR imposed tariffs on July 6, 2018 and August 23, 2018 on approximately $50 billion of Chinese imports as part of the U.S. response to China's unfair trade practices related to the forced transfer of American technology and intellectual property.14 The United States also requested dispute settlement consultations with China in the World Trade Organization (WTO) on March 23, 2018 concerning certain measures pertaining to the licensing of intellectual property rights, and the United States is now pursuing dispute settlement before the WTO on those issues.15China, however, made clear - both in public statements and in government-to-government communications - that it would not change its policies in response to the initial Section 301 action.16 Indeed, China largely denied there were problems with respect to its policies involving technology transfer and intellectual property.17 The Information Office of China's State Council issued a 71-page "White Paper" in September 2018 that dismissed the Section 301 investigation's findings and denounced U.S. actions as "trade bullyism."18 Furthermore, China responded to the U.S. action by attempting to cause further harm to the U.S. economy, by increasing duties on certain U.S. exports to China.19These actions demonstrated that USTR's initial tariff action was no longer appropriate to obtain the elimination of China's unfair trade acts, policies, and practices. In addition, the burden or restriction on United States commerce of these acts, policies, and practices continues to increase, including following the one-year investigation period. Accordingly, under direction of the President, USTR imposed additional tariffs on approximately $200 billion of imports from China on September 24, 2018.20USTR has undertaken this update as part of its ongoing monitoring and enforcement effort. In preparing this update, USTR has relied upon publicly available material, and has consulted with other government agencies. As detailed in this update, China fundamentally has not altered its acts, policies, and practices related to technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation, and indeed appears to have taken further unreasonable actions in recent months.* Section II describes how China continues its policy and practice of conducting and supporting cyber-enabled theft and intrusions into the commercial networks of U.S. companies and those of other countries, as well as other means by which China attempts illegally to obtain information. This conduct provides the Chinese government with unauthorized access to intellectual property, including trade secrets, or confidential business information, as well as technical data, negotiating positions, and sensitive and proprietary internal business communications.* Section III describes how, despite the relaxation of some foreign ownership restrictions and certain other incremental changes in 2018, the Chinese government has persisted in using foreign investment restrictions to require or pressure the transfer of technology from U.S. companies to Chinese entities. Numerous foreign companies and other trading partners share U.S. concerns regarding China's technology transfer regime.* Section IV describes China's discriminatory licensing restrictions and how the United States has requested consultations and is pursuing dispute settlement under the WTO in China - Certain Measures Concerning the Protection of Intellectual Property Rights (WT/DS542). China continues to maintain these discriminatory licensing restrictions.* Section V describes how, despite an apparent aggregate decline in Chinese outbound investment in the United States in 2018, the Chinese government continues to direct and unfairly facilitate the systematic investment in, and acquisition of, U.S. companies and assets by Chinese entities, to obtain cutting-edge technologies and intellectual property and generate large-scale technology transfer in industries deemed important by state industrial plans. Chinese outbound investment is increasingly focused on venture capital (VC) investment in U.S. technology centers such as Silicon Valley, with Chinese VC investment reaching record levels in 2018.B. China's Technology Policies PersistAs detailed in the introduction to the Section 301 Report, official publications of the Chinese government and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) set out China's ambitious technology-related industrial policies. These policies are driven in large part by China's goals of dominating its domestic market and becoming a global leader in a wide range of technologies, especially advanced technologies. The most prominent industrial policy is "Made in China 2025," initiated in 2015.21 Industrial sectors that contribute to or benefit from the "Made in China 2025" industrial policy include aerospace, information and communications technology, robotics, industrial machinery, new materials, and automobiles.22In the period following the publication of the Section 301 Report, China has deliberately downplayed the importance of and reduced official media attention on the Made in China 2025 policy. In late June, China's Internet Propaganda Ministry reportedly circulated a Propaganda Oral Notice directing media outlets to "not make further use of 'Made in China 2025,' or there will be consequences."23 Also in late June, the Hong Kong paper South China Morning Post asked Wang Xinzhe, chief economist at China's Ministry of Industry and InformationTechnology (MIIT), whether the Chinese government "would withhold or adjust" the Made in China 2025 policy.24 In his response, Mr. Wang made no mention at all of the policy, stating only that "the ministry was following guidelines" set during the CCP's 2017 national congress regarding "upgrading the manufacturing industry."25In addition, the May 2018 project guide26 for China's Industrial Transformation and Upgrading Fund - a government fund that provides financing to technology-related programs in sectors linked to Made in China 202527 - no longer references the industrial policy by name, even though it still targets the same high-technology industries.28 (Made in China 2025 featured prominently in the fund's administrative measure, issued in December 2016, and its 2017 project guide published in August 2017.29)Despite this transparent attempt to deemphasize Made in China 2025 in public, China continues to implement this industrial policy on a large scale. In February 2018, the National Strategic Advisory Committee on Building a Powerful Manufacturing Nation published the Made in China 2025 Key Area Technology and Innovation Greenbook - Technology Roadmap (2017) ("2017 Roadmap"),30 which updates and replaces the 2015 Made in China 2025 Key Area Technology Roadmap ("2015 Roadmap")31 discussed in the Section 301 Report. The updated document again sets explicit market share and other targets to be filled by Chinese producersboth domestically and globally in dozens of high-technology industries. For example, the 2017 Roadmap calls for "indigenous new energy vehicle annual production" to have a "supplying capacity that can satisfy more than 80% of the market" by 2020, up from a 70% target set in the 2015 Roadmap.To read the full report, click here. https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/enforcement/301Investigations/301%20Report%20Update.pdfCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6524604 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: November 21, 2018End of Document

CHINA'S NON-TRADITIONAL ESPIONAGE AGAINST THE UNITED STATES: THE THREAT AND POTENTIAL POLICY RESPONSESStates News ServiceDecember 12, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 1795 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the FBI:Statement for the RecordChairman Grassley, Ranking Member Feinstein, members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today, and thank you for highlighting the threat from Chinese espionage.It is impossible to overstate the differences between the American and Chinese systems. China is an authoritarian, one-party state where the Chinese Communist Party reigns supreme. At the Chinese Communist Party's direction, the Chinese government dominates every facet of Chinese life, through actions such as central economic planning, Internet and media censorship, and leveraging intrusive technologies.The Chinese government is attempting to acquire or steal, not only the plans and intentions of the United States government, but also the ideas and innovations of the very people that make our economy so incredibly successful. The Chinese government understands a core lesson of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union: economic strength is the foundation of national power. The competition between the United States and China will be greatly influenced, if not ultimately decided, on the strength of our economies.The Chinese government means to compete with us in every way possible, playing by the rules at times, bending them at others, and breaking them when necessary to ensure their success. They also aim to rewrite the rules to shape the world in their image, and they have already made progress on this front. The rules they write seek to guarantee the dominance of their businesses and root Chinese national power in the very fabric of an international system.From my vantage point, it appears we are at the early stages of a hyper-competitive world. This is not simply a competition between businesses and industries but also between governments and the ways in which they govern their societies. Make no mistake: the Chinese government is proposing itself as an alternative model for the world, one without a democratic system of government, and it is seeking to undermine the free and open rules-based order we helped establish following World War II. Our businesses and our government must adapt in order to compete and thrive in this world.Business in a Hyper-Competitive WorldMany American businesses are just now starting to understand the new environment in which they are operating. The continued proliferation of cyber hacking tools and human intelligence capabilities means that this environment will only become more hostile and more treacherous for our companies. Our businesses face competitors in the form of foreign enterprises assisted or directed by extremely capable intelligence and security services. These capabilities are used to target not just intellectual property, but any proprietary information that could give Chinese or other countries businesses a crucial edge in the market. As a result, American companies are increasingly having to compete against businesses that are their mirror images, built on stolen ideas, information and innovations, but operating more nimbly and cheaply, not weighed down by the honest expense of developing intellectual property.Part of this new environment is that some foreign governments, especially the Chinese government, selectively and unfairly create and enforce laws and regulations to disadvantage our businesses. The Chinese government is not satisfied to stack the deck for its businesses solely in their domestic market. They are also cultivating other countries' economic dependence, partly to gain geopolitical influence and partly to ensure the success and dominance of Chinese businesses in overseas markets.Because the Chinese government creates an uneven playing field, and because this is done partly to facilitate the transfer of technology to China, our companies face what appears to be a very grim choice: participate and compete in the Chinese market and put vital corporate assets at grave risk, or neglect China and risk the loss of the second largest market in the world. But this is a false choice for three reasons.First, a lack of participation in the Chinese market will not spare a company from the risks the Chinese government and its companies pose. While the risks may be more acute for companies with business in China, all companies, even those solely operating in the United States, are at risk.Second, while U.S. companies may be able to operate and profit in China for a time, it is on borrowed time. The Chinese government will permit foreign companies to operate only so long as it is advantageous to China. Is the U.S. company making a product that China needs but cannot yet produce domestically, such as sophisticated agricultural machinery? If so, the U.S. company will be allowed to operate, but only until China learns enough about the business that they can replace it with a domestic version. Is the U.S. company using sophisticated intellectual property or a unique business model? Then such companies may also be allowed to operate, as long as they divulge the required technology, data, or expertise to a Chinese entity. Alternatively, a company may be allowed to operate simply to give China a better opportunity to understand how to copy the business and outcompete it globally. From the viewpoint of the Chinese government, many of the foreign companies doing business in China represent a temporary failure of the domestic market to meet demand. The government believes that if something can be made in China, then it should be made in China.Third, the bulk of the competition between U.S. companies and Chinese companies is not in the Chinese or American market. It is everywhere else in the world. American businesses will need a strategy to compete with China's national champions globally. Such a strategy will likely require new and innovative corporate business models that are tailored to withstand the challenges of various business ecosystems in the world. For example, U.S. companies must carefully construct their internal enterprise IT infrastructures so that vital data, communications, and intellectual property are protected, even in jurisdictions without strong rule of law and even if local regulations are coercively designed to collect data. They must carefully consider where to manufacture their products, as this may expose them to risks that cannot be mitigated. Ultimately, they may need to compete in the Chinese market, if only to maintain a window on the ecosystem that will be creating their global competitors.Government in a Hyper-Competitive WorldIt is unclear what it means for governments to compete in the 21st century. Will it be a second Cold War where we once again count missiles and warheads aimed at each other? Or, will it be United States, Inc. versus China, Inc.? Based on our experience so far, it seems far more likely that competition in the commercial realm will play a decisive role.Let me describe what I believe is coming. There will be competition between companies and industries as outlined above, but we will also compete with China at a more basic level. Our governments and economic systems will compete. They will compete for people, for resources, for ideas and, ultimately, they will compete throughout the world to be the governmental and economic system of choice: the one picked by other nations to organize their societies. This will be a competition of economics, but also of ideals and values, to determine which system better utilizes the talents and resources of the people, for the good of the people.The United States must ensure that we are both developing our domestic talent and attracting foreign talent from around the globe as we always have. Our nation will compete for this talent with other nations just as companies now compete for unique and exceptional employees. The Chinese government is already far ahead of us in creating direct financial incentives to draw gifted scientists and researchers to relocate and do work in their country. At the same time, the Chinese government has created comprehensive programs to identify, develop, and retain their most talented citizens. These talent recruitment and brain gain programs (as some in China call them) also encourage theft of intellectual property from U.S. institutions. For example, China's talent recruitment plans, such as the Thousand Talents Program, offer competitive salaries, state-of-the-art research facilities, and honorific titles, luring both Chinese overseas talent and foreign experts alike to bring their knowledge and experience to China, even if that means stealing proprietary information or violating export controls to do so.To be clear, there are distinct advantages to our decentralized approach, including the flexibility and agility to respond quickly to problems, as well as the openness of our system and strength of its governing institutions. The independence and historical dominance of the U.S. private sector has helped us attract global talent for decades. Alternatively, if we do not also develop a holistic national response and recognize the importance of sharpening our country's competitive advantages, we will not continue to attract or keep the people we need.This competition between the American and Chinese systems will manifest not only directly, but indirectly as other countries choose with whom to align themselves and how best to develop their societies. Countries throughout the world are being affected by unprecedented transformations in their societies and economies brought on by rapid technological change. They are searching for the correct model by which to organize their societies in order to survive these changes and even benefit from them.To many, our system of openness and transparency appears to be under attack. We are being exploited by China, so we are right to shore up our defenses against this. However, we must also make certain that, as we address the loopholes and vulnerabilities within our system, we do not simultaneously undermine the open, free, and fair principles that have made it thrive. Our efforts must inspire other nations to preserve similar systems. We must persuade them to choose freedom, reciprocity, and the rule of law. What hangs in the balance is not just the future of the United States, but the future of the world.Chairman Grassley, Ranking Member Feinstein, and members of the committee, thank you again for this opportunity to discuss the concerns the Federal Bureau of Investigation is seeing with the China threat. We are grateful for the support each of you, and this committee, continue to provide to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. I look forward to answering any questions you may have on this topic.Load-Date: December 12, 2018End of Document

FBI Issues Statement on China's Non-Traditional Espionage Against U.S.Targeted News ServiceDecember 12, 2018 Wednesday 9:00 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1845 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe U.S. Department of Justice's FBI issued the following statement by Bill Priestap, assistant director of the Counterintelligence Division, before the Senate Judiciary Committee entitled "China's Non-Traditional Espionage Against the United States: The Threat and Potential Policy Responses":"Chairman Grassley, Ranking Member Feinstein, members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today, and thank you for highlighting the threat from Chinese espionage."It is impossible to overstate the differences between the American and Chinese systems. China is an authoritarian, one-party state where the Chinese Communist Party reigns supreme. At the Chinese Communist Party's direction, the Chinese government dominates every facet of Chinese life, through actions such as central economic planning, Internet and media censorship, and leveraging intrusive technologies."The Chinese government is attempting to acquire or steal, not only the plans and intentions of the United States government, but also the ideas and innovations of the very people that make our economy so incredibly successful. The Chinese government understands a core lesson of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union: economic strength is the foundation of national power. The competition between the United States and China will be greatly influenced, if not ultimately decided, on the strength of our economies."The Chinese government means to compete with us in every way possible, playing by the rules at times, bending them at others, and breaking them when necessary to ensure their success. They also aim to rewrite the rules to shape the world in their image, and they have already made progress on this front. The rules they write seek to guarantee the dominance of their businesses and root Chinese national power in the very fabric of an international system."From my vantage point, it appears we are at the early stages of a hyper-competitive world. This is not simply a competition between businesses and industries but also between governments and the ways in which they govern their societies. Make no mistake: the Chinese government is proposing itself as an alternative model for the world, one without a democratic system of government, and it is seeking to undermine the free and open rules-based order we helped establish following World War II. Our businesses and our government must adapt in order to compete and thrive in this world."Business in a Hyper-Competitive World"Many American businesses are just now starting to understand the new environment in which they are operating. The continued proliferation of cyber hacking tools and human intelligence capabilities means that this environment will only become more hostile and more treacherous for our companies. Our businesses face competitors in the form of foreign enterprises assisted or directed by extremely capable intelligence and security services. These capabilities are used to target not just intellectual property, but any proprietary information that could give Chinese or other countries businesses a crucial edge in the market. As a result, American companies are increasingly having to compete against businesses that are their mirror images, built on stolen ideas, information and innovations, but operating more nimbly and cheaply, not weighed down by the honest expense of developing intellectual property."Part of this new environment is that some foreign governments, especially the Chinese government, selectively and unfairly create and enforce laws and regulations to disadvantage our businesses. The Chinese government is not satisfied to 'stack the deck' for its businesses solely in their domestic market. They are also cultivating other countries' economic dependence, partly to gain geopolitical influence and partly to ensure the success and dominance of Chinese businesses in overseas markets."Because the Chinese government creates an uneven playing field, and because this is done partly to facilitate the transfer of technology to China, our companies face what appears to be a very grim choice: participate and compete in the Chinese market and put vital corporate assets at grave risk, or neglect China and risk the loss of the second largest market in the world. But this is a false choice for three reasons."First, a lack of participation in the Chinese market will not spare a company from the risks the Chinese government and its companies pose. While the risks may be more acute for companies with business in China, all companies, even those solely operating in the United States, are at risk."Second, while U.S. companies may be able to operate and profit in China for a time, it is on borrowed time. The Chinese government will permit foreign companies to operate only so long as it is advantageous to China. Is the U.S. company making a product that China needs but cannot yet produce domestically, such as sophisticated agricultural machinery? If so, the U.S. company will be allowed to operate, but only until China learns enough about the business that they can replace it with a domestic version. Is the U.S. company using sophisticated intellectual property or a unique business model? Then such companies may also be allowed to operate, as long as they divulge the required technology, data, or expertise to a Chinese entity. Alternatively, a company may be allowed to operate simply to give China a better opportunity to understand how to copy the business and outcompete it globally. From the viewpoint of the Chinese government, many of the foreign companies doing business in China represent a temporary failure of the domestic market to meet demand. The government believes that if something can be made in China, then it should be made in China."Third, the bulk of the competition between U.S. companies and Chinese companies is not in the Chinese or American market. It is everywhere else in the world. American businesses will need a strategy to compete with China's national champions globally. Such a strategy will likely require new and innovative corporate business models that are tailored to withstand the challenges of various business 'ecosystems' in the world. For example, U.S. companies must carefully construct their internal enterprise IT infrastructures so that vital data, communications, and intellectual property are protected, even in jurisdictions without strong rule of law and even if local regulations are coercively designed to collect data. They must carefully consider where to manufacture their products, as this may expose them to risks that cannot be mitigated. Ultimately, they may need to compete in the Chinese market, if only to maintain a window on the ecosystem that will be creating their global competitors."Government in a Hyper-Competitive World"It is unclear what it means for governments to compete in the 21st century. Will it be a second Cold War where we once again count missiles and warheads aimed at each other? Or, will it be United States, Inc. versus China, Inc.? Based on our experience so far, it seems far more likely that competition in the commercial realm will play a decisive role."Let me describe what I believe is coming. There will be competition between companies and industries as outlined above, but we will also compete with China at a more basic level. Our governments and economic systems will compete. They will compete for people, for resources, for ideas and, ultimately, they will compete throughout the world to be the governmental and economic system of choice: the one picked by other nations to organize their societies. This will be a competition of economics, but also of ideals and values, to determine which system better utilizes the talents and resources of the people, for the good of the people."The United States must ensure that we are both developing our domestic talent and attracting foreign talent from around the globe as we always have. Our nation will compete for this talent with other nations just as companies now compete for unique and exceptional employees. The Chinese government is already far ahead of us in creating direct financial incentives to draw gifted scientists and researchers to relocate and do work in their country. At the same time, the Chinese government has created comprehensive programs to identify, develop, and retain their most talented citizens. These talent recruitment and 'brain gain' programs (as some in China call them) also encourage theft of intellectual property from U.S. institutions. For example, China's talent recruitment plans, such as the Thousand Talents Program, offer competitive salaries, state-of-the-art research facilities, and honorific titles, luring both Chinese overseas talent and foreign experts alike to bring their knowledge and experience to China, even if that means stealing proprietary information or violating export controls to do so."To be clear, there are distinct advantages to our decentralized approach, including the flexibility and agility to respond quickly to problems, as well as the openness of our system and strength of its governing institutions. The independence and historical dominance of the U.S. private sector has helped us attract global talent for decades. Alternatively, if we do not also develop a holistic national response and recognize the importance of sharpening our country's competitive advantages, we will not continue to attract or keep the people we need."This competition between the American and Chinese systems will manifest not only directly, but indirectly as other countries choose with whom to align themselves and how best to develop their societies. Countries throughout the world are being affected by unprecedented transformations in their societies and economies brought on by rapid technological change. They are searching for the correct model by which to organize their societies in order to survive these changes and even benefit from them."To many, our system of openness and transparency appears to be under attack. We are being exploited by China, so we are right to shore up our defenses against this. However, we must also make certain that, as we address the loopholes and vulnerabilities within our system, we do not simultaneously undermine the open, free, and fair principles that have made it thrive. Our efforts must inspire other nations to preserve similar systems. We must persuade them to choose freedom, reciprocity, and the rule of law. What hangs in the balance is not just the future of the United States, but the future of the world."Chairman Grassley, Ranking Member Feinstein, and members of the committee, thank you again for this opportunity to discuss the concerns the Federal Bureau of Investigation is seeing with the China threat. We are grateful for the support each of you, and this committee, continue to provide to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

CARDIN, BIPARTISAN GROUP OF SENATORS URGE PRESSURE ON CHINESE AT G-20 TO END THE USE OF EXIT BANS ON AMERICANSStates News ServiceNovember 29, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 1177 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Maryland Senator Ben Cardin:Senators: The Chinese government's practice of imposing exit bans against American citizens must stop. China must provide transparency, due process, and a path toward resolution on these exit bans in accordance with international norms. Congress will not turn a blind eye to China's subversion of basic human rights and extra-judicial application of exit bans.WASHINGTON Hours before President Trump lands in Buenos Aires for the G-20 Summit, U.S. Senator Ben Cardin (D-Md.) , a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations, along with Senator Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), chairman of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC), and Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific, and International Cybersecurity Policy, are leading a bipartisan group of senators calling on Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to use every opportunity to pressure the Chinese government to end the use of exit bans that are being applied to U.S. citizens. As noted in their letter, "[e]xit bans 'are sometimes used to prevent U.S. citizens who are not themselves suspected of a crime from leaving China as a means to pressure their relatives or associates who are wanted by Chinese law enforcement.'"We urge you to raise this issue on the sidelines of the summit with your counterparts in the Chinese government ... and to insist that all levels of the Chinese government adhere to due process and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and the U.S.-China Consular Convention," the senators wrote in their letter. "[I]n its employment of exit bans against U.S. citizens, China appears to be in violation of Article 35 of the U.S.-China Consular Convention."The apparent extra-judicial application of exit bans to U.S. citizens presents a serious human rights concern that violates due process rights that U.S. citizens are entitled to under international law."The full letter can be found at this link and below. In addition to Senators Cardin, Rubio and Markey, the letter was signed by Senators Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisc.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Cory A. Booker (D-N.J.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) and Catherine Cortez Masto (D-N.M.).November 29, 2018The Honorable Michael R. PompeoSecretary of StateU.S. Department of State2201 C Street, NWWashington, DC 20520Dear Secretary Pompeo,Ahead of the Group of Twenty (G20) summit in Buenos Aires, from November 30 to December 1, 2018, we write to express our concern over the People's Republic of China's imposition of exit bans on United States citizens. We urge you to raise this issue on the sidelines of the summit with your counterparts in the Chinese government, or at the next available diplomatic opportunity, and to insist that all levels of the Chinese government adhere to due process and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations[1] and the U.S.-China Consular Convention. The Chinese government must provide clear information to the U.S. government and affected U.S. citizens about its efforts to resolve their exit bans and enable them to return to the United States.As the U.S. government's recently released Integrated Country Strategy for the United States Mission to China notes, "Chinese law enforcement and security services employ extra-judicial means against U.S. citizens without regard to international norms." Exit bans "are sometimes used to prevent U.S. citizens who are not themselves suspected of a crime from leaving China as a means to pressure their relatives or associates who are wanted by Chinese law enforcement in the United States."[2] Chinese government agencies have imposed exit bans on a number of U.S. citizens in the context of criminal charges and private commercial disputes.Article 28 of the Exit and Entry Administration Law of the People's Republic of China forms the basis for the Chinese government's authority to impose exit bans on foreign nationals. Article 28 lists circumstances under which "foreigners shall not be allowed to exit China," including the broad category, "[o]ther circumstances in which exit shall not be allowed in accordance with laws or administrative regulations." The law assigns responsibility for administering exit/entry matters to the Ministry of Public Security and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, with public security organs responsible for administering "the stay and residence of foreigners."[3]As you know, in its employment of exit bans against U.S. citizens, China appears to be in violation of Article 35 of the U.S.-China Consular Convention. Under Article 35, if a U.S. national is "placed under any form of detention," China's government must notify the relevant U.S. consulate within four days. Also under Article 35, a U.S. consular officer is entitled to "be informed of the reasons for which said national has been arrested or detained in any manner."[4] China also appears to be in violation of Article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. Many U.S. citizens are not made aware of a ban on their exit until they attempt to leave China. Once U.S. citizens are made aware of the ban, Chinese authorities provide little to no information - either to the U.S. citizen or to U.S. consular officials - regarding the nature of the ban, which Chinese government entity is responsible for the ban, and what processes and procedures must be followed to resolve the dispute(s) related to the ban. The apparent extra-judicial application of exit bans to U.S. citizens presents a serious human rights concern that violates due process rights that U.S. citizens are entitled to under international law.We are encouraged by the Administration raising this issue during the inaugural meeting of the U.S.-China Law Enforcement and Cybersecurity Dialogue (LECD) in 2017 and more recently during the U.S.-China Diplomatic and Security Dialogue. We urge the Department of State, in coordination with the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security, to work with Chinese counterparts to convene a second meeting of the LECD as soon as possible and to place this issue high on its agenda. We urge you both to continue to use diplomatic levers at your disposal to compel the Chinese government to adhere to the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and the U.S.-China Consular Convention, and to operate with increased transparency and good faith to resolve exit bans against U.S. citizens.The U.S. government's Integrated Country Strategy for China, referenced above, lists as the third goal for the U.S. mission to China, "Promote and protect the health, safety, and welfare of American citizens." Challenging China's extrajudicial use of exit bans against U.S. citizens is a key priority for advancing that goal.Thank you for your consideration of this important issue.Sincerely,cc: Deputy Attorney General Rod RosensteinLoad-Date: November 30, 2018End of Document

Chinese government admits head of Interpol 'under investigation' after disappearanceCNN.comOctober 7, 2018 Sunday 1:26 AM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: EUROPELength: 836 wordsByline: By Ben Westcott, Eliott C. McLaughlin, Saskya Vandoorne, CNNBodyThe missing head of Interpol, who vanished after returning to his homeland, is under investigation in China, authorities in Beijing have confirmed.In a terse one line statement Sunday evening, China's ruling Communist Party admitted Meng Hongwei, who also holds the position of vice minister of public security in China, was "under investigation by the National Supervision Commission for alleged violations of laws."Chinese authorities had previously remained tight-lipped about the whereabouts of Meng, following his sudden disappearance last month after he flew from France to China.Sunday's statement did not specifically say that Meng had been arrested, or that he remains in China. However, previous suspects who have been described as "under investigation" by the National Supervisory Commission -- the country's top anti-corruption agency -- have often reappeared in the custody of the government at a later date.In a separate development, Interpol said it had received Meng's resignation from the international police agency with "immediate effect" according to statement posted Sunday. It made no mention of the former president's sudden disappearance or his current whereabouts.The South China Morning Post, a Hong Kong-based newspaper known for its connections inside the Chinese government, said Meng was "taken away" for questioning upon landing in China last week. The newspaper cited an unnamed source.It comes just one week after one of China's best-known actresses, Fan Bingbing, reappeared following a lengthy disappearance, admitting to tax evasion and promising to pay a large fine."That China feels so emboldened to disappear even one of its most famous actresses ... should be a real wake up call that anyone within China could be next," human rights advocate Michael Caster wrote for CNN in September.'Wait for my call'Meng's disappearance was first reported to authorities by his wife, Grace, who went to police in Lyon on Thursday, according to the French Interior Ministry.She told police that she last heard from him 10 days prior and had received threats on social media and by telephone, according to the statement.Speaking to reporters at a hotel in Lyon, France, Grace said that that her last contact with her husband came via a WhatsApp text message with a knife emoji and the instructions, "Wait for my call."Grace said her husband's whereabouts is a matter that "belongs to the international community.""Although I can't see my husband, we are always connected by heart," she said.The French Interior Ministry said through a spokesman it has no information to share about the text message Grace had received from her husband.Interpol had asked Chinese authorities for information about Meng Hongwei. Interpol Secretary General Jurgen Stock said in a statement posted to Twitter on Saturday, "Interpol has requested through official law enforcement channels clarification from China's authorities on the status of Interpol President Meng Hongwei.""Interpol's General Secretariat looks forward to an official response from China's authorities to address concerns over the President's well-being," the statement continued.Interpol said Sunday night that South Korea's Kim Jong Yang, a vice president representing Asia on Interpol's executive committee, would serve as acting president until the organization's general assembly picks a permanent president next month.Missing for daysInterpol, or the International Police Criminal Organization, facilitates international police cooperation.Meng Hongwei, a former head of Interpol China, was elected president of the international organization in November 2016. He was the first Chinese official to become Interpol president, which is based in Lyon.Meng oversaw the agency's executive committee, which sets overall strategy.Following the announcement of Meng's appointment in 2016 there were concerns among human rights advocates that he could turn the organization towards Beijing's aims.Instead, Meng could be the latest victim of the wide-ranging anti-corruption campaign put in place by Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.The campaign promised to crackdown on both the powerful as well as regular people, or "tigers and flies," and in the following six years, it has brought down powerful political figures in China, including former security tzar Zhou Yongkang, under whom Meng rose through the ranks of the Chinese security apparatus.But some have criticized the campaign as partly a way for Xi to secure his hold on power and remove political opponents.Meng was not on French soil when he was last seen, according a senior French law enforcement official, who declined to say whether he was in China.The French government said that a "suitable police mechanism" was put in place to guarantee Grace Meng's safety, and that the prosecutor's office in Lyon has opened an investigation.A spokeswoman for Interpol, who declined to give her name, refused to say whether Meng had been on official business in China.Load-Date: October 9, 2018End of Document

CICC Bloomberg Barclays China Treasury 1-10 Years ETF Lists on the SEHK Today; ONE-click Solution to Access China Government Bond MarketPR NewswireDecember 11, 2018 Tuesday 10:08 PM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1285 wordsDateline: BEIJING, Dec. 11, 2018 BodyPR NewswireChina International Capital Corporation Hong Kong Asset Management Limited (CICC HK AM), a wholly-owned subsidiary of China International Capital Corporation Limited (CICC), announced today the launch of CICC Bloomberg Barclays China Treasury 1-10 Years ETF (the "ETF"). Units of the ETF will begin trading today on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (SEHK) under the ticker number 3079 for HKD counter and 83079 for RMB counter. The ETF aims to track the Bloomberg Barclays China Treasury 1-10 Years Index[1] (the "Index"). The Index is designed to reflect the performance of the fixed rate RMB-denominated treasury bonds with remaining maturity between 1 year to, but not including, 10 years and with a face value of at least RMB 5 billion outstanding.China Government Bonds (CGBs)[2] currently account for 73%[3] of overseas investors' onshore bond exposure, and on the other hand, foreign ownership stands at only about 8%[4] of the CGBs. The inclusion of CGBs into mainstream international indices brings refreshed attention to the CGBs market of over USD 2 trillion[5]. As an important step for China's integration with global financial markets, Bloomberg announced on March 23, 2018[6], its plan to add Chinese government and policy bank bonds in its flagship Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index from April 2019 pending several planned operational enhancements[7] by the People's Bank of China (PBoC) and Ministry of Finance. All member securities of theBloomberg Barclays China Treasury 1-10 Years Indexwould be officially included into the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index.CGBs are distributed across different maturities where those with maturity less than 10 years account for 80%[8] of total outstanding CGBs. The new ETF offers a one-click solution to this segment of CGBs and provides overseas investors with a unique combination of benefits including attractive risk adjusted return, generally low correlation with major global assets and clarified tax exemption."It is extremely important that CICC serves international investors' needs to invest in China government bonds," said Lin Ning, Managing Director of CICC HK AM."We hope this ETF becomes a 'go-to' product for investors to access the third largest[9]government bond market in the world.""As international investors find new ways to access China's market, Chinese government bonds are a compelling way of diversifying their portfolios and increasing exposure to the world's fastest growing bond market," said Norman Tweeboom, Head of Portfolio & Index Sales for Asia-Pacific at Bloomberg. "CICC is a valuable partner in enabling investors a new way to access China's market via an easily tradable ETF, underpinned by Bloomberg's market leading data and analytics."With a 45-year tradition, the Bloomberg Barclays Indices are widely-used for fixed income investors who are seeking objective, rules-based and representative benchmarks to measure asset class risk and returns.

Pence attacks China on 'predatory' trade, 'coercion' and military 'aggression'CNN WireOctober 4, 2018 Thursday 10:22 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1596 wordsByline: By Nicole Gaouette, Elise Labott, James Griffiths and Ben Westcott, CNNDateline: WASHINGTON (CNN) BodyWASHINGTON (CNN) --  Vice President Mike Pence launched a broad attack against Beijing Thursday, accusing China of "predatory" economic practices, military aggression against the US and of trying to undermine President Donald Trump and harm his chances of winning re-election. Citing Trump's move to levy tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese imports and threatening to "levy even more, with the possibility of substantially more than doubling that number," Pence said that "the American people deserve to know that, in response to the strong stand that President Trump has taken, Beijing is pursuing a comprehensive and coordinated campaign to undermine support for the President." The vice president cited US intelligence agencies but offered no evidence to back up his claims, which are likely to inflame relations between Washington and Beijing, already at their lowest point in years thanks to the burgeoning trade war, policy differences and US allegations of political interference.'To put it bluntly'"To put it bluntly, President Trump's leadership is working. China wants a different American President," Pence said.The intervention by the vice president marks a significant broadening in the rhetoric used by the Trump administration to confront China, linking issues around military, trade and domestic politics.The speech reflects a decision by the Trump administration to make a deliberate pivot on China policy, a senior administration official told reporters. The long held expectation that China's behavior would be tempered as the world lowered trade barriers and offered greater political engagement has not come to pass, this official said, prompting the re-evaluation. There hasn't been a greater respect for human rights, reciprocity on markets and intellectual property, the official said, so Trump is building a "constructive and results oriented" policy toward China. "There are many avenues for cooperation, but the administration doesn't shy from calling out China as a competitor," the official said. 'Unparalleled surveillance'Pence accused the Chinese of suppressing its citizens at home with the creation of "an unparalleled surveillance state," of brutally repressing religious minorities and of oppressing countries abroad through loan programs that favor Beijing and leave those nations beholden to China. The vice president said that Chinese security agencies have masterminded "the wholesale theft of American technology." The vice president delivered his speech as Bloomberg News reported that during their construction in China, tiny microchips were hidden in computer motherboards sold to major US companies such as Amazon and Apple that allowed hackers to access any network that included the altered equipment. The article said US officials are describing the operation as the most significant supply chain attack known to have been carried out against American companies. Pence didn't mention that revelation, but he said that Beijing works to steal US intellectual property, leading to a "new consensus" among US businesses about investing there. Pence called on one firm in particular to stop cooperating with China. Google, Pence said, "should immediately end development of the 'Dragonfly' app that will strengthen Communist Party censorship and compromise the privacy of Chinese customers," he said. "Worst of all, China has initiated an unprecedented effort to influence American public opinion, the 2018 elections, and the environment leading into the 2020 presidential elections," Pence said. Part of the administration's new strategy to counter China involves public education. They believe it's important that Americans understand and are aware of the malign activities of China that have gathered in intensity. "A lot of these activities are going to be dealt with if people know about them. In the political realm, strengthening election security," the official said. "But what we're really counting on is our fellow citizens to stand up for their convictions and to recognize when they're being taken advantage of." The official said the White House expects American institutions to "not accept money from China, which is legal, with clear strings attached.""Understanding the Chinese propaganda efforts is going to be key," the official said. Pence also accused Beijing of military aggression, saying that "Beijing is also using its power like never before." "Chinese ships routinely patrol around the Senkaku Islands, which are administered by Japan," Pence said. "And while China's leader stood in the Rose Garden of the White House in 2015 and said that his country had, and I quote, 'no intention to militarize the South China Sea,' today, Beijing has deployed advanced anti-ship and anti-air missiles atop an archipelago of military bases constructed on artificial islands," Pence said.He said that China now spends as much on its military as the rest of Asia combined, and is prioritizing capabilities to erode US military advantages "on land, at sea, in the air, and in space." "China wants nothing less than to push the United States of America from the Western Pacific and attempt to prevent us from coming to the aid of our allies," Pence said. "But they will fail."The speech, which will likely strain relations further, came days after a Chinese military vessel nearly collided with a US Navy ship in the waters around the disputed Spratly Islands in the South China Sea. Pence described the encounter in which a Chinese naval vessel came within 45 yards (41 meters) of the USS Decatur as "reckless harassment," and repeated a US refrain: that the United States Navy "will continue to fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows and our national interests demand. We will not be intimidated; we will not stand down."Chinese Defense Ministry spokesman Wu Qian defended the naval maneuver on Tuesday, accusing the US of threatening China's sovereignty and safety by repeatedly sending warships to disputed areas of the South China Sea."The Chinese military will resolutely perform its defense duties and continue to take all necessary measures to safeguard our sovereignty and the regional peace and stability," Wu said.Pence's speech comes a week after Trump stood in front of world leaders at the UN and accused Beijing of meddling in US politics. Citing US intelligence agencies, Pence said Russia's actions in the US "pale in comparison" to Beijing's interference.The vice president cited a Chinese government document, called "Propaganda and Censorship Notice," which he claimed laid out a strategy aimed at "splitting apart different domestic groups in the United States," much as US intelligence services have unanimously concluded that Russia did in the 2016 elections. They continue to warn Russia is actively trying to interfere in November's midterm elections. Among the institutions targeted for Chinese Communist Party coercion, according to the vice president, are "businesses, movie studios, universities, think tanks, scholars (and) journalists.""Beijing is employing a whole-of-government approach to advance its influence and benefit its interests. It's employing this power in more proactive and coercive ways to interfere in the domestic policies of this country and to interfere in the politics of the United States," Pence will say on Thursday.'Debt diplomacy'Last week, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang hit back at accusations that China was attempting to steer policy making in Washington, suggested the US was the country "most accustomed" to interfering in other countries' affairs.Pence also took a forceful line on Taiwan, the self-ruled island which Beijing views as part of its territory, saying that "while our administration will continue to respect our One China Policy ... Taiwan's embrace of democracy shows a better path for all the Chinese people." Under the "One China Policy," Washington officially recognized Beijing and removed its embassy from Taiwan, though it continues to regard the sovereignty status of the island as unresolved. Pence condemned efforts by Beijing to pressure allies of Taipei to sever their ties and embrace China, which he said "threaten the stability of the Taiwan Strait."The focus on Taiwan comes after CNN reported on proposals by the US Navy's Pacific Fleet to stage a major show of force, in an apparent demonstration of US readiness to deter and counter antagonistic Chinese military actions.The plan, which was relayed to CNN by several US defense officials, suggests sailing ships and flying aircraft near Chinese-controlled waters in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait.This ongoing battle for influence between the two countries on the global stage has become a major policy concern in Washington in recent months. In his speech Thursday, the US vice president repeated claims that Beijing is using billions of dollars in infrastructure loans to countries across the world to tie them to the Chinese government, a practice termed "debt diplomacy.""The terms of those loans are opaque at best, and the benefits flow overwhelmingly to Beijing," Pence said.In particular, Pence referenced Hambantota Port in Sri Lanka. It was commissioned by the local government with Chinese funds in 2010 but when Sri Lanka was unable to pay back their loans, a Chinese state-owned company took ownership."It may soon become a forward military base for China's growing blue-water navy," Pence said.CNN's Kaitlan Collins contribute to this report.TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Following Stanford physics professor's passing, rumors of ties to Chinese government emergeeval(ez_write_tag([[728,90],'stanforddaily_com-box-3','ezslot_1']));The Stanford Daily: Stanford UniversityDecember 30, 2018 SundayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 908 wordsBodyDistinguished Stanford physics professor Shoucheng Zhang passed away on Dec. 1, 2018 at age 55. According to his family, Zhang's death - an apparent suicide - follows a long "battle with depression." However, some on Chinese media speculate that Zhang's death may be related to rising U.S.-China tensions and Zhang's involvement with Chinese business and government."We are saddened to learn of the passing of Shoucheng Zhang, a distinguished physicist who has made tremendous scientific contributions," said University Provost Persis Drell, who is also a physics professor. "His passing is a loss for his family, his colleagues at the University and for his field."A pioneer in physics, Zhang explored everything from novel materials and quantum gravity to artificial intelligence. Most notably, his research in a topological insulator - which led to the discovery of a new state of matter - led to predictions that his team would win the 2014 Nobel Prize in physics. Though Zhang didn't win, his research was seen as critical for the development of improved semiconductor chips, a technology highly valued by the Chinese Communist Party for economic and national security purposes.Zhang was originally recruited in 2008 under the Thousand Talents program - a CCP effort to attract top scientists from overseas to work in China - to conduct research at Tsinghua University in Beijing. Zhang was active in helping U.S.-trained Chinese researchers return home, and expressed his desire to help "bring back the front-lines of research to China" in a recent interview with Chinese news portal Sina.Zhang's venture capital firm Digital Horizon Capital , formerly known as Danhua Capital, was recently linked to China's "Made in China 2025" technology dominance program in a Nov. 30 U.S. Trade Representative report. According to the report, venture capital firms like DHVC are ultimately aimed at allowing China to access vital technology from U.S. startups. Zhang's firm lists 113 U.S. companies in its portfolio, most falling within emerging sectors that the Chinese government has identified as strategic priorities.The "Made in China 2025" program combines economic espionage and aggressive business acquisitions to aid China's quest to become a tech manufacturing superpower, the USTR report continues. The program was launched in 2015 and has been cited by the Trump administration as evidence that the Chinese government is engaged in a strategic effort to steal American technological expertise.A Hoover Institution document called "Chinese Influence & American Interests: Promoting Constructive Vigilance," released just one day before the USTR report, echoes its sentiments. The 192-page investigation argues that China "captures much valuable new technology through its investments in US high-tech companies," and is more generally attempting to manipulate state and local governments, universities, think tanks, media, corporations and the Chinese American community.The close timing of Zhang's death with the USTR report's release - as well as the same-day arrest of the CFO of Huawei, a Chinese telecommunications company now under fire for sanctions fraud - has fueled doubt within Chinese media that the scientist's death occurred of his own accord.According to The Washington Times, Guo Wengui, an exiled Chinese businessman who in the past had close contact with Chinese intelligence, suspected foul play in Zhang's death because the physicist knew secrets about China's technology expert program. Zhang also refused to return to China as requested by senior party leaders, said Guo."I knew this guy very well," Guo said. "The guy worked with the [Chinese Communist Party]."Zhang's family maintains that the events were unrelated to his death."There is no police investigation, and the authorities have no suspicions about Professor Zhang's death," a representative for the family told the South China Morning Post. "You will read that he committed suicide, and this is true. But you will also read in the family statement that he had periodic bouts with depression."Zhang's distinguished career includes winning the Dirac Medal of the International Centre for Theoretical Physics in 2012 and a spot on the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2015. His recent classes include the popular introductory seminar, "PHYSICS 81N: Science on the Back of the Envelope" and "PHYSICS 171: Thermodynamics, Kinetic Theory, and Statistical Mechanics II."He is survived by his wife, Barbara; his children, Stephanie and Brian; and his daugher-in-law, Ruth Fong.The Daily has reached out to the University for comment.Contact Berber Jin at fjin16 'at' stanford.edu.Editor's note: If you are experiencing trauma or thoughts of self harm, there are available resources both on and beyond campus that are reachable 24 hours a day, seven days a week:National Suicide Prevention Hotline: +1(800)-273-8255Stanford Counseling and Psychological Services: +1(650)-723-3785Stanford Confidential Support Team: +1(650)-725-9955While you're here...We're a student-run organization committed to providing hands-on experience in journalism, digital media and business for the next generation of reporters.

NEW ZEALAND LAWMAKER REPORTS CHINA-LINKED POLITICAL DONATION TO POLICEStates News ServiceOctober 19, 2018 FridayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 1092 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:A New Zealand lawmaker has accused the opposition National Party leader of corruption, claiming that he sought to hide the source of a donation from a Chinese businessmen who has been linked to Beijing's international influence strategy under the ruling Chinese Communist Party's United Front Work Department.National Party MP Jami-Lee Ross said he had been told by his own party leader, Simon Bridges, to split the 100,000 New Zealand dollar (U.S.$66,000) donation from businessman Zhang Yikun, to hide the source of the funds.Ross told reporters that he plans to provide evidence to police and to release a secretly recorded phone conversation with Bridges, who denied the accusation, and said that he'd done nothing wrong.Zhang, who was awarded an "Order of Merit" by the New Zealand government in June for "services to New Zealand-China relations and the Chinese community," has been linked to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) by Canterbury University expert Anne-Marie Brady, an expert on Chinese influence overseas."The most concerning aspect to the controversy over National's hidden donations is that the source of the funds is a leader in #CCP united front work activities," Brady said via her Twitter account earlier this week.Last November, Zhang led a political and business delegation to Beijing, meeting with an official of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of China's cabinet, the State Council, Brady said in another tweet, linking to a report from TV33, a Chinese-language digital broadcaster owned by Chinese state broadcaster China Xinhua News Network TV.Zhang told officials in Beijing that he would "unite the Chinese community in New Zealand and fully cherish this opportunity to tell the story of China," TV33 reported at the time.He also expressed his gratitude for the "concern and support" given by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office, it said.Since arriving in the country in 2000, Zhang founded and still leads the New Zealand arm of the Chao Shan General Association.The Australian branch of the organization, the Chao Shan Association of Commerce, was listed as a United Front affiliate in a submission on Chinese influence to the Australian parliament earlier this year.Repeated calls to the Chao Shan General Association rang unanswered during office hours on Friday.Not the first of its kindChen Weijian, the New Zealand-based editor-in-chief of the political magazine Beijing Spring, said the alleged donation revealed by Ross isn't the first of its kind."It looks like a donation from a businessman, but who is that businessman, actually?" Chen said. "The Chinese Communist Party has been gradually making donations to political parties here and there via their agents in Western political circles.""This is a very serious problem ... and yet the government here in New Zealand doesn't seem to be taking much of a stand," Chen said. "The New Zealand's relationship with China is too cozy, with a lot of vested interests tied up with it."On Friday, Brady also reported via her Twitter account that security cameras have now been installed at her office at Canterbury University after an unexplained "burglary" in which the laptop she used to write her research and articles on China's overseas influence went missing.Brady this week also called on governments to carry out in-depth probes into the Chinese Communist Party's activities overseas."Governments need to conduct their own in-depth investigations into CCP united front work activities within their countries and then devise a strategy to counteract them," she wrote in an article published in the Party Watch annual report on Thursday."Governments must define China's meddling in their internal affairs as a national security issue and treat it accordingly," Brady said, suggesting updates to laws governing the funding of elections, protocols around conflicts of interest for serving and retired public servants and politicians, and sales of strategic infrastructure.Overseas Chinese targetedCommentators said ethnic Chinese populations overseas are also being targeted by United Front tactics, which often rely on affiliated organizations promoting "friendship and cooperation" between China and their home country, and need the support of their governments to resist Beijing's attempts to silence criticism of the CCP far beyond China's borders.Writer and social researcher Tze Ming Mok said Chinese influence is already raising concerns in academic, business, civil society, and government circles in New Zealand."But they can't say much publicly or their own Chinese government-linked funding, or their access, or their negotiations even in some cases, their families could come under pressure," he wrote in an op-ed piece in the New Zealand Herald on Friday.He said a lack of independent funding in New Zealand made it particularly vulnerable to "any state or lobby group with deep pockets."Tze said there is "a wall of silence where there should be informed critique, transparency and debate" on the topic, and that the chilling effect is "harming Chinese people in New Zealand."Brady meanwhile called on governments to establish better contacts with their ethnic Chinese populations."[Governments should] work with these communities to support them to become resilient and autonomous from CCP attempts to control them," Brady wrote.Classified information exchangedEarlier this month, the five nations in the world's leading intelligence-sharing network confirmed they have been exchanging classified information on China's foreign activities with other like-minded countries since the start of the year, Reuters reported.Officials told the agency that the enhanced cooperation amounted to an informal expansion of the Five Eyes group on the specific issue of foreign interference, with expanding Chinese influence as the main focus.China has rejected accusations that it is seeking to influence overseas governments and that its investments are politically driven.Australia last December tightened rules on foreign lobbying and political donations, while broadening the definition of treason and espionage, while the U.S. has legislated to make it easier for the government to block certain kinds of investment.Earlier this month, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence accused Beijing of interfering in the political and economic life of the U.S. by "rewarding or coercing American businesses, movie studios, universities, think tanks, scholars, journalists and local, state and federal officials."Load-Date: October 19, 2018End of Document

China's government is trying to hijack a viral meme for propagandaCNN WireOctober 24, 2018 Wednesday 8:34 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 493 wordsByline: By Serenitie Wang and Ben Westcott, CNNDateline: BEIJING (CNN) BodyBEIJING (CNN) --  The Chinese government is trying to hijack one of the world's hottest social trends this year for its own propaganda purposes.For months, young people across China have been posting images of themselves pretending to fall out of cars or trip, spreading their expensive belongings in front of them, as if they've just casually fallen out of their pockets.It's called the "flaunt your wealth" challenge and, although it isn't clear where it started, it has taken Chinese social media by storm.It isn't just huge in China -- people across the world including Russia and Australia have taken the opportunity to show off, under the hashtag #fallingstars.Originally popular among wealthy Chinese women, the trend rapidly spread across all parts of society."It is no longer just the rich people who are falling off their yachts or planes. It's people from all professions -- doctors, lawyers, workers, even babies.

SEC Issues Order Involving PolycomTargeted News ServiceDecember 26, 2018 Wednesday 8:10 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2955 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Securities and Exchange Commission issued the following order instituting cease-and-desist proceedings (No. 3-18964) involving Polycom:In the Matter of POLYCOM, INC., Respondent.ORDER INSTITUTING CEASE-AND-DESIST PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO SECTION 21C OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, MAKING FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING A CEASE-AND-DESIST ORDERI.The Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") deems it appropriate that cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act"), against Polycom, Inc. ("Polycom" or "Respondent").II.In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer of Settlement (the "Offer") which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings herein, except as to the Commission's jurisdiction over it and the subject matter of these proceedings, which are admitted, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Cease-And-Desist Proceedings Pursuant To Section 21C Of The Securities Exchange Act Of 1934, Making Findings, And Imposing A Cease-And-Desist Order ("Order"), as set forth below.III.On the basis of this Order and Respondent's Offer, the Commission finds that:Summary1. This matter concerns violations of the books and records and internal accounting controls provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") by San Jose, California-based communications solutions provider, Polycom, Inc. From 2006 through at least July 2014, Polycom's Vice President of China at Polycom's China subsidiary, along with senior managers, provided significant discounts to Polycom's distributors and/or resellers, knowing and intending that the distributors and/or resellers would use the discounts to make payments to officials at Chinese government agencies and government-owned enterprises in exchange for those officials' assistance in obtaining orders for Polycom's products. Employees and managers at the China subsidiary recorded the payments in a parallel deal-tracking and email system located in China, outside of Polycom's company-approved systems. These senior managers at Polycom's Chinese subsidiary also instructed their sales personnel not to use their Polycom email addresses when discussing sales opportunities with Polycom's distributors. Throughout this period, Polycom failed to devise and maintain a sufficient system of internal accounting controls and lacked an effective anti-corruption compliance program with regard to its Chinese sales operations. During the period of September 27, 2012 through July 2014, the efforts to make, and conceal, improper payments to Chinese government officials carried out by Polycom's Chinese subsidiary ultimately netted Polycom approximately $10.7 million.Respondent2. Polycom is a Delaware corporation headquartered in San Jose, California that sells voice and video communications products and services. From 1996 until 2016, Polycom's common stock was registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and was quoted on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker PLCM. On September 27, 2016, a private equity firm acquired Polycom, and the company ceased to trade on the NASDAQ. On July 2, 2018, Plantronics, Inc. acquired Polycom from the private equity firm. Polycom is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Plantronics. Plantronics' common stock is registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act.3. On March 31, 2015, the Commission entered an Order (the "2015 Order") finding that Polycom, Inc. had violated Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1, 12b-20, 14a-3 and 14a-9 thereunder. According to the 2015 Order, from May 2010 to July 2013, Polycom paid for approximately $190,000 worth of its then-CEO's personal expenses. Polycom failed to disclose these perquisites, falsely recorded many of these personal expenses as business expenses, and failed to implement adequate internal accounting controls related to company purchasing cards and air travel booking.Other Relevant Entity4. During the relevant time period, Polycom Communications Solutions (Beijing) Co., Ltd. (China) ("Polycom China") was a company organized in China that sold Polycom's products and services into the China Market. During the relevant time period, Polycom China was, through a chain of holding companies, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Polycom. Polycom China engaged distributors to facilitate the sale of Polycom products throughout China and maintained its own sales and marketing staff to promote Polycom products.Facts5. Polycom sells its voice and video communications equipment in China through several distributors. Polycom China sells Polycom's products to these distributors, who sell the products to resellers who in turn sell the products to end users.6. From 2006 through at least July 2014, Polycom's Vice President of China devised and implemented a scheme to obtain additional business from public-sector customers by facilitating improper payments to government officials through Polycom's distributors.7. According to Polycom's policies and procedures, Polycom sales personnel worldwide were required to enter details concerning sales opportunities and deals into a single, centralized customer relations management ("CRM") database. However, Polycom China's senior managers directed Polycom China's sales personnel to enter details concerning sales opportunities into a separate, parallel sales management system outside of Polycom's company-approved systems, which was orchestrated by Polycom's Vice President of China. Polycom personnel outside China were unaware of the existence of this parallel system. Polycom China's senior managers also directed Polycom China's sales personnel to use non-Polycom email addresses when discussing deals with Polycom's distributors.8. On numerous occasions during years leading up to July 2014, Polycom China's distributors obtained business from public-sector customers in China by offering and making cash payments to government officials who exercised influence over those customers' purchasing decisions. When a distributor sought to make such a payment, it requested that Polycom provide it with a discount on the equipment that was to be sold to the public-sector customer. As senior management at Polycom China knew, these discounts were not passed on to the end customer, but instead were intended to cover the cost of the payments the distributors made to the Chinese government officials.9. Polycom China sales employees entered the requested discounts into the non-Polycom sales management system for approval by senior managers at Polycom China, and recorded information about the reason for the payments in the same off-line system. Polycom China's senior managers routinely approved these discounts, knowing that they would be used to make improper payments to Chinese government officials. Polycom's Vice President of China recorded information regarding these improper payments in excel spreadsheets he maintained.10. Senior managers at Polycom China recorded information about each deal in Polycom's centralized CRM database. Entries in the centralized CRM database did not reflect that Polycom was providing discounts to its distributors in China in order to fund improper payments to Chinese government officials. Rather, the entries in the CRM database falsely attributed the discounts to purportedly legitimate purposes. For example:a. In connection with a project with a state-owned entity, Polycom China authorized an improper payment of 60,000 RMB to a government official through a discount given to one of Polycom China's channel partners. The Polycom China distributor made the improper payment in exchange for the official's assistance in securing an agreement to purchase Polycom products. In an excel spreadsheet maintained by Polycom's Vice President of China, the purpose of the discount was described as "in order to thank [the official] for help, we promised to give him 60,000 RMB." However, the information entered into the centralized CRM database cited "competition" with another communications products provider as the reason for the discount that funded this improper payment.b. In connection with a transaction with a state-owned entity, Polycom China authorized an improper payment of 170,000 RMB to a government official through a discount given to one of Polycom China's channel partners. The payment was made in exchange for the official's assistance in causing the entity to issue a tender that specifically called for Polycom products. However, the information entered into the centralized CRM database cited "competition" with two other communication products providers as the reason for the discount that funded this improper payment.c. In connection with a deal with a public institution, Polycom China authorized a payment of an 850,000 RMB "end-user fee" through a discount given to one of Polycom China's channel partners. However, the information entered into the centralized CRM database cited only competition and the customer's refusal to pay a higher price as the reason for the discount that funded this fee. According to Polycom China employees, "end-user fees" at times represented kickbacks to Chinese government officials.d. In connection with a sale of Polycom products to a government entity, Polycom China authorized payments of 20,000 RMB, 70,000 RMB, and 200,000 RMB through a discount to one of Polycom China's channel partners to three separate officials who worked at the entity. However, the information entered into the centralized CRM database cited only "competition" with two other communications products providers as the reason for the discount that funded these payments.11. Product discounts up to a certain threshold could be approved unilaterally by Polycom China's senior managers. However, discounts above this threshold had to be approved by Singapore-based personnel who worked for another wholly-owned Polycom subsidiary. When these Singapore-based personnel sought information regarding the reasons for particular discounts, Polycom China's senior managers always cited legitimate concerns such as competition with other communications products providers or end-user budget constraints. Polycom China's senior managers never told the Singapore-based personnel that certain discounts were being used to fund improper payments to government officials.12. During the relevant period, Polycom failed to devise and maintain adequate controls to detect whether any reasons for discounts entered in the centralized CRM database, or given to Polycom's Singapore-based personnel, were accurate. Accordingly, Polycom failed to devise and maintain sufficient accounting controls to detect whether Polycom China was using product discounts as a vehicle for funding improper payments to government officials.13. Polycom also failed to translate certain anticorruption training materials into the Polycom China employees' local language, Mandarin, and frequently did not follow up if Polycom China personnel did not attend anticorruption trainings. Moreover, as part of a 2013 due diligence procedure, Polycom became aware of allegations that one of Polycom China's distributors had, years prior on a deal unrelated to Polycom, made an improper payment to a Chinese government official. Polycom never finished its due diligence review of the relevant distributor. Polycom nonetheless allowed Polycom China to continue using this distributor to sell its products to public-sector customers.14. As a result of the conduct described above, Polycom violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act. Polycom violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act by falsely recording improper payments by Polycom China's employees and agents as legitimate business expenses, whose results were then consolidated and reported by Polycom on its books and records. Polycom also violated Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act by failing to devise and maintain a sufficient system of internal accounting controls to detect and prevent the making of improper payments by Polycom China to foreign government officials. As a result, Polycom generated profits of approximately $10.7 million.Polycom's Self-Disclosure, Cooperation, and Remedial Efforts15. In determining to accept the Offer, the Commission considered Polycom's self-disclosure, cooperation, and remedial efforts. Polycom hired outside counsel to conduct an independent investigation to determine the scope of potential issues related to payments made by Polycom China's distributors. Polycom then voluntarily disclosed this misconduct to the Commission staff and provided cooperation to the Commission during the entire course of its investigation. Polycom shared facts that it discovered during the course of its internal investigation into the matters described above. Polycom also cooperated by voluntarily producing all documents requested by Commission staff, translating a large volume of documents into English, and making certain employees available for interviews.16. Polycom also undertook remedial actions in response to the matters it identified in its internal investigation. These remedial measures included terminating the employment of eight employees involved in the matters described above, disciplining 18 other employees, terminating the Company's relationship with one of its channel partners and requiring personnel changes at several others, improving the anticorruption and other related trainings Polycom provides to its China-based employees, hiring additional personnel, including in China, to enhance oversight, supplementing existing third party policies and trainings and third party due diligence procedures, and enhancing existing, as well as adopting additional, policies, procedures and controls designed to detect and prevent improper payments.IV.In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions agreed to in Respondent Polycom's Offer.Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that:A. Pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, Respondent Polycom cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act.B. Respondent shall, within 10 days of the entry of this Order, pay disgorgement of $10,672,926 and prejudgment interest of $1,833,410 to the Securities and Exchange Commission for transfer to the general fund of the United States Treasury, subject to Exchange Act Section 21F(g)(3). If timely payment is not made, additional interest shall accrue pursuant to SEC Rule of Practice 600.C. Respondent shall, within 10 days of the entry of this Order, pay a civil money penalty in the amount of $3,800,000 to the Securities and Exchange Commission for transfer to the general fund of the United States Treasury, subject to Exchange Act Section 21F(g)(3). If timely payment is not made, additional interest shall accrue pursuant to 31 U.S.C. *3717.Payment must be made in one of the following ways:(1) Respondent may transmit payment electronically to the Commission, which will provide detailed ACH transfer/Fedwire instructions upon request;(2) Respondent may make direct payment from a bank account via Pay.gov through the SEC website at http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ofm.htm; or(3) Respondent may pay by certified check, bank cashier's check, or United States postal money order, made payable to the Securities and Exchange Commission and hand-delivered or mailed to:Enterprise Services CenterAccounts Receivable BranchHQ Bldg., Room 181, AMZ-3416500 South MacArthur BoulevardOklahoma City, OK 73169Payments by check or money order must be accompanied by a cover letter identifying Polycom, Inc. as a Respondent in these proceedings, and the file number of these proceedings; a copy of the cover letter and check or money order must be sent to Erin Schneider, Associate Regional Director, Securities and Exchange Commission, San Francisco Regional Office, 44 Montgomery Street, Suite 2800, San Francisco, CA 94104.D. Amounts ordered to be paid as civil money penalties pursuant to this Order shall be treated as penalties paid to the government for all purposes, including all tax purposes. To preserve the deterrent effect of the civil penalty, Respondent agrees that in any Related Investor Action, it shall not argue that it is entitled to, nor shall it benefit by, offset or reduction of any award of compensatory damages by the amount of any part of Respondent's payment of a civil penalty in this action ("Penalty Offset"). If the court in any Related Investor Action grants such a Penalty Offset, Respondent agrees that it shall, within 30 days after entry of a final order granting the Penalty Offset, notify the Commission's counsel in this action and pay the amount of the Penalty Offset to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such a payment shall not be deemed an additional civil penalty and shall not be deemed to change the amount of the civil penalty imposed in this proceeding. For purposes of this paragraph, a "Related Investor Action" means a private damages action brought against Respondent by or on behalf of one or more investors based on substantially the same facts as alleged in the Order instituted by the Commission in this proceeding.By the Commission.Brent J.

What's wrong with Huawei, and why are countries banning the Chinese telecommunications firm?The Conversation - United StatesDecember  19, 2018 Wednesday 11:44 AM ESTCopyright 2018 The Conversation Media Group Ltd All Rights ReservedLength: 1095 wordsByline: Frank J. Cilluffo, Director, McCrary Institute for Cyber and Critical Infrastructure Security, Auburn UniversityHighlight: Intelligence officials in many countries are concerned the company could be helping the Chinese government spy on companies, military units and government agencies.BodyThe Chinese telecommunications company Huawei is under scrutiny around the globe over concerns that its close ties with the Chinese government present national security threats to the U.S., Europe and allied countries. Huawei, which denies all the allegations against it, is "           the world's biggest supplier of telecoms gear" and has plans to "           dominate the market" for the next generation of            wireless communications, called 5G. But its hopes are threatened by governments around the world, which are restricting the company's prospects and even banning it from operating in some areas.No Chinese company is fully independent of its government, which reserves the right to require companies to assist with intelligence gathering. Huawei is even more closely tied to the government than many Chinese firms: Its founder, Ren Zhengfei, is a former            technologist in the People's Liberation Army. As his company grew, so did international concerns about whether Huawei equipment could be used to            spy on companies and governments around the world.As far back as 2003, the company was accused of stealing intellectual property, including from U.S.-based network hardware maker Cisco. The companies            settled out of court, but Huawei has            been accused of stealing other firms' intellectual property and violating international economic sanctions. Throughout 2018, a flurry of activity has signaled the level of concern in the international intelligence community, and pressure on the company - and other Chinese technology firms - has mounted.Months of setbacksIn February, the heads of six U.S. intelligence agencies told a Senate committee they didn't trust Huawei or its rival ZTE, which is also based in China, and would recommend Americans not use the company's smartphones or other equipment. On July 17, the intelligence chiefs of the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Australia and New Zealand reportedly met in person, in part to make plans to publicize their concerns about allowing Huawei equipment to operate in their countries and governments.Two days later, the United Kingdom's government-run lab specifically set up to evalute Huawei hardware and software reported finding "           shortcomings" in Huawei's engineering processes that raised security risks. After a big push from the British government,            Huawei agreed to spend US$2 billion to address those problems.In mid-August, the U.S. Congress passed, and President Donald Trump signed, a law specifically prohibiting U.S. government agencies from purchasing or using telecommunications and surveillance products from Chinese companies like ZTE and Huawei - both of which are            named in the law.A week later, Australia announced a similar ban, barring firms "who are likely to be subject to extrajudicial directions from a foreign government" from supplying equipment for its            nationwide 5G rollout. The announcement did not specifically name Huawei or ZTE, but Huawei criticized the decision as political and based in "           ideological prejudices," rather than actual security concerns.In late November, New Zealand's intelligence agency barred Huawei from participating in its 5G development, citing "significant national security risks." In Canada, where telecommunications companies use Huawei equipment extensively, the government is still            discussing a possible ban. But the country did arrest Huawei's chief financial officer,            Meng Wangzhou, who is also the daughter of the company's founder, as a result of a U.S. allegation that she            violated international sanctions against Iran.            China threatened Canada with "           severe consequences" if Meng was not released immediately. She is now            out on bail with extradition proceedings pending.Days after Meng's arrest, the private company that dominates U.K. telecommunications, BT Group, announced it was removing Huawei equipment from its existing mobile networks, and would not use Huawei technology in future mobile systems.In early December, Japan also announced it was poised to ban Huawei and ZTE from its 5G networks.In mid-December, French telecommunications company Orange, previously known as France Telecom, announced it would not use Huawei equipment in its 5G network.And Germany's Deutsche Telekom said it was reviewing security concerns about Huawei equipment.On Dec. 17 Czech authorities warned their citizens against using Huawei equipment for security reasons. Tensions over evidenceAll these countries and companies are expressing concern that China's government could exploit Huawei's technology to spy on them, stealing corporate or            government or            military secrets.Tensions between free commerce and national security are not new. Security skeptics, and those who favor free and open trade, will ask to see evidence supporting the claims that Huawei, ZTE or other foreign companies have spied, or might spy, on conversations and data transmissions. Security proponents will counter that the            evidence must remain secret, to protect intelligence operations.The situation with these Chinese companies is even more challenging, because the full extent of any relationship between Huawei and the Chinese government is masked. However, it's extremely rare for the U.S. and allied governments to take the sorts of steps they have taken to restrict specific companies. Those moves suggest that - even without detailed public proof - there is solid evidence supporting the intelligence community's worries.The focus of many security agencies and countries on Huawei's involvement in 5G systems raises the stakes, too: The next generation of wireless technology is expected to fuel even more connectivity in the "internet of things," linking smart cars, smart homes and smart cities together. Billions of devices will be involved, all communicating with each other, forming what could become a surveillance web over much of the planet, and exponentially expanding the number of potential targets for spying. As governments seek to ensure 5G is secure and trusted around the world, Huawei may find its prospects limited by its links to the Chinese government.Frank J.

She is now            out on bail with extradition proceedings pending.Days after Meng's arrest, the private company that dominates U.K. telecommunications, BT Group, announced it was removing Huawei equipment from its existing mobile networks, and would not use Huawei technology in future mobile systems.In early December, Japan also announced it was poised to ban Huawei and ZTE from its 5G networks.In mid-December, French telecommunications company Orange, previously known as France Telecom, announced it would not use Huawei equipment in its 5G network.And Germany's Deutsche Telekom said it was reviewing security concerns about Huawei equipment.On Dec. 17 Czech authorities warned their citizens against using Huawei equipment for security reasons. Tensions over evidenceAll these countries and companies are expressing concern that China's government could exploit Huawei's technology to spy on them, stealing corporate or            government or            military secrets.Tensions between free commerce and national security are not new. Security skeptics, and those who favor free and open trade, will ask to see evidence supporting the claims that Huawei, ZTE or other foreign companies have spied, or might spy, on conversations and data transmissions. Security proponents will counter that the            evidence must remain secret, to protect intelligence operations.The situation with these Chinese companies is even more challenging, because the full extent of any relationship between Huawei and the Chinese government is masked. However, it's extremely rare for the U.S. and allied governments to take the sorts of steps they have taken to restrict specific companies. Those moves suggest that - even without detailed public proof - there is solid evidence supporting the intelligence community's worries.The focus of many security agencies and countries on Huawei's involvement in 5G systems raises the stakes, too: The next generation of wireless technology is expected to fuel even more connectivity in the "internet of things," linking smart cars, smart homes and smart cities together. Billions of devices will be involved, all communicating with each other, forming what could become a surveillance web over much of the planet, and exponentially expanding the number of potential targets for spying. As governments seek to ensure 5G is secure and trusted around the world, Huawei may find its prospects limited by its links to the Chinese government.Frank J.

Talk explores Chinese public opinion, foreign policyThe Miscellany News: Vassar CollegeDecember 5, 2018 WednesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 1022 wordsBodyOn Friday, Nov. 30, Associate Professor of Government at Cornell Dr. Jessica Chen Weiss presented on the rise of Chinese nationalism in a lecture titled, "Nationalism and Public Opinion in China's Foreign Relation." The event, sponsored by the Political Science Department and the Vassar College Chinese Students' Community, was hosted by Professor and Chair of Political Science Fubing Su.Weiss began with a photograph of a protest that occurred in 2012 in response to Japanese actions in the East China Sea. "This is pretty surprising of Chinese politics," Weiss began, "that there would be large scale street demonstrations allowed to take place. The Chinese government, fearing a repeat of the demonstrations in 1999, remains extremely vigilant and proactive at cracking down on any sign of unrest, even potential unrest." Weiss explained that over the past 30 years, there have been few successful protests relative to the number of repressed national protests. The Chinese government facilitated the few major protests. Of them, one was an anti-U.S. demonstration following the EP-3 incident of 2001, in which an American intelligence aircraft collided with a Chinese fighter jet.Elaborating, Weiss explained that because of fears associated with unrest toward foreign powers and the out-of-hand economic costs of protests, the Chinese government is hesitant to allow them to take place: "Perhaps because of all the accumulated risks, China hasn't allowed large scale protest to occur."Discussing how China manages to handle mass unrests in the Internet age, Weiss stated, "The government employs more than two million [people] to monitor online sentiments and unrest." To anticipate and intercept possible protests, the government is constantly reacting to online activity. Weiss also mentioned the role of monitoring social media in preventing protests. According to Business Insider, "China holds people criminally liable for content posted in any group chat they initiate on messaging apps" (Business Insider, "China is building a vast civilian surveillance network - here are 10 ways it could be feeding its creepy 'social credit system,'" 04.29.2018).Noting that there haven't been any large scale protests since 2012, Weiss asked, "Why is it we should care about nationalism and public opinion in China?" Weiss then provided historical context on the importance of public opinion, quoting past Chinese leaders who emphasized its role in the survival of the Chinese government. "First, public opinion informs domestic leadership," Weiss explained. Public opinion in China communicates to the government the effect of its foreign and domestic policies. "Second, it informs foreigners in their view of China." In other words, foreigners look to the public opinion to better understand China's resolves and long term foreign policy.Continuing, Weiss made an important distinction between nationalism and public opinion, stating, "Chinese nationalism isn't particularly rising ... There is less nationalism in Chinese youth." She instead suggested that people are confusing China's intrinsic nationalism with a new and more outspoken public voice: that is, confusing identity with public opinion.Weiss then questioned the lack of available information on Chinese public opinion. She asked, "Can the Chinese government mold public opinion?" To answer this question, Weiss presented a set of five surveys conducted in China to research Chinese public opinion. The questions addressed foreign policy issues and demonstrated that the younger generations were more outspoken about their beliefs. Yet, in the research, about 30 percent of those surveyed answered that it is best not to speak out against one's government.Throughout the lecture, Weiss addressed the misconceptions that surveys clear up. With such limited knowledge on the public opinion of Chinese citizens, it is easy for foreign countries to create false narratives. One example she provided was the Air Defense Identification Zone in the East China Sea; according to Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative, "[The ADIZ is an] area of airspace... within which the ready identification, the location, and the control of aircraft are required in the interest of national security" (Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative, "Counter-Coercion Series: East China Sea Air Defense Identification Zone," 06.13.2017). It is an area in which any unknown aircraft, if flying within that zone, has to identify itself and comply with Chinese authorities. However, U.S. military aircrafts frequently fly over that zone without complying and receive almost no response from the Chinese government. While this lack of governmental enforcement may point to a weakness in the zone, it can be seen as "benign authority." These possible misconceptions would then influence how foreign relations are conducted.During an interview following the lecture, Weiss contemplated her study of Chinese foreign relations. "I've always been interested in perception and misperception between the United States and China. Maybe because I'm half-Chinese," she said. "When I was in China studying Chinese, the 2001 EP-3 incident happened, and I was pretty shocked by the differences between how my teachers viewed what had happened and what I was reading and hearing from the U.S. media."Reflecting on how this experience inspired her studies, Weiss said, "The idea that we can have such radically different perceptions about the same facts in the same time really worried me. I think it's one of the major challenges for peace in the world for generations to come. I think it has to do with my personal interests and wanting to make the world a little bit safer."Weiss encouraged attendees to conduct and read similar studies in order to increase their understanding of one another as global citizens. "It's important to understand Chinese domestic politics shaping China's foreign policy," Weiss concluded. "[A]s China becomes less and less constrained and as it rises the global hierarchy ... We [in the U.S. and China] have to begin to understand ourselves mutually to avoid this creeping war footing."Load-Date: December 6, 2018End of Document

Internet censorship haunts China's social media starsUPINovember 29, 2018 Thursday 2:33 AM ESTCopyright 2018 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 757 wordsByline: ELIZABETH SHIMDateline: Dec. 31 BodyOnline Chinese celebrities who are featured in a documentary that will be released in select U.S. cities on Friday are nervous about becoming the object of Chinese government attention, the film's director says.Hao Wu, who directed People's Republic of Desire, a film about Chinese live-streamers, said one of the social media stars, Big Li, skipped a screening in Guangzhou, China."'I don't want to be associated with this film'," Li told Wu after being invited to the event."He was very afraid of being the target of government attention," Wu told UPI.China has the largest Internet population in the world, with at least 802 million users as of June. But it also retains a sophisticated system of censors, and online surveillance, that includes tracking users through name registration and the blocking of sites via the Great Firewall.The sustained popularity of social media influencers, despite their wariness of the state bureaucracy, tells a more complicated tale about the relationship between China's vast online population and the state, however.In an increasingly unequal China, where the poor are finding themselves falling behind the urban elites in cities like Shanghai, the entertainment available online provides the state with a useful distraction to use against potential dissidents."There's a term in recent years, 'Entertain until your death'," Wu said, referring to the government's preference of keeping the "masses entertained" so they do not rise up to challenge the status quo. "In this regard, live-streaming is playing that role."Wu added the Chinese state knows live-streaming, and other social media platforms, are powerful tools."Fans worshiping their idols, each idol with millions of followers, they could easily start something...it's a double-edged sword for the government," the filmmaker said.To stay out of trouble, China's live-streamers choose to follow the rules, or have altogether eliminated politics from their daily conversations before the camera.Wu said Big Li originally addressed social inequality in his online monologues in 2012, but eventually quit talking about politically sensitive topics as the government began a comprehensive crackdown on online activity.Now the state is primarily concerned about how "dirty" the content is, as audiences sometimes flirt with their idols or if they are women, ask them to "take off their clothes.""A lot of dirty jokes, a lot of flirting, money worshiping," Wu said.In the Chinese live-streaming world, wealthy patrons shower social media stars with digital gifts, spending their personal wealth online, which impresses those of lesser means. Successful live-streamers earn several thousand dollars per month.Lewd jokes and other forms of speech fill the Chinese Internet in part because the online world behind the Great Firewall "provides a relatively free space for expression that promotes the development of civil society, facilitating collective action," says Rongbin Han, a political scientist at the University of Georgia.Han, who studies the politics of Chinese cyberspace, said this week at the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations the Chinese government has launched many campaigns to influence or manipulate public opinion -- a kind of middle-road solution for an economy that needs the Internet to innovate."The state has neither the capacity nor intention to curb freedom of expression," Han said.China has instead turned to hired "trolls," dubbed the "50-cent army," to flood the comments section of electronic bulletin boards with official party views.The hired commenters are low-paid workers who are not "super motivated" and the strategy has not really worked, Han says.What is interesting, however, is the outcome of a relatively unregulated Internet.Free "online expression has helped the government, [because] it creates spontaneous regime defenders," Han said, referring to a more authentic "voluntary" 50-cent army of commenters who are not state sponsored and are sometimes critical of the government, and therefore more effective communicators.It is these defenders of China's authoritarian government that may have made it harder to build a common resistance against state censors, as they ultimately reinforce state power, according to Han.Volunteers, like the live-streamers featured in Wu's film, are "playful, relatable," and testify to the power of entertainment as a means of spreading state messages.China's "netizens are constantly fighting," and competing views work in the state's favor, according to the analyst.Load-Date: November 30, 2018End of Document

DOJ Announces Charges Against Hackers Associated With Chinese GovernmentCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 20, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 349 wordsBody       In a potential blow to U.S.-China trade talks, the Justice Department on Thursday announced the criminal indictment of two computer hackers associated with the Chinese government. The unsealed indictment charges the two Chinese nationals with conspiracy to commit computer intrusions, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and aggravated identity theft. The defendants, identified as Zhu Hua and Zhang Shilong, allegedly worked for a hacking group operating in China known within the cyber security community as Advanced Persistent Threat 10, or APT 10. Zhu and Zhang are accused of conducting global campaigns of computer intrusions targeting, among other data, intellectual property and confidential business and technological information at managed service providers. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said Zhu and Zhang allegedly committed their crimes in association with a Chinese intelligence service known as the Ministry of State Security. "This is not the first time the Department of Justice has accused Chinese state actors and associates of stealing commercial information," Rosenstein said. "Since the indictment of five uniformed members of the People's Liberation Army in 2014, our Department has repeatedly cast a spotlight on Chinese state-sponsored criminal activity targeting U.S. companies." "It is unacceptable that we continue to uncover cybercrime committed by China against other nations," he added. "We want China to cease illegal cyber activities and honor its commitment to the international community, but the evidence suggests that China may not intend to live up to its promises." The announcement of the indictment comes as U.S. and Chinese officials have been in discussions about a long-term trade deal after President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to a 90-day trade war truce early this month. The indictment of the Chinese hackers along with the recent arrest of Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou on suspicion of violating U.S. trade sanctions against Iran has cast doubt on the potential for a lasting agreement.        Load-Date: December 20, 2018End of Document

Regardless of any past commitment, China's intelligence services have continued brazen attempts to steal the intellectual property of American companies in an effort to continue to exploit the technological gains of others and fuel the goals of the Chinese Communist Party. The United States must lead like-minded countries to counter the Chinese government's lawless cyberaggression. We must understand that this is part of China's strategic effort to supplant and undermine America's economic and global leadership. The United States must continue using all tools, including military alliances, law enforcement, sanctions and other pressure, to end China's growing threat to our national and economic security. How we confront China is the single most important geopolitical issue of our time."Background:China's theft of U.S. intellectual property costs our nation alone nearly $600 billion per yeareconomic damages that exceed the total profits of the top 50 companies on last year's Fortune 500 list.Load-Date: December 21, 2018End of Document

China - Telecoms, Mobile, Broadband and Digital Media - Statistics and AnalysesPR NewswireNovember 19, 2018 Monday 8:33 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 802 wordsDateline: LONDON, Nov. 19, 2018 BodyPR NewswireChina moves towards a 5G futureThe Chinese telecom market is the largest in the world in terms of subscribers and is undergoing transition. Mobile subscriptions outnumber fixed voice connections and voice is giving way to data as the primary revenue generator. China's telecom market is served by three operators; China Telecom, China Unicom and China Mobile. All three are integrated providers of telecom services although China Mobile is the largest in the crucial mobile market.Download the full report:https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/3948161China's fixed-line market is in decline due to voice mobile substitution although the two main fixed-line operators of China Telecom and China Unicom have aggressively deployed and marketed fibre broadband to increase the value of maintaining a fixed-line. Fixed line penetration has dropped significantly over the past five years. This trend is predicted to continue over the next five years to 2022 driven by the growing adoption of mobile broadband.China's telecommunications development has generally been driven by investments from government-allied entities. However, the Chinese government has chosen a minimal intervention approach in broadband development.Although some government funding is spent on universal service, a major strategy of the Chinese government has been to create a competitive market structure by restructuring the telecommunications sector.China possesses the largest broadband subscriber base in the world, with the majority of users accessing the Internet through mobile devices. Broadband makes up the majority of fixed Internet connections given dial-up comprises less than 2% of total fixed Internet connections.Unlike the US market, where cable internet access plays a prominent role in developing the fixed broadband market, DSL was the initial driving force behind fixed broadband growth in China, followed later by EPON fibre and now GPON fibre.The government's Broadband China Plan aims to provide nationwide broadband access with speeds of at least 50 Mbps in urban areas and 12 Mbps in rural areas by 2020. Fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) coverage is close to 90% in cities in most provinces. Moderate fixed broadband growth is predicted over the next five years to 2022. Fibre broadband adoption will continue to dominate the market.China's online audience is growing wealthier due to ongoing urbanisation. As a consequence China's online audience is increasingly willing to spend online, a trend encouraged by the government as it seeks to balance the economy away from an overreliance on building infrastructure and exporting goods towards domestic consumption.Although China boasts the largest mobile market in the world, there is still much room for growth given the relatively recent focus on large scale LTE investment. All three mobile network operators are focused on deploying LTE networks and monetizing such investments by enticing end users to upgrade to higher ARPU LTE products such as mobile broadband.Mobile broadband has seen very strong growth in China over the past five years. Slower growth is predicted for the next five years to 2022 in a fast maturing market. China has emerged as one of the most aggressive countries promoting 5G. The major Chinese internet companies will lead the way in introducing advanced consumer services based on 4K and 8K videos, as well as augmented and virtual reality technologies, on the new 5G networks.Key developments:Fixed line penetration has dropped significantly over the past five years.China's government strengthens IOT policies to boost economic growth.China's government further opens the telecom market to private companies.China possesses the world's largest M2M market.Broadband has become the key revenue generator for China's three telcos.Fibre has overtaken DSL to become the key fixed broadband technology platform.Mobile is the most popular Internet access method in China.Increasing focus on mobile apps by China's digital media giants.China has emerged as one of the most aggressive countries promoting 5G.Key companies mentioned in this report:China Mobile; China Telecom; China Unicom, Apple, Alibaba, JD.com, Baidu, Tencent, SINA, Weibo, Sohu, Xiaomi, Meilishuo, Mogujie, RenRen, V.QQ.com, BesTVDownload the full report:           https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/3948161AboutReportbuyerReportbuyer is a leading industry intelligence solution that provides all market research reports from top publishersFor more information:Sarah SmithResearch Advisor at Reportbuyer.comEmail:sarah@reportbuyer.comTel: +1 (718) 213 4904Website:           http://www.reportbuyer.com View original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/china---telecoms-mobile-broadband-and-digital-media---statistics-and-analyses-300752824.htmlSOURCE ReportBuyerLoad-Date: November 20, 2018End of Document

GRASSLEY ON CHINESE ESPIONAGE: IT'S CALLED CHEATING. AND IT'S ONLY GETTING WORSE.States News ServiceDecember 12, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 1766 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Iowa Senator Charles Grassley:Prepared Statement by Senator Chuck Grassley of IowaChairman, Senate Judiciary CommitteeHearing on China's Non-Traditional Espionage Against the United States:The Threat and Potential Policy ResponsesWednesday, December 12, 2018We've heard a constant drumbeat over the past two years about the national security threats posed by Russia. Attempts to sow discord and inflame partisan differences through social media, and attempts to interfere with our elections through cyber intrusions are real threats. They should not be underestimated. I've held seven hearings on election meddling.But the media hysteria over all things Russia has distracted attention from arguably a greater, more existential threat: China's efforts to overtake the United States as the world's preeminent superpower in all phases of society. China has made no bones about doing this through any and all means. Whether it be President Xi's stated goal of becoming "the world's biggest superpower" by 2050, or the "Made in China 2025" initiative that called for a ten year overhaul of China's manufacturing and high-tech industries, the PRC's plans for superiority includes economic dominance.The United States remains the most creative, innovative society on earth. Although China has made significant strides in various sectors including technology, telecom, advanced robotics, artificial intelligence, and scientific research one tool of economic advancement continues to be pervasive. That's economic and other forms of espionage.In simple terms, it's called cheating. And it's only getting worse.In the past nine months alone, DOJ has investigated, charged, or convicted at least 16 individuals and four corporate entities in eight separate cases involving theft of trade secrets. Over the past five years, six more individuals have been either investigated, charged or convicted by DOJ for stealing research from American universities. One case involves a Chinese intelligence officer who is a deputy division director from China's main spy agency. He's the first Chinese intelligence official to be brought to the United States and tried in open court. A slew of other Chinese intelligence officers and hackers were charged in a multi-year plan to steal sensitive commercial aviation data. Then there is the massive plot by a Chinese government-owned company to steal U.S. semi-conductor technology. These cases, in particular, highlight the threat of Chinese state-controlled economic espionage.Just last week, we saw the arrest of the Chief Financial Officer of Huawei, the largest telecommunications company in China. And a financial firm owned by China's Ministry of Finance reportedly used various shell companies to conceal efforts to get sensitive satellite technology from Boeing. That technology has potential military applications.Although those two cases did not strictly involve espionage, they point to a broader issue: cold disinterest to American sanctions enforcement and a callous indifference for broader adherence to the rule of law.When it comes to espionage, FBI Director Wray has said "there's no country that's even close" to the People's Republic of China. General Keith Alexander called China's estimated gains from economic espionage of up to $600 billion, "the greatest transfer of wealth in history." China is believed to be responsible for 50 to 80 percent of cross-border intellectual property theft worldwide, and over 90 percent of cyber-enabled economic espionage in the United States. Reports issued this year by the White House Office on Trade and Manufacturing, the U.S. Trade Representative, and ODNI all report detailed findings on China's role as a prime cyber-attacker and thief of American intellectual property and technology.The National Institutes of Health announced in August of this year that it has discovered NIH grants are going to researchers who are not disclosing their contributions from foreign governments. Chinese "Talent programs" seek to recruit American researchers, in order to bring technological advancements back to China. Confucius Institutes, found at many of our nation's top universities, and directly funded by the Chinese government, stifle intellectual freedom and quiet all those who would criticize China with revisionist histories.In response to the growing number of cases, DOJ recently announced a new initiative to combat Chinese economic espionage. I look forward to hearing more about the initiative and any legislative proposals needed to address these problems.We often get distracted by the shiny objects in front of us. I fear that China is all too happy to have our attention deflected away from the threat they pose to our economy, our innovation, our businesses, and our very standing in the world.Nobody is in favor of billions in American IP being stolen. Nobody supports researchers violating the terms of their government grants in favor of a foreign government. We all should condemn cyberattacks on government and private sector information and systems. The question is: how can we counter these activities? I hope we can come to an answer together.-30-Grassley on Chinese Espionage: It's called cheating. And it's only getting worse.Grassley on Chinese Espionage: It's called cheating.

Two Chinese intelligence officers accused of stealing US jet engine techCNN.comOctober 30, 2018 Tuesday 4:10 AM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: ASIALength: 472 wordsByline: By Ben Westcott and Mary Kay Mallonee, CNNBodyTwo Chinese intelligence officers have been charged by the United States Justice Department with trying to steal the details for a type of jet engine technology from US-based companies.Zha Rong and Chai Meng, intelligence officers with the Jiangsu provincial branch of the Ministry of State Security (MSS) in China, are accused of attempting to hack and infiltrate private companies over the course of five years in an attempt to steal the technology."This action is yet another example of criminal efforts by the MSS to facilitate the theft of private data for China's commercial gain," US Attorney Adam Braverman said in a statement."The concerted effort to steal, rather than simply purchase, commercially available products should offend every company that invests talent, energy, and shareholder money into the development of products."The US Department of Justice statement does not explicitly state where Zha Rong and Chai Meng are presently located. The United States does not have an extradition treaty with China -- and if the men are in China, the Chinese government would be unlikely to give them up.On Wednesday, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang dismissed the charges as "sheer fiction and completely fabricated."The charges come at a time when pressure is building on Beijing to address US concerns over the widespread alleged theft of intellectual property by Chinese agents to fuel the country's economic rise.The new charges mark the third time since September that charges have been brought against Chinese intelligence officers for trying to steal US intellectual property.On October 11, the Department of Justice charged Chinese intelligence officer Yanjun Xu with attempting to commit economic espionage, including working to get aviation employees to reveal their trade secrets. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman dismissed the allegation as "pure fabrication" at the time.In an indictment released by the Justice Department Tuesday, the US Justice Department alleged Zha and Chai from January 2010 began to work with a team of hackers to steal the technology for the engine which was being developed jointly by a French and a US-based company."At the time of the intrusions, a Chinese state-owned aerospace company was working to develop a comparable engine for use in commercial aircraft manufactured in China and elsewhere," the statement said.Attempts to infiltrate the company weren't limited to hacking, according to the US statement. Two Chinese nationals working for the company, Tian Xi and Gu Gen were allegedly co-opted by Chinese intelligence and given malware to install in their employer's computer system."The threat posed by Chinese government-sponsored hacking activity is real and relentless," John Brown, FBI Special Agent in Charge of the San Diego Field Office, said in a statement.Load-Date: November 1, 2018End of Document

China Lithium Ion Battery Market is Expected to Reach 785.8 GWh in Terms of Output Volume by 2022: Ken ResearchPR NewswireDecember 18, 2018 Tuesday 9:10 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1298 wordsDateline: GURUGRAM, India, December 18, 2018 BodyPR NewswireThe Chinese government has formed medium and Long-Term Development Plan for Automotive Industry about the annual output of new energy vehicles.The government is actively developing plans and taking actions to promote the alternative electric vehicles. This is said to increase the demand for Lithium Ion Batteries in China.The demand for Lithium-ion battery in China is expected to grow at a rapid pace majorly due to increase in the use of retired lithium-ion batteries in telecom industry in the country.Increased Initiatives by the Government:The government has adapted the smart grid initiative which is expected to support the demand for lithium-ion battery in the China. The Government of China is focusing on energy diversification and has a target of achieving 680 GW renewable capacity by 2020, out of which 270 GW will be generated from solar energy and 210 GW from Wind energy. This would require extensive deployment of lithium ion batteries.     (Logo:https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/661352/Ken_Research_Logo.jpg)Promotion of AEV (Alternate Electric Vehicle):In China, government has framed a complex policy/ regulation which will require a sizable portion of car manufacturer's production or imports to be green by 2019, along with escalating goals thereafter. Therefore, all major manufacturers operating in China-from global giants Toyota Motor and General Motors to domestic players BYD and BAIC Motor-have to meet minimum requirements for producing new-energy vehicles, or NEVs (plug-in hybrids, pure-battery electrics, and fuel-cell autos). It has been anticipated that Ford will introduce at least 15 hybrid cars and EVs in China by the year 2025.Use of Retired Lithium-ion Batteries:Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) of China has undergone a pilot program of recycling and second use of retired lithium-ion batteries which were used in EVs in 17 major regions and cities of China. China Tower (world's largest operator of telecommunication of towers) is included alone in this pilot study program. Currently (2018), in China only 2.0% of battery power is deployed using lithium-ion batteries in China Towers while the majority of the storage battery is still generated via lead-acid batteries. It is anticipated that in the upcoming years, China towers will spend around CNY 20 billion to replace lead acid batteries which will further increase the output volume generated through lithium-ion batteries in China.Analysts at Ken Research in their latest publication "China Lithium Ion Battery Market Outlook to 2022 - By Application (Consumer Electronics, Power Storage and Energy Storage), By Type (Ternary, Lithium-Ion Phosphate, Lithium Manganese Oxide and Others), By Shape (Square Shaped, Cylindrical and Soft Pack Battery)"believe that the Battery Market in China will continue to grow with Chinese government emphasis on capacity addition plan of renewable energy over the forecast period coupled with increase in sale of electric vehicles in the country.The market is expected to register a positive CAGR of 50.8% in terms of output volume during the forecast period 2018-2022, albeit the increase in competition from new companies entering the market.Keywords China Lithium Ion Battery MarketLithium Ion Battery Output Volume Capacity ChinaChina Lithium Battery RevenueElectric Vehicles Sales ChinaChina Consumer Electronics MarketEnergy Storage Market ChinaPower Storage Market ChinaChina Lithium Ion Battery GrowthChina Lithium Ion Battery AssociationLithium Ion Battery Shape ChinaChina Lithium Ion Battery ShapeMobile Phone Battery ChinaBattery Shipments ChinaChina Lithium Ion Battery LifeChina Lithium Ion Battery AdvantagesChina Lithium Ion Battery ManufacturersLithium Ion Battery Manufacturers ChinaChina Electric Vehicle Battery MarketPower Battery Usage ChinaSquare Battery Power Capacity ChinaChina Lithium IonLithium Ion BatteryChina BatteryLithium Ion Electric VehiclesLithium Ion Consumer AppliancesChina Lithium Ion BatteryLithium Ion Telecom BatterExport Lithium Ion BatteryTrends Lithium Ion BatteryChallenges Lithium Ion BatteryGovernment Regulations Lithium IonChina Lithium Battery Growth DriverLithium Ion ProductionLithium Ion MobilePower Capacity BatteryLithium Ion IndustryKey Segments Covered -  Market Segmentation Type of Battery (Ternary, Lithium Iron Phosphate, Lithium Manganese Oxide  and Others)Area of Application (Consumer Electronics, Power Storage, and Energy Storage)By Consumer Electronics (Portable Charger, Mobile Phone, Electronic Tools, Laptop,  Tablet and Others)By Power (Electric Car, Electric Bicycle, Electric Tricycle, Low Speed Electric Car and Other Electric Cars)By Energy Storage (Telecom Towers, Home Energy Storage, Grid Energy Storage and Other Energy Storage)By Shape of Battery (Square Shaped Battery, Cylindrical Shaped Battery, Soft Pack Battery)Key Target Audience Distributors of BatteriesTelecom CompaniesManufacturers of Electric VehiclesImporters of BatteriesGovernmental DepartmentsCompanies Covered: Contemporary Amperex Technology Co.

CHINA TRIES INTERNET CZAR, 'FATHER OF GREAT FIREWALL' FOR BRIBERYStates News ServiceOctober 19, 2018 FridayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 612 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:A former top internet censor for the ruling Chinese Communist Party stood trial for corruption behind closed doors in the eastern Chinese city of Ningbo on Friday, state media reported.Lu Wei, once dubbed the "father" of the Great Firewall of government internet censorship, has admitted taking 32 million yuan (U.S. $4.6 million) in bribes, state news agency Xinhua reported.A former journalist for the state-run news agency Xinhua, Lu rose to become the agency's vice president from 2004-2011, and vice mayor of Beijing from 2011-2013. He was last seen in public a year ago.Several of Lu's associates and colleagues at the powerful Cyberspace Administration, which he headed until June 2016, were questioned in the probe.Lu was greeted in Mandarin by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg during a December 2014 trip to the United States, during which he also told Apple's Tim Cook that Beijing would decide whether to allow products to enter the Chinese market.But his fall to an ongoing anti-corruption campaign waged by President Xi Jinping is likely due to behind-the-scenes power struggles, analysts said.Lu's former colleagues and associates in his home province of Anhui have been put on notice by the authorities, and are attending compulsory "education sessions" to discuss his case, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported, citing an article on the website of Xi's hugely powerful State Supervisory Commission.Since Lu's downfall, Xi has continued to expand the authorities' control over what its more than 730 million internet users can do, see, or say online.Interpol chiefMeanwhile, the wife of former Interpol president Meng Hongwei, is under police protection in France after her husband was taken to a secret location "on the outskirts of Beijing" to be investigated for corruption.The official website of China's Ministry of Public Security said Meng is being investigated by the State Supervisory Commission for "accepting bribes and suspected violation of laws."His wife Grace Meng says she has been contacted by Chinese diplomats, who have told her they're holding a letter from him for her, but has only agreed to meet with lawyers and journalists present.Exile sources in Paris said she likely fears she will be rendered back to China by agents of the ruling Chinese Communist Party against her will.Paris-based democracy activist Zhang Jian told RFA that moves are already under way to extradite Grace Meng, who remains vulnerable due to an existing extradition treaty between France and China."The Chinese government wants to extradite Meng Hongwei's wife ... and the French government likely won't be able to protect her because the Chinese Communist Party says this is an economic crime of corruption,"Zhang said."Grace Meng needs to demonstrate to the French government that this is actually a form of political persecution before they will protect her," he said.Request rejectedOfficials on the democratic island of Taiwan, which Beijing has blocked from participation in international bodies because it lays claim to its territory, said Interpol had rejected its request to attend next month's general assembly meeting in Dubai as an observer, blaming China for the snub.Taiwan's premier William Lai said on Friday that the government had received official notification from Interpol that its request to attend the meeting as an observer had been denied."Interpol's rejection of Taiwan is unreasonable but we know the important reason behind it is China's suppression of Taiwan," Lai told reporters.He described China's behavior towards Taiwan as "arrogant and high handed."Load-Date: October 19, 2018End of Document

Canada caught in the middle of US-China spat over Huawei executiveCNN WireDecember 17, 2018 Monday 11:04 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 887 wordsByline: By Paula Newton and Nicole Gaouette, CNNDateline: OTTAWA (CNN) BodyOTTAWA (CNN) --  The Chinese government is pushing Canada to release Meng Wanzhou, the Huawei chief financial officer detained for violating US sanctions on Iran, as Ottawa braces for relations with Beijing to worsen and urges President Donald Trump not to politicize the situation. Canadian government officials have asked for, and received, additional security at their diplomatic outposts in China, while Canadian companies that do business with China are bracing for lower sales and even a boycott of Canadian products. The arrest has put the Canadian government -- which has its own trade and other disputes with the Trump administration -- in the awkward position of defending its role in honoring reciprocal law enforcement arrangements with the US, just as President Donald Trump has suggested he might be willing to drop the Meng case in exchange for a trade deal with Beijing.The CFO of Chinese tech giant Huawei was arrested December 1 in Vancouver for violating US sanctions on Iran -- the same night Trump was dining with Chinese President Xi Jinping during the G20 summit in Argentina. China's state-run media has repeatedly claimed that Meng's detention appears to be politically or economically motivated. Trump's suggestion that he could use Meng as a bargaining chip in trade talks -- a flagrant breach of the US practice of separating politics and issues of the law -- has complicated the situation for Canada and fueled outrage in China. 'Mistakes'"The Chinese side strongly urges Canada to immediately rectify its mistakes, and release the detained Chinese citizen and truly guarantee their relevant legal and just rights," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters Sunday at a regular Ministry of Foreign Affairs briefing. "We strongly urge the US to revoke the relevant person's arrest warrant immediately." Trump told Reuters in an interview last week that he might intervene in Meng's case if it would help the United States and China reach a trade deal. "If I think it's good for what will be certainly the largest trade deal ever made, which is a very important thing, what's good for national security, I would certainly intervene if I thought it was necessary," Trump said.That drew a rebuke from Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland the next day. "Our extradition partners should not seek to politicize the extradition process or use it for ends other than the pursuit of justice," Freeland told reporters. China has detained two Canadians in the wake of Meng's arrest. Last week, Freeland confirmed the detention of Michael Kovrig, a former Canadian diplomat now with the International Crisis Group, a nonprofit organization. A second Canadian, businessman Michael Spavor, has also been detained. For now, China has directed its anger at Canada, but the standoff highlights the potential for increased tensions between Beijing and Washington. The US has pending indictments against Chinese government hackers by the Justice Department for violating a 2015 pact by stealing American intellectual property and a cyberattack on the Marriott hotel chain linked to Chinese-intelligence gathering efforts that affected nearly 500 million guests."China is clearly being impulsive here, they're lashing out and they're not interested in building any political capital with Canada," said James Zimmerman, a partner with the law firm Perkins Cole who formerly represented a Canadian couple detained by Chinese authorities in 2014 accused of spying. "This plays very well to those nationalists in China who argue that arresting the Huawei executive was pushing China too far," Zimmerman said.Things could get worseMany Chinese social media accounts are expressing outrage with Canada's move to execute the arrest, even though Canadian officials, including Freeland, say Canada was just following the terms of its extradition treaty with the US. Freeland said that she's talked with American Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the case.Officials from Global Affairs Canada told CNN that relations with China could get worse. "It has been very public, as you know, and it has been on social media and the Chinese government has been openly critical of the detention of Ms. Meng, so we have in general informed our personnel in Beijing and in our consulates ... to take extra precautions," one official said. The Canadians have registered their concerns with the Chinese authorities, officials tell CNN."Part of our dialogue with the Chinese authorities has been around the notion that under international law it is actually the host country that is in charge of our security," the official said. "We have made them aware of our concerns and they have stepped up security."However, the Chinese government says there's no comparison between the Canadians held in Chinese custody and Meng's arrest in Vancouver.Comparing the detention of the Canadian men in Chinese custody to the arrest of the Huawei CFO, Hua said of the Canadians that, "no matter what ridiculous pretexts they come up with, covering up under the appearance of being legitimate, cannot cover up their ignorance for the real facts and their contempt for the rule of law and people around the world are ridiculing them for this."TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

This attack had further breached and accessed a communications network used by the European Union to facilitate cooperation on urgent foreign policy matters.  This network, known as COREU, operates between the 28 EU countries, the Council, the EEAS and the Commission. It is a crucial but little-known instrument in the EU system of policymaking.Area 1 has tied the activities to the Strategic Support Force (SSF) of the People s Liberation Army (PLA). They have been able to identify a consistent set of characteristics and chain of events that links together a larger campaign that includes targeting of the United Nations and the AFL-CIO, in addition to the accessing of diplomatic cables from the European Union s COREU network. Our mission is to eliminate phishing. Through the course of our normal business we often discover the origins and outcomes of cyber campaigns,  said Oren Falkowitz, CEO of Area 1 Security.   The cybersecurity doom narrative has become so embellished that we have lost the nerve to take action. Cybersecurity needs an optimistic all-out assault on the problem, that starts by seeing cyber attacks for what they are, routine assembly line operations, neither extraordinary or insurmountable to defeat,  Falkowitz continued.Cyber campaigns linked to China have served for many years as a catalyst for national-security and cybersecurity experts to raise awareness and allocate resources to an issue historically relegated to the basements of organizations. After years of publicly censuring the PRC for cyber-based economic espionage, Washington and Beijing reached an agreement in 2015 to curtail the hacking of private companies for commercial gain.   Our report is not the first to expose a specific cyber campaign, nor will it have a direct impact on deterring the actors responsible. But it does show three consistent facts about cyber campaigns that make them unremarkable,  said Blake Darche, Chief Security Officer of Area 1 Security.  1. Phishing remains the dominant method through which cyber actors gain access into computer networks 9 out of 10 times. 2. Cyber attacks are more assembly line than individual snowflakes. Very little about this or any other cyberattack is cutting edge computer science 3. Cyber actors continually use their imagination to find the weakest links in the digital chain, as we show here in attacking the MFA of Cyprus to gain access to the entire European Union diplomatic communications network. As 2018 comes to a close, tensions between the two countries over hacking allegations are once again on the rise.

GARDNER SENDS BIPARTISAN LETTER CALLING FOR RESPONSE TO ALLEGATIONS OF CHINESE GOVERNMENT ELECTION INTERFERENCEStates News ServiceDecember 18, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 1156 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, D.C. BodyThe following information was released by Colorado Senator Cory Gardner:Senator Cory Gardner (R-CO), Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific, and the International Cybersecurity Policy, sent a letter with a group of bipartisan Senators to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other national security leaders in the Trump Administration expressing concern about continued attempts by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to undermine democracy. Specifically, the letter encourages the Administration to work closely with Taiwan to investigate the allegations of interference and respond if deemed necessary."CCP attempts to erode democratic processes and norms around the world threaten U.S. partnerships and prosperity," the Senators wrote . "Allegations such as those surrounding Taiwan's recent elections must therefore be pursued with seriousness and urgency....We write to express our support for efforts to counter interference of this nature and to state unequivocally that we stand shoulder to shoulder with democracies fighting attempts to undermine their sovereignty and freedom. We encourage your departments to do all you can to support Taiwan in investigating these allegations and taking necessary action in response."It is not our intent, nor our role, to question the veracity or fairness of the electoral outcome. Rather, in an era of growing authoritarian interference, we believe such allegations must be taken seriously if free societies are to continue to thrive. If true, CCP interference in Taiwan's elections would be deeply concerning not only for Taiwan's future, but also for fellow democracies around the world where the CCP may choose to interfere."Gardner has prioritized the U.S.-Taiwan relationship during this time in the Senate, including enacting legislation into law, conducting three official visits to Taiwan, and frequent high-level meetings with Taiwan's leadership, including most recently meeting President Tsai Ing-Wen during her transit through the United States in August 2018. In the 114th Congress, Gardner authored legislation to require the Department of State to develop a strategy to include Taiwan as an observer in INTERPOL, which was signed into law by President Obama in March 2016. In the 115th Congress, he introduced the Taiwan Security Act with Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR) in July 2017, a bill that would enhance the security relationship between our two nations. In 2018, he worked with his Subcommittee ranking member Senator Edward Markey (D-MA) to introduce the Taiwan International Participation Act of 2018 (TIPA), a bill aiming to ensure Taiwan's participation in appropriate international organizations, as well as the Taiwan Allies International Protection and Enhancement Initiative (TAIPEI) ACT legislation requiring the U.S. government to engage with nations around the world to maintain and grow ties with Taiwan.Senator Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL), Chris Coons (D-DE), Michael Bennet (D-CO), and Ted Cruz (R-TX) also joined the letter.NOTE: View the letter here.The letter reads in fullDear Secretaries Pompeo and Mnuchin, Directors Coats and Wray:We write with concern about allegations that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) interfered in Taiwan's recent elections.

We appreciate the actions your departments are already taking to address CCP foreign interference. We encourage you to work closely with Taiwan authorities to thoroughly investigate these allegations and, if necessary, take swift action to deter future CCP interference in elections in Taiwan or elsewhere across the globe.In the lead-up to Taiwan's local elections on November 24, 2018, Taiwan authorities and independent observers alleged that the CCP used illegal funds and disinformation to influence the election results in favor of the CCP's strategic interests. It is not our intent, nor our role, to question the veracity or fairness of the electoral outcome.

If true, CCP interference in Taiwan's elections would be deeply concerning not only for Taiwan's future, but also for fellow democracies around the world where the CCP may choose to interfere.Taiwan authorities' statements suggest that illegal campaign contributions to pro-Beijing political candidates were one of the primary tools of alleged CCP interference. In October, Taiwan authorities announced that they were investigating 33 cases of alleged funding from China to political campaigns in Taiwan. If true, the donations would be in violation of Taiwan's Political Donations Act and the Act Governing Relations Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area.

INTERVIEW OF AMBASSADOR HUANG XINGYUAN ON CYPRUS MAIL AND POLITISStates News ServiceOctober 9, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 2528 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: BEIJING, China BodyThe following information was released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China:From Chinese Embassy in CyprusOn September 30, 2018, Cyprus Mail and Politis published an interview of Ambassador Huang Xingyuan by Dr. Andrestinos Papadopoulos, former Ambassador of Cyprus. The full text is as follows:1. China has become the fastest growing economy in the world. What reforms are taking place in the economic, political, cultural, social and environmental fields?A: In recent years, against the background of sluggish global economic recovery, frequent outbreaks of regional conflicts and disturbances and intensifying global issues, the Chinese Government has introduced more than 1,500 reform measures, bringing in breakthroughs in reforms of important areas and key sectors. China's average annual GDP growth rate stands at 7%, our economic aggregate ranks second in the world, and the average contribution rate to world economic growth exceeds 30%, making China a driver and stabilizer for the global economy. At present, the Chinese Government is making efforts to implement the following reform measures:At the economic front, China will deepen supply-side structural reform, focus on the development of the real economy, and promote further integration of the Internet, big data, artificial intelligence with the real economy. We will foster a culture of innovation, encourage more entities to innovate and start businesses, and strengthen the creation, protection, and application of intellectual property. We will pursue a rural vitalization strategy, establish industrial, production and business operation systems for modern agriculture, and improve the systems for supporting and protecting agriculture. We will implement coordinated regional development strategy, speed up the development of old revolutionary base areas, areas with large ethnic minority populations, border and poor areas. We will further reform state-owned enterprises, introduce a negative list for market access nationwide, pursue the Belt and Road Initiative as a priority, promote high-standard liberalization and facilitation of trade and investment, significantly ease market access, further open up the service sector, and protect the legitimate rights and interests of foreign investors.At the political front, we will improve the way the Communist Party of China exercises leadership and governance to ensure that it leads the people in effectively governing the country. We will expand the people's orderly political participation to see that they engage in democratic elections, consultations, decision-making, management, and oversight in accordance with law. We will strengthen legal protection for human rights to ensure that the people enjoy extensive rights and freedoms as prescribed by law. We will build a rule of law government, promote law-based government administration, and see that law is enforced in a strict, procedure-based, impartial and non-abusive way. The government will transform its functions, further streamline administration and delegate powers, develop new ways of regulation and supervision, and strengthen its credibility and administrative capacity to be better service-oriented to satisfy the needs of the people.At the cultural front, China will improve public cultural service system, carry out public-interest cultural programs, and launch more popular cultural activities. We will strengthen the protection and utilization of cultural relics to better preserve our cultural heritage. We will carry out extensive Fitness-for-All programs, step up efforts to build China into a country strong on sports, and make good preparations for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic Games and Paralympic Games. We will strengthen people-to-people and cultural exchanges with other countries, better engage in crosscultural dialogues so as to present a true, multi-dimensional and panoramic view of China.In the social sector, we will give priority to education, to see that each and every child has fair access to good education. We will pursue a proactive employment policy, increase employment rate and create better quality jobs with higher incomes. We will improve our basic pension schemes for urban employees and for rural and non-working urban residents,the unified systems of basic medical insurance and serious disease insurance for rural and non-working urban residents, and unemployment insurance and work-related injury insurance. We will establish a unified national platform for social security public services, promote the coordinated development of social assistance systems for urban and rural residents, and improve the subsistence allowances system. We will continue to implement targeted poverty reduction and alleviation measures to ensure that all rural residents living below the current poverty line have been lifted out of poverty by year 2020.At the environment front, China will spur the development of energy-saving and environment-friendly industries as well as clean production and clean energy industries,with an aim to build an energy sector that is clean, low-carbon, safe and efficient. We will encourage conservation across the board and promote recycling and a simple, moderate, green and low-carbon life style. We will enhance the protection of ecosystems, promote afforestation, take comprehensive steps to control desertification, stony deserts and soil erosion, rigorously protect farmland,continue our campaign to prevent and control air and water pollution to solve prominent environmental problems. We will also actively take part in global environmental governance and fulfill our commitments on emission reduction.2. Over the years, our bilateral relations have reached remarkable standards. Can you give us an overall assessment of these relations and how do you see them expanding?A: In recent years, in spite of tremendous changes internationally, the friendly relations between China and Cyprus remain unchanged. Our political mutual trust deepens with continuous bilateral high-level exchanges. Since I assumed post in August 2016,Cyprus' President of the Parliament Dimitris Syllouris, Minister of Education and Culture Costas Cadiz, Minister of Justice Ionas Nicolaou, and Minister of Transportation and Engineering Marios Demetriades have visited China with fruitful results. Our two countries have signed important cooperation agreements on mutual recognition of academic degrees and qualifications as well as extradition treaties.China and Cyprus understand and support each other on issues of core interests of the other side. "One China, One Cyprus" has become a shared position of China and Cyprus. China appreciates the valuable support given by Cyprus on issues regarding Taiwan, Tibet, Xinjiang and human rights. China will continue to support and facilitate the reunification of Cyprus at an early date.China-Cyprus economic and trade relations have grown steadily. Our bilateral trade has seen growth. Chinese investors are enthusiastic about investing in Cyprus. There has been a rapid increase in the number of Chinese property buyers in Cyprus. Chinese companies have also had many successes in local telecommunications, aviation, new energy and tourism industries. Cyprus is actively involved in the Belt and Road Initiative. A number of Cypriot companies have signed up for the first China International Import Expo to be held in Shanghai in November this year to attract Chinese counterparts to participate in local infrastructure, port shipping and tourism facilty building projects.China-Cyprus cultural exchange have flourished. The number of mutal visits reached a record high exceeding 10,000 in 2017. Cultural events organized by China, including art performances, Chinese Cultural Festival in Limassol, Night of Chinese Culture in Paphos and the Chinese Film Festival have been widely popular in Cyprus. This September, the Chinese Embassy will host a series of cultural activities such as the Chinese Cultural Festival, Maritime Silk Road Oil Painting Exhibition, "China 2017" Photo Exhibition and the Night of Chinese Culture in Paphos. We look forward to celebrating on these occasions with our Cypriot friends.The Belt and Road Intiative proposed by China has gained close attention and postive responses across Cyprus. China is now vigorously promoting the synergy between the Belt and Road Intiative and development strategies of Europe by linking China's international production capacity cooperation with investment plans of Europe. As Cyprus steps up its economic structural reform, tourism campaign,offshore oil and gas exploration, and opens up the gaming industry and revitalizes infrastructure building,China-Cyprus cooperation heralds great potential in the fields of energy, tourism, shipping, communications and electric power under the framework of the Belt and Road Intiative.I wish to work together with the people of China and Cyprus to maintain the momentum of bilateral high-level exchanges,forge closer trade, cultural links and parnerships, and continue to strengthen cooperation in international affairs by supporting each other on issues of core interests and major concerns,with an aim to further uplift China-Cyprus relations.3. Can you tell us about the growing Chinese community in Cyprus? There are many private schools with Chinese children. From what I know some schools also teach some Chinese now: do they cooperate with the Embassy?A: Cyprus is strategically located at the crossroads between Europe, Asia and Africa with a booming economy, stable society and friendly people. As China-Cyprus relations deepen, Chinese citizens are growingly conscious of Cyprus' unique advantages and charms as the Pearl of the Mediterranean. We have seen an increasing number of Chinese coming to Cyprus for sight-seeing, investment and studies, which has given a boost to bilateral economic and trade cooperation as well as cultural and people-to-people exchange. Cyprus has also benefited in terms of economic growth and employment.As an EU member state, Cyprus has a safe social environment, high-quality educational resources and preferential policies, making it more budget-friendly than countries such as the United States or United Kingdom. Many private schools here have programs leading to universities in the UK and US, which have attracted Chinese students of different age groups and levels. In May 2017, China and Cyprus signed an agreement on the mutual recognition of higher education qualifications, providing more opportunities for Chinese and Cypriot students to study in quality institutes recognized by both sides. Many private schools have set up Chinese language courses to meet the needs of Chinese students and their families.As China-Cyprus cooperation enhances across the board,we have seen a greater demand of Cypriots in learning the Chinese language. In this light, a Confucius Institute was launched in the University of Cyprus in 2015 with the support of the two governments to actively promote Chinese language teaching and Chinese culture in Cyprus. With the support of the Ministry of Education and Culture of Cyprus and the Chinese Embassy in Cyprus, the Confucius Institute at the University of Cyprus will continue to promote Chinese language course in primary and secondary schools in Cyprus and provide mid and short term courses in Business Chinese, Practical Chinese Dialogues for Cypriots working in buiness, cartering,hospitality and tourism.4. As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China is playing a prominent role in world affairs. What are the goals of Chinese foreign policy and how this is influencing the Cyprus Problem?A: In the report of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in October last year, General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed that that China will work with other countries to jointly forge a new type of international relations and build a community of shared destiny. This is the goal of foreign policy with Chinese characteristics for a new era. Under the guidance of Xi Jinping thoughts on diplomacy, China will fully commit to the building of a community of shared destiny, promote the development of a fair and just global governance system. China will continue to follow the principle of achieving shared growth through discussion and collaboration in the building of the Belt and Road and open its doors even wider. We will work to build a framework for major country relations featuring overall stability and balanced development, forge friendship and partnership with our neighbors, enhance unity and cooperation with developing countries to promote exchange and mutual learning for common development.Durimg the just-concluded Beijing Summit of the China-Africa Cooperation Forum, China and African countries agreed to build a closer community of shared destiny. African countries actively supported and participated in the building of the "Belt and Road". The two sides also reiterated their commitment to multilateralism, resisting unilateral actions and support for the leading role of the United Nations.China will answer the call of the international community, adhere to the principle of achieving shared growth through discussion and collaboration in global governance, actively participate in the reform of the global governance system and political settlement of regional and international hot issues, and work with all parties towards more effective responses to global challenges. China will unswervingly safeguard its national sovereignty, security, and development interests,and remain committed to building world peace, driving global development and maintaining global order.In helping to settle various flashpoints, we follow a distinctly Chinese approach. There are things we do and do not do. Our approach is peaceful, justifiable and constructive. We call for political settlement of disputes through dialogue and negotiation, and firmly reject the use of force. We respect other countries' sovereignty and wishes, never meddle in their internal affairs or impose our own views on others. We do our best to be fair and objective and proceed from the merits of the matter. We firmly reject the pursuit of private ends.China's position has been consistent on the Cyprus Problem. China supports a fair and reasonable resolution of the Cyprus Problem based on relevant UN resolutions and all peace efforts towards this end. Despite the current difficulties in the negotiations, it is important to bear in mind that obstacles often exist as parties approach the last mile of the resolution of a historic problem. We believe that the doors to negotiations are still open and that the Cypriots have the will, wisdom and power to rise above the difficulties.As one of the five permanent countries of the UN Security Council, China encourages all parties to remain committed to the negotiation process, support the efforts of the UN and other parties, and continue to play a constructive role in maintaining stability in Cyprus and working for the resumption of negotiations between Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities.Load-Date: October 17, 2018End of Document

HOW ARE GOVERNMENTS ADOPTING AI?States News ServiceDecember 19, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 1279 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: LOS ANGELES, Calif. BodyThe following information was released by the USC Marshall School of Business:While the majority of today's media coverage focuses on AI adoption in the private sector, in this blogpost we examine how the public sector is adopting AI, specifically within federal, state, and city governments.byVivek SharmaIn our earlier blog post, "How are consumers adopting artificial intelligence?," we discussed different ways in which artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly integrating into consumers' daily lives. Businesses have taken notice, and according to IDC, worldwide spending on cognitive and AI systems will grow 54% in 2018 to $19 billion. Further, 40% of digital transformations are expected to use AI by 2019, and 75% of enterprise applications will use AI by 2021.The AI juggernaut is not limited to the private sector; several federal and state governments have already made AI integration a key priority. Earlier this year, the Chinese government announced a roadmap aimed at making China the global leader in AI by 2030. As part of the public-private AI partnership to accelerate AI development and commercialization, the Chinese government named four official national champions: Baidu, for autonomous driving; Alibaba, for improving urban life and smart transportation; Tencent, for computer vision for medical diagnosis; and iFlytek, for voice recognition and intelligence.Closer to home, the U.S. federal Investment in RandD for AI and related technologies has grown by 40% since 2015, with both general AI research and applied research in autonomous and unmanned systems designated as administration RandD priorities for 2019. At the U.S. state level, 58% of state CIOs named AI and machine learning the most impactful area for them in the next three to five years. In this blogpost, we will examine four ways in which federal, state, and city governments are adopting AI: infrastructure delivery, social and welfare services, national security, and law enforcement.Let's start with infrastructure delivery. Federal agencies are aggressively using AI to forecast and recover from natural disasters. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) used computer vision analysis of satellites images during the KÄlauea eruption in Hawaii this summer to determine which buildings had been damaged and whether people were evacuating ahead of the lava's approach. The National Center for Atmospheric Research has recently partnered with IBM Watson to forecast severe weather events more accurately, thus enabling warnings further in advance of events.While federal agencies have taken the lead, states and cities are not far behind. Maryland has upgraded traffic signals to respond to traffic conditions in real time, and predictions based on machine learning have reduced commute times by 1015%. Kansas City can now predict where potholes will form based on past trends, current weather data, and existing road conditions. Armed with this information, they can repave streets preemptively instead of waiting for potholes to occur. Additionally, Chattanooga is using smart grid technology to better manage power needs and mitigate outages during extreme weather.In social and welfare services, the most significant impact of AI is in education services, with AI investment in U.S. education expected to grow 48% by 2021. Georgia Tech used an AI chatbot to respond to student questions about a required online course (see also an earlier blogpost: "How do digital voice assistants work?"). Tacoma public schools recently partnered with Microsoft on a predictive analytics project to identify students with a high likelihood of dropping out, and they have seen improvement in graduation rates from 55% to 83%. In China, schools are piloting an "intelligent classroom behavior management system" that can monitor students' engagement and activity levels.State and city bodies are also using AI to address homelessness and deliver child welfare services. The Center for Innovation through Data Intelligence (CIDI) in the New York City mayor's office uses machine learning to cluster high-risk and formerly homeless individuals into various groups (e.g., those with frequent jail stays, consistent supportive housing, consistent subsidized housing, earlier homeless experience, later homeless experience, and minimal service use). Through this approach, the city can better understand the needs of each cluster and identify resource requirements accordingly. In Finland, the city of Espoo analyzes 280 different factors to predict when families will need child welfare services so that support can be offered before serious issues arise.Federal governments are using AI across a wide range of overt and covert national security objectives and in support of both public and private enterprises. Military drones and robot soldiers are already being used as the first line of attack, both in search and rescue as well as in assisting the military during combat. Intelligence agencies are reportedly supplementing spies with AI to gather information virtually, thus reducing risk to agents. Federal cybersecurity teams are using AI for intelligence gathering and active threat hunting to "deal with the new wave of sophisticated adversaries."To support critical infrastructure, such as financial institutions and utilities, the federal government has outlined a new cybersecurity policy and set up infrastructure to respond to virtual attacks. Given multiple instances of users' data breaches (see also: "Why do data breaches happen?"), the IRS is using AI solutions to help protect consumer information.AI is also being used in law enforcement. In the past, police would send patrols to areas where crimes had previously occurred. Using AI tools like PredPol and CrimeScan, they can now predict where crimes will happen and send patrols accordingly. Some cities have found AI is two times better at predicting crime than a human analyst. At crime scenes, police are increasingly using computer visionenabled identification technology (see also: "Why is facial recognition the new face of innovation?") tied in with body cameras to identify suspects in real time.With regard to mass social profiling, no other government has publicly used AI as extensively as China. The Chinese government has instituted a "social credit" system that will be fully implemented by 2020 to dynamically rank all citizens. The score will predict bad behavior, and people with low scores may be unable to purchase train or plane tickets, have their internet speeds throttled, be barred from schools or employment, or be publicly called out as bad citizens.For all the direct and indirect benefits, AI also comes with challenges. As in the case of private enterprises, governments must address two key issues in using AIpreventing existing bias in historical data from negatively impacting citizens (especially in military and criminal use cases) and ensuring that users' privacy is not violated while tracking, collecting, and analyzing their data.The good news is that governments already have the basic rules and guidelines in place for protections like privacy, cybersecurity, and health and safety practices. The federal government should use these as a starting point to shape the future of AI, hopefully through a "legislation not regulation" approach. When it comes to protecting citizens' rights, expecting private sectors and local governments to self-regulate is not an approach that can work.We would like to sincerely thank Colleen Monaco, Director of eCommerce @Disney and a guest lecturer at USC Marshall School of Business, for generously donating her time and insights to this blogpost.Load-Date: December 20, 2018End of Document

Origin Announces Strategic Cooperation Agreement with Longhan Investment Management in Integrated Saline-Alkaline Land Reclamation TechnologyPR NewswireOctober 17, 2018 Wednesday 10:00 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1183 wordsDateline: BEIJING, Oct. 17, 2018 BodyPR Newswire Origin Agritech Ltd. (NASDAQ: SEED) (the "Company" or "Origin"), an agriculture technology and rural e-commerce company, today announced that the Company has entered into a strategic cooperation agreement with Longhan Investment Management Co., Ltd. ("Longhan") pursuant to which both companies will work together to start the commercialization of Integrated Saline-Alkaline Land Reclamation ("ISALR") technology in 2019, both in China and globally, and will integrate Longhan's technologies with Origin's seed technologies and agricultural business platform.Longhan is an investment management company and operating platform that focuses on government-supported major projects in agricultural development and food security. With the Belt and Road initiative of the Chinese government, Longhan has developed and demonstrated its molecular biology technologies for seed treatment and soil treatment. Longhan has successfully tested its technologies on cotton in The Republic of Uzbekistan and on various crops, including corn, soybean, cotton, rice and vegetables, across several Chinese provinces with different degrees of saline-alkaline soil. The yield improvement for different crops ranges from 10-15% in medium level saline-alkaline land and over 15% for heavy saline-alkaline soil.China has about 1.5 billion mu (100 million hectare) of saline-alkaline lands, while globally there is about 15 billion mu (1 billion hectare). Reclamation of these lands has become more and more critical to address the growing food demand in China and around the world. The escalation of the current U.S.-China trade dispute has intensified the Chinese government's attention towards food security. The technologies for expanding plantable acreage through the reclamation of saline-alkaline lands are now well supported by the Chinese government. China currently imports overs 80% of the nation's soybean demands. The ISALR technology will significantly increase the plantable acreage for corn and soybean and could thus dramatically alleviate China's dependence on imported soybeans.    "We are impressed by Longhan's technologies for seed and soil treatment and their initiative to work with the Chinese government to develop large reclamation projects for saline and alkaline soil. The strategic direction set out by Longhan complements well with Origin's seed biotechnology and seed breading technology," said Dr. Gengchen Han, Executive Chairman of Origin Agritech. Furthermore, large land reclamation projects will generate significant agricultural input demands, including seeds, fertilizer and agricultural chemicals, which could be better served with Origin's supply chain established by the Origin e-Commune Network announced previously."We're very pleased to work with Origin Agritech, one of the premier brands for the agricultural industry in China. Origin's strong seed technologies and its commercial experience could jump start our commercialization initiative for our state-of-art molecular biology technologies. We look forward to our joint program and believe that we could see financial returns even at the onset of this cooperation in 2019, especially with the support of the Chinese government," said Mr. Shuangcheng Zhou, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Longhan.About Origin Agritech LimitedOrigin Agritech Limited, founded in 1997 and headquartered in Zhong-Guan-Cun (ZGC) Life Science Park in Beijing, is China'sleading agricultural technology and a rural social e-commerce company, expanding in mid-2018 from crop seed breeding and genetic improvement business to be a leading technology developer in new rural e-commerce platform and Blockchain technologies.

Chinese broadens its propaganda drive to heartland AmericaAssociated Press State & LocalOctober 20, 2018 Saturday 1:22 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 831 wordsByline: By JOSH FUNK, AP Business WriterDateline: OMAHA, Neb. BodyOMAHA, Neb. (AP) - China's propaganda machine has taken aim at American soybean farmers as part of its high-stakes trade war with the Trump administration.The publication last month of a four-page advertising section in the Des Moines Register opened a new battle line in China's effort to break the administration's resolve. U.S. farmers are a key political constituency for Trump, and Beijing has imposed tariffs on American soybeans as retaliation for Trump's tariffs on hundreds of billions in Chinese imports.China regularly disseminates propaganda in the West through its China Daily newspaper to try to influence public opinion. But the advertorial in the Register was unusual for deploying not a national publication in New York or Washington but a newspaper in the farm state of Iowa."It's the first time I've ever seen anything like this in a heartland city," said Matt Schrader, who edits the China Brief newsletter for the Jamestown Foundation, a Washington research institute that monitors China's actions.The Iowa newspaper section was explicitly labeled a product of China Daily, China's official English language newspaper. The articles were clearly geared to try to soften the image of China and its president, Xi Jinping. With headlines ranging from "Dispute: Fruit of a president's folly" and "Book tells of Xi's fun days in Iowa" to Kung Fu skill helps light up life path" and "China seeks pacts on robotics," the message was a not-very-subtle one about the friendly way Beijing wants to be seen in the farm belt.Ken Doctor, a longtime media analyst, noted that newspapers have been struggling to replace revenue lost from declining subscriptions and print advertisements moving online. He suggested that when publications run propaganda like the "China Watch" sections, they should take care to be fully explicit about the source."I'd like to see newspapers that run this include an editor's note to be transparent about what this is," said Doctor, who runs the Newsonomics website.Many experts say they doubt the propaganda drive in the United States will likely succeed. Chinese officials are used to operating at home, where the central government controls all major media outlets."U.S. farmers and manufacturers are smart enough to understand their self-interest," said Elizabeth Economy of the Council on Foreign Relations. "They don't need a Chinese newspaper insert to tell them how to think about the relationship between tariffs and their exports to China."Stanley Chao, a business consultant who has written a book called "Selling to China," said it's not entirely surprising that China would try to take its trade arguments directly to American farmers, whose crops have been hit by Beijing's retaliatory tariffs."This is the norm for the Chinese propaganda machine," Chao said.Chao noted that when a Chinese dissident won the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize - chosen by the Norwegian Nobel Committee and an embarrassment for Beijing - China responded by placing propaganda ads in Scandinavian newspapers.In addition to its connection to the tariffs China imposed on American soybeans and other crops, Iowa is also home to Terry Branstad, a former governor of the state who is now the U.S. ambassador to Beijing. And in the past, President Xi has visited Iowa, whose caucuses serve as the first contest in every presidential election year.Trump tweeted a photo of the "China Watch" edition that ran in the Register, calling it propaganda and asserting that Beijing was trying to interfere in U.S. elections.Chinese officials defended the advertising section and said it didn't violate any U.S. laws. Geng Shuang, a spokesman for the foreign ministry, said the Chinese government doesn't interfere in other countries' internal affairs or elections."I think there has been a long-standing effort to influence Americans across the United States," said Sarah Cook, a research analyst with the Freedom House watchdog group. "Just this particular form of influence - the China Watch paid supplement - may only be appearing in places like Iowa now."Other countries, like Saudi Arabia and Taiwan, typically hire public relations firms and place ads to try to improve their images, in contrast to China's more direct approach of placing ads in newspapers or posting videos online. The 2016 elections brought attention to foreign influence after U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russia had meddled in the elections. Federal prosecutors have charged a Russian firm with interfering through bogus Facebook posts.It's not yet clear whether or how much Beijing will continue to try to shape public sentiment in the farm belt states."I imagine we will see some additional efforts by the Chinese government to directly influence public opinion in the heartland," said Walter Hutchens, a global business professor at the University of Redlands in California. "However, it seems more likely their economic muscle, rather than their clumsy PR efforts, will have actual impact."Load-Date: October 21, 2018End of Document

CHINA 'BUYING' POSITIVE NEWS COVERAGE FROM FOREIGN JOURNALISTS: REPORTStates News ServiceNovember 27, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 782 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:The Chinese government is inviting foreign journalists to Beijing on international relations fellowships, on the understanding that they write "positive stories" about China, an online newspaper in India reported.The Chinese foreign ministry has been running the 10-month programs for journalists from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and more than a dozen countries from Southeast Asia and Africa since 2016, The Print news website reported."They have been given the red-carpet treatment: Apartments in one of Beijing's plush residences ... and free tours twice every month to different Chinese provinces," the article said.The initiative follows a call from Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2016 for journalists to "tell China's story better" to the rest of the world, it said.Participants are also given language classes, access to Chinese government officials and ministries, and degrees in international relations from a Chinese university, the paper said.The journalists carry accreditation from regional press centers run by the Chinese government, rather than from their own organizations, but some news organizations, including the Indo-Asian New Service (IANS), Jansatta, and The Indian Express, have run stories that were written as part of the programs.Journalists who take part in the programs travel everywhere with a government "minder" and are therefore unable to cover more "sensitive" stories, The Print reported.It quoted The Indian Express as saying that it had paid its participating journalists full salaries on top of a Chinese government stipend, and was satisfied with their coverage."There are no terms or conditions, no 'caution' or advisory imposed on what they report from there," it said.According to Cedric Alviani, East Asia director for the Paris-based press freedom group Reporters Without Borders (RSF), China actually started buying foreign journalists before 2016, with attempts to influence international media reporting dating back to 2011."The Chinese authorities are constantly trying and influencing journalists' narratives about China," Alviani told RFA on Monday."Inviting these journalists to go China, where everyone is very nice to them, is one way to make friends with journalists and to train up supporters," he said.Buying shares of media companiesBut the government has other ways of influence overseas media coverage, Alviani said."The Chinese government and Chinese companies have been aggressively buying shares in foreign media organizations in the past year," Alviani said.Andrew Nathan, professor of political science at Columbia, said China has also boosted its influence overseas by providing free news."They also have a lot of influence in the Chinese media in Africa," Nathan said. "Take, for example, Xinhua News Agency. More than 90 percent of its news is fairly objective, and contains valuable information, but about 10 percent of it is information that has a pro-China bias.""Xinhua is huge in Africa, because African news organizations don't have much money, so Xinhua supplies a lot of stories to them free of charge," he said. "So, of course, they are going to use Xinhua copy."Xinhua News Agency is directly controlled by the ruling Chinese Communist Party and answers to the country's cabinet, the State Council, while CGTN is the English-language network of Beijing-based state broadcaster CCTV, under the direct control of the ruling party's Central Propaganda Department.In September, the U.S. Justice Department demanded that Xinhua and state-owned international broadcaster CGTN register as foreign agents, which could limit their access in Washington, according to media reports at the time.The power of propagandaIn March, the administration of President Xi Jinping strengthened its hold on all forms of public expression, enlarging its powerful propaganda department to absorb agencies responsible for regulating the mass media, as the president himself embarked on an unlimited and controversial term in office.'The new leadership structure was introduced to "strengthen the party's centralized and unified leadership in public opinion work by the media," the party's central committee said in a directive at the time."After this adjustment, the main responsibility of the Central Propaganda Department will be to implement the party's propaganda guidelines," it said, adding that the department will also formulate and implement media and publication policy and manage the sectors.The country's international broadcasters will be tasked with "propagating the party's theories, directions, principles and policies" as well as "telling good China stories," it said.Load-Date: November 27, 2018End of Document

Meng Wanzhou regains his freedom; EU is wrongCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 15, 2018 SaturdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1014 wordsBody The relationship between the United States and China seemed to improve during the G20 Summit in Argentina, where President Trump announced that he had reached an important agreement with President Xi Jinping.  Later an ominous act occurred: the US authorities asked Canada to arrest the Vice President of Finance of one of the largest technology companies in China for alleged violation of US export controls.  Meng Wanzhou is not only an important leader in Huawei, manufacturer of phones and other devices, it is also the daughter of the founder and president of the company. His arrest would hypothetically amount to the arrest of Steve Jobs' daughter; On Tuesday he regained his freedom after paying bail.  National Security Advisor, John Bolton, said he was informed of the detention by the Justice Department, but did not tell the president who was in Argentina. That no one in the White House has considered the implications of the arrest during the tenuous commercial truce between China and the United States is, in itself, quite surprising.  The case against Huawei and its executives may be legitimate according to US law, but it does not exempt it from being a frightening political mistake.  Perhaps Huawei used US-made components in the equipment it sold to Iran, in violation of US sanctions, but even in less complex cases, there is always the discretion of the prosecutor.  If the United States wants to respond to China's rise to global prominence, it could hardly have chosen a more foolish tactic.  Social responsability?  Huawei is not exactly a noble avatar of social responsibility. Since 2016, the Department of Commerce has been investigating Huawei in its exports to Iran and North Korea. In the spring of 2017, the Treasury Department opened its own investigation. However, even before that, Huawei operated outside of legality. In 2003, Cisco sued him for copying part of the code used in its routers (Huawei admitted it before the trial and promised to stop).  In 2012, a committee of the House of Representatives called the company a potential threat to US national security because of its links to the Chinese government, its propensity for intellectual property theft and its ability to embed spyware in its phones.  However, the harassment against Huawei is a ridiculous exaggeration, based on the assumption that the United States can dictate how foreign competitors do business.  If Huawei has ties to the Chinese Communist Party, it would be worth reflecting if they are more dangerous than the ties of Pentagon contractors, such as Boeing and Lockheed.  More importantly, global supply chains are deeply interconnected and affect multiple countries and numerous companies. Samsung, for example, is the second largest mobile phone provider in Iran, behind Huawei, while Swedish telecoms company Ericsson has been selling equipment to Iran even under sanctions.  Arresting the number two executive of one of the largest technology companies in the world is an ineffective way to achieve political objectives, and a very effective way to complicate the negotiations that are more important. What is a threat to the United States is the 5G technology that Huawei has developed.  Commercial war  Last MondayThe government of Japan issued instructions to ban government contracts with Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE, while the three main telecom operators in the country plan to do the same.  The news represents a new setback for the Chinese company Huawei after its financial vice president was arrested in Canada on the orders of the US government for allegedly evading US sanctions against Iran.  Earlier this year, the United States Congress passed a law banning government offices and contractors from using Huawei and ZTE phones. Washington had given Tokyo information about the security risks involved in the use of equipment manufactured in China.  Australia and New Zealand have also closed the doors to Huawei preventing it from deploying fifth generation (5G) networks due to concerns about its possible links with the Chinese government.  Nikkei reported that the Japanese decision affects personal computers, servers and telecommunications equipment by the government due to the growing concern that possible viruses embedded in the computers could cause system failures or hack confidential information, including military operations, by the government. from China.  However, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the new rules did not target any particular company.  "To ensure cybersecurity, we are aware that it is extremely important to ensure that we will not buy equipment with malign functions," he said at a press conference on Monday.  Japan's relations with China have improved in recent years, proof of which was Abe's visit to China last October promising a "new historical direction" in the relationship.  However, the crisis that triggered the Huawei case could crack the bilateral relationship.  In response to the announcement, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said that Chinese investment in Japan is part of a "win-win" strategy, and warned that "discriminatory treatment" against Chinese companies will bring consequences.  Do the operators join?  Kyodo News reported that the three major Japanese telecom operators, NTT Docomo, KDDI and SoftBank, plan to follow the government's guidelines by not using equipment from the two Chinese companies; However, the three companies told the Reuters news agency that they had not yet made any decision on the matter.  Although Docomo and KDDI use very little or no equipment from the two Chinese companies, SoftBank does use Huawei equipment in its network; its shares fell 3.5 percent on Monday due to the difficulties of replacing equipment.  Huawei has two research and development centers in Japan; it attracts Japanese graduates by offering them big salaries, and buys Japan's technical equipment for more than 4,300 million dollars, Nikkei reported, arguing that Japan will not be immune to Huawei's ills.  Indeed, it is a serious mistake to have arrested Meng Wanzhou. Load-Date: December 15, 2018End of Document

In China, your car could be talking to the governmentAssociated Press InternationalNovember 30, 2018 Friday 1:30 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; Only on APLength: 2235 wordsByline: By ERIKA KINETZ, Associated PressDateline: SHANGHAI BodySHANGHAI (AP) - When Shan Junhua bought his white Tesla Model X, he knew it was a fast, beautiful car. What he didn't know is that Tesla constantly sends information about the precise location of his car to the Chinese government.Tesla is not alone. China has called upon all electric vehicle manufacturers in China to make the same kind of reports - potentially adding to the rich kit of surveillance tools available to the Chinese government as President Xi Jinping steps up the use of technology to track Chinese citizens."I didn't know this," said Shan. "Tesla could have it, but why do they transmit it to the government? Because this is about privacy."More than 200 manufacturers, including Tesla, Volkswagen, BMW, Daimler, Ford, General Motors, Nissan, Mitsubishi and U.S.-listed electric vehicle start-up NIO, transmit position information and dozens of other data points to government-backed monitoring centers, The Associated Press has found. Generally, it happens without car owners' knowledge.The automakers say they are merely complying with local laws, which apply only to alternative energy vehicles. Chinese officials say the data is used for analytics to improve public safety, facilitate industrial development and infrastructure planning, and to prevent fraud in subsidy programs.But other countries that are major markets for electronic vehicles - the United States, Japan, across Europe - do not collect this kind of real-time data.And critics say the information collected in China is beyond what is needed to meet the country's stated goals. It could be used not only to undermine foreign carmakers' competitive position, but also for surveillance - particularly in China, where there are few protections on personal privacy. Under the leadership of Xi Jinping, China has unleashed a war on dissent, marshalling big data and artificial intelligence to create a more perfect kind of policing, capable of predicting and eliminating perceived threats to the stability of the ruling Communist Party.There is also concern about the precedent these rules set for sharing data from next-generation connected cars, which may soon transmit even more personal information."You're learning a lot about people's day-to-day activities and that becomes part of what I call ubiquitous surveillance, where pretty much everything that you do is being recorded and saved and potentially can be used in order to affect your life and your freedom," said Michael Chertoff, who served as Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security under President George W. Bush and recently wrote a book called "Exploding Data."Chertoff said global automakers should be asking themselves tough questions. "If what you're doing is giving a government of a more authoritarian country the tools to have massive surveillance, I think then companies have to ask themselves, 'Is this really something we want to do in terms of our corporate values, even if it means otherwise forgoing that market?'"___A BIGGER BROTHER?The Shanghai Electric Vehicle Public Data Collecting, Monitoring and Research Center sits in a grey tower in suburban Jiading district. One floor up from the cafeteria, a wall-sized screen glows with dots, each representing a single vehicle coursing along Shanghai's roads to create a massive real-time map that could reveal where people live, shop, work, and worship.Click a dot at random, and up pops a window with a number that identifies each individual vehicle, along with its make and model, mileage and battery charge.All told, the screen exhibits data from over 222,000 vehicles in Shanghai, the vast majority of them passenger cars."We can provide a lot of data from consumers to the government to help them improve policy and planning," said Ding Xiaohua, deputy director of the center, a non-profit that is tightly aligned with and funded by the government.According to national specifications published in 2016, electric vehicles in China transmit data from the car's sensors back to the manufacturer. From there, automakers send at least 61 data points, including location and details about battery and engine function to local centers like the one Ding oversees in Shanghai.Data also flows to a national monitoring center for new energy vehicles run by the Beijing Institute of Technology, which pulls information from more than 1.1 million vehicles across the country, according to the National Big Data Alliance of New Energy Vehicles. The national monitoring center declined to respond to questions.Those numbers are about to get much bigger. Though electric vehicle sales accounted for just 2.6 percent of the total last year, policymakers have said they'd like new energy vehicles to account for 20 percent of total sales by 2025. Starting next year, all automakers in China must meet production minimums for new energy vehicles, part of Beijing's aggressive effort to reduce dependence on foreign energy sources and place itself at the forefront of a growing global industry.The Chinese government has shown its interest in tracking vehicles."The government wants to know what people are up to at all times and react in the quickest way possible," said Maya Wang, a senior China researcher for Human Rights Watch. "There is zero protection against state surveillance.""Tracking vehicles is one of the main focuses of their mass surveillance," she added.Last year, authorities in Xinjiang, a restive region in western China that has become a laboratory for China's surveillance state, ordered residents to install GPS devices so their vehicles could be tracked, according to official media. This summer the Ministry of Public Security, a police agency, began to roll out a system to track vehicles using windshield radio frequency chips that can identify cars as they pass roadside reading devices.Ding insisted that the electric vehicle monitoring program is not designed to facilitate state surveillance, though he said data could be shared with government public security organs, if a formal request is made. The center said it has not shared information with police, prosecutors or courts, but has used the data to assist a government investigation of a vehicle fire.There is a privacy firewall built into the system. The monitoring center has each car's unique vehicle identification number, but to link that number with the personal details of the car owner, it must go through the automaker - a step it has taken in the past. Chinese law enforcement can also independently link the vehicle identification number with the car owner's personal information."To speak bluntly, the government doesn't need to surveil through a platform like ours," Ding said. He said he believed the security forces "must have their own ways to monitor suspects," as other governments do.___DATA ON WHEELSMany vehicles in the U.S., Europe and Japan transmit position information back to automakers, who feed it to car-tracking apps, maps that pinpoint nearby amenities and emergency services providers. But the data stops there. Government or law enforcement agencies would generally only be able to access personal vehicle data in the context of a specific criminal investigation and in the U.S. would typically need a court order, lawyers said.Automakers initially resisted sharing information with the Shanghai monitoring center; then the government made transmitting data a prerequisite for getting incentives."The automakers consider the data a precious resource," said a government consultant who helped evaluate the policy and spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive issues. "They gave you dozens of reasons why they can't give you the data. They give you dozens of excuses. Then we offer the incentives. Then they want to give us the data because it's part of their profit."There was concern that data pulled from electric vehicles might reveal proprietary information about, for example, how hybrids switch between gas and battery power, and eventually set automakers up for commercial competition with a Chinese government entity. As cars become more connected, carmakers are looking to tap new revenue streams built on data - a market McKinsey estimated could be worth $750 billion by 2030.Ding said a Tesla executive came to Shanghai and grilled him about the rules. "The first question is who are you, the second question is why you collect this data, and the third question is how to protect the privacy of the users," Ding said.Tesla declined to comment.Ding said confidentiality agreements bar the data center from sharing proprietary information.Still, he is open about his commercial ambition. He'd like to wean the center from government funding and make money from the data, without infringing on anyone's privacy or intellectual property. "We have done some explorations," he said. "But there is still a distance from truly monetizing it."___CHINA'S EDGEThe Chinese government's ability to grab data as it flows from cars gives its academics and policymakers an edge over competing nations. China tends to view technology development as a key competitive resource. Though global automakers have received billions in incentives and subsidies from U.S., European and Japanese governments, they are contributing data to the Chinese government that ultimately serves Beijing's strategic interests.In 2011, the U.S. Department of Energy's Idaho National Laboratory began a nationwide study of how electric vehicle owners drive and charge their cars. Participants gave explicit written consent to allow the government laboratory to collect their data, and even then it wasn't delivered in real time, said John Smart, who leads the center's advanced vehicles group. Instead, the team got historical data on a weekly basis. Cars were assigned random numbers for the study, so owners remained anonymous.Nothing of its kind has been done since in the U.S., Smart said."The cost is very high to collect data," he explained. "The government hasn't felt the need to provide that money and the manufacturers making their own investments are choosing to keep the findings to themselves for proprietary reasons."When it was published, in 2015, the Idaho National Laboratory's study was the largest ever done. All told, bundled with some additional data, the study helped Idaho researchers analyze 21,600 electric vehicles over 158 million driving miles (254 million kilometers).In the same amount of time it took Idaho researchers to publish their study, the Shanghai Electric Vehicle Public Data Collecting, Monitoring and Research Center began gathering real-time information from more than 222,000 vehicles and amassed over 4.7 billion miles (7.6 billion kilometers) of driving history."As a researcher, I think that data set could be used to answer hundreds of questions," Smart said.

In China, your car could be talking to the governmentAssociated Press Financial WireNovember 30, 2018 Friday 1:30 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWS; Only on APLength: 2235 wordsByline: By ERIKA KINETZ, Associated PressDateline: SHANGHAI BodySHANGHAI (AP) - When Shan Junhua bought his white Tesla Model X, he knew it was a fast, beautiful car. What he didn't know is that Tesla constantly sends information about the precise location of his car to the Chinese government.Tesla is not alone. China has called upon all electric vehicle manufacturers in China to make the same kind of reports - potentially adding to the rich kit of surveillance tools available to the Chinese government as President Xi Jinping steps up the use of technology to track Chinese citizens."I didn't know this," said Shan. "Tesla could have it, but why do they transmit it to the government? Because this is about privacy."More than 200 manufacturers, including Tesla, Volkswagen, BMW, Daimler, Ford, General Motors, Nissan, Mitsubishi and U.S.-listed electric vehicle start-up NIO, transmit position information and dozens of other data points to government-backed monitoring centers, The Associated Press has found. Generally, it happens without car owners' knowledge.The automakers say they are merely complying with local laws, which apply only to alternative energy vehicles. Chinese officials say the data is used for analytics to improve public safety, facilitate industrial development and infrastructure planning, and to prevent fraud in subsidy programs.But other countries that are major markets for electronic vehicles - the United States, Japan, across Europe - do not collect this kind of real-time data.And critics say the information collected in China is beyond what is needed to meet the country's stated goals. It could be used not only to undermine foreign carmakers' competitive position, but also for surveillance - particularly in China, where there are few protections on personal privacy. Under the leadership of Xi Jinping, China has unleashed a war on dissent, marshalling big data and artificial intelligence to create a more perfect kind of policing, capable of predicting and eliminating perceived threats to the stability of the ruling Communist Party.There is also concern about the precedent these rules set for sharing data from next-generation connected cars, which may soon transmit even more personal information."You're learning a lot about people's day-to-day activities and that becomes part of what I call ubiquitous surveillance, where pretty much everything that you do is being recorded and saved and potentially can be used in order to affect your life and your freedom," said Michael Chertoff, who served as Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security under President George W. Bush and recently wrote a book called "Exploding Data."Chertoff said global automakers should be asking themselves tough questions. "If what you're doing is giving a government of a more authoritarian country the tools to have massive surveillance, I think then companies have to ask themselves, 'Is this really something we want to do in terms of our corporate values, even if it means otherwise forgoing that market?'"___A BIGGER BROTHER?The Shanghai Electric Vehicle Public Data Collecting, Monitoring and Research Center sits in a grey tower in suburban Jiading district. One floor up from the cafeteria, a wall-sized screen glows with dots, each representing a single vehicle coursing along Shanghai's roads to create a massive real-time map that could reveal where people live, shop, work, and worship.Click a dot at random, and up pops a window with a number that identifies each individual vehicle, along with its make and model, mileage and battery charge.All told, the screen exhibits data from over 222,000 vehicles in Shanghai, the vast majority of them passenger cars."We can provide a lot of data from consumers to the government to help them improve policy and planning," said Ding Xiaohua, deputy director of the center, a non-profit that is tightly aligned with and funded by the government.According to national specifications published in 2016, electric vehicles in China transmit data from the car's sensors back to the manufacturer. From there, automakers send at least 61 data points, including location and details about battery and engine function to local centers like the one Ding oversees in Shanghai.Data also flows to a national monitoring center for new energy vehicles run by the Beijing Institute of Technology, which pulls information from more than 1.1 million vehicles across the country, according to the National Big Data Alliance of New Energy Vehicles. The national monitoring center declined to respond to questions.Those numbers are about to get much bigger. Though electric vehicle sales accounted for just 2.6 percent of the total last year, policymakers have said they'd like new energy vehicles to account for 20 percent of total sales by 2025. Starting next year, all automakers in China must meet production minimums for new energy vehicles, part of Beijing's aggressive effort to reduce dependence on foreign energy sources and place itself at the forefront of a growing global industry.The Chinese government has shown its interest in tracking vehicles."The government wants to know what people are up to at all times and react in the quickest way possible," said Maya Wang, a senior China researcher for Human Rights Watch. "There is zero protection against state surveillance.""Tracking vehicles is one of the main focuses of their mass surveillance," she added.Last year, authorities in Xinjiang, a restive region in western China that has become a laboratory for China's surveillance state, ordered residents to install GPS devices so their vehicles could be tracked, according to official media. This summer the Ministry of Public Security, a police agency, began to roll out a system to track vehicles using windshield radio frequency chips that can identify cars as they pass roadside reading devices.Ding insisted that the electric vehicle monitoring program is not designed to facilitate state surveillance, though he said data could be shared with government public security organs, if a formal request is made. The center said it has not shared information with police, prosecutors or courts, but has used the data to assist a government investigation of a vehicle fire.There is a privacy firewall built into the system. The monitoring center has each car's unique vehicle identification number, but to link that number with the personal details of the car owner, it must go through the automaker - a step it has taken in the past. Chinese law enforcement can also independently link the vehicle identification number with the car owner's personal information."To speak bluntly, the government doesn't need to surveil through a platform like ours," Ding said. He said he believed the security forces "must have their own ways to monitor suspects," as other governments do.___DATA ON WHEELSMany vehicles in the U.S., Europe and Japan transmit position information back to automakers, who feed it to car-tracking apps, maps that pinpoint nearby amenities and emergency services providers. But the data stops there. Government or law enforcement agencies would generally only be able to access personal vehicle data in the context of a specific criminal investigation and in the U.S. would typically need a court order, lawyers said.Automakers initially resisted sharing information with the Shanghai monitoring center; then the government made transmitting data a prerequisite for getting incentives."The automakers consider the data a precious resource," said a government consultant who helped evaluate the policy and spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive issues. "They gave you dozens of reasons why they can't give you the data. They give you dozens of excuses. Then we offer the incentives. Then they want to give us the data because it's part of their profit."There was concern that data pulled from electric vehicles might reveal proprietary information about, for example, how hybrids switch between gas and battery power, and eventually set automakers up for commercial competition with a Chinese government entity. As cars become more connected, carmakers are looking to tap new revenue streams built on data - a market McKinsey estimated could be worth $750 billion by 2030.Ding said a Tesla executive came to Shanghai and grilled him about the rules. "The first question is who are you, the second question is why you collect this data, and the third question is how to protect the privacy of the users," Ding said.Tesla declined to comment.Ding said confidentiality agreements bar the data center from sharing proprietary information.Still, he is open about his commercial ambition. He'd like to wean the center from government funding and make money from the data, without infringing on anyone's privacy or intellectual property. "We have done some explorations," he said. "But there is still a distance from truly monetizing it."___CHINA'S EDGEThe Chinese government's ability to grab data as it flows from cars gives its academics and policymakers an edge over competing nations. China tends to view technology development as a key competitive resource. Though global automakers have received billions in incentives and subsidies from U.S., European and Japanese governments, they are contributing data to the Chinese government that ultimately serves Beijing's strategic interests.In 2011, the U.S. Department of Energy's Idaho National Laboratory began a nationwide study of how electric vehicle owners drive and charge their cars. Participants gave explicit written consent to allow the government laboratory to collect their data, and even then it wasn't delivered in real time, said John Smart, who leads the center's advanced vehicles group. Instead, the team got historical data on a weekly basis. Cars were assigned random numbers for the study, so owners remained anonymous.Nothing of its kind has been done since in the U.S., Smart said."The cost is very high to collect data," he explained. "The government hasn't felt the need to provide that money and the manufacturers making their own investments are choosing to keep the findings to themselves for proprietary reasons."When it was published, in 2015, the Idaho National Laboratory's study was the largest ever done. All told, bundled with some additional data, the study helped Idaho researchers analyze 21,600 electric vehicles over 158 million driving miles (254 million kilometers).In the same amount of time it took Idaho researchers to publish their study, the Shanghai Electric Vehicle Public Data Collecting, Monitoring and Research Center began gathering real-time information from more than 222,000 vehicles and amassed over 4.7 billion miles (7.6 billion kilometers) of driving history."As a researcher, I think that data set could be used to answer hundreds of questions," Smart said. "I have a notebook a half an inch thick full of questions."Global automakers stressed that they share data to comply with Chinese regulations. Nearly all have announced plans to aggressively expand their electric vehicle offerings in China, the world's largest car market."There are real-time monitoring systems in China where we have to deliver car data to a government system," Volkswagen Group China chief executive Jochem Heizmann said in an interview.

How China, Russia Interfere in U.S. AffairsUSNEWS.comNovember 6, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 U.S. News & World Report All Rights ReservedSection: CIVIC; National News; Vol.; No.Length: 1471 wordsByline: Paul D. ShinkmanHighlight: Beijing and Moscow are manipulating American centers of power in sharply different ways.BodyIn early 2011, U.S. solar panel manufacturing giant Solyndra was considered one of the world's most innovative companies, following an encouraging visit from then-President Barack Obama at a time the economy was still reeling from the 2008 downturn. Then in September of that year, it filed for bankruptcy despite receiving more than half a billion dollars in federal loan guarantees, becoming a central talking point for Obama's political rivals leading up to the 2012 election. Economists and defense officials who served at the time blame market pressure from rivals in China who are believed to have improved their own technology by stealing American designs. SEE: [The Week in Cartoons, Nov. 2-5, 2018]Three months later, in December, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton condemned Russia's legislative election as neither free nor fair -- a criticism that Russian leader Vladimir Putin viewed as fomenting revolution in his country. He            reportedly vowed revenge in kind. Foreign governments have for decades attempted to exert influence inside the U.S. to their political or financial advantage but perhaps never as acutely or troublingly as in recent years, current and former officials say. Through complex cyber operations, Russia sows dissent wherever it can to undermine American unity at home and alliances abroad, while China increasingly grabs influence within the U.S. to further its own long-term economic and security goals, sometimes in plain sight. Both appear to be successful, though in sharply different ways. These activities have particularly intensified going into the midterm elections on Nov. 6 as Moscow and Beijing, along with other nefarious actors like Iran, continue to, as one Trump administration official put it, "undermine confidence in Democratic institutions and influence public sentiment and government policies," as well as "influence voter perceptions and decision-making in the 2018 and 2020 U.S. elections." "We've been taken by surprise by things that in the big picture shouldn't be that surprising," says Thomas Mahnken, a former top Pentagon official for policy and strategy, now president of the Center for Budgetary and Strategic Assessments. "Russia's strategy is one of promoting discord. It's a negative aim. It's aimed at showing the weakness of democracy, the flaws of democracy. Whereas the Chinese are using many of the same tactics, the same overall broad approach to portray China in a favorable light." "The harder we look and the more places we look, the more we find. I don't know that we know enough to be able to characterize the scale of their efforts." What the U.S. yet doesn't know about these online threats is notably true for China, which invests more than Russia appears to on overt or public campaigns for its coercion efforts rather than covert espionage or attacks. Unlike Russia, which seems to cast a wide net and then focus on targets of opportunity, China appears to have more of a grand plan it seeks to achieve in undermining American power. The Trump administration took particular affront to the Sept. 26 "China Daily" insert in the Des Moines Register, a newspaper in a hotly influential political battleground state that included propaganda material criticizing President Donald Trump's trade war with Beijing with a disclaimer that it had been produced by a foreign government. In a speech the following week, Vice President Mike Pence outlined what the government considers to be the Chinese Communist Party's efforts to influence American economics and politics, including lobbying Hollywood toward more pro-Chinese imagery, and issued a stern warning: "Our administration is going to continue to act decisively to protect America's interests, American jobs and American security." A spokesperson for the National Security Council told Foreign Policy earlier this month it has evidence the Chinese government has employed targeted counter-sanctions as a form of "retaliation at farmers and workers in states and districts that voted for President Trump," in an attempt to create divisions between federal and state governments and U.S. businesses. An organization known as the Chinese Communist Party's United Front Work Department seeks to undermine political dissent at home but has also carried out influence operations abroad using ethnic Chinese living in communities outside the country, according to an assessment by the American U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission this summer. The extent to which these operatives have clear ties to the Communist Party vary, making their intent difficult to prove. Through these networks, party officials have apparently meddled directly in other countries' elections. A man connected with ties to the communist government reportedly tried to undercut the Australian Liberal Party last year, for example, by            encouraging ethnic Chinese voters there to cast ballots against it in a by-election. In New Zealand, Yang Jian, a Chinese-born naturalized citizen and member of Parliament, was discovered to have hid his prior experience as an instructor for more than a decade for Chinese military intelligence operatives, and after he had likely gained access to sensitive material regarding China. Yang            later denied he had committed any acts of espionage. An expert told the            Financial Times that the incident shows China saw New Zealand as a softer target than the U.S. and "may also be using it as a testing ground for future operations in other countries." Chinese officials have flatly refuted any interference in foreign countries' elections. "We did not, do not and will not interfere in the internal affairs of any country, and we don't accept any groundless accusations made against China," Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said at the United Nations in September following the Trump administration's claims. "We also urge other countries to follow the principles of the United Nations Charter, which forbids interference in any nation's internal affairs." This shift in policy toward the Asian giant has continued to take shape in multiple corners of the administration. Last week, the Justice Department announced new indictments against 10 Chinese citizens it believes are intelligence officers who stole sensitive technology from American companies. "They have long-term ambitions to retake their place in the world," says Ely Ratner, who served as Vice President Joe Biden's deputy national security adviser. "We're facing an extremely serious challenge from China across all dimensions of international politics, and the only way we're going to respond to that effectively is if there's a bipartisan consensus around the issue." Ratner points to one of the most effective results of Russia's influence campaign in the U.S. in the partisanship it has created, especially with regard to the yet-unknown element of whether it succeeded in changing the outcome of the 2016 election. The U.S. intelligence community has sounded alarms about Russia's continual interference in American elections. And while the White House has taken steps to rein in Moscow's activities -- including new sanctions and            support for military exercises along Russia's border -- new data from Pew shows that the politicization of the threat Russia poses has            succeeded in driving a wedge between Republican and Democratic voters. Trump and his top officials have already indicated they might blame China for an unfavorable outcome on Nov. 6, which Ratner fears could further politicize the threat from Beijing and handicap the government's ability to counter it, with support from Congress. "It really undermines the ability of both parties to work together on that issue. And you don't want a dynamic similar to Russia where it becomes immediately partisan," says Ratner, now executive vice president at the Center for a New American Security. But perhaps the most nefarious effect of foreign intervention in U.S. elections is that it likely won't be clear to the average voters whether the interference was successful. Even if it were, some voters may not want to believe it and will be allowed to do so by their political leaders. "They've both been effective because of our ineffectiveness at dealing with our vulnerabilities," says Malcolm Harkins, an expert in cyberattack risks and chief security and trust officer at software firm Cylance. China and Russia both have centered their attempts to influence Americans' thinking by playing on existing beliefs about their perceived opponents. "You play on the anchor points that people are already tilting toward. And you exacerbate them."Paul D. Shinkman is a national security reporter for U.S. News & World Report.

Bush Begins, Burial To Be Next To Wife And DaughterMORNINGS WITH MARIA MORNINGS WITH MARIA 8:00 AM ESTDecember 6, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved Section: NEWS; FinancialLength: 7328 wordsByline: Maria Bartiromo, Robert Wolf, James Freeman, Dagen McDowell, Blake Burman, Robert Wolf, Stuart Varney, Hillary Vaughn, Connell McShaneGuests: Stephen Harper, Rishi Kapoor, Mark Avallone, Sara GreensteinBodyMARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: -- points, 1-2/3 percent. S&P 500 down 41, 1-1/2 percent. And the NASDAQ now with a decline of 129 points, that's down almost two percent right now. At these levels the Dow and the S&P 500 are falling back into negative territory for the year so far.Now investors were rattled by the arrest of the chief financial officer of Huawei, the Chinese company. She was arrested in Canada. The news is sparking fears about the fight between U.S. and China worsening. We're going to tell you all about the Huawei situation. All this coming after Tuesday's big rout. Remember, the markets were down sharply on Tuesday, before they were closed yesterday.All the major averages down better than three percent on the session. Markets were closed yesterday for the funeral of President George H.W. Bush. So this is the first time investors in the U.S. are reacting to that big he sell-off on Tuesday down 800 points at the close on the Dow, down 283 points on the NASDAQ. Looks like the selling continues this morning at least at the open.Global are down as well. FT-100 down 2-1/3 percent. CAC Quarante down 2- 1/3 percent. DAX Index in Germany down 2-1/2 percent. In Asia overnight, declines across the board. Worst performer Hong Kong, Hang Seng Index down 2-1/2 percent. It is also decision day for OPEC. We're watching the price of oil down as well, look at that move, oil prices sliding amid uncertainty over a possible production cut out of OPEC.Crude oil right now down 3-3/4 percent or $2.00 lower as you can see. Technology descending on the White House. CEOs from some of the biggest companies in the industry set to discuss regulations and innovation. White House having the meeting with those tech CEOs as you can see all there. Qualcomm, Microsoft, Google, IBM, Oracle all coming to Washington.Meanwhile, it is round two for G.M. CEO Mary Barra, she's headed back to Capitol Hill after explaining the recent job cut announcements to lawmakers.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MARY BARRA, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, GENERAL MOTORS: We're trying to make sure that General Motors is strong and that we're in a leadership position in the technologies like electrification, like autonomous vehicles, like connectivity because that's what customers want, that's what where industry is going.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: We are taking a look at the fallout for the automaker and we will have more of Edward Lawrence's exclusive interview with Mary Barra coming up. The stock is down 1-1/2 percent right now.All those stories coming up this Thursday morning. And joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the Wall Street Journal's assistant editorial page editor James Freeman and 32 Advisors CEO, former economic adviser to President Obama, Robert Wolf. Busy morning this morning. Good to see you.ROBERT WOLF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Crazy morning. I was not expecting to have a down open after yesterday. So this -- I think this Huawei thing and everything between China U.S. is taking and feels like a turn for the worse.BARTIROMO: Now, the Journal wrote about this, James, in terms of the arrest of the CFO of Huawei as it relates to what Huawei has done in terms of Iran. And going against the sanctions that the U.S. put on Iran but there is more to this story than just Iran sanctions.JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I think our colleagues on the news side of our paper have done a good job kind of laying out this long-term issue with both Huawei and ZTE, the other big China telecom manufacture, both parties for long time have seen a threat here not just violating sanctions around the world against rogue regimes like Iran and ZTE's case, North Korea as well but really being a threat to spy on the United States if their equipment becomes a part of our telephone system.So this is -- this is not necessarily a Trump move here, this may be exactly what would be appropriate and she deserves her day in court like anyone else but there is a history here of concern from both parties on this issue.BARTIROMO: Yes.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: And our allies have linked arms with us on this with Australia banning Huawei from its 5G networks. New Zealand blocking one major wireless carrier from using Huawei technology.BARTIROMO: And Britain.MCDOWELL: And Britain B.T. and Britain just yesterday starting to remove Huawei equipment from its networks.WOLF: But I think the question we're going to have to ask ourselves and we don't know yet is will this kind of put a pause in the trade truce? What does it mean for the 90 days kind of cease and the whole tariff situation?BARTIROMO: Which is why that uncertainty has the market down another 400 points right now. Our top story this hour, it is that trade tension. It is mounting. The chief financial officer of Chinese technology giant Huawei was arrested on Saturday at the request of United States. A move likely to escalate tensions between the two countries. This arrest is sending shockwaves to our global markets.It took place on the same night as the high stakes dinner between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping where the two leaders established that 90-day trade truce. Joining me right now is former Canadian Prime Minister, author of the book, Right Here, Right Now Stephen Harper. Mr. Prime Minister it's great to see you again. Thanks very much for joining me this morning.STEPHEN HARPER, AUTHOR, RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW: Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: Now the CFO of Huawei was arrested in Canada. Give your thoughts of this relationship between the U.S. and China or even China and the rest of the world including Canada because this is -- there is more to this story than just Iran sanctions. This is about espionage and about the potential for the Chinese government to use Huawei, use Z.T. as an enabler to spy on political enemies or even friends like the U.S.HARPER: Look, just a couple thoughts. I'm not going to speculate on the arrest. Obviously, it's a criminal matter that's going to be before courts and I don't know the specifics. What I do know is that when I was in government, we were increasingly concerned about the penetration of Huawei and ZTE into western Democratic telecommunications networks. These are organizations ultimately tightly tied to Chinese security apparatus.And we think there are some real serious issues there. I obviously note that the United States is encouraging western allies to essentially push Huawei out of the emerging 5G network and my person view is that that is something that western countries should be doing in terms of our long-term security issues. You know, as long as people have to remember China is not simply an economic competitor and a major challenger, I think that bothers us less than the fact that China this is in fact a geopolitical rival that has made no secret of the desire to spread an alternative to western Democratic norms and I think that's something that should concern us.BARTIROMO: So, what should be done then, Mr. Prime Minister? Because, you know, we can't look at this story in isolation as if this just happened this year or this just happened last year, I mean, when you were in charge and running Canada, you too, looked at these companies as the potential -- as the potential threat. What should be done in terms of getting China to change its behavior in terms of spying on the rest of the world, stealing trade secrets, and then coming up with companies that compete with them and beating us at our own game?HARPER: Well, there's many things have to be done. As I say, one of them is obviously dealing with the particular problem of the penetration of these telecommunications agencies into the west. I think that's a concern in and of itself. Obviously, pressure has to be brought on China to change its behavior in terms of rule-breaking. But I -- as you know I go farther in my book, Maria, and I argue that the rules themselves have to be changed.We have a situation where the Chinese have wide-ranging access to our markets, our access to their markets is extremely limited, it has caused the loss of millions of jobs in North America. And frankly the trade deficits keep growing as China gets more wealthy and the opposite should be happening. Essentially, I think the United States has under long-term policy, been essentially paying for the rise of an alternative rival.And this is simply unwise and look I know that markets get rattled by the administration trying to take on this problem but if we don't take on this problem now and the long term this is going to get worse and frankly we'll get to the point in long term where China cannot be taken on, where it is determining the rules of the global system and arbitrary ways that simply suit its own interests.So, you know, I -- well, I don't know if I agree with every aspect of the administration's policy, taking on this issue of Chinese rule-breaking and rules that frankly allow China to exploit a trade relationship this has to be done.BARTIROMO: Yes. You make a really, really important point there. Let me ask you about other issues on trade because the President is threatening to terminate the NAFTA agreement if Congress does not approve the USMCA pact. Now, the last time you and I spoke, you felt good I think about the changes in the USMCA. But I want to get your take on this because Secretary Steven Mnuchin was on with me this week and he talked about this trilateral agreement. Listen to what he said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)STEVEN MNUCHIN, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF TREASURY: The deal was signed by the U.S., Canada and Mexico. And I think this is going to be an agreement that President Trump expects is going to be taken to Congress and passed. And as he said on Air Force One, if it's not passed, he is going to terminate the existing agreement.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: What about that? The consequences of President Trump terminating the existing agreement and the consequences of this USMCA not being ratified in short order when the new Congress starts next month.HARPER: I'm not surprised the President would make that threat. You know, I've always kind of figured that would be his fallback to get the new deal through. Obviously, you know, my view that NAFTA itself and the existing trade relationship between United States and Canada in particular has been a balanced one that is in the interest and to benefit of both parties. So I think, you know, canceling the agreement as part of a bargain ploy with Congress would be ultimately a bad decision.But, you know, given that the three countries have agreed on a new deal, let's hope that the Congress acts widely -- wisely and adapts it.BARTIROMO: Yes. But I mean, one of the issues as I had one of the Congressman on the Democratic side this weekend on "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES" and he said, look, this is not just about the auto sector, we need all industries to have a fair shake when it comes to manufacturing. So, do you want to see USMCA expanded? Do you want to see any changes from your standpoint in terms this deal between Canada and Mexico and the U.S.?HARPER: I don't speak for the government of Canada but h I don't believe that Canada is looking for anything more. This is a comprehensive deal, Maria, and as with any trade agreement it is very big and very complicated and not everyone is going to like everything in it. But as I say, I think the President is presenting Congress with a pretty clear option. Here is a deal. And the alternative may be no deal at all and no special trade pact in the North America trade year.I don't think that would be in anybody's interest. And I certainly think the USMCA is better than having no trade pact at all.BARTIROMO: Mr. Prime Minister, let me get your take on oil because we have breaking news right now, OPEC is just announcing right now that they are agreeing to cut output, oil prices are down this morning by three percent on expectations of production cuts ahead of the OPEC meeting following this mandated reduction in Canadian supply. It comes amid growing discourse within OPEC following Qatar's withdrawals. So now we're going to see an output cut from OPEC.I don't think they're going to stick to it or if they're going to be honest and really cut production. What's your take on this?HARPER: OPEC has less market power than -- and has had less market power than people think for a long time. But at the same time, if the major powers, the major producers like Saudi Arabia and Russia if they are serious about some production reduction, they can get it. I mean, the truth is that we are -- we're seeing oil prices come down for many reasons but one of them is that we have had a slackening in global demand recently.And, you know, I think that should alarm us somewhat. I think there is very little doubt that outside in my travels. I have very little doubt that outside North America you are seeing the economy beginning to slow. It's particularly outside the United States.BARTIROMO: Mr. Prime Minister, it's good to see you this morning. Hope you come back soon. Thanks so much for your insights on all the above.HARPER: Yes. Good morning, Maria.BARTIROMO: Stephen Harper joining us there. Former Prime Minister of Canada. We're going to take a short break and then we got the ADP number right after this. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: We have breaking news right now. The ADP numbers is a miss. It is just hitting them wires to just for the month of November. And it is 179,000 jobs created for the month that miss the consensus expectation which calls for jobs of 195,000.Markets are basically where they were. Maybe a little better, down 390 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. But this miss basically, shows you that we've got growth in the economy, but it is certainly not gangbusters with growth of jobs of 179,000 lower than the estimate of 195,000.Of course, we get the job's numbers from Labor Department out on Friday. And typically speaking, this usually indicates -- this is we could see something along the lines, of this number.Joining me right now to talk more about the economic growth, and how to invest right now is the co-CEO of Investcorp, Rishi Kapoor. Rishi, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks very much for joining us.RISHI KAPOOR, CO-CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, INVESTCORP: Thank you very much for having me.BARTIROMO: So we had a -- we had a number that was looks not too hot, not too cold on the job's numbers, you invest a quarter of a percent of your assets under management in private equity. You have a good vision in terms of what's going on with the economic growth out there. How do you see things?KAPOOR: Yes, I mean, our starting point frankly is obviously everything starts with the top-down assessment. And what we had prevailing in the global economy over the last several years was a very benign backdrop. Stemming from an ultra-loose monetary policy, a very low volatility regime, and a fairly stable geopolitical backdrop -- a facilitating growth in global trade.Today, in 2018, towards the end of 2018 and looking forward, much of that is not really something that we can take for granted. And much of that is falling away.So, as a consequence, you know, our stance from an investment perspective is what I would describe as being cautiously vigilant. We do believe that the U.S. economy in particular, and the global economy generally is going to continue to grow, albeit perhaps, not as fast as we have seen it in recent times.And positioning ourselves well for that means, focusing on businesses that are less at risk from two major exogenous risk factors. One, relating to the trade disputes that we are having to face up to today and the second is technology-led disruption risk.So, we are focusing a lot on business services, we are focusing a lot on people-based businesses that are less susceptible to such secular forces, disrupting them. We've acquired a talent agency that was our most recent investment in the U.S.You know, but the -- but the onslaught of content ownership, the likes of Netflix, Amazon, et cetera coming over the top. You know, YouTube, social media influencers, et cetera. Talent management is we think ideally poised as a people business enabled by technology to grow well into the people.BARTIROMO: So, talent agency is one the most recent but business services, other areas that you are finding growth in an economy that is expected to slow down.KAPOOR: Yes. So, you know, for instance, some of the other areas we focused on are either high-end value-added businesses, people-based businesses like consulting firms, like strategic communication firms, we've invested in both.And also, down the value chain, essential services. You know, we've invested in a business that provides maintenance services to HVAC Plumbing Services et cetera. It's grown like a weed, you know, so --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Wow. Let me ask you about real estate because Investcorp has a range of investments around the world in terms of real estate, as well as private equity. You just invested $300 million in the multi-family properties in the United States. Do you see a change happening to real estate as interest rates move up?KAPOOR: So, bid real estate much like as is the case with private equity. Our assessment starts from the top down perspective, right. And in real estate for us, in particular, the main secular trend we are looking to bank is this adoption of e-commerce and in particular, the significant expansion of data storage requirements with the advent of big data, et cetera.BARTIROMO: Sure.KAPOOR: And playing on both of those, we feel that the real near-term opportunity actually I shouldn't even say, the near-term, it's really more like medium to long-term, opportunity in real estate is all around the periphery. The last mile fulfillment, the distribution centers, the data centers, the logistics, whereas this -- either serving regional hubs or the last mile -- you know, into major urban centers.And so, that, as you mentioned earlier, Maria, one of our biggest investments lately, has been a large portfolio of industrial warehousing assets across the United States. We see a good opportunity in student housing, as well. Yes, rising rates would have had an impact, but you know, it's been fairly muted.BARTIROMO: Is there anything about this most recent market upset that would cause you to pull back? I mean, look, market was down 800 points, Tuesday. Today, we're seeing another sell-off, worries about global growth. Do you pull back in terms of putting that into work on all?KAPOOR: Yes. So, I think the shift in our thinking is we are not backing the data anymore, we are backing the Alpha. No macro bets, it's really the micro bets. We are looking at the company first, the property first. Where is it located? What does the company do? What is the management do?(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: That makes a lot of sense. That makes a lot. Rishi, it's great to have you on the program.KAPOOR: It was absolutely fantastic being here.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much, Rishi Kapoor. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Markets are lower this morning. As we've been telling you, it is going to be a rough opening on the heels of a sharp sell-off, Tuesday. Dow Industrials set to be down about 400 points.We're off of the lows right here, but this is still 1-1/2 percent lower. S&P 500 is now 1-1/3 percent, and the Nasdaq is down 117 points, that is 1- 3/4 percent lower.Meanwhile, technology companies are headed to Washington today. The CEOs of those companies, the White House is hosting a roundtable discussion with a number of top tech CEOs to talk about innovation. Blake Burman is live at the White House this morning. He has the very latest. Blake.BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Maria, good morning to you. Artificial intelligence, Quantum Computing, 5G Technology, those just some of the topics that will be under discussion here at the White House later today. Involving some of the biggest tech heavyweights. The leaders, for example, from the company's Oracle, Qualcomm, Microsoft, and Google, will be a part of the discussions.One source involved with the gathering telling me, the focus will be on ensuring innovation and growth continue to happen in the U.S. Now, it will be a much more contentious setting later today up on Capitol Hill, as the General Motors CEO Mary Barra will return for a second day to talk with lawmakers about GM's decision to slash jobs and shutter plants.Barra telling our Edward Lorenz yesterday that G.M. needs to keep up with the times.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MARRY BARRA, CHAIRWOMAN, GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY: The industry is transforming and we need to make sure that General Motors is around for the next several decades. We have responsibilities to many of our stakeholders, our employees, our folks who have retired from the company, our investors.And so, we're trying to make sure that we have a strong General Motors.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURMAN: Maria, Barra was pressed by reporters about that massive taxpayer- funded bailout that G.M. received just a little less than a decade ago. Her response was that G.M. has invested $22 billion in the U.S. since then. Maria.BARTIROMO: All right. Blake, thank you. Blake Burman at the White House. Coming up, investors are watching economic data, international trade, weekly jobless claims.After the break, we just got the ADP number. The number was below expectations. Jobs in America is our focus. We're going to break down the expectations ahead of the November jobs report which happens on Friday.Not a major reaction should the ADP number, which showed jobs came -- coming in at below the estimate at 179 jobs created in the month of November. Back in a momentBARTIROMO: Welcome back to Thursday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, December 6th. Your top stories right now just about 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast. Breaking news, we are moments away from the weekly jobless numbers coming out. Expectations there 225,000 jobless claims for the last week. Markets this morning are under selling pressure once again. Take a look at where we stand. We're off of the lows but certainly it is expected to be a tough opening at the start of trading, extending the losses of earlier in the week.The Dow Jones Industrial average right now down 363 points, 1-1/2 percent. S&P 500 down 35 points, that's 1-1/4 percent. And the NASDAQ is 111 points, that's 1-2/3 percent lower. European Indices are down across the board as well. Take a look. FT-100 right now down 2-1/4 percent, 155 points lower. CAC Quarante down 115, down 2-1/3 percent lower in Paris. And the Dax Index in Germany down 2-1/2 percent, 273 points lower.Asian markets lower across the board overnight. Worst performer Hong Kong, Hang Seng Index down 2-1/2 percent. Oil is also down on breaking news, although it was down before we got this news. OPEC has agreed on a deal to cut oil output. No final figure has been determined in terms of what kind of capacity is going away but the price of oil is off its lows. It is down $1.43 a barrel, that's 2.7 percent.Jobless claims missed expectations after the ADP report also missed expectations. Dow Industrials down 373 points, no change after the economic data out this morning. Let's take it with Gerri Willis, she's on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange watching this market. It's going to be a loser at the start, Gerri.GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: That's right. You got that right, Maria. A little anxiety down here already this morning as we see the futures pointing to a lower open. Let's take a look at those stocks there, well, it didn't do so great on Tuesday. The last day the market was open starting with Boeing, that stock is poised to open down three percent, and why in part because Lion Air CEO is examining of cancelling his Boeing orders that after we found out Tuesday that Boeing's automated flight control system was omitted from the plane's operations manual.So lots of trouble for Boeing. Apple also poised open lower here by 2.2 percent. Price target cuts from an analyst this morning to 165. Caterpillar poised to open down as well and here you're seeing the impact of all this news about trade this morning. The concerns, the worries that we will not get a deal with China and that two sides may be moving further apart rather than together.But interesting UnitedHealth on this list the worst Dow performers on Tuesday and that is a distinctly domestic company. 3M also an international player here poised to open down 1.4 percent. We're going to be watching this all morning but I got to tell you, a little bit of anxiety down here, Maria, we'll be watching.BARTIROMO: All right, Gerri. Thanks very much. And joining us right now to weigh in on all of that is the president and founder of Potomac Wealth Advisories, Mark Avallone. Mark, good to see you. Thank you so much for being here this morning. Your reaction to this nervousness in the market. You've got to make investment decisions every day. When you see a market down as much as it has been on these worries about slowing growth and higher interest rates, how do you -- how do you invest?MARK AVALLONE, PRESIDENT AND FOUNDER, POTOMAC WEALTH ADVISORS: Well, the slowing growth is mostly overseas. We see hint of that here with ADP number. The real trouble today in the market is the news that you've been covering all day. When you have a shocking event like that you're going to see a reaction and that's when it's important to look at the underlying economic strength that the U.S. economy still has.We're still in a bull market. U.S. economy is still strong. The problems are mostly overseas there with the Fed and China. The good news about the jobs number that you reported earlier, is that numbers like that which show that growth may have peaked, that could suppress the Fed's zeal to continue to be aggressive and longer term that's a positive for the market.BARTIROMO: So you want it still but then the buying stocks is what you're saying.AVALLONE: Yes. I think I would be cautious here. I would go in he slowly. I wouldn't back up the truck right now because there's just too much exogenous news. But look, ever since 1946, the year after midterm election has been positive, the GDP is over three percent, unemployment is 3.7 percent. None of that spells recession, none of that says this is a bad time to be in stocks but I would go in slowly until some if these news noise calms down.WOLF: Mark, you commented that the low expectations on the jobless claims in ADP may be an OK sign because the Fed may not do as many hikes as we expect. So maybe they'll do two next gens instead of three or four. But that actually aligns what the idea that people now are nervous about the inverted curve because that shows there's a possible slowdown. So wouldn't that kind of play into what we saw last week?AVALLONE: Yes. Last week was an inversion on the -- on the middle end of the curve. We haven't seen that yet in the 210 spread. I'm not sure that's a one-to-one correlation that that inversion leads to a recession. We look more at the underlying economic data and recessions cause stock market corrections and an aggressive Fed causes stock market corrections with a higher probability than an inverted yield curve.And an inverted yield curve may or may not happen yet. So I think we're getting a little ahead of ourselves with that worry. And I think any Fed pullback is going to be a net positive for stocks.WOLF: So just as a follow up. Going into next year, what would you say how many possible hikes the Fed will likely do at 25 beats?AVALLONE: It will be good news if they're data driven. And I don't think they get to more than two. Where -- you know, December is pretty much baked in the cake at this point. But they've seen what happens when they get more aggressive and we also see a global oversees slowdown. It's not just -- they are worried about a wage number early in the year. One wage number doesn't drive the entire global economy.And overseas there are some real problems, both geopolitical as well as economic and structural. So the Fed is going to face those headwinds. They just can't march to their own drum and raise repeatedly three or four times simply because we've had about strong wages here in the U.S.FREEMAN: Mark, James Freeman at The Wall Street Journal. I'm wondering if you could try to interpret for us this investor reaction to the Huawei news. Do you think the sell-off is occurring because people think this is Trump jabbing at the Chinese as part of a negotiation? Or if it's completely legitimate investigation, there's a lot of reason to think it is. If this really is an outlaw company, why should that trigger a sell- off?And can't we have law enforcement even with a trade deal?AVALLONE: Well, I think it's a little of both. I mean, to think this happened while they were meeting at the G20 is a bit surprising. I think it shows how firm Trump and his administration is to fight China excesses. I think that's what worries the market. The markets just want everybody to kiss and make up for things to be better. And clearly a move like today says that is not going to happen.We are in a prolonged trade skirmish here. The market reaction today is they're worried it's going to turn into a trade war. Most important thing now is if it's really to subside, have some meaningful conversations back channel and keep it out of the headlines because Chinese don't react well if they look to be embarrassed and publicly humiliated.MCDOWELL: You said keep it -- Mark, it's Dagen McDowell. You said keep it out of the headlines. Are you suggesting that the communication strategy coming out of the White House and out of Washington, it needs to be -- well, more quiet if you will?AVALLONE: Absolutely. That would be wiser at this point. Look, we said that before here. These tweets only serve to antagonize a proud country that is intent on being our economic peer. That's the reality. We can't publicly beat them down. I think effective conversations would be far more important than trying to be a bully in the street with the significant economic power that China is becoming and absolutely wants to be.BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, that's not going to happen. I mean, we're going to -- we're going to see the news come out as it happens. I have a hard time believing that it -- what happens is going to be quiet and we're not going to find out -- find out the news. So the news is the news, China and the U.S. are in a fight, China has been stealing for us for decades and there is worry about a global slowdown and that fight having an impact on the relationship.What is the downside risk? What -- I mean, I know you said everybody wants China and U.S. to kiss and make up but what's the downside risk of China and the U.S. having a drawn-out issue here?AVALLONE: Well, it would create economic uncertainties. It would shift U.S. production to other countries that may or may not be able to handle all the production that's inside China, tariffs also raise costs to consumers here. It's a global trickle effect. Look at what happened to emerging market stocks since this. The emerging market stocks are reacting to the uncertainties of China.BARTIROMO: I mean, what's the alternative? You know, this president has pushed back on China and its behavior and he is basically making a statement that yes, we are going to protect and force respect out of Beijing for America's intellectual property.AVALLONE: Well, then, that's the choice. Do we have the internal fortitude to sit through market gyrations like this for the President not to look at the stock market as a daily indicator of his success and for the American economy for our farmers to sit through some pain? This is going to be the test because the Chinese leaders will sit through their pain and they're feeling pain. Look, I think this strategy is working. It's bringing them to the table.It's slowing their economy down and it's giving us some leverage. I'm not against the objective here, I'm just pointing out that along the way there is pain and we're going to be feeling it.BARTIROMO: All of these things are happening at once because you've got jobs number our tomorrow, the expectation calls for jobs of 200,000 jobs created in the month of November. We are expecting the unemployment rate to hold steady at 3.7 percent when we get those job numbers tomorrow. But all of these worries are happening simultaneously, the worry about China, the worry about a slowing global economy, the worrying about the U.S. And that's why markets are reacting.AVALLONE: Yes. I think last week, it was much more geopolitical, Brexit, the slowing in China, the issues in France and then I think post G20, it feels now it's back to just China and the U.S. But it's not. I think as Mark said, there are -- there are global issues, OK, with growth. Actually, we're by far in the best seat, OK? There's no question from an economic perspective, we're feeling the best, the best.I think what we've done wrong is we have focused on just the market gyrations and I think you always say it. If you look at where we've come with the market, we have made an incredible, you know, new stride. The problem is we hit 27,000 high and now it feels not too good. I actually think going into next year, wages feel better, the economy feels better. I don't think we'll see recession next year.FREEMAN: That's a good news this week on U.S. factories. So the concerns -- the fears are out there, the data so far pretty good. Also, we all want the tariffs to go away. I'm not sure as part of a resolution --MCDOWELL: President Trump doesn't want the tariffs to go away I would argue.(CROSSTALK)FREEMAN: I'm speaking for all consumers.(CROSSTALK)FREEMAN: I've been appointed by someone -- myself but --BARTIROMO: But your point is?FREEMAN: But my point is look, we want the tariffs to go to zero but it doesn't mean we have to tolerate Chinese companies doing business with Iran, the world's most dangerous regime. So let's be clear with what we're after.BARTIROMO: And spying on us. And spying on us.MCDOWELL: I was just trying to make the point when the market is on edge about everything, the communication out of the White House, I don't care if it's on Twitter, I don't care if it's front of a T.V. camera, it matters. And the perception on Monday was that the White House was trying to put a shine on what happened over the weekend and make it rosier than it actually was. And they were not on the same page, communications wise as China and that added to what we saw on Tuesday.AVALLONE: Totally agree. Right.BARTIROMO: Mark, it's good to have you on the show this morning. Thanks so much.AVALLONE: Good to be here.BARTIROMO: Mark Avallone. Stay with us on Fox Business for a special coverage of jobs in America on -- tomorrow, Friday morning, 8:00 a.m. Eastern. We're going to identify where the jobs are when we get the latest jobs number out. Again, expectations call for 200,000 jobs to have been created last month. U.S. tariffs making steel expenditure despite that imported steel still flowing into the U.S. Connell McShane covering this story in Braddock, Pennsylvania this morning. Connell, good morning to you.CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria. From a U.S. steel plant, I got news from James Freeman by the way. There are whole bunch of steelworkers and executives out here who do not want to see those tariffs go away especially on imported steel because to your point about foreign competition of the steel still coming from overseas that has a lot to do a with pricing.Doug's going to show you the process here of the red-hot steel as it's made here in Braddock, Pennsylvania. And as he's doing that, I want to put up on the screen the chains we've seen since the tariffs went into effect. Remember they went into effect in March. Prices in the U.S. really since February on average up about 11 percent. Foreign steel prices come down almost five percent. So, the foreign competitors on the U.S., they're kind of pricing through the tariffs, if you will.So, the environment has gotten much better short term for companies that make American steel like U.S. steel. Now, I want to introduce you real quick to Sara Greenstein, the executive here at U.S. steel to ask you, Sara. Thank you for having us here by the way today. Two questions. One about the president, one about the future. How is your business different today and quantify it because of the tariffs on imported steel?SARA GREENSTEIN, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, UNITED STATES STEEL CORPORATION: Yes. Great question. There's no doubt that this administration's commitment to ensuring fair trade has allowed for reinvestment and renaissance in the steel industry.MCSHANE: OK. So, you've hired -- you've hired 800 people, say for example out of Saint Louis. We get that, we've seen that in the headlines. The question is about the future, your stock price has been quite stagnant even though the profits have been up. I think investors are concerned, what if the President makes a deal and the tariffs go away? Then what?GREENSTEIN: Yes. Our view is that this President is committed, will not blink and will ensure that we have a level playing field. I would be remiss if he -- I would be remiss if I didn't tell you you're standing in the very place that Andrew Carnegie started the steel industry in 1875. We've been here, we're committed to staying here and this administration is enabling us to do so.MCSHANE: OK. So, thank you. We're going to have much more throughout the day today. Maria, we brought after the bell out, we'll do the show at 4:00 p.m. Eastern with the CEO David Beard of U.S. steel who will join us live. So, as you can imagine, a lot of questions about the future because as Sara said, they need these tariffs to be in place. That level-playing field as they see it in order to remain a profitable enterprise. So, it's really changed the game here at least in the short term. We'll see what happens next year.BARTIROMO: Yes. Really fascinating stuff, Connell. Thanks so much. We'll be tuning in at 4:00 and watch your reporting all day.First though, lingering trade tensions with China. Stuart Varney will weigh in on that after arrest of this chief financial officer of Huawei in Canada. That's next.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Well, the arrest of Chinese telecom giant Huawei's chief financial officer sent shockwaves throughout the global market. Host of "VARNEY & COMPANY" Stuart Varney is here now to weigh in. What a story, Stu. Good morning.STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: What a story and late-breaking too. I walked in this morning, really just like you, Maria, picked up my copy at the Financial Times, hard copy, right here it is. The headline is, U.S. and China bolster trade truce message in big to soothe the markets. Then we hear that Meng Wanzhou she has been arrested in Canada and she is the daughter of founder of Huawei.And we find that she was arrested on December the 1st in Canada and that is the day of the dinner with Xi Jinping and Donald Trump in Argentina. Were we sending a message to China? Hey, we're getting tough, the hard-line stands because if the message, it certainly been taken by the markets to mean that the trade truce is off. I was really surprised at this news and I'm wondering, what we really behind this sending a message to China?It sure looks that way at the moment. And now you've got the repercussions. The market is tumbling, going to be down close to 400 points at the opening bell. And there is the possibility of retribution against American executives doing business in China. I think this is a blow-up of significant proportions. I think it's a mess what say you.BARTIROMO: Yes. But Stu, I mean, I know that you think it's a surprise that this one incident but are you really surprised that the Chinese government uses Chinese companies as tools to spy on America?VARNEY: No. I'm not surprised at all, no.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: And now Donald Trump says this is happening and they cornered this person and yes, there are repercussions for that and ramifications for the espionage.VARNEY: All true. All -- you're right across the board. But did we need to send that message at that time in that way?BARTIROMO: Right.VARNEY: I mean, she was arrested on December the 1st. That was at the moment when with Xi Jinping was sitting down to dinner with Donald Trump. I mean, the Chinese must have known that this was happening and must have gotten the message.BARTIROMO: Yes.VARNEY: Surely.BARTIROMO: We'll see. Well, that's why the market is down. People are worried about this as well the other worries out there. Stuart, I know you have a lot more about it in 10 minutes. We'll see at the top of the hour.VARNEY: Thank you.BARTIROMO: "VARNEY & COMPANY" begins 9:00 a.m. Eastern right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA. But first, honoring America's 41st president. We've got details as mourners are gathering in Texas today.BARTIROMO: And we continue to honor an American patriot. Mourners remembering President George H.W. Bush in Houston today as he prepares for his final journey. Hillary Vaughn is in Houston. Hillary?HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria. Well, former president Herbert Walker Bush is finally home here in Houston. Yesterday all living presidents and leaders from around the world gathered in Washington to honor America's 41st president.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GEORGE W. BUSH, 43RD PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're going to miss you. Your decency, sincerity and kind soul will stay with us forever. So through our tears let us know the blessings of knowing and loving you. A great and noble man. The best father a son or daughter can have. And on our grief by the smile knowing that dad is hugging Robin and holding mom's hand again.(END VIDEO CLIP)VAUGHN: In about two hours, the Bush family will arrive for a final farewell here at the church that former President Bush and his later wife Barbara worshipped at every Sunday. After the ceremony, Bush's body will head to the Union Pacific Railroad and take the train 70 miles to his final resting place. Bush's casket will be transported in the funeral car with special plexiglass windows.So along the route, people will gather to see the casket pass by. This train trip was all President Bush's idea. He toured the special locomotive in 2005 when it was unveiled with white and baby blue lettering calling the train 4141 for the 41st president. He even got in the conductor seat and took the train for a two-mile spin. Bush will be buried alongside former first lady Barbara Bush and his daughter Robin. Maria?BARTIROMO: All right, Hillary. Thanks very much. Hillary Vaughn. As we take a break and we are watching this market as well. I want to shows you futures pointing lower, lingering trade tensions with China has the Dow Jones Industrial average now down 420 points on the hills of that selloff on Tuesday. Back in a minute right here.BARTIROMO: All right. Final thoughts from this all-star panel. Robert Wolf.WOLF: There's going to be incredible volatility between now and year-end, China, Brexit and we haven't chatted about the budget showdown.BARTIROMO: There you go. That's right. That's true. James?FREEMAN: Lots of concerns but what's happening with the economy right now, we'll find out tomorrow with the national jobs report and I'll be publishing later establishing this morning the NFIB numbers from last month.BARTIROMO: I know you look really closely at those numbers. It's an important number.FREEMAN: Yes. It's going to be out there. I think it's going to be good barometer. We've talked about feelings and concerns and this is maybe a little harder data.BARTIROMO: Dagen?Load-Date: December 6, 2018End of Document

The Chinese Motherboard Hack Is a Crisis, Even If It Didn't Really HappenAtlantic OnlineOctober 6, 2018 SaturdayCopyright 2018 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1485 wordsByline: Ian BogostBodyIt's easy to forget in the app era, but Silicon Valley got its name from microchips. The generation that transformed orchards into Oracle did so by manufacturing electronic circuits that encrust "chips" of a semiconductor material, usually made of silicon. In the fertile purlicue south of San Francisco, the foundations of the electronic revolution were invented, designed, and manufactured. Shockley Semiconductor, Fairchild Semiconductor, Intel, and other integrated-circuit makers thrived. Computer makers who used their parts burgeoned too. Software and services came next, and then the venture capital to fund these efforts.Today, the capital and the software remain, and some computer and device makers, too. But the integrated circuit business has largely left the region. Silicon is etched into Silicon Valley mostly in name. The reasons are            many. Land, housing, and labor became more expensive. Other countries, most of them in East Asia, created incentives for semiconductor manufacture. Global just-in-time manufacturing, along with the low cost of shipping small, light microchips around the world, made vertical integration less desirable.This is a useful lens through which to view an            explosive story published this week by Bloomberg Businessweek. The report claims that Chinese spies systematically infiltrated U.S. corporate and government computer systems by installing hardware exploits on the motherboards of servers destined for widespread use, from video-streaming services to the CIA. According to Businessweek, the infected machines provided a backdoor into any network on which the machines were installed. The reporting claims that at least 30 U.S. companies were affected, including Apple and Amazon, the most valuable companies in the world.            Both           companies have vociferously denied the claims, but Bloomberg            stands by its story.Who is right is a matter of corporate and national security. The exploits and hacks            that           have           rocked           the           tech           industry           in           recent           years would seem minor compared with a foreign state gaining stealth access to the entire networks of companies and government agencies that manage enormous volumes of sensitive information. But even if the situation turns out to be different than Businessweek's report, the scenario outlined in the piece (or one like it) is totally plausible. That plausibility, made newly visible, could combine with an accelerant: A            tough American stance on Chinese business, including President Trump's love for tariffs and trade war, and China's increased dedication to independence. The resulting blaze has serious implications for the American technology business, and it won't soon burn out.Historically, China has not been a designer or manufacturer of the integrated circuits that get printed on silicon. It            imports most of them. Some of those chips are used domestically, but many are used as parts for computers, embedded systems, and other computing tools that are then exported globally. Even so, China has excelled in making large volumes of chips quickly and cheaply, and at assembling imported parts into new components or devices for export. As a result, more and more computing devices rely on Chinese manufacture in one way or another, even if China still relies on imports to fulfill those demands.The servers at the center of the Businessweek story are made by Super Micro Computer, a Silicon Valley company with a long history. The company manufactures servers that businesses can customize for specific needs, but it imports pre-built components from China used to assemble them. If such machines have been infected at the supply-chain level, in parts assembled into final products, both seller and customer might never know. (Super Micro has also issued a            strong denial of Businessweek's account.)[           China and America may be forging a new economic order]Concerns about Chinese manufacturing are not new. Earlier this year, the Federal Communications Commission voted to            prevent domestic telecommunications companies from using equipment made by Huawei and ZTE, two Chinese electronics manufacturers, citing national-security concerns. Separately, ZTE was caught selling electronics to Iran and North Korea in violation of U.S. economic sanctions. The Commerce Department also            banned U.S. companies from selling parts to ZTE (who relies on microprocessors from Qualcomm and glass from Corning, among others). The firm            agreed to pay more than $1 billion in fines to lift the ban, contingent on changes to its management and operations.These recent precedents suggest that the table is already set for further censure of Chinese computer-parts suppliers, and the rising tensions of such a fallout. The Chinese government already has been            pouring investment into the semiconductor sector in an attempt to achieve technological independence from the United States and Europe. Meanwhile, the United States remains reliant on Chinese components and assembly, as the Super Micro products affirm.Whether or not a microcontroller backdoor turns out to have been installed somewhere in the Chinese supply chain, the conditions are right for anxiety about that possibility to effect U.S. trade with China in the high-tech industry. The truth of Bloomberg Businessweek's investigation might matter less than the concerns it opens, or the open worries it further irritates-at the White House, among U.S. regulating bodies, and among the general public.The international-trade scholars Henry Farrell and Abraham Newman            speculate that those repercussions might weaponize U.S. dependence on China. If Chinese manufacturers offer the best or cheapest option for components needed for domestic manufacture, then it might become beneficial for China to take advantage of that need in order to conduct corporate or governmental espionage. The risks would be enormous, of course-the ZTE ban likely would have bankrupted the company had it not paid the hefty fine to lift it. But over time, if China's investments in local sources for parts pan out, then China might not rely on imports from the United States and Europe as much as those regions do on China.Up until now, cost has driven much of the U.S. reliance on Chinese manufacturing: In many cases, it's the best way to get lots of parts produced fast and cheap. But            there are downsides, too, like the lack of redundancy and weakened negotiating position that come from overreliance on one supplier, or on a cartel of regional ones. Labor, environmental, and political concerns are also mounting, hacked motherboards being just the most recent example. And besides all that, Chinese manufacturing has been            getting more expensive anyway.[           How China's tech revolution threatens Silicon Valley]But unlike China, the United States isn't prepared to rebuild its semiconductor and motherboard-manufacturing industries. Some of that effort still takes place domestically. Intel still            makes some of its microprocessors domestically, at plants in Arizona, New Mexico, and Oregon. Texas Instruments manufactures integrated circuits in the Dallas metro area. Micron, which makes flash memory for use in solid-state drives, has fabrication facilities in Utah and Virginia. Patriot Memory makes USB flash drives in Fremont, California. But all these and other semiconductor companies also maintain fabrication facilities in Taiwan, Dalian, and elsewhere in East Asia.Other, more prominent efforts to return product manufacturing stateside amount to strategies for publicity as much as supply-chain logistics. Tim Cook has            boasted that Apple manufactures its high-end desktop, the Mac Pro, in a factory near Austin, Texas. But that doesn't quite mean "Made in the USA"; the computers are assembled in Texas-from parts sourced globally, including from China. It's also arguably Apple's least important product line, and the U.S. manufacturer reportedly            slowed production.Even if the cost savings from offshoring manufacturing have dropped in recent years, American workers            might not want those jobs as much anymore, even if some of them also find the Trump administration's political crusade for such jobs appealing. But the alternative-building robots and artificial intelligence to do the work-only alienates blue-collar and middle-class workers even more. That means that automation            might catch on faster in China, while the West wrestles with its social and political implications.If China begins to believe that its local manufacturing capabilities will outstrip its reliance on U.S. design, parts, and materials, then the risk associated with hardware-level attacks will lower considerably, while providing substantial benefit in the form of industrial or state espionage. Soon enough, as people            start tearing down the Super Micro motherboards at the heart of the scandal,            the world will learn whether the hack is a real crisis or a false alarm.

SEN. GRASSLEY ISSUES STATEMENT ON CHINESE ESPIONAGE: IT'S CALLED CHEATING. AND IT'S ONLY GETTING WORSE.US Fed NewsDecember 12, 2018 Wednesday 10:22 PM  ESTCopyright 2018 HT Media Ltd. All Rights ReservedLength: 856 wordsBodyWASHINGTON, Dec. 12 -- Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking Member, Chuck Grassley, issued the following news release:We've heard a constant drumbeat over the past two years about the national security threats posed by Russia. Attempts to sow discord and inflame partisan differences through social media, and attempts to interfere with our elections through cyber intrusions are real threats. They should not be underestimated. I've held seven hearings on election meddling.But the media hysteria over all things Russia has distracted attention from arguably a greater, more existential threat: China's efforts to overtake the United States as the world's preeminent superpower in all phases of society. China has made no bones about doing this through any and all means. Whether it be President Xi's stated goal of becoming "the world's biggest superpower" by 2050, or the "Made in China 2025" initiative that called for a ten year overhaul of China's manufacturing and high-tech industries, the PRC's plans for superiority includes economic dominance.The United States remains the most creative, innovative society on earth. Although China has made significant strides in various sectors - including technology, telecom, advanced robotics, artificial intelligence, and scientific research - one tool of economic advancement continues to be pervasive. That's economic and other forms of espionage.In simple terms, it's called cheating. And it's only getting worse.In the past nine months alone, DOJ has investigated, charged, or convicted at least 16 individuals and four corporate entities in eight separate cases involving theft of trade secrets. Over the past five years, six more individuals have been either investigated, charged or convicted by DOJ for stealing research from American universities. One case involves a Chinese intelligence officer who is a deputy division director from China's main spy agency. He's the first Chinese intelligence official to be brought to the United States and tried in open court. A slew of other Chinese intelligence officers and hackers were charged in a multi-year plan to steal sensitive commercial aviation data. Then there is the massive plot by a Chinese government-owned company to steal U.S. semi-conductor technology. These cases, in particular, highlight the threat of Chinese state-controlled economic espionage.Just last week, we saw the arrest of the Chief Financial Officer of Huawei, the largest telecommunications company in China. And a financial firm owned by China's Ministry of Finance reportedly used various shell companies to conceal efforts to get sensitive satellite technology from Boeing. That technology has potential military applications.Although those two cases did not strictly involve espionage, they point to a broader issue: cold disinterest to American sanctions enforcement and a callous indifference for broader adherence to the rule of law.When it comes to espionage, FBI Director Wray has said "there's no country that's even close" to the People's Republic of China. General Keith Alexander called China's estimated gains from economic espionage of up to $600 billion, "the greatest transfer of wealth in history." China is believed to be responsible for 50 to 80 percent of cross-border intellectual property theft worldwide, and over 90 percent of cyber-enabled economic espionage in the United States. Reports issued this year by the White House Office on Trade and Manufacturing, the U.S. Trade Representative, and ODNI all report detailed findings on China's role as a prime cyber-attacker and thief of American intellectual property and technology.The National Institutes of Health announced in August of this year that it has discovered NIH grants are going to researchers who are not disclosing their contributions from foreign governments. Chinese "Talent programs" seek to recruit American researchers, in order to bring technological advancements back to China. Confucius Institutes, found at many of our nation's top universities, and directly funded by the Chinese government, stifle intellectual freedom and quiet all those who would criticize China with revisionist histories.In response to the growing number of cases, DOJ recently announced a new initiative to combat Chinese economic espionage. I look forward to hearing more about the initiative and any legislative proposals needed to address these problems.We often get distracted by the shiny objects in front of us. I fear that China is all too happy to have our attention deflected away from the threat they pose to our economy, our innovation, our businesses, and our very standing in the world.Nobody is in favor of billions in American IP being stolen. Nobody supports researchers violating the terms of their government grants in favor of a foreign government. We all should condemn cyberattacks on government and private sector information and systems. The question is: how can we counter these activities? I hope we can come to an answer together.

Chinese companies are urging employees to boycott Apple and buy HuaweiCNN WireDecember 11, 2018 Tuesday 1:05 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 850 wordsByline: By Ben Westcott and Yong Xiong, CNNDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  The detention of a top Huawei executive is prompting some Chinese companies and business groups to call for workers to boycott products from US companies like Apple, prompting fears of a wider backlash. Several organizations across China have issued notices urging staff members to show their support for Huawei, threatening punishment against anyone caught with Apple (AAPL) products or even offering subsidies to buy Chinese smartphones."The US aims to contain China's rise ... I believe we Chinese people should stand united and support our national products," the Nanchong Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai said in a statement this week, warning any members who bought Apple products would be "banned."The crisis began after news emerged that Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's chief financial officer and the daughter of the company's founder, was detained in Vancouver on December 1. She could face extradition to the United States, provoking fury in Chinese state media."To treat a Chinese citizen like a serious criminal, to roughly trample their basic human rights, and to dishonor their dignity, how is this the method of a civilized country? How can this not make people furious?" said an editorial in People's Daily, the official mouthpiece for the Chinese Communist Party.The growing backlash has echoes of previous boycotts in China which have followed perceived insults to the country and at times resulted in large-scale, destructive protests.In 2012, Japanese companies were attacked and at least one person was killed amid mass demonstrations staged throughout China over a territorial dispute with Japan. Similar scenes occurred in 2008, after the French government appeared to lend its support to Tibetan independence advocates. Rana Mitter, director of the University China Center at Oxford University, told CNN the boycott of US goods was the start of a pattern seen frequently in China over the past three decades.But "these things don't normally escalate to a larger level if there isn't some level of official permission to go ahead, as with the Japan demonstrations back in 2012," he said.'Stop purchasing US brands'No major companies or government departments have publicly endorsed or taken part in the calls for boycotts yet, but a range of smaller suppliers and groups have enthusiastically taken part.Shenzhen-based electronic parts supplier Menpad said Monday that it would give a 15% subsidy to any employees who bought phones from Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE (ZTCOF)."The company will punish staff who buy Apple phones with a fine of 100% of market price," the notice to all staff members said. "Stop purchasing US brands for company equipment like work computers." The notice has since been taken down and the company did not respond to CNN's attempts to contact them.In the western province of Sichuan, Chengdu RYD Information Technology said that it would only source Huawei equipment where possible from now on. It would also be offering staff a 15% subsidy on Huawei products."Chengdu RYD admires and cooperates with suppliers who have great strength and quality products and services," the midsized technology startup said on its official social media account.Luo Qiang, secretary of the Nanchong Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, told CNN the group hadn't been guided by the government in ordering a boycott but was speaking out as "grassroots" citizens."We don't have guns or cannons, we as common citizens only have freedom of speech," she told CNN. The chamber claims to have as many as 500 members.Other companies limited themselves to only supporting Huawei, without mentioning an Apple boycott, such as Xinjiang Nor-West Star Information Technology."Our company actively backs the calls to support Huawei and protect national brands with real action," the company's statement said.Trade talks to continueDespite the furious reaction to Meng's arrest and the stern denunciations in Chinese state media, Washington and Beijing are pushing ahead with trade talks.According to a statement from the Chinese Commerce Ministry, China's top trade negotiator, Liu He, spoke on the phone Tuesday with US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.The US and Chinese officials discussed "implementing the agreements" reached by US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the G20 in Buenos Aires earlier in December, the statement said.The two sides gave themselves 90 days to reach a lasting agreement. The Trump administration has threatened it could increase tariffs on Chinese goods from 10% to 25% if no deal is reached by March 1.Mitter said the Chinese government would want to avoid any larger boycotts or backlash against the United States or Canada while the trade talks were ongoing because of fears the US government might pull out."The stakes are very, very high in terms of the overall trade dispute between the US and China," he said.CNN's Serenitie Wang and Nanlin Fang contributed to this article.TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Open Letter: Response to Google on Project Dragonfly, China, and Human RightsTargeted News ServiceDecember 10, 2018 Monday 5:47 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1883 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyHuman Rights Watch issued the following letter:To: Ben Gomes, Vice President of Search; Kent Walker, Senior Vice President of Global Affairs; Scott Beaumont, Vice President, Greater China &#38; Korea)Dear Mr Pichai,We are writing to ask you to ensure that Google drops Project Dragonfly and any plans to launch a censored search app in China, and to re-affirm the company's 2010 commitment that it won't provide censored search services in the country.We are disappointed that Google in its letter of 26 October[1] failed to address the serious concerns of human rights groups over Project Dragonfly. Instead of addressing the substantive issues set out in the August letter,[2] Google's response - along with further details that have since emerged about Project Dragonfly - only heightens our fear that the company may knowingly compromise its commitments to human rights and freedom of expression, in exchange for access to the Chinese search market.We stand with current and former Google employees speaking out over recent ethical scandals at the company, including Project Dragonfly. We wholeheartedly support the message from hundreds of Google employees asking Google to drop Dragonfly in their open letter of 27 November, and commend their bravery in speaking out publicly. We echo their statement that their "opposition to Dragonfly is not about China: we object to technologies that aid the powerful in oppressing the vulnerable, wherever they may be." [3]New details leaked to the media strongly suggest that if Google launches such a product it would facilitate repressive state censorship, surveillance, and other violations affecting nearly a billion people in China. Media reports state that Google has built a prototype that censors "blacklisted" search terms including "human rights", "student protest" and "Nobel Prize", including in journalistic content, and links users' search queries to personal phone numbers.[4] The app would also force users to sign in to use the service, track and store location information and search histories, and provide "unilateral access" to such data to an unnamed Chinese joint venture company, in line with China's data localization law - allowing the government virtually unfettered access to this information.[5]Facilitating Chinese authorities' access to personal data, as described in media reports, would be particularly reckless. If such features were launched, there is a real risk that Google would directly assist the Chinese government in arresting or imprisoning people simply for expressing their views online, making the company complicit in human rights violations. This risk was identified by Google's own security and privacy review team, according to former and current Google employees. Despite attempts to minimize internal scrutiny, a team tasked with assessing Dragonfly concluded that Google "would be expected to function in China as part of the ruling Communist Party's authoritarian system of policing and surveillance," according to a media report.[6]Actively aiding China's censorship and surveillance regime is likely to set a terrible precedent for human rights and press freedoms worldwide. A recent Freedom House report warned that the Chinese government is actively promoting its model of pervasive digital censorship and surveillance around the world.[7] Many governments look to China's example, and a major industry leader's acquiescence to such demands will likely cause many other regimes to follow China's lead, provoking a race to the bottom in standards. It would also undermine efforts by Google and other companies to resist government surveillance requests in order to protect users' privacy and security,[8] emboldening state intelligence and security agencies to demand greater access to user data.Google's letter makes several specific points that are directly contradicted by other sources. The letter states that it is "not close" to launching a search product in China, and that before doing so the company would consult with key stakeholders. However, as reported by the media, comments made in July by Ben Gomes, Google's Head of Search, suggested the product could be "six to nine months [to launch]" and stressed the importance of having a product ready to be "brought off the shelf and quickly deployed" so that "we don't miss that window if it ever comes."[9]The letter also states that Google worked on Dragonfly simply to "explore" the possibility of re-entering the Chinese search market, and that it does not know whether it "would or could" launch such a product. Yet media reports based on an internal Google memo suggest that the project was in a "pretty advanced state" and that the company had invested extensive resources to its development.[10]Google's decision to design and build Dragonfly in the first place is troubling. Google's own AI Principles commit the company not to "design or deploy" (emphasis added) technologies whose purpose contravenes human rights. Given the company's history in China and the assessment of its own security team, Google is well aware of the human rights implications of providing such an application. Moreover, Google's letter fails to answer many questions about what steps, if any, the company is taking to safeguard human rights, including with respect to its current Chinese mobile app offerings, consistent with its commitments.We urge Google to heed concerns from its own employees and from organizations and individuals across the political spectrum by abandoning Project Dragonfly and reaffirming its commitment not to provide censored search services in China. We also note that the letter makes no reference to whistle-blowers, and thus we urgently repeat our call to the company that it must publicly commit to protect the rights of whistle-blowers and other workers voicing rights concerns.We welcome that Google has confirmed the company "takes seriously" its responsibility to respect human rights. However, the company has so far failed to explain how it reconciles that responsibility with the company's decision to design a product purpose-built to undermine the rights to freedom of expression and privacy.Signed, the following organizations:Access NowActiveWatch - Media Monitoring Agency (MMA)Adil Soz - International Foundation for Protection of Freedom of SpeechAmericans for Democracy &#38; Human Rights in Bahrain (ADHRB)Amnesty InternationalArticle 19Articulo 12 - Son Tus DatosAssociation for Progressive CommunicationsAsociacion para una Ciudadania ParticipativaBolo BhiBriar ProjectBytes for All (B4A)Cartoonists Rights Network, International (CRNI)Center for Democracy &#38; TechnologyCenter for Media Freedom and Responsibility (CMFR)Center for Independent Journalism (CIJ)Child Rights International Network (CRIN)Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ)Electronic Freedom Foundation (EFF)Foro de Periodismo Argentino (FOPEA)Freedom of the Press FoundationFreedom ForumFundacion Datos Protegidos (Chile)Fundacion Internet BoliviaGlobe International Center (GIC)Hong Kong Journalists AssociationHuman Rights in China (HRIC)Human Rights FirstHuman Rights WatchIndependent Chinese PEN Center (ICPC)Independent Journalism Center (IJC)Index on CensorshipInitiative for Freedom of Expression - TurkeyInterfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR)International Campaign for TibetInternational Service for Human Rights (ISHR)International Tibet Network SecretariatInternet Sans FrontieresLatin American Observatory of Regulation, Media and Convergence - OBSERVACOMMedia Rights Agenda (MRA)Mediacentar SarajevoNetBlocksNetwork of Chinese Human Rights Defenders (CHRD)New America's Open Technology InstituteNorwegian PENOpenMediaPacific Island News AssociationPalestinian Center for Development and Media Freedoms (MADA)PEN InternationalPEN AmericaPrivacy InternationalReporters Without Borders (RSF)Software Freedom Law Center, India (SFLC.in)South East Europe Media Organisation (SEEMO)Southeast Asian Press Alliance (SEAPA)Students for a Free TibetSyrian Center for Media and Freedom of Expression (SCM)Tibet Action InstituteViet TanWITNESSWorld Uyghur CongressSigned in individual capacity (affiliations for identification purposes only):Chinmayi ArunAssistant Professor, National Law University DelhiArturo J.

Australia joins condemnation of 'huge, audacious' Chinese hacking plotStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeDecember 22, 2018 SaturdayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: WORLD-NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 789 wordsByline: Steven ClarkeBodyChina for long has fended off allegations of cyber-attacks from the U.S. and other countries.She also accused United States of indulging in cyber espionage against China and other countries."This is stealing commercial secrets that are the lifeblood of factories, the lifeblood of consultancies, the lifeblood of businesses", Alastair MacGibbon, the head of the Australian Cyber Security, said.The U.S. Justice Department announced indictments accusing Chinese officials of coordinating a decade-long espionage campaign to steal intellectual property and other data from dozens of companies, drawing a strong denial from China.Two Chinese nationals, Zhu Hua and Zhang Shilong, were accused Thursday of coordinating with state security officials in an "extensive" hacking campaign, allegedly infiltrating 45 USA companies and government agencies, as well as other firms in more than a dozen countries.United States and British authorities on Thursday also condemned China for violating 2015 agreements to curb cyber espionage for business purposes, slamming Chinese efforts to steal other countries' trade secrets and technologies and to compromise government computers.One Whitehall official said targeting such large organisations gave the hackers a "jumping-off point" into the wider corporate world, making it hard to assess just how far they had penetrated.Zhu and Zhang worked for Huaying Haitai Science and Technology Development Company in the north China city of Tianjin, and acted on behalf of the security ministry's bureau there, U.S. deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein said."China's goal, simply put, is to replace the USA as the world's leading superpower and they're using illegal methods to get there", FBI Director Chris Wray told a news conference, adding that the companies targeted by China were a "who's who" of U.S. businesses.China called the USA arrogant and selfish on Friday after two Chinese citizens were charged with stealing American trade secrets and other sensitive information on behalf ofBeijing's main intelligence agency.There was a dip in activity after the deal was signed (which followed a period of pressure by Washington, including the indictment of Chinese military hackers and the threat of sanctions).NASA figured out when it disappears, the rings of SaturnThe research actually began with scientists trying to figure out if Saturn formed with its rings or acquired them later. Previously there was speculation that the rings are attracted to the Saturn in 1980-ies.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, speaking Thursday on Fox Business Network, said the case was unrelated to ongoing trade negotiations with China, but that cyber-security has consistently been part of the talks.The alleged hackers, Zhu Hua and Zhang Shilong, each face one count of conspiracy to commit computer intrusions (a maximum 5-year sentence), one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud (a maximum 20-year-sentence) and one count of aggravated identity theft (a mandatory 2-year sentence).Over the course of the MSP Theft Campaign, Zhu, Zhang and their co-conspirators in the APT10 Group successfully obtained unauthorised access to computers providing services to or belonging to victim companies located in at least 12 countries, including Brazil, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, India, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates, the UK and the US."America and its many allies know what China is doing", Rosenstein said.A Beijing-based attorney said the US doesn't have an extradition treaty with China, but the men could be detained if they travel to countries signed with the U.S.GCHQ's summary (PDF, 6 pages) of APT10's tactics said: "Industry partners have reported that data exfiltrated often relates to human resources information, suggesting an interest in the targeted company specifically, as well as potentially developing access to customers and suppliers".Top US Department of Justice officials said the indictment shows thatBeijing has not fulfilled its pledge to stop such actions.Tensions between Washington andBeijing are high over tit-for-tat trade tariffs and after Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies, was arrested in Canada at the request of the United States.The ministry emphasized that the Chinese government had never been engaged in theft of commercial data."The U.S.is a world superpower, and it's quite arrogant and selfish", Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said during a press briefing Friday.USA complaints of cyberespionage and other means of IP theft (including forced technology transfers as a condition to enter the Chinese market) are at the core of the ongoing trade dispute with China.Load-Date: December 23, 2018End of Document

Trump administration alleges China hasn't 'altered' unfair trade practicesCNN.comNovember 20, 2018 Tuesday 8:46 PM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICSLength: 1087 wordsByline: By Donna Borak, CNNDateline: Washington BodyThe Trump administration on Tuesday continued to ratchet up pressure on China, releasing an updated report showing Beijing has done little to fix its unfair practices less than two weeks before the leaders of the two economic superpowers plan to meet.The 50-page report by the Office of the Trade Representative concluded that China has "not altered" its policies and practices tied to technology transfers, intellectual property and innovation as part of the US government's ongoing investigation launched last August. The Trump administration has been urging Beijing to address those top concerns as part of its on-and-off-again trade negotiations.Instead, the country's top trade official warned that China "appears to have taken further unreasonable actions in recent months," including continuing to apply strict restrictions on foreign investment as a way to pressure US companies to transfer technology to Chinese firms."China shows no signs of ceasing its policy and practice of conducting and supporting cyber-enabled theft and intrusions into the commercial networks of US companies," the sweeping report said. Such illicit activity has led to economic espionage by the Chinese government which has stolen trillions of dollars in intellectual property, the US government said. It also pointed to how Chinese state-sponsored hackers have developed even better tools to conceal cyberattacks.The scolding report by America's top trade negotiator heightens uncertainty over the ability of President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping to reach a truce when they meet in Argentina on the sidelines of the G20 meeting.The Trump administration has already slapped tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese products since July. The tariffs on $200 billion of those goods are set to increase from 10% to 25% on January 1, which would further escalate the conflict.China has retaliated with tariffs on $110 billion in US products and is likely to respond with more if the United States goes ahead with the increase in January.The Argentina meeting is the only scheduled opportunity for a direct tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte between Trump and Xi, though the two leaders exchanged direct visits in 2017. Trump welcomed Xi at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida with a lavish banquet and a singing performance in Mandarin by his granddaughter Arabella.Larry Kudlow, the White House economic adviser, raised the stakes earlier Tuesday, warning that he anticipated a direct confrontation between with China over trade shortly after plans collapsed for high-level discussions in Washington."It will come to a head at the G20, I think that's the key point," Kudlow told reporters at the White House.His comments came after a high-level Chinese delegation delayed and then canceled its trip to the US capital amid an escalating war of words between Trump and Xi.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang announced Tuesday in a statement that Vice Premier Lui He will travel to Germany on Sunday at the invitation of Olaf Scholz, the vice chancellor and finance minister.A US Treasury spokesman declined to comment on the status of the negotiations.Trump last Friday described a list of 142 concessions offered by the Chinese as "not acceptable," though he also expressed optimism that he could reach a deal with China before January 1.The tariffs have drawn complaints from American businesses, which are responsible for paying the import duties. They also have spurred concerns about renewed inflation, just as the Federal Reserve is set to raise interest rates in December.Vice President Mike Pence subsequently increased pressure on Beijing in his remarks over the weekend to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Papua New Guinea.The No. 2 US administration official warned that Trump wasn't in a rush to end the trade war he had started earlier this year and was willing to "more than double" the tariffs it has placed on $250 billion in Chinese goods.

Trump administration alleges China hasn't 'altered' unfair trade practicesCNN WireNovember 21, 2018 Wednesday 1:46 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1105 wordsByline: By Donna Borak, CNNDateline: WASHINGTON (CNN) BodyWASHINGTON (CNN) --  The Trump administration on Tuesday continued to ratchet up pressure on China, releasing an updated report showing Beijing has done little to fix its unfair practices less than two weeks before the leaders of the two economic superpowers plan to meet. The 50-page report by the Office of the Trade Representative concluded that China has "not altered" its policies and practices tied to technology transfers, intellectual property and innovation as part of the US government's ongoing investigation launched last August. The Trump administration has been urging Beijing to address those top concerns as part of its on-and-off-again trade negotiations. Instead, the country's top trade official warned that China "appears to have taken further unreasonable actions in recent months," including continuing to apply strict restrictions on foreign investment as a way to pressure US companies to transfer technology to Chinese firms. "China shows no signs of ceasing its policy and practice of conducting and supporting cyber-enabled theft and intrusions into the commercial networks of US companies," the sweeping report said. Such illicit activity has led to economic espionage by the Chinese government which has stolen trillions of dollars in intellectual property, the US government said. It also pointed to how Chinese state-sponsored hackers have developed even better tools to conceal cyberattacks. The scolding report by America's top trade negotiator heightens uncertainty over the ability of President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping to reach a truce when they meet in Argentina on the sidelines of the G20 meeting. The Trump administration has already slapped tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese products since July. The tariffs on $200 billion of those goods are set to increase from 10% to 25% on January 1, which would further escalate the conflict. China has retaliated with tariffs on $110 billion in US products and is likely to respond with more if the United States goes ahead with the increase in January. The Argentina meeting is the only scheduled opportunity for a direct tête-à-tête between Trump and Xi, though the two leaders exchanged direct visits in 2017. Trump welcomed Xi at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida with a lavish banquet and a singing performance in Mandarin by his granddaughter Arabella. Larry Kudlow, the White House economic adviser, raised the stakes earlier Tuesday, warning that he anticipated a direct confrontation between with China over trade shortly after plans collapsed for high-level discussions in Washington. "It will come to a head at the G20, I think that's the key point," Kudlow told reporters at the White House. His comments came after a high-level Chinese delegation delayed and then canceled its trip to the US capital amid an escalating war of words between Trump and Xi.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang announced Tuesday in a statement that Vice Premier Lui He will travel to Germany on Sunday at the invitation of Olaf Scholz, the vice chancellor and finance minister.A US Treasury spokesman declined to comment on the status of the negotiations.Trump last Friday described a list of 142 concessions offered by the Chinese as "not acceptable," though he also expressed optimism that he could reach a deal with China before January 1.The tariffs have drawn complaints from American businesses, which are responsible for paying the import duties. They also have spurred concerns about renewed inflation, just as the Federal Reserve is set to raise interest rates in December.Vice President Mike Pence subsequently increased pressure on Beijing in his remarks over the weekend to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Papua New Guinea.The No. 2 US administration official warned that Trump wasn't in a rush to end the trade war he had started earlier this year and was willing to "more than double" the tariffs it has placed on $250 billion in Chinese goods. The United States "will not change course until China changes its ways," Pence said in his speech."It's possible that it's a negotiating tactic," said David Dollar, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who's a former economic and financial emissary to China for the Treasury Department, referring to the vice president's speech. "Let the Chinese hawks have their free rein to get the Chinese scared of potentially what might happen." The Trump administration has been divided between free traders -- including those with Wall Street backgrounds, like Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Kudlow -- and hardliners like Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and White House trade adviser Peter Navarro. It's been unclear who among them has Trump's ear, but close China watchers cautioned ahead of the release of the updated report that Lighthizer has played a pivotal role in steering the administration's trade strategy on China and elsewhere. "He's delivered," said Scott Kennedy, deputy director of the Freeman Chair in China Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

US panel warns against government purchase of Chinese techAssociated Press InternationalNovember 14, 2018 Wednesday 2:22 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 601 wordsByline: By MATTHEW PENNINGTON, Associated PressDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) - A congressional advisory panel says the purchase of internet-linked devices manufactured in China leaves the United States vulnerable to security breaches that could put critical infrastructure at risk.In its annual report on Wednesday, the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission warns of dangers to the U.S. government and private sector from a reliance on global supply chains linked to China, which is the world's largest manufacturer of information technology equipment.China's push to dominate in the high-tech industry by 2025 already is a sore point with Washington and a contributing factor in trade tensions that have seen the world's two largest economies slap billions of dollars in punitive tariffs on each other's products this year.The U.S. also has had long-running concerns about state-backed cyber theft of corporate secrets, something that China agreed to stop in 2015. But the bipartisan commission highlights the potential security risks to the United States by China's pre-eminence in the so-called internet of things, or IoT, which refers to the proliferation of physical devices that have sensors that collect and share data and connect to the internet. Such devices could be everything from household appliances like refrigerators and air conditioners to warehouse delivery systems, smart traffic signs and aerial drones."The scale of Chinese state support for the IoT, the close supply chain integration between the United States and China, and China's role as an economic and military competitor to the United States creates enormous economic, security, supply chain, and data privacy risks for the United States," the report says.The commission, which does not set policy but can make recommendations to Congress and the U.S. administration, is warning that the potential impact of malicious cyberattacks through such systems will intensify with the adoption of ultra-fast 5G networks that could quicken data speeds by up to 100 times."The lax security protections and universal connectivity of IoT devices creates numerous points of vulnerability that hackers or malicious state actors can exploit to hold U.S. critical infrastructure, businesses, and individuals at risk," the report says.The United States has already taken some steps to restrict the use of Chinese-made high technology. For example, it has restricted government procurement from Chinese tech giants Huawei and ZTE, which deny their products are used for spying by China's authoritarian government.In June, the Defense Department suspended the purchase of all commercial, off-the-shelf drones until a cybersecurity risk assessment strategy was established. In 2017, U.S. customs authorities alleged that drones produced by Chinese company DJI, which has dominated the U.S. and Canadian drone markets, likely provided China with access to U.S. critical infrastructure and law enforcement data. DJI denied the allegation.The commission is calling for Congress to push for assessments by U.S. government agencies on their supply chain vulnerabilities. It says the U.S. government depends on commercial, off-the-shelf products, many of them made in China, for more than 95 percent of its electronics components and information technology systems.Large U.S. telecommunications providers also rely on global supply chains dominated by Chinese manufacturers. Although they do not source directly from Huawei and ZTE, major U.S. telecommunications providers rely on other foreign 5G network equipment suppliers that incorporate Chinese manufacturing in their supply chains, the report says.Load-Date: November 15, 2018End of Document

Chinese executive facing US extradition to appear in courtThe Daily Universe: Brigham Young UniversityDecember 7, 2018 FridayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: WORLD; Pg. 1Length: 1167 wordsBodyForeigners look at a Huawei computer at a Huawei store in Beijing, China, Thursday, Dec. 6. Canadian authorities said Wednesday that they have arrested the chief financial officer of China's Huawei Technologies for possible extradition to the United States. (AP Photo/Ng Han Guan)A Chinese telecommunications executive will appear in court Friday to seek bail, the latest development in a surprising legal wrangle that raises doubts about whether a U.S.-China trade cease-fire can hold.The arrest of Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of the Chinese telecom giant Huawei, came as a jarring surprise after Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping agreed to a trade truce last weekend in Buenos Aires, Argentina.Fears of renewed U.S.-China trade hostilities have rattled global financial markets. They tumbled Thursday. Stocks regained their equilibrium Friday in Europe and Asia after conciliatory words from Beijing but fell again on Wall Street.The bail hearing for Meng, who faces possible extradition to the United States after her arrest in Vancouver, Canada, last weekend, was set for later Friday. Meng requested a court publication ban that covers pretty much everything except her name.Huawei has been a subject of U.S. national security concerns for years and Meng's case echoes well beyond tariffs or market access. Washington and Beijing are locked in a clash between the world's two largest economies for economic and political dominance for decades to come."It's a much broader issue than just a trade dispute," said Amanda DeBusk, chair of the international trade practice at Dechert LLP. "It pulls in: Who is going to be the world leader essentially."Meng was detained on the same day that Trump and Xi met at the Group of 20 summit in Argentina and agreed to a cease-fire in their trade war. The Globe and Mail newspaper, citing law enforcement sources, reported she is suspected of trying to evade U.S. sanctions on Iran.Huawei is the world's biggest supplier of network gear used by phone and internet companies and long has been seen as a front for spying by the Chinese military or security services. A U.S. National Security Agency cybersecurity adviser, Rob Joyce, last month accused Beijing of violating a 2015 agreement with the U.S. to halt electronic theft of intellectual property.Other nations are increasingly being forced to choose between Chinese and U.S. suppliers for next-generation "5G" wireless technology. U.S. critics are lobbying other countries not to buy the equipment from Huawei, arguing that the company may be working stealthily for Beijing's spymasters."There is ample evidence to suggest that no major Chinese company is independent of the Chinese government and Communist Party - and Huawei, which China's government and military tout as a 'national champion' is no exception," Sens. Mark Warner, D-Va., and Marco Rubio, R-Fla., wrote in October to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. They urged him to keep Huawei off Canada's next-generation network.Still, a senior Japanese official cast doubt Friday over reports that his country was considering blocking Huawei and its biggest Chinese rival, ZTE Corp., from government procurement contracts. He said there had been no decision. Australia, New Zealand and Britain are among the countries that have moved to limit the Chinese companies' involvement in their next-generation telecoms networks.In a sign Meng's case might not derail the Trump-Xi truce, Beijing protested Meng's arrest but said talks with the Trump administration would go ahead. Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesman Gao Feng said China is confident it can reach a deal during the 90 days that Trump agreed to suspend a scheduled increase in U.S. import taxes on $200 billion worth of Chinese products.Some analysts say China has deployed predatory tactics in its drive to overtake America's dominance in technology and global economic leadership, such as forcing American and other foreign companies to hand over trade secrets in exchange for access to the Chinese market and engaging in cyber theft.Washington also regards Beijing's ambitious long-term development plan, "Made in China 2025," as a scheme to dominate such fields as robotics and electric vehicles by unfairly subsidizing Chinese companies and discriminating against foreign competitors.Priscilla Moriuchi, a former East Asia specialist at National Security Agency and now with the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future, said both Huawei and its biggest Chinese rival, ZTE Corp., are wedded to China's military and political leadership."The threat from these companies lies in their access to critical internet backbone infrastructure," she said.The Trump administration has tightened regulations on high-tech exports to China and made it harder for Chinese firms to invest in U.S. companies or to buy American technology in cutting-edge areas like robotics, artificial intelligence and virtual reality.Earlier this year, the United States nearly drove ZTE out of business for selling equipment to North Korea and Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions. But Trump issued a reprieve, perhaps partly because U.S. tech companies, major suppliers to ZTE, would also have been scorched. ZTE agreed to pay a $1 billion fine, change its board and management and let American regulators monitor its operations.The U.S. and Chinese tech industries depend on each other so much for components that "it is very hard to decouple the two without punishing U.S. companies, without shooting ourselves in the foot," said Adam Segal, cyberspace analyst at the Council on Foreign Relations.Dean Garfield, president of the U.S. Information Technology Industry Council trade group, said innovation by U.S. companies often depends utterly on product development and testing by Chinese partners and component suppliers.Still, the pushback against Huawei and ZTE is limiting their reach into the world's richest markets. Nearly a year ago, AT&T pulled out of a deal to sell Huawei smartphones. Barred from use by U.S. government agencies and contractors, they're mostly locked out of the American market.Derek Scissors, a China specialist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, doubts that China will change its tech policies since it needs innovative technologies to keep its economy growing as its labor force ages and it confronts a huge stockpile of debt."We're not going to deal that away in 90 days," he said. "I don't see a way out of this."Likewise, Rod Hunter, an international economic official in President George W. Bush's White House and a partner at law firm Baker McKenzie, said, "I'm skeptical that the Chinese are going to want to say 'uncle.'"U.S. and Chinese officials are "trying to tackle a problem that is going to take years, maybe a decade, to resolve," he said.___Gillies reported from Toronto and Wiseman reported from Washington.

China's IP Commitment is a victory for U.S.The Hillsdale Collegian: Hillsdale CollegeDecember 6, 2018 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: OPINION; Pg. 1Length: 797 wordsBodyDonald Trump, via Wiki­media CommonsThe Trump Admin­is­tration achieved one of its biggest trade vic­tories on Tuesday when China's National Devel­opment and Reform Com­mission announced new pun­ish­ments for Chinese theft of intel­lectual property .Though the main­stream media has barely covered it, this new com­mitment from China amounts to one of the most impactful vic­tories in the trade battle to date. Every year, American com­panies fall victim to hun­dreds of bil­lions of dollars worth of IP theft at the hands of the Chinese.China's IP abuses against the U.S. come in a number of ways: Forced tech­nology transfers are one of the major offenses, wherein China's "joint venture requirement" forces U.S. com­panies looking to do business in China to transfer their tech­nology to Chinese firms.American firms are likewise coerced into pro­viding China's state-owned enter­prises with below-market acqui­sition and licensing terms. China then asserts own­ership over the licensed tech­nology, as well as own­ership of any later tech­no­logical advances. If U.S. com­panies refuse to hand over their secrets, the Chinese gov­ernment carries out police raids on company offices.Other methods of Chinese IP theft include copy­right infringement, large-scale coun­ter­feiting of goods, and software piracy. Cor­porate espi­onage is a problem, too: Beijing recruits employees within certain U.S. com­panies to sell those com­panies' secrets."You can't find a company that hasn't been assaulted, and half of them don't even know it," says Dr. Richard Ellings, exec­utive director of the Com­mission on the Theft of American Intel­lectual Property.The esti­mated cost of these vio­la­tions? Any­where from the low end of $225 billion, up to $600 billion per year, according to a 2017 report from U.S. Trade rep­re­sen­tative Robert Lighthizer.With this change in policy, however, offenders will be noted on a reg­istry, which financial insti­tu­tions will ref­erence when lending money and granting access to foreign exchange. Offenders' access to capital and gov­ernment funding will be cut off, as will their access to foreign trade and company reg­is­tration.As recently as last month, China denied IP theft even occurred. Any claims of Chinese wrong­doing are based on hearsay and ignore reality, a spokesman for China's Min­istry of Com­merce claimed.And buried even deeper in Tuesday's announcement was another big win for the U.S. in regards to the opioid epi­demic. According to the White House Press Sec­retary, China has agreed to des­ignate Fen­tanyl as a con­trolled sub­stance, meaning that the dis­trib­utors of Chinese Fen­tanyl in the U.S. will be subject to China's maximum penalty under the law.Fen­tanyl is the dead­liest drug in our country today, and a 2017 con­gres­sional report iden­tified China as the primary source of origin for Fen­tanyl in the United States. In 2017, the drug was respon­sible for the deaths of 30,000 Amer­icans, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.All of this speaks to a simple point: Com­merce is an instrument of national policy, to be used to achieve both political and eco­nomic ends.China cer­tainly under­stands this. Chinese tariffs have been crafted to specif­i­cally target red-state indus­tries, such as auto­mobile man­u­fac­turers and soybean farmers. In other words, Chinese tariffs are designed to specif­i­cally weaken Trump's base.The American Founders under­stood this, too. Throughout the Fed­er­alist Papers, Publius makes the point that trade in a com­mercial republic is a method of achieving national greatness.Inde­pen­dence doesn't just mean the absence of foreign rule, Publius argues. It also means that other nations will not pre­scribe for us the con­di­tions of our political exis­tence. In a world of com­peting nations, com­merce isn't simply for cheaper material goods: It is a means to achieve national inde­pen­dence and the con­di­tions needed to maintain it.And it's an instrument Trump is wielding effec­tively."I am a Tariff Man," Trump tweeted Tuesday. "When people or coun­tries come in to raid the great wealth of our Nation, I want them to pay for the priv­ilege of doing so. It will always be the best way to max out our eco­nomic power."With this, Trump is telling other nations: If you want the priv­ilege of access to our market - the largest con­sumer market in the world - you must treat us right, or face the con­se­quences.And China is responding accord­ingly.Of course, Beijing may not follow through on their promises. But tariffs brought China to the table, and they know the con­se­quences of breaking their promises may prompt serious action on the part of the U.S.Because now, they're dealing with a Tariff Man.Gar­rison Grisedale is a senior studying pol­iticsLoad-Date: December 6, 2018End of Document

SEN. GRASSLEY ISSUES STATEMENT ON CHINA'S NON-TRADITIONAL ESPIONAGE AGAINST USUS Fed NewsDecember 12, 2018 Wednesday 6:07 PM  ESTCopyright 2018 HT Media Ltd. All Rights ReservedLength: 852 wordsBodyWASHINGTON, Dec. 12 -- The office of Sen. Charles E. Grassley issued the following statement:We've heard a constant drumbeat over the past two years about the national security threats posed by Russia. Attempts to sow discord and inflame partisan differences through social media, and attempts to interfere with our elections through cyber intrusions are real threats. They should not be underestimated. I've held seven hearings on election meddling.But the media hysteria over all things Russia has distracted attention from arguably a greater, more existential threat: China's efforts to overtake the United States as the world's preeminent superpower in all phases of society. China has made no bones about doing this through any and all means. Whether it be President Xi's stated goal of becoming "the world's biggest superpower" by 2050, or the "Made in China 2025" initiative that called for a ten year overhaul of China's manufacturing and high-tech industries, the PRC's plans for superiority includes economic dominance.The United States remains the most creative, innovative society on earth. Although China has made significant strides in various sectors - including technology, telecom, advanced robotics, artificial intelligence, and scientific research - one tool of economic advancement continues to be pervasive. That's economic and other forms of espionage.In simple terms, it's called cheating. And it's only getting worse.In the past nine months alone, DOJ has investigated, charged, or convicted at least 16 individuals and four corporate entities in eight separate cases involving theft of trade secrets. Over the past five years, six more individuals have been either investigated, charged or convicted by DOJ for stealing research from American universities. One case involves a Chinese intelligence officer who is a deputy division director from China's main spy agency. He's the first Chinese intelligence official to be brought to the United States and tried in open court. A slew of other Chinese intelligence officers and hackers were charged in a multi-year plan to steal sensitive commercial aviation data. Then there is the massive plot by a Chinese government-owned company to steal U.S. semi-conductor technology. These cases, in particular, highlight the threat of Chinese state-controlled economic espionage.Just last week, we saw the arrest of the Chief Financial Officer of Huawei, the largest telecommunications company in China. And a financial firm owned by China's Ministry of Finance reportedly used various shell companies to conceal efforts to get sensitive satellite technology from Boeing. That technology has potential military applications.Although those two cases did not strictly involve espionage, they point to a broader issue: cold disinterest to American sanctions enforcement and a callous indifference for broader adherence to the rule of law.When it comes to espionage, FBI Director Wray has said "there's no country that's even close" to the People's Republic of China. General Keith Alexander called China's estimated gains from economic espionage of up to $600 billion, "the greatest transfer of wealth in history." China is believed to be responsible for 50 to 80 percent of cross-border intellectual property theft worldwide, and over 90 percent of cyber-enabled economic espionage in the United States. Reports issued this year by the White House Office on Trade and Manufacturing, the U.S. Trade Representative, and ODNI all report detailed findings on China's role as a prime cyber-attacker and thief of American intellectual property and technology.The National Institutes of Health announced in August of this year that it has discovered NIH grants are going to researchers who are not disclosing their contributions from foreign governments. Chinese "Talent programs" seek to recruit American researchers, in order to bring technological advancements back to China. Confucius Institutes, found at many of our nation's top universities, and directly funded by the Chinese government, stifle intellectual freedom and quiet all those who would criticize China with revisionist histories.In response to the growing number of cases, DOJ recently announced a new initiative to combat Chinese economic espionage. I look forward to hearing more about the initiative and any legislative proposals needed to address these problems.We often get distracted by the shiny objects in front of us. I fear that China is all too happy to have our attention deflected away from the threat they pose to our economy, our innovation, our businesses, and our very standing in the world.Nobody is in favor of billions in American IP being stolen. Nobody supports researchers violating the terms of their government grants in favor of a foreign government. We all should condemn cyberattacks on government and private sector information and systems. The question is: how can we counter these activities? I hope we can come to an answer together.

A slew of other Chinese intelligence officers and hackers were charged in a multi-year plan to steal sensitive commercial aviation data. Then there is the massive plot by a Chinese government-owned company to steal U.S. semi-conductor technology. These cases, in particular, highlight the threat of Chinese state-controlled economic espionage."Just last week, we saw the arrest of the Chief Financial Officer of Huawei, the largest telecommunications company in China. And a financial firm owned by China's Ministry of Finance reportedly used various shell companies to conceal efforts to get sensitive satellite technology from Boeing. That technology has potential military applications."Although those two cases did not strictly involve espionage, they point to a broader issue: cold disinterest to American sanctions enforcement and a callous indifference for broader adherence to the rule of law."When it comes to espionage, FBI Director Wray has said "there's no country that's even close" to the People's Republic of China. General Keith Alexander called China's estimated gains from economic espionage of up to $600 billion, "the greatest transfer of wealth in history." China is believed to be responsible for 50 to 80 percent of cross-border intellectual property theft worldwide, and over 90 percent of cyber-enabled economic espionage in the United States. Reports issued this year by the White House Office on Trade and Manufacturing, the U.S. Trade Representative, and ODNI all report detailed findings on China's role as a prime cyber-attacker and thief of American intellectual property and technology."The National Institutes of Health announced in August of this year that it has discovered NIH grants are going to researchers who are not disclosing their contributions from foreign governments. Chinese "Talent programs" seek to recruit American researchers, in order to bring technological advancements back to China. Confucius Institutes, found at many of our nation's top universities, and directly funded by the Chinese government, stifle intellectual freedom and quiet all those who would criticize China with revisionist histories."In response to the growing number of cases, DOJ recently announced a new initiative to combat Chinese economic espionage. I look forward to hearing more about the initiative and any legislative proposals needed to address these problems."We often get distracted by the shiny objects in front of us. I fear that China is all too happy to have our attention deflected away from the threat they pose to our economy, our innovation, our businesses, and our very standing in the world."Nobody is in favor of billions in American IP being stolen. Nobody supports researchers violating the terms of their government grants in favor of a foreign government. We all should condemn cyberattacks on government and private sector information and systems. The question is: how can we counter these activities? I hope we can come to an answer together."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6548817 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: December 13, 2018End of Document

MENENDEZ PRESSES TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ON FAILURE TO POLICE CHINESE ACQUISITION OF CRITICAL U.S. TECHNOLOGYStates News ServiceDecember 11, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 1174 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by New Jersey Senator Robert Menendez:Letter comes after WSJ reported a Chinese state-owned firm may become the beneficial owner of critical U.S. technology, potentially exposing it to Chinas governmentTuesday, December 11, 2018WASHINGTON United States Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), senior member of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, and Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today asked Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to explain how a Chinese state-owned firm was able to use offshore companies to potentially acquire restricted American technology. According to a December 4 article in the Wall Street Journal, China Orient used subsidiaries and offshore third parties to evade U.S. export control laws and acquire a majority stake in a U.S. company seeking to purchase a U.S.-made satellite. Senator Menendez sent the Secretaries a list of thirteen detailed questions about the transaction, and urged them to commit to provide briefings on any review of the deal.Failure to review this and other similarly-situated transactions, in which Chinese stated-owned entities may gain footholds in sensitive technologies, poses a significant threat to U.S. national security, wrote the Senator.Menendez authored an amendment in the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 that granted the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) authority to mandate declarations for suspect transactions like China Orients. The law, which passed on August 13, 2018, allows CFIUS to mandate the disclosure of investments by state-owned companies that use opaque corporate structures or financing arrangements to evade CFIUS review and gain access to critical U.S. technology.The text of the letter can be found here and below:Dear Secretary Mnuchin and Secretary Ross,I write to bring to your attention to reports that a Chinese state-owned firm may have used a complex financial deal to evade U.S. export controls and review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). As a result, the Chinese state-owned firm may ultimately become the beneficial owner of critical U.S. technology, potentially exposing that technology to Chinas government or military.A December 4 article by The Wall Street Journal states that China Orient Asset Management Co. (China Orient), a firm owned by Chinas Ministry of Finance, sought a stake in Global IP, a U.S. startup that was seeking to acquire a satellite to improve web access in Africa.[1] After realizing that U.S. laws prohibited China Orient from taking a direct, sizeable stake in Global IP, China Orient reportedly used subsidiaries in Hong Kong and the British Virgin Islands to lend money to another British Virgin Islands company, Bronzelink Holdings Ltd. (Bronzelink), which in turn acquired a 75 percent stake in Global IP.This investment allegedly gave China Orient, through its subsidiary, the ability to influence Global IPs decision-making and to access information that may be restricted under U.S. export controls. The article notes how the Chinese investors urged Global IP to pursue Boeing specifically to manufacture the satellite. Another instance describes how Global IPs board members, appointed by China Orient, then sought to review a manufacturing contract with Boeing that contained exhibits detailing Boeings technology and may have been restricted by export control laws. The article further states that when one of Global IPs founders ordered the companys general counsel to determine whether the company, following the Chinese investment, was still eligible to own a U.S.-made satellite, the counsel determined that Global IP could not prove it was independent of the Chinese government. Global IPs board reportedly refused to discuss the general counsels findings.To ensure that CFIUS reviews such cases, I wrote an amendment to the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018, unanimously adopted by the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and signed into law, to give CFIUS the authority to mandate declarations for transactions where opaque corporate structures or financing arrangements could be used by state-owned or state-controlled entities to evade CFIUS review and gain access to critical U.S. technology.[2] Failure to review this and other similarly-situated transactions, in which Chinese stated-owned entities may gain footholds in sensitive technologies, poses a significant threat to U.S. national security.In light of the concerns raised by this article, I request you answer the following questions:Does CFIUS, or your Departments individually, consider the Global IP transaction to be a covered transaction as defined under 50 USC 4565(a)(4)?[3]Although the provision was not in force at the time of this specific transaction, would CFIUS, or your Departments individually, consider the Global IP transaction to be a foreign government-controlled transaction as defined under 50 USC 4565(a)(7)?[4]Did Global IP, China Orient, China Orients subsidiaries, or Bronzelink at any point submit to CFIUS a written notice of the proposed transaction between Global IP and China Orient, China Orients subsidiaries, and Bronzelink? If so, when?When did your Departments first become aware of Global IP and the financing structure employed by Global IP, China Orient, China Orients subsidiaries, and Bronzelink?When was CFIUS first alerted to the investment by China Orient, China Orients subsidiaries, and Bronzelink in Global IP?Did CFIUS conduct a review of the proposed investment by China Orient, China Orients subsidiaries, and Bronzelink in Global IP? If so, when?Did CFIUS consider a unilateral initiation of review under 50 USC 4565(b)(1)(D)?[5] If so, when did CFIUS complete the review and what did CFIUS find? If not, why did CFIUS choose not to conduct such a review?Will you commit to brief my staff within 30 days on the status of any pending CFIUS review of this transaction?Has CFIUS or any of its member agencies ever found Global IP, China Orient, China Orients subsidiaries, or Bronzelink to have breached a mitigation agreement or submitted false or misleading material information to CFIUS?10. Has CFIUS reviewed any other transactions by Global IP, China Orient, China Orients subsidiaries, or Bronzelink? If so, please provide a list of those transactions.11. Did the Commerce Department grant Boeing an export license for sale of the satellite to Global IP? If so, when?12. Do any CFIUS members, or staff of CFIUS member agencies tasked with CFIUS work, hold any financial interest in Global IP, China Orient, China Orients subsidiaries, Bronzelink, Boeing, or any other satellite manufacturer, owner, or operator?13. Will you commit to brief my staff within 30 days on your planned implementation of 50 USC 4565 (b)(1)(C)(v)(IV)(bb)(BB)?I request that you respond in writing by December 26. Thank you for your attention to this issue.Sincerely,Load-Date: December 12, 2018End of Document

TRANSCRIPT OF AMBASSADOR CUI TIANKAI'S INTERVIEW WITH WALL STREET JOURNAL FROM CHINESE EMBASSY IN AMERICAStates News ServiceNovember 27, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 1591 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: BEIJING, China BodyThe following information was released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China:Ambassador Cui Tiankai recently had an interview with Wall Street Journal's Gerald Seib and Bob Davis, on topics include China-U.S. relations and bilateral trade issues. The report was published on Nov. 26, 2018.Here is the edited transcript:WSJ: You mention that we need sufficient good will and good faith to proceed with trade negotiation. How do you judge and measure that?Ambassador Cui: For a negotiation like this, people have to make their position clear and consistent. If their position is shifting all the time, I don't think it's helpful for any negotiation.Number two, if there is some agreement, people have to remain committed to this agreement and try to make further progress. You cannot have some tentative agreement one day and reject it next day.We fully understand that the U.S. side, the current administration, they love the principle of mutual respect, fairness, and reciprocity. Then people make all of these comments and statements without any sense of mutual respect, without any indication of fairness. How can we have mutual confidence to proceed with a negotiation?WSJ: How have U.S.-China relations changed over the course of the administration?Ambassador Cui: We had the Mar-a-Lago summit, April last year, which was a great success. I think both our leaders were happy about their first meeting. They got to know each other. They were on very friendly terms. Then President Trump made his state visit to China last November. It was also a successful one.In the meantime, we did have a number of very high-level dialogues. We had the first round of all of these four high-level dialogues: Diplomatic and Security Dialogue, Comprehensive Economic Dialogue, People-to-People Exchange Dialogue, and also Law Enforcement and Cybersecurity Dialogue.Of course, we also have problems. The trade issues have not been solved yet.There is also the action taken by the administration and also some of the legislation on the Capitol Hill with regard to Taiwan and the American growing military presence in South China Sea.[There are also possible restrictions] on people-to-people exchanges between our two countries, and all such talks about all the Chinese students here are spies. I think this is really poisoning the overall relationship, especially the understanding and friendship of the two peoples. I don't know where all this originated, but this is really alarming.WSJ: What do you expect from the coming G-20 meeting?Ambassador Cui: I think we would expect, and maybe our American colleagues would also expect, that when the two presidents see each other again in Argentina, they will review the overall situation of the bilateral relations, maybe since their last face-to-face meeting in Beijing.It's been just over one year since President Trump's state visit to China if they meet again in Buenos Aires in late November. So I think it's necessary for the two leaders to review the developments of the relations, and also give us a clear strategic guidance on where the relationship is going and how the two sides should conduct this important and complicated relationship together. Hopefully, this meeting will enable us to make further progress on many fronts, including on the economic and trade issues.WSJ: Some people China would rely on as sort of back channel, intermediaries, don't have the clout that they once did. What's your take on this?Ambassador Cui: I think, first of all, this is not a problem for China. This is a problem for America itself. What will serve the best interests of the United States if we don't listen to these experienced people?We have to talk to people in the administration in order to arrive at a solution of the problem. But at the same time, I think advice and assistance from people like [Former Treasury] Secretary [Hank] Paulson and others is extremely helpful. I think that both sides should make best use of their experience. We should listen to their advice seriously. And I, myself, I'm talking to people like Secretary Paulson, Dr. Henry Kissinger, Mr. Steve Schwarzman and the [U.S.] Chamber of Commerce here in Washington very often. I want to listen to their advice, their assessment of the situation and their views about the effective ways of solving the problem.WSJ: Are you concerned about the possible economic fallout from the trade battle?Ambassador Cui: The problem is that if things go on like this, there's a real risk the global market might become fragmented. In the last few decades, we've seen a clear trend for the global market to be really globalized with the establishment of WTO [World Trade Organization] itself and with so-called emerging market economies like China, Russia, all the rest, joining the WTO. And we do see the restructuring of the global supply chain, integrating most of the countries.But if we allow the current situation to go on, not only between China and the United States, but also between the U.S. and other countries and also on the multilateral front, there's a real risk that the integrating global market might become fragmented. I don't know whether this will serve the interests of any country. I don't think that this will serve the interests of China. I don't think it will serve the interests of the United States.And also, although the current economic situation in the U.S. is good, people cannot rule out the possibility of another-I don't want to use the word "crisis"-a similar situation as what happened 10 years ago. But under the current circumstances, do you think that people will still be as ready and open as they were in 2008 to have effective international policy coordination and coordinated stimulus actions? I'm not sure about that.WSJ: In your view could the trade fight, if it worsens, lead to a global recession?Ambassador Cui: We are the two largest economies in the world, so whatever happens in our economic cooperation will have an impact globally. This is just a fact, this is reality. So in other words, we have to be fully aware of our shared responsibility to the global economy, the prospects of global economic growth. If we solve our economic issues in a mutually beneficial way and in a timely manner, it will certainly enhance people's confidence about global economic prospects. If we fail to do that, probably it will weaken people's confidence for the global economy.For economic and financial issues, confidence is very important. If people lose confidence, then a lot of bad things could happen. Some of these things could become self-fulfilling prophecies. So I think as the two largest economies in the world, we have to be fully aware of this and we have to act responsibly.WSJ: U.S. businesses complain more than in the past about the way they are treated in China. How valid are the concerns?Ambassador Cui: I think the fact is clearly there's more competition in China compared with 40 years ago, because the Chinese economy has grown and Chinese companies are also learning how to be internationally competitive. And maybe they are learning very fast, sometimes with the help of American companies.But still, bilateral trade has been growing so fast. It has benefited both countries. As people do more bilateral trade and investment with each other and there is more and closer contact between each other, competition will also increase. This is just a fact. There's more competition on the Chinese market. This is determined more by the economic logic than by any policy.As far as the government policy is concerned, we do have laws and policies to protect intellectual-property rights. We even set up special courts for intellectual-property cases. We also discourage or even prohibit forced transfer of technology.WSJ: Some U.S. companies say that they are being pressured by Beijing to hand over technology.Ambassador Cui: Very often we talk to American business people, asking them to give us specific cases; try to use the Chinese legal system to protect their legitimate interests. But very often they just don't give us specific cases, they complain to the American government. I don't think this will really help us to address that real concern. You have to give us specific cases.For some of the cases of transfer of technology, it's not forced transfer. Very often it's a commercial deal between Chinese companies and American companies because Chinese companies have their local sales network. [They also have] land, facilities and labor. The American companies have technology. So they want to make a deal between them. Each relies on its so-called comparative advantage.I'm sure there have been cases of so-called market share for technology. But these are commercial deals between the companies. If people don't like the deals, they can certainly walk away. Nobody is forcing them to do these deals.And also, besides such interaction between Chinese and American companies, there is also very fierce competition between American companies [and other foreign companies].For instance, all the major car makers-American, European, Japanese-are competing with each other in China. So if American companies don't bring their best model, their best technology to the cars they are making in China and selling to the Chinese consumers, they might lose their market share to the Europeans and Japanese car-makers.So sometimes this kind of transfer of technology is forced not by the Chinese government or Chinese company, but by the market competition.Load-Date: November 28, 2018End of Document

Detentions raise fears, cast doubt on China's policiesAssociated Press InternationalDecember 14, 2018 Friday 8:48 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 1115 wordsByline: By PAUL WISEMAN, ROB GILLIES and JOE MCDONALD, The Associated PressDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) - By detaining two Canadians in an apparent act of retaliation, China is looking like the country its harshest critics say it is: one unbound by the laws, rules and procedures that govern other major industrial nations.Canada's arrest of a top Chinese technology executive at the request of the United States has set off a diplomatic furor with Beijing.And the way the countries have acted in the controversy draws a clear distinction between their political and legal systems - at a time when the United States, Canada and other advanced economies are rethinking the way they do business with China.Canada gave Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou - daughter of the telecom giant's founder - three days of public hearings before releasing her on bail to the cheers of members of Vancouver's large Chinese community who came to court to show their support.By contrast, the Chinese secretly detained two Canadians on vague suspicions of "engaging in activities that endanger the national security" of China. Beijing didn't allow Canadian officials to see Michael Kovrig, a former diplomat in China, for four days. And it has yet to allow them access to detained entrepreneur Michael Spavor.On Friday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke out against the arrests and called on China to release them. "The unlawful detention of two Canadian citizens is unacceptable. They ought to be returned," Pompeo said after meeting with his Canadian counterpart."What does this say to Canadians?" David Mulroney, Canada's former ambassador to China, said of China's move. "It says to Canadians that China isn't a country that respects the rule of law. This means that when we engage China, we do it carefully and probably in a limited way.""They are trying to teach us a lesson, and I don't think we should put up with it," agreed Robert Bothwell, a University of Toronto historian. "Sadly, we have to diminish contact with China."Bothwell concedes that disengaging with China "obviously has economic implications." Like consumers in the United States and elsewhere, Canadians have come to rely on cheap imports from China - everything from sneakers to electronics.The Huawei clash comes at a tense time. The United States has slapped tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese exports to punish Beijing for its sharp-elbowed drive to challenge American technological dominance.The U.S. says China uses predatory tactics, including outright cybertheft and coercing U.S. and other foreign countries into handing over their technology as the price of admission to the Chinese market. China has lashed back with retaliatory tariffs on $110 billion in U.S. goods.Over dinner in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping agreed to a 90-day cease-fire in the trade dispute, buying time to resolve their differences.In a sign of progress, China on Friday announced a 90-day suspension of planned tariff hikes on U.S. cars, trucks and auto parts. And China has resumed buying American soybeans, which had plunged as trade tensions worsened.The Dec. 1 Trump-Xi meeting came on the same day Canadian officials, acting at the request of the U.S., detained Meng during a layover at the Vancouver airport. Washington wants her extradited to the U.S. to face bank fraud charges. The U.S. accuses Huawei of using a Hong Kong shell company to deceive banks and do business with Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions.On Monday, China took the two Canadians into custody."They're innocent. She's probably guilty of fraud. So in that sense, China has arrested innocent people, or relatively innocent people, as a way to pressure Canada to let someone who may be guilty of a crime go free," said David Zweig, a Canadian political scientist at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and director of its Center on China's Transnational Relations.But, Zweig noted, "the Americans moved first" in issuing the warrant for Meng's arrest and therefore must share blame for the fallout.And Trump may have surrendered the moral high ground by saying he would consider intervening in Meng's case if it would help clinch a good trade deal with Beijing. His comments in an interview with Reuters suggested that he might view Meng as a political pawn."What you can't do is make our rule of law negotiable with China," said Derek Scissors, a China specialist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.The backdrop to the controversy is a growing disillusionment in Washington with U.S.-Chinese relations. When China entered the World Trade Organization in 2001, many American policymakers expected it to open its markets and perhaps its political system as its economy and its global integration expanded. That hasn't happened.The Chinese government continues to restrict foreign investment and imports and to closely oversee commerce in the world's second-biggest economy. And under President Xi, the Communist Party has tightened its grip on politics.The detention of the Canadians "telegraphs once again China's refusal to follow the rule of law and reform its system," said Michael Wessel, a member of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, a congressional watchdog on China policy."We have to come to grips with the fact that China is a nonmarket economy ruled by a party and president who have solidified if not expanded their grip on power. ... We have to stop thinking that China wants to be more like us."The Chinese response to Meng's arrest is also having practical repercussions.Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, said China's tough tactics could jeopardize its effort to woo countries like Germany, France and South Korea into an alliance against Trump's protectionist trade policies."These arrests, if they do have an impact, I imagine it would be a negative one, undermining that campaign to try to win over other developed economies," he said."It feeds into the notion that China's arrests are not based on the rule of law but on other factors," said Amanda DeBusk, chair of trade practice at the Dechert law firm and a former U.S. Commerce Department official. "Some of our clients have cancelled trips to China. Business executives are reluctant to go China right now because there is uncertainty as to who will be targeted. ... The arrests are a new escalation in the trade war with China."They could backfire on Beijing, she said, by discouraging trade and foreign investment in China.In Hong Kong, professor Zweig, a friend of detainee Kovrig, said: "My 96-year-old mother phoned and told me, 'Don't go to China! You're going to be arrested!' "___Gillies reported from Toronto and McDonald from Beijing.Load-Date: December 15, 2018End of Document

These giant US companies could suffer if China trade talks go southCNN WireNovember 30, 2018 Friday 5:12 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 739 wordsByline: By Paul R. La Monica, CNN BusinessDateline: NEW YORK (CNN Business) BodyNEW YORK (CNN Business) --  President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping will have dinner Saturday night at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires -- and many big US companies are hoping that a new trade deal is on the menu along with some empanadas, chimichurri and steak.Chances of a breakthrough don't seem great though, even if there may be a willingness on the part of China to do a deal. Trump told reporters Thursday that "we're very close to doing something with China but I don't know that I want to do it" since "what we have right now is billions and billions of dollars coming into the United States in the form of tariffs or taxes." That stance may further irritate China, and any escalation of a trade war could make life a lot more difficult for some well-known, blue chip American firms that generate a significant chunk of their sales from China. According to data compiled by FactSet, 57 companies in the S&P 500 get more than 10% of their sales from China. The list is dominated by tech giants like Qualcomm (QCOM), Texas Instruments (TXN), Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT). Several consumer companies have made a big bet on China as well.Tiffany (TIF), McDonald's (MCD), Starbucks (SBUX), Nike (NKE), Coach owner Tapestry (TPR) and KFC parent Yum Brands (YUM) all derived more than 10% of their latest sales from China. And it isn't just tech and consumer products companies in the S&P 500 that could be hurt by any further escalation of trade tensions with China. Water heater and boiler maker A.O. Smith (AOS), auto parts manufacturer Aptiv (APTV), MasterCard (MA) and Dow components Visa (V), Boeing (BA), Chevron (CVX) and 3M (MMM) all generate at least 10% of their sales from China.Tariffs starting to take their toll on Chinese economy?It's still not clear what the long-term impact of a protracted trade spat with China will be. But some multinational companies have started to warn that China's economy is starting to slow -- and that it is hurting US firms doing business there.These companies could face new hurdles if the Chinese government retaliates with a further crackdown on American businesses. Chinese consumers may decide to stop buying American products too -- in China and abroad.In fact, Tiffany just warned this week in its latest quarterly earnings report that it was being hurt by a slowdown in spending by Chinese tourists at its US and Hong Kong locations. The stock plunged on the news. But Tiffany didn't seem to think that anti-American sentiment was the reason for tourists pulling back. In fact, the company said it has posted strong sales growth in its Asia-Pacific unit in the third quarter, led by double-digit increases in China."We can speculate on the reasons for the tourist spending slowdown outside of China but the reality is that the Tiffany brand is appealing to Chinese customers as evidenced by the continued strong sales growth in Mainland China in the quarter," said Tiffany CEO Alessandro Bogliolo on a conference call with analysts.McDonald's also doesn't believe that the trade war is hurting its sales in China. Chinese consumers are still eating Big Macs and Chicken McNuggets."We're not really seeing any meaningful anti-American sentiment given some of the geopolitical issues that clearly exist between the countries," said McDonald's CEO Steve Easterbrook on the company's earnings call last month.Easterbrook was talking about a recent trip he made to China and added that McDonald's is increasingly being viewed more in China as a "locally-owned business of a global brand."But even if Chinese consumers continue to support American brands, there's another potential problem for US companies. If, as Trump believes, the US has the upper hand in trade talks and can exert more economic pain on China with tariffs, the Chinese consumer may start to feel the pinch and buy fewer US products -- even if it's not for political reasons.A.O. Smith CEO Kevin Wheeler said in the company's latest earnings release last month that it was already experiencing weakness in China -- and he suggested that the trade spat was one of the reasons for that."We believe our China sales will continue to be negatively impacted by significantly slower housing growth caused by deteriorating consumer confidence related to a weakening economy and international trade issues," Wheeler said. TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Tesla s competition for the Model Y is growing quickly in ChinaiCrowdNewswire (English)December 22, 2018 Saturday 12:20 PM GMTCopyright 2018 iCrowdNewswire, LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1382 wordsBody                   Tesla is set to unveil the Model Y, its fifth car, in March of 2019. It s expected to be a crossover SUV that s smaller than the Model X, and will share lots of the Model 3 s underlying tech.

Continue reading Tesla s competition for the Model Y is growing quickly in ChinaTesla is set to unveil the Model Y, its fifth car, in March of 2019. It s expected to be a crossover SUV that s smaller than the Model X, and will share lots of the Model 3 s underlying tech. With SUV sales through the roof in the United States, it s likely to be a hit. And with a sticker price that will likely resemble the Model 3 s, the Model Y will launch in the US with very little direct competition when you consider the premium attached to the electric SUVs from Jaguar, Audi, Mercedes-Benz, and Porsche.That s not the case in China, however, a point underscored this week by two new vehicle announcements.On Saturday, Chinese EV startup NIO launched the ES6   the company s second all-electric SUV. It s a smaller five-seater successor to NIO s first car, the larger ES8. In broad strokes, the ES6 is simply a more affordable, more approachable version of the ES8. It will start at 358,000 RMB, or about $51,000, and that s before government subsidies.NIO s second all-electric SUV, the ES6.The base model features a 70kWh battery pack that offers 410 km (or about 254 miles) of range, or 430 km (267 miles) in performance trim. NIO will also sell a version of the ES6 outfitted with an 84kWh battery pack that will muster about 480 km (298 miles), with the performance version eking out 510 km (or about 317 miles) of range on a full charge. (Though to be clear, NIO is basing these estimates on the now-outdated European standard known as NEDC, which was replaced by a more rigorous one this year   in other words, expect the ultimate range of each to be up to a few dozen miles lower.)All different versions of the ES6 will be outfitted with dual electric motors, and will also be loaded with Tesla-style tech. An 11.3-inch touchscreen hangs between the dashboard and the center console, while another screen sits behind the steering wheel in place of a physical instrument cluster. The SUV also offers a heads-up display that places critical information (like speed) in the driver s field of view as they stare out at the road. And, of course, the ES6 is outfitted with a suite of sensors that allow for driver assistance features (under the umbrella of  NIO Pilot ) like lane keep and adaptive cruise control.Then there s NIO s more unique features, like the  in-car artificial intelligence system  called NOMI, a Nexus Q-looking robot that sits atop the center of the dashboard. NIO also built into the ES6 perhaps my favorite feature to be announced this year: an  intelligent fragrancing system  that offers a  more pleasant occupant experience. The Xpeng G3.NIO wasn t the only Chinese automaker to make a splash this week. Xiaopeng, another one of the literal hundreds of EV startups that have sprouted up in China in recent years, officially launched its first all-electric SUV, the G3. Backed by Foxconn and Alibaba, and valued at around $3 billion, Xiaopeng, or Xpeng, has gained some notoriety in the run-up to the release of its first car because its concept designs borrowed heavily from Tesla s Model X. (The founders have even said that they took some advantage of the fact that Elon Musk open-sourced Tesla s patents.)But what Xpeng launched with this week was not quite as obvious a clone. It s also dramatically cheaper than a Model X, or even likely what the Model Y will end up costing. The G3 starts at 227,800 RMB, or just shy of about $33,000, again, before any government subsidies. It will offer similar driver assistance features as NIO s, boasts a massive Tesla-style touchscreen in the dashboard, and has a battery pack that should last somewhere around 230 miles (though full details are still scarce).Both of these startups are laser focused on design and technologyXpeng has been taking orders for the G3 and claims to be ready to start deliveries. NIO opened up preorders for the ES6 this week, with deliveries slated to start in June 2019. Depending on where buyers live, both cars could cost as much as $10,000 less thanks to what are pretty generous government subsidies resulting from Beijing s push to wean the country off of internal combustion engines.Tesla s timeline for launching the Model Y in China isn t fully clear. It s also not clear where the company will build the SUV. Elon Musk has said that 2020 is a likely target for production, but hasn t announced if that will happen at the Gigafactory in Nevada, or at the Gigafactory that Tesla is just breaking ground on outside Shanghai for building the Model 3.NIO and Xpeng have a lot of ground to make up when it comes to producing cars in large volumes like Tesla, let alone at the scale of other major automakers. NIO only began production of the ES8 in June of this year, and has made just 10,000 or so cars. Xpeng is even farther behind.But both companies have a decent amount of runway to build up a customer base while Tesla brings its cheaper electric SUV into production. And while Tesla has exported the Model X (and Model S) to China for a few years, the company s cars are tens of thousands of dollars more expensive than most Chinese cars, and the prices have fluctuated wildly as the government there introduced new tariffs this year as part of the ongoing trade war.NIO and Xpeng are no  Tesla killers  on their own, but they re the tip of the iceberg. They re two of the more notable startups in a vast expanse of automakers in China, many of which have spent the last few years spinning up electric vehicle programs to comply with the government s green energy mandates.NIO and Xpeng are no  Tesla killers,  but they re representative of a much larger trendIn fact, perhaps even more challenging to companies like Tesla, who are still largely on the outside of the world s largest car market looking in, is that the Chinese government is starting a push to consolidate the national automotive industry. China s National Development and Reform Commission is going to start throwing more weight behind car companies that perform the best, including ones that are ready to increase capacity, and are willing to invest heavily in R&D.The NDRC has also said it s committed to supporting companies that want to export their cars, too, a stated goal for NIO, which plans to eventually bring its cars to the US. Xpeng hasn t announced plans to expand beyond China yet, but a number of other Chinese automakers   like SF Motors, a subsidiary of auto giant Sokon, or Qiantu, another startup that announced it s targeting the US this week   have expressed similar ambitions. NIO, Xpeng, and SF Motors have already established R&D centers in the US.Automakers around the world have spent decades worming their way into China in anticipation of an automotive boom, though those efforts were largely handcuffed by rules that forced outside companies to strike up 50-50 partnerships with Chinese counterparts. That effort, coupled with the recent government push to foster the development of companies dedicated to electric and hybrid cars, helped build up enough knowledge and momentum to give birth to companies like NIO and Xpeng.China announced a plan to relax those partnership rules this year, which quickly resulted in moves like Tesla s announcement of a Gigafactory in China, or BMW buying out a supermajority of its Chinese partner. It appeared to be something of an opening of the floodgates. But the heavy hand of China s government is still tightly on the wheel of the electric car movement. That means Tesla will face formidable competition as it spins up production of the Model Y, the Model 3, or whatever else it chooses to build in China. It also means that, with China s government at the wheel, Chinese automakers are closer than ever to trying to compete on US soil, too.Tags: See Campaign:https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/21/18151959/tesla-model-y-competition-china-suv-nio-xpengContact Information:Sean O'KaneTags:,            Wire,            Artificial Intelligence Newswire,            United States,            EnglishLoad-Date: December 23, 2018End of Document

AWARD-WINNING CHINESE PHOTOGRAPHER DETAINED IN XINJIANG: WIFEStates News ServiceNovember 27, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 745 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Authorities in the northwestern Chinese region of Xinjiang have detained an award-winning documentary photographer who was on a trip there, his wife has said.Lu Guang, 57, has been missing, presumed detained since Nov. 3, while he was in the regional capital Urumqi, Lu's wife Xu Xiaoli said.Xu said via her Twitter account late on Monday that Lu had been invited by a friend to Urumqi on Oct. 23, and had later traveled to Kashgar, in the south of the region, on Oct. 31.But his family lost contact with Lu after he returned to Urumqi on the night of Nov. 3, and Xu later learned that her husband and a fellow photographer had been taken back to Kashgar by Chinese state security police, according to a statement pinned to her Twitter account.Xu declined to comment further when contacted by RFA on Tuesday."Everything I know is in my statement, so there is nothing more to say," she said. "There has been no news. I have made a lot of calls to Xinjiang, to numbers I found online, but no one is picking up."An employee who answered the phone at the Kashgar police department declined to comment in the absence of a missing persons report."His family would need to report him missing to the local police department, and then it would be up to them to keep you informed," the employee said.Suppressing informationPatrick Poon, China researcher for the London-based rights group Amnesty International, said Lu's sudden disappearance came as Beijing seeks to fend off mounting international criticism of its mass internment of Muslim Uyghurs and other ethnic groups in "re-education" camps in Xinjiang."The situation in Xinjiang has indeed caused a lot of international concern, so the Chinese government is taking various steps to shut down the flow of information," Poon said."I don't know if the authorities are worried about something that Lu Guang photographed [in Xinjiang].""But they shouldn't suppress it in this way. It won't work, and the effect will be to increase public attention," he said. "We call on the international community to watch closely and request that the Chinese government ... release him immediately."A U.S. green card holder who usually lived in eastern China, Lu has made a name for himself documenting the devastating environmental impact of China's industrialization since the 1990s.He has been awarded a World Press Photo prize, the Henry Nannen Preis, the W. Eugene Smith Grant Humanitarian Photography Award, the National Geographic Photography Award, and the Dutch Prince Claus Award, as well as a China Photography Award.Authorities nervousWang Longmeng, a political commentator currently living in France, said Lu's presence in Xinjiang likely made the authorities there nervous."Why has such a well-known photographer been detained in Xinjiang? Maybe it has something to do with the current, and highly repressive, policies being implemented in Xinjiang right now," Wang said."They are building the biggest concentration camps in the world."He added: "Maybe they were afraid of what Lu Guang would see and reveal on his trip; that he would let the international community know about what is going on in Xinjiang."Beginning in April 2017, Uyghurs accused of harboring "strong religious views" and "politically incorrect" ideas have been jailed or detained in re-education camps throughout the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), where members of the ethnic group have long complained of pervasive discrimination, religious repression, and cultural suppression under Chinese rule.China claims that it has sent an unspecified number of Uyghurs influenced by "extremism" to these camps, but many prominent Uyghur intellectuals, such as academics, professors, researchers, artists, singers, businessmen, and religious leaders are also being detained.While Beijing initially denied their existence, the Uyghur chairman of Xinjiang's provincial government, Shohrat Zakir, told China's official Xinhua news agency last month that the facilities are an effective tool to protect the country from terrorism and provide vocational training for Uyghurs.Reporting by RFA's Uyghur Service and other media organizations, however, has shown that those in the camps are detained against their will and subjected to political indoctrination, routinely face rough treatment at the hands of their overseers, and endure poor diets and unhygienic conditions in the often overcrowded facilities.Load-Date: November 27, 2018End of Document

CHINA'S BUMBLING POLICE STATE THE ONLY THING PROTECTING HUMAN RIGHTS FROM THE BUREAUCRACY? INEFFICIENCY.States News ServiceDecember 26, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 681 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, N.Y. BodyThe following information was released by Human Rights Watch:Barely a day goes by without a story about China's ambition to use new technologies for nefarious means, and Human Rights Watch has amassed evidence that President Xi Jinping is building a "digital totalitarian state." But Beijing's aspirations to control people's everyday lives are not so easily realized. Supporters of human rights have plenty of opportunities to limit the damage.The recent headlines are chilling: "In China, your car could be talking to the government." "China's brightest children are being recruited to develop AI 'killer bots.' The country's "social credit" system restricts the freedoms of citizens the state considers to have behaved badly. The government is pushing for national DNA and voice-recognition databases and for big-data "predictive policing" programs aimed at picking out political threatsall without any effective protections for privacy. The brutal crackdown on Muslims in the northwestern Xinjiang region of China involves both high- and low-tech surveillance.Yet the Chinese government's mass-surveillance capabilities are more fearsome in theory than in practice. "While big data has become a sizzling hot concept, there is so much more speculation than actual application," laments one researcher working for the Chinese police, who adds that police leaders are frustrated they may be "sitting on" a "data gold mine" that they are unable to exploit properly. Authorities' mass-surveillance ambitions are bedeviled by unreliable and incomplete basic data, as well as incompatible datasets and systems developed by different companies, among other problems.Plus, citizens across China find ingenious ways to evade surveillance. Blacklisted by the social-credit system? Use documents other than ID cards to get around the restrictions. Concerned your calls are being monitored? Activists have learned creative ways to make police lose track of them.Beijing has devoted enormous efforts to perfecting mass surveillance during the "Strike Hard" crackdown in Xinjiang, which began in late 2016. One elementthe "Becoming Family" program, in which officials are dispatched to live with Muslim families, monitor and indoctrinate themrequires mobilizing 1.1 million government officials to keep tabs on a population of 13 million Muslims.These programs depend on meticulous data input, which may prove unsustainable. Local officials report logging grueling hoursearly morning until midnight, with hardly any vacationto maintain a constant stream of "dynamic" data necessary for mass surveillance and other repressive measures.Communist officials' laxness also hinders surveillance. One woman from Xinjiang told Human Rights Watch that while she was supposed to be under house arrest, the people assigned to watch her took photos of her engaged in various activities around her housethen left and went home. Her minders later sent the pictures to their superiors, pretending that the photos were taken on different days.There's no doubt that Chinese authorities are moving in an ominous directionfew things are more alarming than a powerful rights abuser with cutting-edge technology. But there's still time to arrest or reverse these trends and stigmatize the use of technology for oppressive purposes.To that end, governments and tech companies should begin by adhering to existing privacy protections, which are already established in international human-rights treaties. The U.S. and other governments must investigate and map out the ways in which mass-surveillance technology is being transferred to the Chinese authorities, particularly the police, and figure out how to restrict such transfers. Technology companies need to be held accountable for enabling the Chinese government's abuses or advancing its surveillance goals.The increasingly aggressive and abusive Chinese government poses a significant danger, but the free world should not be cowed. Governments, companies and civil society can translate legitimate fears into concrete efforts to contain Beijing's dystopian ambitions.Load-Date: January 3, 2019End of Document

Pence To Warn China US Won't Be Intimidated In South China SeaThe FrontrunnerOctober 4, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 Bulletin News Network, Inc.Section: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 561 wordsBodyReuters (10/4, Rampton) reports Vice President Pence, "sharpening US criticism of Chinese policies around the globe, will give China a blunt warning on Thursday that the United States will not back down from what Washington sees as Chinese intimidation in the South China Sea." Pence will deliver an address at the Hudson Institute that is "likely to increase tensions...beyond trade disputes." In excerpts of his speech seen by Reuters, Pence will call attention to an incident Sunday in which a Chinese naval vessel came within 45 yards of the USS Decatur "as it conducted freedom-of-navigation operations in the South China Sea, forcing our ship to quickly maneuver to avoid collision." The Vice President is also expected to say that "despite such reckless harassment, the United States Navy will continue to fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows and our national interests demand. We will not be intimidated. We will not stand down."China Reportedly Placed Malicious Chip In Motherboards Used By US Government, Apple.In a cover story headlined "The Big Hack: How China Used a Tiny Chip to Infiltrate Amazon and Apple," Bloomberg BusinessWeek (10/4, Robertson, Riley, 1.82M) reports on how Amazon, while doing due diligence for its 2015 acquisition of Elemental Technologies, hired a third party to examine Elemental's security, according to sources. In probing the company's servers, assembled by Super Micro Computer, the security company found a tiny microchip on the motherboard "that wasn't part of the boards' original design." Amazon duly reported this to US officials "sending a shudder through the intelligence community." Elemental's servers are "in Department of Defense data centers, the CIA's drone operations, and the onboard networks of Navy warships." Sources "familiar with the matter say investigators found that the chips had been inserted at factories run by manufacturing subcontractors in China." One official says "investigators found that it eventually affected almost 30 companies, including a major bank, government contractors," and Apple. However, in statements, Amazon, Apple, and Supermicro "disputed summaries" of the reporting. Amazon is quoted as saying, "It's untrue that AWS knew about a supply chain compromise, an issue with malicious chips, or hardware modifications when acquiring Elemental." Apple similarly said, "On this we can be very clear: Apple has never found malicious chips, 'hardware manipulations' or vulnerabilities purposely planted in any server."NYTimes: Chinese Government Intensifying Control Of Economy.The New York Times (10/3, Yuan, 16.73M) reports on a "growing worry among Chinese entrepreneurs, economists and even some government officials" that China "may be stepping back from the free-market, pro-business policies that transformed it into the world's No. 2 economy. For 40 years, China has swung between authoritarian Communist control and a freewheeling capitalism where almost anything could happen - and some see the pendulum swinging back toward the government." While dissenters in China "must walk a careful line," the Times says a "sense of urgency - fueled in part by China's slowing growth and rising pressures from President Trump's trade war - has driven a growing number of officials and economists to speak out on the government's changing stance on private business."Load-Date: October 4, 2018End of Document

US, China put brakes on trade dispute with cease-fireAssociated Press Financial WireDecember 2, 2018 Sunday 6:35 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 1030 wordsByline: By PAUL WISEMAN, ZEKE MILLER and CATHERINE LUCEY, Associated PressDateline: BUENOS AIRES, Argentina BodyBUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) - The United States and China reached a 90-day cease-fire in a trade dispute that has rattled financial markets and threatened world economic growth. The breakthrough came after a dinner meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the Group of 20 summit in Buenos Aires.Trump agreed to hold off on plans to raise tariffs Jan. 1 on $200 billion in Chinese goods. The Chinese agreed to buy a "not yet agreed upon, but very substantial amount of agricultural, energy, industrial" and other products from the United States to reduce America's huge trade deficit with China, the White House said.The truce, reached after a dinner of more than two hours Saturday, buys time for the two countries to work out their differences in a dispute over Beijing's aggressive drive to supplant U.S. technological dominance."It's an incredible deal," Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, adding, "if it happens it goes down as one of the largest deals ever made."Trump said: "What I'll be doing is holding back on tariffs. China will be opening up, China will be getting rid of tariffs. ... China will be buying massive amounts of products from us."In a long-sought concession to the U.S., China agreed to label fentanyl, the deadly synthetic opioid responsible for tens of thousands of American drug deaths annually, as a controlled substance. And Beijing agreed to reconsider a takeover by U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm that it had previously blocked.The White House announcement framed a victory for Trump and his unflinching negotiating tactics, securing a commitment from China to engage in talks on key U.S. economic priorities, with little obvious concession by the U.S. Notably, however, the White House appears to be reversing course on its previous threats to tie trade discussions to security concerns, like China's attempted territorial expansion in the South China Sea."It's great the two sides took advantage of this opportunity to call a truce," said Andy Rothman, investment strategist at Matthews Asia. "The two sides appear to have had a major change of heart to move away from confrontation toward engagement. This changes the tone and direction of the bilateral conversation."The Trump-Xi meeting was the marquee event of Trump's whirlwind two-day trip to Argentina for the G-20 summit after the president canceled a sit-down with Russian President Vladimir Putin over mounting tensions between Russia and Ukraine. Trump also canceled a Saturday news conference, citing respect for the Bush family following the death of former President George H.W. Bush.Trump said Bush's death put a "damper" on what he described as a "very important meeting" with Xi.The United States and China are locked in a dispute over their trade imbalance and Beijing's tech policies. Washington accuses China of deploying predatory tactics in its tech drive, including stealing trade secrets and forcing American firms to hand over technology in exchange for access to the Chinese market.Trump has imposed import taxes on $250 billion in Chinese products - 25 percent on $50 billion worth and 10 percent on the other $200 billion. Trump had planned to raise the tariffs on the $200 billion to 25 percent if he couldn't get a deal with Xi.China has already slapped tariffs on $110 billion in U.S. goods.Under the agreement reached in Buenos Aires, the two countries have 90 days to resolve their differences over Beijing's tech policies. If they can't, the higher U.S. tariffs will go into effect on the $200 billion in Chinese imports.U.S. officials insist that the American economy is more resilient to the tumult than China's, but they remain anxious of the economic effects of a prolonged showdown - as Trump has made economic growth the benchmark by which he wants his administration judged.A full-blown resolution was not expected to be reached in Buenos Aires; the issues that divide them are just too difficult.Growing concerns that the trade war will increasingly hurt corporate earnings and the U.S. economy are a key reason why U.S. stock prices have been sinking this fall.Joining other forecasters, economists at the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development last week downgraded their outlook for global economic growth next year to 3.5 percent from a previous 3.7 percent. In doing so, they cited the trade conflict as well as political uncertainty.The U.S. and China also made progress on the regulation of fentanyl, which is 50 times more powerful than heroin. U.S. officials for years have been pressing the Chinese government to take a tougher stance against fentanyl, and most U.S. supply of the drug is manufactured in China.White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said China's decision to label the drug as a controlled substance means that "people selling Fentanyl to the United States will be subject to China's maximum penalty under the law."The White House also said that China's government is "open to approving" the purchase of Dutch semiconductor manufacturer NXP by American chipmaker Qualcomm.China nixed the proposed takeover earlier this year, citing antitrust concerns, after U.S. and European regulators approved the deal. China's decision came amid a period of heightening tensions between the U.S. and China over trade and intellectual property issues.Qualcomm announced it was dropping plans to proceed with the deal after it failed to receive Chinese government approval. It is unclear whether the transaction could be revived even with China's acquiescence.In other developments, Trump announced aboard Air Force One on his return to Washington from Buenos Aires that his next meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un would likely happen in January or February. He said there were three sites under consideration, but he declined to name them.Trump also said he would shortly be providing formal notice to Congress that he will terminate the North American Free Trade Agreement, giving lawmakers six months to approve the replacement he signed Friday. He said lawmakers can choose between the replacement, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or nothing.___Wiseman reported from Washington.Load-Date: December 3, 2018End of Document

US, China reach 90-day ceasefire in their trade disputeAssociated Press InternationalDecember 2, 2018 Sunday 4:01 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 1018 wordsByline: By PAUL WISEMAN, ZEKE MILLER and CATHERINE LUCEY, Associated PressDateline: BUENOS AIRES, Argentina BodyBUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) - The United States and China reached a 90-day ceasefire in a trade dispute that has rattled financial markets and threatened world economic growth. The breakthrough came after a dinner meeting Saturday between President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the Group of 20 summit in Buenos Aires.Trump agreed to hold off on plans to raise tariffs Jan. 1 on $200 billion in Chinese goods. The Chinese agreed to buy a "not yet agreed upon, but very substantial amount of agricultural, energy, industrial" and other products from the United States to reduce America's huge trade deficit with China, the White House said.The truce, reached after a dinner of more than two hours, buys time for the two countries to work out their differences in a dispute over Beijing's aggressive drive to supplant U.S. technological dominance."It's an incredible deal," Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One. "What I'll be doing is holding back on tariffs. China will be opening up, China will be getting rid of tariffs. China will be buying massive amounts of products from us."In a long-sought concession to the U.S., China agreed to label fentanyl, the deadly synthetic opioid responsible for tens of thousands of American drug deaths annually, as a controlled substance. And Beijing agreed to reconsider a takeover by U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm that it had previously blocked.The White House announcement framed a victory for Trump and his unflinching negotiating tactics, securing a commitment from China to engage in talks on key U.S. economic priorities, with little obvious concession by the U.S. Notably, however, the White House appears to be reversing course on its previous threats to tie trade discussions to security concerns, like China's attempted territorial expansion in the South China Sea."It's great the two sides took advantage of this opportunity to call a truce," said Andy Rothman, investment strategist at Matthews Asia. "The two sides appear to have had a major change of heart to move away from confrontation toward engagement. This changes the tone and direction of the bilateral conversation."The Trump-Xi meeting was the marquee event of Trump's whirlwind two-day trip to Argentina for the G-20 summit after the president canceled a sit-down with Russian President Vladimir Putin over mounting tensions between Russia and Ukraine. Trump also canceled a Saturday news conference, citing respect for the Bush family following the death of former President George H.W. Bush.Trump said Bush's death put a "damper" on what he described as a "very important meeting" with Xi.The United States and China are locked in a dispute over their trade imbalance and Beijing's tech policies. Washington accuses China of deploying predatory tactics in its tech drive, including stealing trade secrets and forcing American firms to hand over technology in exchange for access to the Chinese market.Trump has imposed import taxes on $250 billion in Chinese products - 25 percent on $50 billion worth and 10 percent on the other $200 billion. Trump had planned to raise the tariffs on the $200 billion to 25 percent if he couldn't get a deal with Xi.China has already slapped tariffs on $110 billion in U.S. goods.Under the agreement reached in Buenos Aires, the two countries have 90 days to resolve their differences over Beijing's tech policies. If they can't, the higher U.S. tariffs will go into effect on the $200 billion in Chinese imports.U.S. officials insist that the American economy is more resilient to the tumult than China's, but they remain anxious of the economic effects of a prolonged showdown - as Trump has made economic growth the benchmark by which he wants his administration judged.A full-blown resolution was not expected to be reached in Buenos Aires; the issues that divide them are just too difficult.Growing concerns that the trade war will increasingly hurt corporate earnings and the U.S. economy are a key reason why U.S. stock prices have been sinking this fall.Joining other forecasters, economists at the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development last week downgraded their outlook for global economic growth next year to 3.5 percent from a previous 3.7 percent.

A.G. Sessions Issues Remarks on Chinese Economic EspionageTargeted News ServiceNovember 1, 2018 Thursday 5:17 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1347 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyU.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued the following remarks on the initiative to combat the Chinese economic espionage:"Thank you all for being here."For decades, the United States has led the world in science, technology, research, and development. Without a doubt, we are the world's top innovator. Billions have been invested to achieve that status."This has given this country advantages both economically and militarily that have directly benefitted the daily lives of the American people."It is no surprise that geopolitical rival states around the world have taken notice."That is why they often try to steal our inventions and defraud us of their proceeds. Too often, they are successful."Discoveries that took years of work and millions of dollars in investment here in the United States can be stolen by computer hackers or carried out the door by an employee in a matter of minutes."This theft is not just wrong; it poses a grave threat to our national security. And it is unlawful."But under President Donald Trump, the United States is standing up to the deliberate, systematic, and calculated threats posed, in particular, by the communist regime in China, which is notorious around the world for intellectual property theft."Earlier this year, a report from U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer found that Chinese sponsorship of hacking into American businesses and commercial networks has been taking place for more than a decade and is a serious problem that burdens American commerce."The problem has been growing rapidly, and along with China's other unfair trade practices, it poses a real and illegal threat to our nation's economic prosperity and competitiveness."Perhaps this threat has been overshadowed in the press by threats from Russia or radical Islamic terrorism. But while it has been in the shadows, the threat has only grown more dangerous."From 2013 to 2016, the Department of Justice did not charge anyone with spying for China."But since the beginning of 2017, we have charged three people with spying for China or attempting or conspiring to do so. And when it comes to trade secret theft, we are currently prosecuting five other cases where the theft or attempted theft was for the benefit of the Chinese government."In 2015, China committed publicly that it would not target American companies for economic gain."Obviously, that commitment has not been kept."Just ask GE Aviation, or Trimble, of Sunnyvale, California."Today I am announcing another economic espionage case against Chinese interests."And before I do that I want to remind everyone that the defendants in this case--as in every case--are innocent until proven guilty."I am announcing that a grand jury in San Francisco has returned an indictment alleging economic espionage on the part of a Chinese state-owned, government owned, company, a Taiwan company, and three Taiwan individuals for an alleged scheme to steal trade secrets from Micron, an Idaho-based semi-conductor company."Micron is worth an estimated $100 billion and controls about 20 to 25 percent of the dynamic random access memory industry--a technology not possessed by the Chinese until very recently."One of the defendants served as president of a company acquired by Micron in 2013. He left the company in 2015 and went to work for the Taiwan defendant company--from where he is alleged to have orchestrated the theft of trade secrets from Micron worth up to $8.75 billion."The Taiwan defendant company then partnered with a Chinese state-owned company--so that ultimately China could steal this technology from the United States and then use it to compete against us in the market. This is a brazen scheme."If convicted, the defendants face up to 15 years in prison and $5 million in fines. The companies could face forfeiture and fines worth more than $20 billion."This week the Commerce Department added the Chinese company to the Entity List to prevent it from buying goods and services in the United States, to keep it from profiting from the technology it stole."And today the Department of Justice is filing a civil action to seek an injunction that would prevent the Chinese and Taiwan companies from transferring the stolen technology, or exporting products based on it to the United States."We are not just reacting to crimes--we are acting to block the defendants from doing any more harm to our U.S. based company, Micron."United States Attorney Alex Tse of the Northern District of California will provide more information on this case in a moment."And once again I want to remind everyone that the defendants in this case--as in every case--are innocent until proven guilty."As the cases I've discussed have shown, Chinese economic espionage against the United States has been increasing--and it has been increasing rapidly."We are here today to say: enough is enough. We're not going to take it anymore."It is unacceptable. It is time for China to join the community of lawful nations. International trade has been good for China, but the cheating must stop. And we must have more law enforcement cooperation; China cannot be a safe haven for criminals who run to China when they are in trouble, never to be extradited. China must accept the repatriation of Chinese citizens who break U.S. immigration law and are awaiting return."We will continue to charge wrongdoers based on carefully conducted investigations done with integrity and professionalism, not politics, and we will seek extradition of criminals."To be prosperous trading partners, integrity and cooperation are essential."And today I am focusing more Department of Justice resources to counter these threats."I am announcing that I have ordered the creation of a China Initiative led by Assistant Attorney General John Demers, who heads our National Security Division, and composed of a senior FBI Executive, five United States Attorneys including Alex, and several other Department of Justice leaders and officials, including Assistant Attorney General for our Criminal Division, Brian Benczkowski."This Initiative will identify priority Chinese trade theft cases, ensure that we have enough resources dedicated to them, and make sure that we bring them to an appropriate conclusion quickly and effectively."This administration's new initiative will also address two major responsibilities of our National Security Division: the Foreign Investment Review Staff's review of investments and licenses in U.S. infrastructure and telecommunications, and the Foreign Agent Registration Act Unit's work to counter covert efforts to influence our leaders and the general public."This will help us meet the new and evolving threats to our economy. Today, we see Chinese espionage not just taking place against traditional targets like our defense and intelligence agencies, but against targets like research labs and universities, and we see Chinese propaganda disseminated on our campuses."And so I have directed this initiative to focus on these problems as well and to recommend legislation to Congress if necessary."China--like any advanced nation--must decide whether it wants to be a trusted partner on the world stage--or whether it wants to be known around the world as a dishonest regime running a corrupt economy founded on fraud, theft, and strong-arm tactics. Our wish is to have a trusted partner."The President has made clear that this country remains open to friendship and productive relationships with China. Nothing is more important for the world. We want our relationships to improve, not get worse."But these problems must be solved. These threats must be ended."This Department of Justice--and the Trump administration--have already made our decision: we will not allow our sovereignty to be disrespected, our intellectual property to be stolen, or our people to be robbed of their hard-earned prosperity. We want fair trade and good relationships based on honest dealing. We will enforce our laws--and we will protect America's national interests."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6503278 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: November 6, 2018End of Document

US charges Chinese hackers in global scheme targeting business and militaryCNN WireDecember 21, 2018 Friday 3:48 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1321 wordsByline: By Chris Isidore and Nicole Gaouette, CNNDateline: (CNN Business) Body (CNN Business) --  The Justice Department charged two Chinese nationals Thursday in a global hacking scheme to steal business secrets as part of a campaign allegedly directed by the Chinese government.Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said the hackers, part of a group known as Advanced Persistent Threat 10 or APT 10, stole information from more than 45 companies in the US in coordination with China's state security service.According to the indictment, they also targeted US military service members, stealing "sensitive data belonging to the Navy, including the names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, salary information, personal phone numbers, and email addresses of more than 100,000 Navy personnel."Rosenstein said the US action was coordinated with 11 other nations: Brazil, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, India, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom."This is outright cheating and theft, and it gives China an unfair advantage at the expense of law-abiding businesses and countries that follow the international rules in return for the privilege of participating in the global economic system," Rosenstein said at a press conference.He added that the Chinese government can no longer pretend it isn't aware of the campaign to steal the business secrets, and referred to the actions as "economic aggression.""We know what China is doing it, we know why they are doing it, and in some instances we know who is sitting at the keyboard," he said. The Chinese government retorted that the United States had "fabricated facts out of thin air," describing the accusations and indictments as "vile in nature.""China firmly preserves cybersecurity, always opposing and cracking down on any forms of cyber theft, " Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a statement Friday. "The Chinese government has never participated in or supported any theft of trade secrets."The Department of Homeland Security also said Thursday it would create a new website to help support US companies that might have been affected.The charges come at a time of rising trade tensions between the US and China, the world's two largest economies. The US has already imposed tariffs on many Chinese exports to the US and had threatened to impose additional tariffs over the issue of the protection of intellectual property. China has retaliated with tariffs on US goods and services being sold by US companies in China.President Donald Trump has repeatedly suggested that his trade negotiations with Beijing, which got a boost following Trump's dinner with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in Argentina on December 1, are going well. But administration officials have in recent weeks repeatedly drawn attention to the risks posed by China's espionage activities.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told a Kansas radio station Thursday that the relationship with China is "a challenge... we are working across multiple vectors, multiple ways to think about how we convince the Chinese to be -- accept our products, allow us to sell products there, and stop stealing our stuff. It's really pretty straightforward.""We all need to watch the threat that China poses to the United States over the long term," Pompeo told KNSS. "The Chinese misappropriate our property, steal our intellectual property. This is a real risk to the aviation industry that's so important. It's a challenge for our farmers to sell their products into China. Those are big, important issues."Pompeo also recently attributed the massive hack on Marriott to China.Senior law enforcement officials testifying before Congress earlier this month named China as the most serious national security threat facing the US, pointing to state-backed hacking efforts like the APT10 Group's attacks and industrial espionage that costs the US some $225 billion a year by some estimates."I believe this is the most severe counter-intelligence threat facing our country today," Bill Priestap, an assistant director in the FBI's counterintelligence division, told a Senate committee December 12. US "prosperity and place in the world are at risk because the Chinese government and its proxies are aggressively exploiting our nation's economy, technology and information," Priestap said.Priestap, along with officials from the departments of Homeland Security and Justice told the Senate Judiciary Committee that Chinese hacking and espionage efforts are state-directed, clearly focused on certain sectors, and also make use of non-traditional spies, including Chinese expatriates at universities and businesses.Cybersecurity firms including CrowdStrike have assessed the group is tied to China's Ministry of State Security and have tracked their activity back to 2009, when they are accused of targeting Western defense companies involved in building large weapons systems.The DOJ indictment against the APT10 Group is meant to send three messages, said Priscilla Moriuchi, director of strategic threat development at Recorded Future, a threat intelligence firm. "They continue to draw a clear line for China regarding what type of behavior is and is not acceptable for states to conduct in cyberspace," Moriuchi said. "In particular, that leveraging government and military resources to conduct cyber operations in order to steal intellectual property from private companies is unacceptable."According to the indictment, the hackers -- one of whom is referred to in court documents by his nickname "Godkiller" -- worked for a company associated with the Chinese government. They are accused of hacks from 2006 through 2018. The charges include aggravated identity theft, conspiracy to commit computer intrusions, conspiracy to commit wire fraud.Business registration records show their company, Huaying Haitai, is a small software firm based in the northern Chinese city of Tianjin. It was opened in 2010 with an initial capital of one million yuan, or about $140,000.Hua, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, on Friday urged the US government to "stop smearing China on cybersecurity and withdraw the so-called charges against Chinese nationals to avoid causing serious damage to China-US relations."The new charges come as the US is also pursuing a separate, unrelated case against a top Chinese tech executive, Huawei's Meng Wanzhou, on claims that she helped skirt US sanctions on Iran. Meng was arrested in Canada and is facing possible extradition to the US. Huawei has said that it is unaware of any wrongdoing by Meng and that it complies with all applicable laws and regulations where it operates.There is no extradition agreement between the US and China, making it unlikely the hackers charged in the indictment unsealed Thursday will see a US courtroom. Rosenstein and other top law enforcement officials said that even if the Chinese hackers never appear in a US courtroom, the charges are significant in that they hold Beijing accountable. FBI Director Christopher Wray said that China, through its actions, poses the greatest threat to the US economy."Healthy competition is good for the global economy, but criminal conduct is not," said Wray. "This is conduct that hurts American businesses, American jobs, and American consumers. No country should be able to flout the rule of law -- so we're going to keep calling out this behavior for what it is: illegal, unethical, and unfair."China sees the situation differently."It's an open secret that relevant US government agencies have long engaged in large-scale and organized cyber theft and surveillance against foreign governments, companies and individuals," Hua said. "The 'cyber theft' accusations against China by the United States are purely groundless counter-charges and can deceive no one but itself."CNN's Steven Jiang and David Shortell contributed to this report.TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

China grants 16 trademarks to defunct Ivanka Trump businessCNN WireNovember 7, 2018 Wednesday 2:07 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 618 wordsByline: By Steven Jiang and Serenitie Wang, CNNDateline: BEIJING (CNN) BodyBEIJING (CNN) --  China has granted preliminary approval for 16 trademarks for fashion accessories and other items to White House adviser and presidential daughter Ivanka Trump, even though she announced earlier this year she's shutting her business down.The approvals, which were applied for in March and May 2016, underscore the ongoing entanglement of President Donald Trump and his family with the Chinese government through the Trumps' various business interests in the country, past and present.Chinese government records show that the trademark applications received preliminary approvals last month. Such decisions usually become final after a three-month public comment period. Most applications were related to fashion items such as shoes and handbags, but one was for an unspecified item in a category that covers voting machines, as well as gadgets and electronics ranging from cameras and telephones to semiconductors.The White House did not respond to a request for comment on the trademark approvals, which were first reported by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a nonprofit group that has previously sued the President over his business interests. In China, where shoes carrying Ivanka Trump's brand were once made, she had previously scored batches of trademarks on a wide array of products, including in late May --- when her father's administration was engaged in intense trade negotiations with Beijing. At the time, Ivanka Trump's business representative said the fashion line regularly filed such applications, especially in areas where trademark infringement was rampant."We have recently seen a surge in trademark filings by unrelated third parties trying to capitalize on the name and it is our responsibility to diligently protect our trademark," said Abigail Klem, who was then the president of the Ivanka Trump brand. Escalating trade warThe US-China trade talks ultimately failed, and the Trump administration subsequently slapped steep tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese imports.China has retaliated by imposing tariffs on $110 billion of American products. Tensions have also been growing in other areas between Washington and Beijing, from the military to intelligence and diplomacy.Speaking at a United Nations meeting in September, President Trump claimed, without offering evidence, that China was trying to interfere with the US midterm elections. "They do not want me, or us, to win, because I am the first president ever to challenge China on trade, and we are winning on trade," he said. "We don't want them to meddle or interfere in our upcoming election." The Trump Organization, the family company that is now run by the President's sons, has also had a slew of trademarks approved by Beijing, many of them after his election victory in 2016.Ethics experts have said Beijing could be seeking to influence the President by awarding him and his family the trademarks, but the Chinese government has dismissed those assertions, emphasizing that authorities follow the law in reviewing all applications. President Trump is being sued by the governments of Washington DC and Maryland on claims that his continued interest in the Trump International Hotel, which has become a gathering place for foreign governments with business before the administration, puts him in violation of a constitutional clause banning presidents from accepting gifts from foreign governments.A federal judge last week allowed discovery to proceed in that case, meaning Trump will have to turn over business records associated with the hotel.CNN's Betsy Klein contributed to this report.TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Tensions have also been growing in other areas between Washington and Beijing, from the military to intelligence and diplomacy.Speaking at a United Nations meeting in September, President Trump claimed, without offering evidence, that China was trying to interfere with the US midterm elections."They do not want me, or us, to win, because I am the first president ever to challenge China on trade, and we are winning on trade," he said. "We don't want them to meddle or interfere in our upcoming election."The Trump Organization, the family company that is now run by the President's sons, has also had a slew of trademarks approved by Beijing, many of them after his election victory in 2016.Ethics experts have said Beijing could be seeking to influence the President by awarding him and his family the trademarks, but the Chinese government has dismissed those assertions, emphasizing that authorities follow the law in reviewing all applications.President Trump is being sued by the governments of Washington DC and Maryland on claims that his continued interest in the Trump International Hotel, which has become a gathering place for foreign governments with business before the administration, puts him in violation of a constitutional clause banning presidents from accepting gifts from foreign governments.A federal judge last week allowed discovery to proceed in that case, meaning Trump will have to turn over business records associated with the hotel.Load-Date: November 7, 2018End of Document

RUBIO URGES GOOGLE CEO TO ABANDON PLANS FOR CENSORED SEARCH ENGINE IN CHINAStates News ServiceDecember 11, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 702 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON D.C. BodyThe following information was released by Florida Senator Marco Rubio:U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) urged Google CEO Sundar Pichai to abandon plans for Dragonfly, a censored version of its search engine in China.

Why Huawei arrest deepens conflict between US and ChinaAssociated Press Financial WireDecember 7, 2018 Friday 1:03 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 1251 wordsByline: By PAUL WISEMAN and FRANK BAJAK, Associated PressDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) - The dramatic arrest of a Chinese telecommunications executive has driven home why it will be so hard for the Trump administration to resolve its deepening conflict with China.In the short run, the arrest of Huawei's chief financial officer heightened skepticism about the trade truce that Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping reached last weekend in Buenos Aires, Argentina. On Thursday, U.S. stock markets tumbled on fears that the 90-day cease-fire won't last, before regaining most of their losses by the close of trading.But the case of an executive for a Chinese company that's been a subject of U.S. national security concerns carries echoes well beyond tariffs or market access. Washington and Beijing are locked in a clash over which of the world's two largest economies will command economic and political dominance for decades to come."It's a much broader issue than just a trade dispute," said Amanda DeBusk, chair of the international trade practice at Dechert LLP. "It pulls in: Who is going to be the world leader essentially."The Huawei executive, Meng Wanzhou, was detained by Canadian authorities in Vancouver as she was changing flights Saturday - the same day that Trump and Xi met at the Group of 20 summit in Argentina and produced a cease-fire in their trade war. The Globe and Mail newspaper, citing law enforcement sources, reported that Meng is suspected of trying to evade U.S. sanctions on Iran. She faces extradition to the United States, and a bail hearing was set for Friday.The British bank HSBC is cooperating with U.S. authorities in its investigation, people familiar with the matter said Thursday.Huawei, the world's biggest supplier of network gear used by phone and internet companies, has long been seen as a front for spying by the Chinese military or security services, whose cyber-spies are widely acknowledged as highly skilled. A U.S. National Security Agency cybersecurity adviser, Rob Joyce, last month accused Beijing of violating a 2015 agreement with the U.S. to halt electronic theft of intellectual property.Other nations are increasingly being forced to choose between Chinese and U.S. suppliers for next-generation "5G" wireless technology. Washington has been pushing other countries not to buy the equipment from Huawei, arguing that the company may be working stealthily for Beijing's spymasters.Beijing protested Meng's arrest but signaled that it doesn't want to disrupt progress toward settling its trade dispute with the Trump administration. Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesman Gao Feng said China is confident it can reach a deal during the 90 days that Trump agreed to suspend a scheduled increase in U.S. import taxes on $200 billion worth of Chinese products.U.S. national security adviser John Bolton told NPR that he knew of the pending arrest in advance. He noted that there has been much concern about the suspicion that Chinese firms like Huawei use stolen U.S. intellectual property.In the view of the United States and many outside analysts, China has embarked on an aggressive drive to overtake America's dominance in technology and global economic leadership. According to analysts, China has deployed predatory tactics, from forcing American and other foreign companies to hand over trade secrets in exchange for access to the Chinese market to engaging in cyber-theft.Washington also regards Beijing's ambitious long-term development plan, "Made in China 2025," as a scheme to dominate such fields as robotics and electric vehicles by unfairly subsidizing Chinese companies and discriminating against foreign competitors.In addition to Trump's tariffs, the administration is tightening regulations on high-tech exports to China. It's also making it harder for Chinese firms to invest in U.S. companies or to buy American technology in such cutting-edge areas as robotics, artificial intelligence and virtual reality.Earlier this year, the United States nearly drove Huawei's biggest Chinese rival, ZTE Corp., out of business for selling equipment to North Korea and Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions. But Trump issued a reprieve, possibly in part because U.S. tech companies are major suppliers of the Chinese giant and would also have been scorched. ZTE got off with paying a $1 billion fine, changing its board and management and agreeing to let American regulators monitor its operations.The U.S. and Chinese tech industries depend on each other so much for components that "it is very hard to decouple the two without punishing U.S. companies, without shooting ourselves in the foot," said Adam Segal, cyberspace analyst at the Council on Foreign Relations.Dean Garfield, president of the U.S. Information Technology Industry Council trade group, said innovation by U.S. companies often depends utterly on product development and testing by Chinese partners, not to mention component suppliers.British Telecom said this week that it would stop using Huawei equipment in its 5G network, the BBC reported, and U.S. lawmakers have lobbied Canada's prime minister to freeze out the Chinese supplier. New Zealand and Australia already have.  Other, less wealthy nations are concerned less about spying and more about low prices, which play to Huawei's advantage.Both Huawei and ZTE have not only been barred from use by U.S. government agencies and contractors; they have also been mostly locked out of the American market. A 2012 report by the House Intelligence Committee report urged U.S. businesses to avoid their products and called for blocking all mergers or acquisitions involving them.And nearly a year ago, AT&T pulled out of a deal to sell Huawei smartphones."There is ample evidence to suggest that no major Chinese company is independent of the Chinese government and Communist Party - and Huawei, which China's government and military tout as a 'national champion' is no exception," Sens. Mark Warner, D-Va., and Marco Rubio, R-Fla., wrote in October to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. They urged him to keep Huawei off Canada's next-generation network.Priscilla Moriuchi, a former East Asia specialist at National Security Agency now with the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future, said both ZTE and Huawei are wedded to China's military and political leadership."The threat from these companies lies in their access to critical internet backbone infrastructure," she said."No matter what happens in the short term, (the arrest of Huawei's CFO) is a symptom of a long-term technology clash," said Derek Scissors, a China specialist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. "We're not going to deal that away in 90 days."Scissors said he doubts that China will change its tech policies. Beijing must develop innovative technologies to keep its economy growing as its labor force ages and it confronts a huge stockpile of debt. Yet its political and economic system - which promotes inefficient state-owned companies at the expense of nimbler private ones - discourages innovation."I don't see a way out of this," Scissors said.Likewise, Rod Hunter, an international economic official in President George W. Bush's White House and a partner at law firm Baker McKenzie, said, "I'm skeptical that the Chinese are going to want to say 'uncle.' " U.S. and Chinese officials are "trying to tackle a problem that is going to take years, maybe a decade, to resolve."___Bajak reported from Boston.

Agreements with China could add investments for up to US $ 3,550 millionCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 4, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 720 wordsBody The State visit by the Chinese president,: between what was under discussion - and finally agreed upon - are the Caucharí Solar Park and a swap of 60,000 million yuan - some US $ 8600 million - with the Central Bank. Between last Thursday and yesterday, they could add up to US $ 3550 million in investments in energy and infrastructure.  With regard to economic issues, the signing of agreements involved Argentine authorities from the Ministries of Production, Transport and Finance, the Central Bank and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  The swap, a term that marks the Sino-Argentinean relationship for several years, returned with force: the Central Bank and the Bank of the People's Republic of China signed a supplementary agreement on the exchange of currencies for 60 billion yuan yesterday, which complements what was already agreed in July 2017 and thus totals 130,000 million yuan (about US $ 18,000 million).  Meanwhile, the Caucharí Solar Park in Jujuy will be expanded by around 200 megawatts to reach a generating capacity of 500 megawatts. For that, explained the Secretary of International Economic Relations, Horacio Reyser, it is estimated that there will be an investment of US $ 350 million by the companies Power China and Shanghai Electric Power Construction.  Reyser explained that there will also be investments estimated at US $ 1100 million in the public-private participation contract (PPP) for the works of route 5, where the Chinese company CCA will provide financing to improve the connection between Buenos Aires and La Pampa. In addition, it added another US $ 1100 million in the contract with the Chinese firm CRCC to recover more than 1000 kilometers of the San Martín freight train.  An agreement between the Ministry of Finance and the Development Bank of China provides for the creation of a fund of up to US $ 1000 million to finance working capital of companies.  For Argentina, the intention is to increase the level of added value of exports to China and also to increase the investments of the Asian country, which could become a key ally. From the assumption of Cambiemos until September of this year, they indicated in the Investment Agency, China overturned more than US $ 3,600 million in Argentina.  With the agreements signed, that amount could grow at a rapid pace in the coming years. "The main objective of this government's international economic relations, and at this moment, is access to foreign direct investment, over trade." The stock of these investments, historically, has been dominated by the United States and European countries. like Spain and France, the idea, then, is that China acquires greater relevance, "said Marcelo Elizondo, of the DNI consultancy.  Regarding exports, the Argentine Ministry of Production and Labor and the Chinese Ministry of Commerce negotiated cooperation agreements on electronic commerce and services. One of the objectives is to facilitate the integration of service companies from both countries in global production and supply chains.  In the portfolio that Dante Sica directs, they said that although the agreement on electronic commerce is with the Chinese government, it is likely that cooperation activities will have a presence in the private sector and may involve the Asian giant Alibaba, a gateway important for Argentine products in the Chinese retail sector.  China, meanwhile, is looking for suppliers to satisfy the needs of its booming middle class, but also wants to increase its geopolitical influence in Latin America. Due to its size, Argentina is one of the most important countries in the region to do so, said Elizondo.  China's geopolitical intentions are particularly relevant in the global context, says the consultant: more than a G-20, what was seenthe weekend in Argentina for international looks, pending the meeting between the Chinese president and his US counterpart, Donald Trump, was a G-2. "In this bipolar world, Argentina still does not pay large costs to have a relationship with these two great powers, although it runs the risk of being involved in discomforts," explained Elizondo. It remains to be seen whether, as the tension between Trump and Xi evolves, the neutrals can continue without conditionings, he added.  Copyright Grupo de Diarios América - GDA / La Nación / Argentina Load-Date: December 4, 2018End of Document

Spy chief wanted ban on China telecoms from Australian 5GAssociated Press InternationalOctober 30, 2018 Tuesday 10:58 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 904 wordsByline: By ROD McGUIRK, Associated PressDateline: CANBERRA, Australia BodyCANBERRA, Australia (AP) - Australia's critical infrastructure including electricity grids, water supplies and hospitals could not have been adequately safeguarded if Chinese-owned telecommunications giants Huawei and ZTE Corp. were allowed to help roll out the nation's 5G network, a spy chief said.Mike Burgess, director-general of the Australian Signals Directorate, said his cyber experts had backed the government's decision in August to bar the two Chinese companies that he described as "high-risk vendors." It was the first time the secretive agency had disclosed such information."My advice was to exclude high-risk vendors from the entirety of evolving 5G networks," Burgess said in a recent speech released by his office on Tuesday.Security agencies had previously protected sensitive information and core functions of Australian telecommunications networks by restricting risky vendors to the edges, Burgess said."But the distinction between 'core' and 'edge' collapses in 5G networks. That means that a potential threat anywhere in the network will be a threat to the whole network," Burgess said.The next generation of telecommunications networks will be at the top of every country's list of critical national infrastructure, he said."5G technology will underpin the communications that Australians rely on every day, from our health systems and the potential applications of remote surgery, to self-driving cars and through to the operation of our power and water supply," Burgess said. "The stakes could not be higher."Huawei was banned from bidding for contracts for Australia's broadband network in 2011. ZTE is a Chinese maker of mobile devices.The Chinese foreign ministry accused Australia of ideological bias against the Chinese companies."Cooperation between Chinese and Australian companies is mutually beneficial in nature. Australia should offer convenience for the companies' cooperation between two sides, rather than making various excuses to deliberately obstruct the cooperation, such as taking discriminatory measures," ministry spokesman Lu Kang said."We urge the Australian side to cast away ideological bias and provide a level playing field for Chinese companies' operations in Australia. We hope Australia will take it seriously," he added.Burgess' warning came as an Australian security think-tank raised concerns on Tuesday about increasing collaboration between Australian universities and China's People's Liberation Army scientists on research programs such as hypersonic missiles and navigation technology.Australian Strategic Policy Institute researcher Alex Joske said some Chinese scientists hide their military backgrounds by claiming to be visiting scholars from non-existent institutions.Since 2007, the PLA has sponsored more than 2,500 military scientist and engineers to study overseas, Joske said in a report.Based on peer-reviewed publications co-authored by PLA and non-Chinese scientists, the United States, Britain, Canada, Australia and Germany were the top five countries engaged in research collaboration with the Chinese military since last year, the report said.The report recommended that universities collaborate with allied countries rather than non-allied militaries on strategic research."It's not in our interests to help a non-allied military develop advanced military technology," Joske said. "We need better visa screening to make sure that people who've lied on their visa applications or are seeking to come to Australia to develop better military technology for China aren't let into the country."Education Minister Dan Tehan said Universities were self-governing institutions best able to make decisions about collaboration while also satisfying all relevant Australian laws and security requirements.Australian universities carefully assess applications from students from all countries and liaise with defense and security agencies as needed, the advocacy group Universities Australia said in a statement."Australian universities help to advance Australia's national interests through their research and education ties with students and researchers all around the world," the statement said.The Defense Trade Controls Act gives the government and Defense Department oversight over providing information on any technology or research with potential military applications. That legislation is under review, and Joske said it should be expanded to prevent Chinese military scientists from learning about sensitive technologies while in Australia.Several governments have scrutinized Huawei's links to the Chinese government. The private Chinese company was founded by a former People's Liberation Army major in 1987. Now the world's biggest telecoms equipment supplier, it suffered a setback in 2012 when a U.S. congressional report said it was a security risk and warned phone companies not to buy its equipment.Shenzhen-based Huawei has said it would never give Australian customer data to Chinese spy agencies. But the Australian government said no combination of security controls sufficiently mitigated the risk.5G networks will start commercial services in Australia next year.The Australian Signals Directory, formerly the Defense Signals Bureau, became an independent statutory body with a more public profile on July 1. It is responsible for foreign signals intelligence, support to military operations, cyber warfare and information security.Load-Date: October 31, 2018End of Document

Chinese army scientists exploiting Western universities, report saysCNN.comOctober 29, 2018 Monday 6:05 AM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: AUSTRALIALength: 792 wordsByline: By Ben Westcott, CNNDateline: Hong Kong BodyA growing number of Chinese military scientists are using their research collaborations with Western universities to take their host country's expertise back home to improve China's own technology, a new Australian report claimed Tuesday.The report, by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), called out what it saw as a lack of caution among Western governments and universities in the face of an alleged concerted campaign by Beijing to advance the Chinese military using foreign technology."I just haven't seen any universities acknowledge the risk of this. They haven't really made that step publicly distinguishing between beneficial collaboration with China and cooperation with the Chinese military which may not be in our interests," Alex Joske, report author and ASPI researcher, told CNN.The ASPI is a non-partisan think tank, partly funded by the Australian government.Since 2007, more than 2,500 Chinese scientists with links to the People's Liberation Army (PLA) have traveled to work in the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom, among others, according to ASPI research."Those scientists work in strategic and emerging technology sectors such as quantum physics, signal processing, cryptography, navigation technology and autonomous vehicles," the report said.In a PLA Daily article, these activities are described as "picking flowers in foreign lands to make honey in China."The Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement to CNN the report was "ridiculous and groundless ... irresponsible and not worth refuting.""China's overseas exchange and cooperation on technology and humanities are in line with everyone's interests. We urge the related party to abandon cold war mentality and focus their energy on something beneficial," the statement said.The Chinese scientists, who came from institutions such as the Navy Submarine Academy and the Rocket Force Engineering University, traveled to Western countries to conduct study abroad, undertaking their PhDs or working as visiting scholars.But during their research overseas, ASPI claims they maintain a strict loyalty to their government and the Chinese Communist Party. "Party education and training cannot stop outside the country," the PLA Daily article said.Universities Australia hit back strongly at suggestions that there were inadequate protections around collaborations between Australian researchers and foreign military scientists."Australian universities carefully assess applications from students from all countries and liaise with defense and security agencies as needed," the organization told CNN in a statement."Australian universities help to advance Australia's national interests through their research and education ties with students and researchers all around the world. All visa decisions are made by the Australian government."University of New South Wales, which was mentioned by the ASPI report, said they conducted "rigorous assessments as required by the Australian Government's Defence Export Controls framework."The number of peer-reviewed articles written by overseas scientists and Chinese PLA researchers grew from 112 in 2006, to more than 700 in 2017, according to the ASPI.Out of those, the vast majority were in were in the so-called "Five Eyes" countries, a close group of Western nations including the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, who share intelligence and other information.The ASPI report even claims some military scientists from China have "actively used cover" to disguise their PLA affiliations, instead claiming to be from academic institutions which don't exist.The report was released just one day after Christopher Ashley Ford, assistant secretary at the US Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation, said cracking down on the transfer of technology to China was a priority for the US."We do need to understand China's technology strategy, and its military and potential strategic implications," he said."If we ... continue engagement with the Chinese military-technological complex in its state of 'fusion' with China's civilian sector, this must be done only with due care."Chinese Vice Premier Han Zheng said in a public speech on Monday there needed to be closer military-civilian integration in China, according to state media Xinhua.Joske said while collaboration between Chinese researchers and their international peers was important, there needed to be tighter controls when it came to research with strategic implications."The information flow and the advantages of this collaboration are overwhelmingly to the PLA because they're often sending people here to train and gain these skills, they're not coming to teach our scientists new skills," he said.Load-Date: November 1, 2018End of Document

China suspends tariff hikes on US cars, auto partsAssociated Press InternationalDecember 15, 2018 Saturday 12:28 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 527 wordsByline: By JOE McDONALD, AP Business WriterDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - China announced a 90-day suspension on Friday of tariff hikes on U.S. cars, trucks and auto parts following its cease-fire in a trade battle with Washington that threatens global economic growth.The suspension is China's first step in response to President Donald Trump's Dec. 1 agreement to suspend U.S. tariff hikes for a similar 90-day period while the two sides negotiate over American complaints about Beijing's technology policy and trade surplus.China has indicated it plans to move ahead with the talks despite strains over the arrest of a Chinese technology executive in Canada to face possible U.S. charges related to a violation of trade sanctions on Iran.Beijing will suspend a 25 percent import charge on cars and trucks and a 5 percent charge on auto parts, effective Jan. 1, the Finance Ministry announced.The announcement helped give substance to Trump's agreement with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, after prolonged uncertainty caused jittery global financial markets to swing wildly.The Finance Ministry said the tariff suspension would apply to imports worth up to a total of $126 billion, but that would be nearly 10 times the $13 billion of vehicles the United States exported to China last year.China is the world's biggest auto market but most U.S.-branded vehicles sold here are manufactured in Chinese factories. The automaker hit hardest by the Chinese tariff hike was Germany's BMW AG, which ships SUVs made in a South Carolina factory to China.The penalties were imposed in response to Trump's decision to slap 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese goods and a 10 percent charge on another $200 billion. The second tariff was due to rise Jan. 1 until Trump agreed to the postponement.The United States and other trading partners complain Beijing steals or pressures companies to hand over technology in violation of its market-opening obligations. American officials also worry Chinese industry plans that call for state-led creation of global champions in robotics and other fields threaten U.S. industrial leadership.A spokesman for China's Commerce Ministry, Gao Feng, said Thursday the two sides were in "close contact" but gave no timetable for possible face-to-face negotiations.Economists say 90 days probably is too little time to resolve conflicts that have bedeviled U.S.-Chinese relations for years. They say Beijing's goal probably will be to show it is making progress so Trump extends his deadline.Beijing officials expressed confidence China could withstand U.S. pressure but the fight battered consumer confidence and threatened export industries that support millions of jobs.Friday's announcement "shows the Chinese government is willing to solve trade disputes through consultation based on equality," said Song Lifang, an economist at Renmin University in Beijing.The tariff cut lowers the charge for U.S.-made cars and trucks to 15 percent, the same level as imports from other countries."If the United States cuts or remove tariffs on Chinese goods, China will surely follow up with further relevant measures," Song said.___Associated Press researcher Yu Bing contributed to this report.Load-Date: December 15, 2018End of Document

ATTORNEY GENERAL JEFF SESSIONS ANNOUNCES NEW INITIATIVE TO COMBAT CHINESE ECONOMIC ESPIONAGEStates News ServiceNovember 1, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 1331 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the U.S. Department of Justice:Washington, DCUnited States~Thursday, November 1, 2018Remarks as prepared for deliveryThank you all for being here.For decades, the United States has led the world in science, technology, research, and development. Without a doubt, we are the world's top innovator. Billions have been invested to achieve that status.This has given this country advantages both economically and militarily that have directly benefitted the daily lives of the American people.It is no surprise that geopolitical rival states around the world have taken notice.That is why they often try to steal our inventions and defraud us of their proceeds. Too often, they are successful.Discoveries that took years of work and millions of dollars in investment here in the United States can be stolen by computer hackers or carried out the door by an employee in a matter of minutes.This theft is not just wrong; it poses a grave threat to our national security. And it is unlawful.But under President Donald Trump, the United States is standing up to the deliberate, systematic, and calculated threats posed, in particular, by the communist regime in China, which is notorious around the world for intellectual property theft.Earlier this year, a report from U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer found that Chinese sponsorship of hacking into American businesses and commercial networks has been taking place for more than a decade and is a serious problem that burdens American commerce.The problem has been growing rapidly, and along with China's other unfair trade practices, it poses a real and illegal threat to our nation's economic prosperity and competitiveness.Perhaps this threat has been overshadowed in the press by threats from Russia or radical Islamic terrorism. But while it has been in the shadows, the threat has only grown more dangerous.From 2013 to 2016, the Department of Justice did not charge anyone with spying for China.But since the beginning of 2017, we have charged three people with spying for China or attempting or conspiring to do so. And when it comes to trade secret theft, we are currently prosecuting five other cases where the theft or attempted theft was for the benefit of the Chinese government.In 2015, China committed publicly that it would not target American companies for economic gain.Obviously, that commitment has not been kept.Just ask GE Aviation, or Trimble, of Sunnyvale, California.Today I am announcing another economic espionage case against Chinese interests.And before I do that I want to remind everyone that the defendants in this caseas in every caseare innocent until proven guilty.I am announcing that a grand jury in San Francisco has returned an indictment alleging economic espionage on the part of a Chinese state-owned, government owned, company, a Taiwan company, and three Taiwan individuals for an alleged scheme to steal trade secrets from Micron, an Idaho-based semi-conductor company.Micron is worth an estimated $100 billion and controls about 20 to 25 percent of the dynamic random access memory industrya technology not possessed by the Chinese until very recently.One of the defendants served as president of a company acquired by Micron in 2013. He left the company in 2015 and went to work for the Taiwan defendant companyfrom where he is alleged to have orchestrated the theft of trade secrets from Micron worth up to $8.75 billion.The Taiwan defendant company then partnered with a Chinese state-owned companyso that ultimately China could steal this technology from the United States and then use it to compete against us in the market. This is a brazen scheme.If convicted, the defendants face up to 15 years in prison and $5 million in fines. The companies could face forfeiture and fines worth more than $20 billion.This week the Commerce Department added the Chinese company to the Entity List to prevent it from buying goods and services in the United States, to keep it from profiting from the technology it stole.And today the Department of Justice is filing a civil action to seek an injunction that would prevent the Chinese and Taiwan companies from transferring the stolen technology, or exporting products based on it to the United States.We are not just reacting to crimeswe are acting to block the defendants from doing any more harm to our U.S. based company, Micron.United States Attorney Alex Tse of the Northern District of California will provide more information on this case in a moment.And once again I want to remind everyone that the defendants in this caseas in every caseare innocent until proven guilty.As the cases I've discussed have shown, Chinese economic espionage against the United States has been increasingand it has been increasing rapidly.We are here today to say: enough is enough. We're not going to take it anymore.It is unacceptable. It is time for China to join the community of lawful nations. International trade has been good for China, but the cheating must stop. And we must have more law enforcement cooperation; China cannot be a safe haven for criminals who run to China when they are in trouble, never to be extradited. China must accept the repatriation of Chinese citizens who break U.S. immigration law and are awaiting return.We will continue to charge wrongdoers based on carefully conducted investigations done with integrity and professionalism, not politics, and we will seek extradition of criminals.To be prosperous trading partners, integrity and cooperation are essential.And today I am focusing more Department of Justice resources to counter these threats.I am announcing that I have ordered the creation of a China Initiative led by Assistant Attorney General John Demers, who heads our National Security Division, and composed of a senior FBI Executive, five United States Attorneys including Alex, and several other Department of Justice leaders and officials, including Assistant Attorney General for our Criminal Division, Brian Benczkowski.This Initiative will identify priority Chinese trade theft cases, ensure that we have enough resources dedicated to them, and make sure that we bring them to an appropriate conclusion quickly and effectively.This administration's new initiative will also address two major responsibilities of our National Security Division: the Foreign Investment Review Staff's review of investments and licenses in U.S. infrastructure and telecommunications, and the Foreign Agent Registration Act Unit's work to counter covert efforts to influence our leaders and the general public.This will help us meet the new and evolving threats to our economy. Today, we see Chinese espionage not just taking place against traditional targets like our defense and intelligence agencies, but against targets like research labs and universities, and we see Chinese propaganda disseminated on our campuses.And so I have directed this initiative to focus on these problems as well and to recommend legislation to Congress if necessary.Chinalike any advanced nationmust decide whether it wants to be a trusted partner on the world stageor whether it wants to be known around the world as a dishonest regime running a corrupt economy founded on fraud, theft, and strong-arm tactics. Our wish is to have a trusted partner.The President has made clear that this country remains open to friendship and productive relationships with China. Nothing is more important for the world. We want our relationships to improve, not get worse.But these problems must be solved. These threats must be ended.This Department of Justiceand the Trump administrationhave already made our decision: we will not allow our sovereignty to be disrespected, our intellectual property to be stolen, or our people to be robbed of their hard-earned prosperity. We want fair trade and good relationships based on honest dealing. We will enforce our lawsand we will protect America's national interests.Load-Date: November 2, 2018End of Document

China's VP and Israel's PM co-host trade conferenceAssociated Press InternationalOctober 24, 2018 Wednesday 6:57 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 645 wordsByline: By ISABEL DEBRE, Associated PressDateline: JERUSALEM BodyJERUSALEM (AP) - China's vice president and Israel's prime minister on Wednesday co-hosted a high-profile trade and innovation conference and toured an exhibition of Israeli technology start-ups together as the two countries worked to cement their fast-growing trade ties.A quarter century after establishing diplomatic relations, Israel and China have become important trade partners, with China emerging as an eager customer of Israeli technology.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the Chinese government's choice to send Wang Qishan, a close confidant of President Xi Jinping, to co-chair this year's Israeli innovation summit "reflects the growing ties between our countries, our economies, our peoples."Wang praised Israel as an innovation hub that China hopes to learn from as it modernizes its fast-growing economy."Israel leads the world in electronics, information technology, modern medicine, and agriculture," he said. "China is still striving to achieve modernization."China has become Israel's second largest trading partner, trailing only the U.S. Israel exported $2.8 billion to China in the first half of 2018, an 80 percent jump from the previous year. In the last two years, Israel and China have signed a breakthrough visa agreement, opened direct flights, and conducted hundreds of joint research projects."Our bilateral relations are at a new height," Wang said in a speech at the summit's gala. "Our arms are wide open, for countries to innovate, to start businesses in China."Netanyahu announced that the two countries will complete a free trade agreement next year, and that China plans to invest heavily in Israeli infrastructure, including new ports and a light rail."China and Israel are a perfect match," said Dale Aluf, the director of research for Sino-Israel Global Network & Academic Leadership, a think tank that promotes closer Israeli-Chinese relations. "China may be a huge market, but it has a lot of domestic problems--pollution, desertification, an aging population. Israel has the technology to solve those problems."Netanyahu also said he and Wang pledged to create professional training programs in agriculture, entrepreneurship and public health, allowing Israeli tech companies to penetrate the Chinese market. He stressed that China has made breakthroughs in intellectual property protection, likely attempting to assuage start-ups concerned about the risks of working in China.Wang called piracy worries "groundless," saying that China "has been working tirelessly to strengthen international protections."The leaders made no mention about Chinese trade policies that have created friction with the U.S. and Europe. Major trade partners have accused China of discriminating against foreign companies and forcing them to hand over crucial technology.Israeli defense experts also have expressed concerns that Chinese participation in massive national infrastructure projects may pose a security risk, given China's close relations with Israel's regional foes, such as Iran."We have to be cautious about the types of things we sell to China," said Aluf. "Defense technology is off the table. But we can sell health care and sustainable development so there's no reason for America to be upset," he said.Wang is one of the most senior Chinese officials to visit Israel since the countries established diplomatic relations in 1992. Credited with orchestrating China's anti-corruption purge and shoring up support for the Communist party, he is widely considered to be the most powerful vice president in China.Netanyahu and Wang toured exhibits by high-tech Israeli startups focused on self-driving cars, health care and agriculture. They also attended an evening gala where former Google CEO Eric Schmidt spoke, touting Israel's innovative potential, and will open a new Israeli innovation center together Thursday.Load-Date: October 25, 2018End of Document

In China, your car could be talking to the governmentAssociated Press InternationalNovember 29, 2018 Thursday 5:12 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; Only on APLength: 1056 wordsByline: By ERIKA KINETZ, Associated PressDateline: SHANGHAI BodySHANGHAI (AP) - Global automakers are feeding real-time location information and dozens of other data points from electric vehicles to Chinese government monitoring centers, potentially adding to China's rich kit of surveillance tools as President Xi Jinping steps up the use of technology to track Chinese citizens. Generally, it happens without car owners' knowledge, The Associated Press found.More than 200 automakers selling electric vehicles in China - including Tesla, Volkswagen, BMW, Daimler, Ford, General Motors, Nissan, Mitsubishi and U.S.-listed start-up NIO - send at least 61 data points to government-backed monitoring platforms, under rules published in 2016.Automakers say they are merely complying with local laws, which apply only to alternative energy vehicles. Chinese officials say the data is used for analytics to improve public safety, facilitate industrial development and infrastructure planning, and to prevent fraud in subsidy programs.But critics say the information collected exceeds those goals and could be used to undermine foreign carmakers' competitive position, or for surveillance. Under Xi's leadership, China has unleashed a war on dissent, marshalling big data and artificial intelligence to create a more perfect kind of policing that can quickly neutralize perceived threats to the stability of the ruling Communist Party.There is also concern about the precedent these rules set for sharing data from next-generation connected cars, which may soon transmit even more personal information."You're learning a lot about people's day-to-day activities and that becomes part of what I call ubiquitous surveillance," said Michael Chertoff, who was secretary of the Department of Homeland Security under President George W. Bush and wrote a book called "Exploding Data." "Companies have to ask themselves, 'Is this really something we want to do in terms of our corporate values, even if it means otherwise forgoing that market?'"At the Shanghai Electric Vehicle Public Data Collecting, Monitoring and Research Center, a wall-sized screen glows with dots. Each represents one of more than 222,000 vehicles connected to the system, coursing along Shanghai's roads to create a massive real-time map that could reveal where people live, shop, work, and worship.Data also flows to a national monitoring center run by the Beijing Institute of Technology, which pulls information from more than 1.1 million new energy vehicles. Those numbers are about to get much bigger, as Beijing pushes electric vehicle development as part of its "Made in China 2025" industrial development plan.Ding Xiaohua, the deputy director of the Shanghai center, said monitoring is not designed to facilitate state surveillance, though data can be shared with police, prosecutors or courts, if a formal request is made. The center is registered as a non-profit but is tightly aligned with and funded by the government.There is a privacy firewall built into the system. The data center has each car's unique vehicle identification number, but to link that with the owner's personal details, it must go through the automaker - a step it has taken in the past. Chinese law enforcement can also link the vehicle identification number with the owner's personal information."To speak bluntly, the government doesn't need to surveil through a platform like ours," Ding said.Many vehicles in the U.S., Europe and Japan transmit position information back to automakers, who feed it to car-tracking apps, maps that pinpoint nearby amenities and emergency services providers. But the data stops there. Government or law enforcement agencies would generally only be able to access vehicle data in the context of a specific criminal investigation and in the U.S. would typically need a court order, lawyers said.Automakers initially resisted sharing information with the Shanghai monitoring center; then the government made transmitting data a prerequisite for getting incentives."They gave you dozens of reasons why they can't give you the data," said a government consultant who helped evaluate the policy and spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive issues. "Then we offer the incentives. Then they want to give us the data because it's part of their profit."There was concern the shared data might reveal proprietary information about, for example, how hybrids switch between gas and battery power, and eventually set automakers up for commercial competition with a Chinese government entity.Ding said confidentiality agreements protect proprietary company information. Still, he is open about his desire to make money from the data. "We have done some explorations," he said. "But there is still a distance from truly monetizing it."China's ability to grab data as it flows from cars gives it an edge. China tends to view technology development as a key competitive resource. Though global automakers have received billions in incentives and subsidies from U.S., European and Japanese governments, they are contributing data to China that ultimately serves Beijing's strategic interests.Automakers stressed they share data to comply with Chinese law and obtain consent from car owners. Nearly all have announced plans to aggressively expand electric vehicle offerings in China, the world's biggest car market.Volkswagen Group China chief executive Jochem Heizmann said he could not guarantee the data would not be used for government surveillance, but stressed that Volkswagen keeps personal data, like the driver's identity, secure within its own systems."It includes the location of the car, yes, but not who is sitting in it," he said, adding that cars won't reveal more information than smart phones already do. "There is not a principle difference between sitting in a car and being in a shopping mall and having a smart phone with you."But not all electric vehicle owners feel the same.Standing beside his white Tesla Model X, Shan Junhua said he might not have bought the car if he'd known its journeys were being recorded."Tesla could have it, but why do they transmit it to the government?" Shan said. "Because this is about privacy."_____Associated Press researcher Chen Si contributed from Shanghai and Business Writer Yuri Kageyama contributed from Tokyo.Follow Kinetz on Twitter at https://twitter.com/ekinetzLoad-Date: November 30, 2018End of Document

Each represents one of more than 222,000 vehicles connected to the system, coursing along Shanghai's roads to create a massive real-time map that could reveal where people live, shop, work, and worship.Data also flows to a national monitoring center run by the Beijing Institute of Technology, which pulls information from more than 1.1 million new energy vehicles. Those numbers are about to get much bigger, as Beijing pushes electric vehicle development as part of its "Made in China 2025" industrial development plan.Ding Xiaohua, the deputy director of the Shanghai center, said monitoring is not designed to facilitate state surveillance, though data can be shared with police, prosecutors or courts, if a formal request is made. The center is registered as a non-profit but is tightly aligned with and funded by the government.There is a privacy firewall built into the system. The data center has each car's unique vehicle identification number, but to link that with the owner's personal details, it must go through the automaker - a step it has taken in the past. Chinese law enforcement can also link the vehicle identification number with the owner's personal information."To speak bluntly, the government doesn't need to surveil through a platform like ours," Ding said.Many vehicles in the U.S., Europe and Japan transmit position information back to automakers, who feed it to car-tracking apps, maps that pinpoint nearby amenities and emergency services providers. But the data stops there. Government or law enforcement agencies would generally only be able to access vehicle data in the context of a specific criminal investigation and in the U.S. would typically need a court order, lawyers said.Automakers initially resisted sharing information with the Shanghai monitoring center; then the government made transmitting data a prerequisite for getting incentives."They gave you dozens of reasons why they can't give you the data," said a government consultant who helped evaluate the policy and spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive issues. "Then we offer the incentives. Then they want to give us the data because it's part of their profit."There was concern the shared data might reveal proprietary information about, for example, how hybrids switch between gas and battery power, and eventually set automakers up for commercial competition with a Chinese government entity.Ding said confidentiality agreements protect proprietary company information. Still, he is open about his desire to make money from the data. "We have done some explorations," he said. "But there is still a distance from truly monetizing it."China's ability to grab data as it flows from cars gives it an edge. China tends to view technology development as a key competitive resource. Though global automakers have received billions in incentives and subsidies from U.S., European and Japanese governments, they are contributing data to China that ultimately serves Beijing's strategic interests.Automakers stressed they share data to comply with Chinese law and obtain consent from car owners. Nearly all have announced plans to aggressively expand electric vehicle offerings in China, the world's biggest car market.Volkswagen Group China chief executive Jochem Heizmann said he could not guarantee the data would not be used for government surveillance, but stressed that Volkswagen keeps personal data, like the driver's identity, secure within its own systems."It includes the location of the car, yes, but not who is sitting in it," he said, adding that cars won't reveal more information than smart phones already do. "There is not a principle difference between sitting in a car and being in a shopping mall and having a smart phone with you."But not all electric vehicle owners feel the same.Standing beside his white Tesla Model X, Shan Junhua said he might not have bought the car if he'd known its journeys were being recorded."Tesla could have it, but why do they transmit it to the government?" Shan said. "Because this is about privacy."_____Associated Press researcher Chen Si contributed from Shanghai and Business Writer Yuri Kageyama contributed from Tokyo.Follow Kinetz on Twitter at https://twitter.com/ekinetzLoad-Date: November 30, 2018End of Document

Stories from Slate; One key question it raises: What are the limits of American coercion?Slate MagazineDecember 7, 2018 Friday 3:19 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Washingtonpost.Newsweek Interactive Company, LLC. All Rights ReservedSection: FUTURE TENSE; TechnologyLength: 1717 wordsHighlight: What the Huawei Executive's Arrest Could Mean for the U.S.-China Trade TalksBodyThe world learned Wednesday night that on Dec. 1, Canadian authorities arrested Meng Wanzhou-the chief financial officer at Chinese electronics giant Huawei-over allegations that the company violated American sanctions on Iran. The timing of the arrest is very charged, and the stakes of the case are extremely high.Huawei is one of China's largest tech companies, and Meng is the daughter of its founder.She faces extradition to the United States while a 90-day clock is ticking on wide-ranging negotiations between the U.S. and China that, if fruitful, could reshape the two countries' globally vital trade relationship.Whether intentionally or not, the arrest came on the same day that U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping met at the G-20 in Buenos Aires. Following their dinner, the two governments announced a 90-day round of talks, during which the U.S. would pause planned tariff increases against China.Although the two sides differed considerably in how they described the agreement, reports and markets were initially optimistic that the nations' so-called trade war had entered a truce. The Trump administration had downplayed the potential for any deal during the meeting, and this announcement was the first strong signal of restraint in America's escalating pressure campaign against Chinese trade, market access, and intellectual property practices.Then, after Trump on Twitter dubbed himself "Tariff Man," market optimism seemed to deflate. And when markets opened after news of Meng's arrest, they dipped further downward.There are crucial unknowns about Meng's arrest and America's associated efforts against Huawei, but this development will certainly complicate U.S. efforts to coerce Chinese officials to capitulate to American demands and to abandon a development strategy that champions the Asian country's independent technological capabilities. Below are some of the case's most salient remaining questions and its most important likely consequences.1. Was the Huawei arrest designed to increase pressure on China during the tariff negotiations?News of Meng's arrest did not emerge for four days, but did Trump know during dinner with Xi that Canadian police were acting against a Huawei executive at the Americans' behest? Thursday night, the White House said that the president did not know before the meal. But meanwhile, National Security Adviser John Bolton told NPR that he            knew the arrest was coming in advance.If Trump knowingly took action on an issue the Chinese government regards as sensitive during a bilateral meeting, it wouldn't be the first time he's done it. At the leaders' first dinner in 2017, at Trump's Florida resort, the U.S. president surprised his Chinese counterpart with news that American forces had attacked targets in Syria. China's government had sided with Russia in supporting Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad, and Trump's revelation led            Chinese commentators to speculate that the administration wanted to make its threats against North Korea more credible.It is entirely possible that the U.S. case against Meng developed on its own time-scale over years of investigation into alleged sanctions violations. Without knowing when the United States asked Canada for its help, or when authorities learned of Meng's travel to Canada, it is hard to nail down whether the timing was a coincidence or a message.What seems clear is that U.S. law enforcement authorities were not restrained from acting at such a sensitive time. It's less clear what happens next. If Meng is successfully extradited to the United States, CNN reported that an administration source said she "could be used for leverage in trade talks." This may never happen, but if it does, it would be an extraordinary breach of diplomatic convention, and one that would pose retaliatory risks for thousands of Americans working in China.2.     This arrest follows a near total shutdown of Huawei's Chinese competitor ZTE over sanctions violations. What does ZTE's treatment tell us about U.S. efforts against Huawei ?U.S. scrutiny of Huawei goes back at least to 2012, when a congressional committee report identified the company, along with its smaller rival ZTE, as a risk to U.S. national security. The two companies "cannot be trusted to be free of foreign state influence and thus pose a security threat to the United States and to our systems," the report said.More recently, U.S. and other governments have scrutinized the role Huawei might play in next-generation 5G wireless infrastructure, which requires new technology and a lot of new hardware. Australia,            New Zealand, and            British Telecom have gone so far as to explicitly ban Huawei from their 5G build-outs.Getting shut out of markets is one thing. Earlier this year, however, in a related sanctions case, ZTE faced the real possibility of total shutdown. ZTE admitted in a 2017 settlement that it had violated sanctions by providing technology containing U.S. content to customers in Iran and North Korea. After the U.S. Commerce Department found, in a damning court filing, that ZTE had violated the settlement agreement, the government announced that it would impose a previously suspended penalty.That penalty, called a "denial order," would cut off ZTE from U.S. components, including semiconductors crucial to a wide array of the company's products. The announcement threw the company into shambles, causing it to cease "major operation activities." Only an intervention by Trump, after speaking with Xi, allowed the company to survive.The Huawei case is connected. ZTE documents unearthed in the U.S. investigation referred to a competing company they called "F7" as an example of how a company could arrange transactions to evade sanctions enforcement. Many believed F7 referred to Huawei.The U.S. action against an individual Huawei executive is different from a sanctions case against the company, but the memory of the ZTE case is fresh, and it is at least conceivable that the U.S. government would seek to threaten Huawei with a similar denial order.Huawei-a much larger company than ZTE and one with growing efforts to develop its own semiconductors and other core technologies instead of buying them from abroad-might not be forced to shut down by a denial order. But such an order would be dramatic and damaging for the company.3.  No question: U.S. determination to undermine Huawei will strengthen China's efforts to develop independent "core technology."For Chinese strategists, the ZTE case was a clarifying moment.Authorities had long sought to make Chinese computer systems more "secure and controllable." Edward Snowden's 2013 revelations about NSA surveillance galvanized concerns that Chinese use of American tech products could be an advantage for U.S. spies.In 2018, the denial order against ZTE made clear that the U.S. government was not merely wielding tariffs, but was also willing to use sanctions power in a way that would destroy a major Chinese company. In April, when ZTE's fate was uncertain, Xi gave a speech in which he underlined the importance of "construction of China as a cyber superpower through indigenous innovation." As our DigiChina project at New America            reported, Xi's emphasis on independent capabilities in "core technologies" echoed a speech he gave at a similar occasion two years earlier."Core technologies" refers to things like semiconductors, operating systems, and foundational A.I. algorithms without which no country can thrive at the leading edge of technological development-and Huawei and ZTE are two major developers of such capabilities. U.S. government threats to cut key firms off from these "core" components made China's perceived need to develop solutions without U.S. dependencies very clear.Though the technologies at issue have changed, the conflict has historical echoes, and Xi has seized upon them. In another April speech, he recalled China's rhetoric and practice of "self-reliance" during past blockades. Chinese people, he said, had "tightened their belts" and "grit their teeth," eventually succeeding in developing nuclear weapons and missile programs back in the 1960s.4.  What are the limits of American coercion?The Trump administration's economic policies toward China are designed to address longstanding U.S. grievances. Whether it's China failing to live up to expectations following acceptance into the WTO in 2001, blocking American firms from major sectors in China, or wrenching intellectual property from foreign companies through joint ventures or outright theft, stubborn trade-related frictions long predate Trump.What has changed is a turn from negotiations, quiet advocacy, and name-and-shame tactics to measures designed to be coercive, most prominently through an escalating tariff program. Though key administration figures have often disagreed (and often in full view of their Chinese counterparts), the broad Trump administration consensus is that the United States can exert enough pain on China economically and diplomatically that it will relent and accede to U.S.demands.But this economic coercion campaign comes alongside an emerging rivalry over security and geopolitics, one resulting from several factors: for instance, China's brazen violation of international law in the South China Sea, efforts on both sides to build military advantages over the other, and Chinese policies abroad that at times appear designed to make the world safer for authoritarianism, all amid alarming human rights abuses against Muslims in northwest China. This dynamic is not predestined to escalate, but nor is it clear how to stop it-especially given the volatile state of American politics.However the Trump administration fares in coercing Chinese concessions, it is all but certain that tariffs will not quash Chinese government efforts to free their country from foreign government leverage over its technological supply lines.Whether the U.S. is targeting Huawei for legitimate and laudable law enforcement goals or over murky national security suspicions, the administration must know that doing so will make the company even more important to its champions in Beijing. With the stakes heightened by a turn to coercion and a public test of wills, some concessions from China become ever more unlikely.Load-Date: December 7, 2018End of Document

HUAWEI AND EUROPE'S 5G CONUNDRUMStates News ServiceDecember 27, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 1458 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Center for the National Interest (former the Nixon Center):In a world marked by growing geopolitical rivalry between Washington and Beijing, American allies will increasingly face a stark choice between the two.by Erik BrattbergPhilippe Le CorreThe recent controversy in the United States, Japan and Australia over the Chinese technology giant, Huawei, is also beginning to reverberate across Europe . Several European countriesincluding the United Kingdom, France, Germany and the Czech Republic have all recently taken steps to scrutinize Huawei as they are preparing to hold auctions for awarding contracts to build out their respective 5G networks next year. Such steps are welcomed by Washington, which is actively pushing its allies and partners around the world to be more vigilant about Chinese 5G due to national security concerns.In the UK, the country's largest telecom provider, BT, has already announced plans to remove Huawei equipment from its existing networks. This is a far cry from the previous David Cameron government's lax approach toward China. Even the screening mechanism it introduced, the Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation Centre (HCSEC), failed to provide complete assurances that all risks to British national security posed by Huawei's involvement in the UK's critical networks were "sufficiently mitigated." Last summer, representatives of the "five eyes" (top intelligence chiefs for the United States, Canada, the UK, Australia and New Zealand) also decided to send strong warnings about risks presented by Huawei and ZTE, a state-owned Chinese telecommunications manufacturer.In Germany as well, there are concerns around the Chinese National intelligence law, as the intelligence community fears that Huawei could be asked by the Chinese government to incorporate "backdoors" into their equipment, allowing access to encrypted data for spying or sabotage purposes. Deutsche Telekom has recently decided to review its vendor plans in light of recent debates of the security of Chinese network equipment while France's Orange has already severed ties with Huawei. Under the guidance of ANSSI (Agence Nationale de la Securite des Syst mes d'Information) , French security agencies have been warning ministers for over a decade about potential risks, barring Huawei from government contractsdespite very competitive offers from the Chinese manufacturer.Yet, despite the recent uptick in the debate in Europe on Chinese 5G, many local providers are still working and testing with Chinese manufacturers, particularly Huawei. Huawei has signed MoUs with wireless providers in at least eight European countries and has tested with local providers in at least twelve EU member states. Earlier this month, Portugal's top wireless provider Altice signed a deal with Huawei to upgrade its networks to 5G.Given this deep market penetration and the fact that Huawei is a global industry leader with highly competitive prices, simply banning Huawei from supplying 5G equipment or removing them from existing networks in Europe is unlikely . Some European operators are also concerned that the exclusion of Chinese firms would lead to fewer vendors and, consequently, higher costs. On top of this, Huawei has skillfully managed to leverage its inroad into smartphone devices to gain credibility with European consumers as a reliable network provider. Within five years, Huawei products have become popular on Europe's retail market in a way few would have imagined. In 2011, it has also set up a business-to-business ecosystem focusing on supply, maintenance and providing technical advice for private sector companies and public institutions across Europe. Finally, Huawei is actively advertising across Europe and has hired lobbyists and consultants to help promote itself. Recently, Chinese manufacturers have been shifting their efforts towards the European market even more strongly.Unlike in the United States, where Huawei's role is far more restricted and skepticism surrounding Chinese technology is subject to far greater sensitivities, few European countries perceive China as a strategic rival. This means that for the time being, a coordinated transatlantic approach toward Chinese 5G is unlikely to emerge. That said, Europe may soon no longer have a choice. The Trump administration has made clear that it expects allies and partners to take steps to limit Chinese 5G , and to protect the security of telecoms networks and supply chains.Notwithstanding such U.S. pressure, Europe also has good reasons on its own to take a more stringent approach toward Chinese 5G. First, the European Commission has established that Huawei was able to become the EU's top telecommunication supplier in record time by receiving subsidies from Chinese state banks and other financial entities. Second, European officials acknowledge that critical infrastructure built with technology manufactured in China may give Chinese companies access to vast troves of sensitive data and industrial informationwhich ultimately might be turned over to Chinese authorities. Moreover, Chinese-manufactured infrastructure could make European countries vulnerable to Chinese spying, cyberattacks delivered through the network infrastructure, and overall national security threats . European Commission Vice President for Digital Single Market Andrus Ansip said earlier in December that "I think we have to be worried about Huawei and other Chinese companies," recalling the mandatory collaboration between certain technology companies and intelligence agencies in China.In the 5G era, these concerns are mounting as the number of connected machines and objects and reliance on fast data increases. Anticipating that 5G will transform the way humans communicate and operate supplies like power, water and health systems, the security risks connected to 5G infrastructure become significant. Other risks associated with relying on Chinese 5G equipment include intellectual property losses and a dependency on foreign infrastructure (China currently manufactures about 90 percent of the world's IT hardware).On top of these apparent national security concerns, there are also economic rationales to avoid becoming overly reliant on China in the digital age. 5G and its associated infrastructure are poised to be critical building blocks for the digitization of the global economy, enabling a wide variety of applications and new sectors such as advancing artificial intelligence systems and the Internet of Things. The potential payoffs of being a 5G leader are enormous a European Commission study estimated that investing 56.6 billion in 5G networks could yield economic benefits of 113.3 billion annually and generate 2.3 million new jobs by 2025. Patent-holding companies are slated to make billions in royalties, and countries with large and reliable networks will be able to develop emerging and new technologies with faster speeds.In this emerging competitive technological landscape, ensuring that Europe is a global leader in 5G is essential. China, South Korea and the United States are currently leading the race to 5G, with China pulling ahead. Although the EU and several of its member states are investing more in 5G and two Scandinavian companies (Nokia and Ericsson) are leading 5G technology manufacturers, the transition is not happening broadly or quickly enough . Losing the race to 5G would have significant negative repercussions on Europe's economy, along with the strategic implications of falling behind on the development of emerging technologies.Unfortunately, the current debate in Europe on how to enhance "strategic autonomy" is too narrow as it focuses mainly on carving out foreign policy independence from the Trump administration. How to ensure European sovereignty in the digital age deserves more attention. This starts with boosting European RandD spending, favoring European alternatives to Huawei, better understanding the security risks of Chinese 5G, and beefing up national and EU-wide investment screening schemes. Greater transatlantic information exchange and intelligence sharing with the United States on China is also called for.Yet, even if Chinese telecom infrastructure companies like Huawei and ZTE are not formally curtailed, the combination of the EU's forthcoming investment screening framework and growing U.S. pressure may see Chinese investments in European 5G decrease. Even though relying on European providers may be more expensive and potentially delay the 5G deployment, avoiding an over-reliance on any foreign companies could support the EU's "strategic autonomy" agenda in the digital age whilst also benefiting the European economy long-term.Load-Date: December 29, 2018End of Document

The Asian country is also home to some of the most powerful technology companies in the world, some of which already have a strong presence in Mexico and are beginning to gain market thanks to their relatively accessible offers. DIDI Founded three years after Uber, DiDi Chuxing has become the main competitor of Travis Kalanick's startup, so much so that it won the Chinese market and is already the largest travel company in the world, partly because companies like Apple, Tencent and Alibaba support it. Its president, Jean Liu, is one of the most influential women in the world of technology in China. -It is valued at 56 billion dollars. -Up to February 2018, Didi had 400 million customers registered in more than 40 cities around the world. - Apple injected a billion dollars in investment. -It has a research laboratory in Silicon Valley where former Uber employees and other technology workers work. -The service arrived in Mexico in November with an aggressive discount plan to attract market. HUAWEI Founded by businessman Ren Zhengfei, Huawei has become the second company that produces more smartphones. It is present in 170 countries and has 180 thousand employees around the world. However, the United States, Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand restricted the commercialization of their smartphones due to the supposed risk of espionage by the Chinese government. - Huawei means "magnificent act" or "splendid act" in Chinese. -With a brand value of 8.4 billion dollars, it is the only Chinese company in the ranking of the most valuable brands in the world 2018 of Forbes. -The recognition of the brand increased by 85 percent in 2017, according to IPSOS. -The technology company boats 3.3 percent of the global smartphone market, according to The CIU. ALIBABA Alibaba Group. It was born with the aim of connecting local producers with foreign merchants and in 2017 it surpassed Amazon as the largest company in the sector that is listed on the stock market, winning, at that time, 11 times more than the company of Jeff Bezos. It was founded in 1999 by Jack Ma, the richest man in China and a member of the Chinese Communist Party. -In 2017 it was the fifth best-quoted company, just below Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft and Facebook. -In 2012, its sales exceeded those of Amazon and Ebay together. -Actually, Alibaba is present in 200 countries and its biggest sales peak is during the Bachelor's Day. - Jack's real name is Ma Yun. He adopted the name Jack after a tourist will call him that during his youth. - It is expected that in 2019, Alibaba will install wineries and offices in Mexico. XIAOMI With just eight years in the market, Xiaomi has become one of the fastest growing Chinese startups in the world. In 2013 alone, it managed to position the Xiaomi Mi2Sl as the most popular smartphone of the year in China, ahead of Samsung's Galaxy S4 and Apple's iPhone 5, according to figures from the Antutu portal. - They have sold 16 billion dollars during their eight years. -They employ approximately 15 thousand people around the world. -It occupies the fourth place in the sale of smartphones with 34.3 million marketed in 2018, according to IDC. -The products are sold at cost or with a very low profit margin, according to its founder Lei Jun, is around 1 or 2 percent. -The brand officially arrived in Mexico in mid-2017 and its first physical store opened on December 8th. in Toreo Park. MOBIKE The idea was of the journalist intechnology Hu Weiwei, who in 2015 undertook, along with two other co-founders, the startup of shared bicycles without anchoring, which today is the largest in the sector. With just three years in the market, Mobike already has a presence in 200 cities in 19 countries, which allowed its founders to sell it last April for 3 thousand 400 million dollars. -With the sale of Mobike, each of its founders earned more than one billion dollars. -Up to 2016, investors injected Mobike, 928 million, according to figures from the company. -In 2016, the goal of trips made was one million, the figure tripled. -With the arrival of Mobike, in China there was a "boom" of shared bikes, reaching up to 70 companies. -In the CDMX began with 500 bicycles (March 2018), today there are already thousand 400 operating.       Load-Date: December 15, 2018End of Document

BIG BROTHER IS HERE: WHY CHINA'S 'SOCIAL CREDIT' MONITORING TOOL SHOULD TERRIFY YOUStates News ServiceNovember 5, 2018 MondayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 549 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Center for the National Interest (former the Nixon Center):There are many policies that the Chinese Communist government ought to reverse, but the social credit system is the latestand may be the most blatantintrusion into the lives of the Chinese people yet.by Patrick Farrell Patrick TyrrellFor people living in China, government repression is a fact of life.The country earned a rating of "mostly unfree" in the latest Heritage Foundation Index of Economic Freedom and is judged politically "not free" by Freedom House.Unfortunately, the situation may soon become worse.The Chinese government has unveiled a new program that it dubbed the "social credit system." The system won't be fully operational until 2020, but already it has generated as many as 7 million punishments.The system would rate the "trustworthiness" of Chinese citizens according to a wide variety of factors, such as what they buy, how they spend their time, and who their friends are, just to name a few.The government would then take those deemed untrustworthy and punish them by not letting their children attend prestigious private schools, not allowing them to travel, and shutting down their internet presence.The Chinese Communist government promises that the social credit system will "allow the trustworthy to roam freely under heaven while making it hard for the discredited to take a single step."However, one must ask what it means to be "untrustworthy."In the case of journalist Liu Hu, it could mean trying to expose government corruption. Other offenses could be things such as jaywalking, smoking on a train, criticizing the government, or having friends or family that speak ill of the government, all things that can lower one's score.This social credit system monitors people all day, every day from a variety of sources. For starters, millions of surveillance cameras with facial-recognition technology are already watching people as they go about their day-to-day activities, silently recording, judging, and updating, all in real time.Another monitoring method is through one's activity on one's smartphone through apps. The Chinese closely monitor their population's internet usage and behavior, and require internet service providers and telecommunications companies to cooperate.Resources such as government records, financial documents, and education are also used.All in all, it's Big Brother come to life.For many people, especially in the West, the very notion of a social credit system would be unthinkable. It is a system that quite literally allows the government to monitor its citizens in every aspect of their daily lives.It restricts not only their personal privacy, but also their economic freedom, by not allowing them to participate fully in the free market if the government does not like their lifestyle.China has made significant gains in its economic prosperity over the years. However, history has shown that nations that regularly oppress their people and stifle economic potential will never be as prosperous as nations that do not.There are many policies that the Chinese Communist government ought to reverse, but the social credit system is the latestand may be the most blatantintrusion into the lives of the Chinese people yet.Load-Date: November 6, 2018End of Document

Connection or control? On the new Silk Road, two tales of China compete; Beijing has cast itself as a global leader, trumpeting connectivity and trade and spearheading the $1 trillion Belt and Road Initiative. But its policies at home underscore a different reality, and more of China's partners are taking note.The Christian Science MonitorDecember 18, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 Christian Science Publishing Society All Rights ReservedSection: WorldLength: 2211 wordsByline: Ann Scott Tyson CorrespondentBodyThe Pakistani businessman braved the rugged Karakoram Highway, crossed the freezing Khunjerab Pass, and spent an hour undergoing security at China's border to reach the city of Kashgar, in the frontier region of Xinjiang.Eager to promote his adventure tourism company, the young entrepreneur set out in October in hopes of finding a travel agency to partner with. Instead, he ran up against China's paramilitary surveillance state and its anti-Muslim policies.It began with a simple transaction - trading US dollars for Chinese yuan. He passed through one of Kashgar's ubiquitous airport-style security checks, entered a Bank of China branch, and waited to see a teller. "I went to the window at my turn, but when they saw my first name was Mohammad, they refused to change the money," he says, asking that his last name be withheld.Mohammad soon learned that, as a Muslim and foreigner, he would be met with intense suspicion and harassment by authorities in Xinjiang. He was forbidden from praying at Kashgar's ancient Id Kah mosque, told that the posted prayer times were just for show. Hotels denied him rooms. Police interrogated him, and he spent a night in a squad car. Soon, he abandoned his plan.Xinjiang authorities have detained as many as 1 million people in reeducation camps, according to human rights groups, in a campaign to eradicate what authorities label the "three evil forces" of separatism, religious extremism, and terrorism.Most are Muslim ethnic minorities, many targeted because of contacts or travel in 26 "sensitive countries" with large Muslim populations, including Pakistan. Some are spouses and children of citizens from neighboring Pakistan, Kazakhstan, and elsewhere, and foreigners have been detained. The repression is complicating foreign ventures like Mohammad's - and also Beijing's largest overseas experiment of all.China has pledged $1 trillion in loans and investments to its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a plan to build a vast web of roads, railways, ports, and pipelines across nearly 70 countries on three continents, tracing the ancient paths of the Silk Road. The goal is to spur commerce and interconnectivity, while advancing Chinese strategic interests and influence, analysts say.Xinjiang, a huge, resource-rich swath of desert and mountains on China's western periphery that shares borders with six countries, is an essential BRI hub and gateway to the rest of Eurasia. But experts warn that the harsh crackdown here, which Chinese officials argue is needed for stability, exposes a basic contradiction - and weakness - underlying China's push to assert itself as a world power."The fundamental contradiction at the heart of the strategy ... is between the idea of connectivity and the flow of Chinese goods, ideas, and information globally, and this concern for stability domestically," says James Leibold, an expert in Chinese ethnic policy at La Trobe University in Melbourne, Australia. "You can't have true connectivity and leadership on global trade when domestically your key driver is stability maintenance and locking down people."President Xi Jinping has centralized the Communist Party's power - with himself at the helm - to a degree not seen since the rule of revolutionary leader Mao Zedong. Meanwhile, he is tightening the party's grip on not only Xinjiang but many aspects of Chinese society, highlighting Beijing's authoritarian priorities in a way that experts say limits the appeal of a global leadership role."It speaks to an inherent weakness in China itself, the necessity to repress people to this extent," says Elizabeth Economy, senior fellow and director for Asia studies at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. China's autocratic trend, along with pressing internal problems such as economic inequality, pollution, and the weak rule of law, undermine Beijing's efforts to advance its "soft power" and promote itself as a model for other countries to follow, she says."With artificial intelligence, the installing of cameras, what is going on at universities, constraints on the internet - it's part of a continuum of political repression and a fusion of political and technological means of repression," Dr. Economy says. "There are few citizenries globally that will look at that as an attractive option. That is a big challenge for China as it goes forward globally and tries to sell itself."Belt-er bewareSince the Communist Party took power in 1949, China has mobilized a large migration into Xinjiang of millions of ethnic Han Chinese, who now make up nearly 40 percent of the population once dominated by Muslim, Turkic-speaking ethnic groups such as Uyghurs and Kazakhs. Hans have taken over land, commerce, and oil and gas industries as well as other resources, and typically hold higher paying jobs. This encroachment - as well as the party's severe restrictions on Islam and minority cultures - has caused resentment among Uyghurs and other Xinjiang ethnic groups. Similar concerns exist in some countries involved in BRI, with local people worried Chinese workers and companies will gain the lion's share of jobs, sales, profits, and other economic gains. China's polluting plants, relatively lax safety standards, and use of what critics call "debtbook diplomacy" to extract concessions when countries fail to repay Chinese loans have also stirred public opposition, as well as doubts in some governments that initially welcomed the influx of Chinese-funded projects.A flagship BRI project in Pakistan, the $62 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, includes a 2,000-mile conduit of roads, railways, and pipelines linking Pakistan's Chinese-operated port of Gwadar with Xinjiang. The pipelines will create the fastest route for China to import oil and gas from the Middle East and Africa.Key infrastructure will go through the region of Balochistan, where nationalists charge that local people will benefit little from the project. Popular opposition is significant, and Pakistan's new premier Imran Khan has reportedly pushed to focus the project on job creation. In late November, a militant nationalist group that opposes the project, the Balochistan Liberation Army, attacked the Chinese consulate in Karachi.Kazakhstan, where China has invested heavily in the energy sector, is another key BRI partner where concerns over Chinese influence are growing. Beijing is also building a major rail hub in Kazakhstan to load and unload trains running from China toward Russia and western Europe. But in 2016, when Kazakhstan's government proposed allowing foreigners to rent land for 25 years, protests erupted in opposition to what many Kazakhs feared would turn into a Chinese land grab, and the government postponed the plan. This year, Kazakhstan has quietly pressed China to release Kazakh citizens from detention in Xinjiang, as more ethnic Kazakhs speak out about about how they or their relatives have been ensnared in the camps.In Malaysia, amid concern over what Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad calls "a new version of colonialism," the government this year suspended a $20 billion BRI railroad project and canceled pipeline projects worth $3 billion backed by China. Mr. Mahathir has vowed to review all "unequal treaties" linked to Beijing.And in southern Sri Lanka last year, China obtained a 99-year lease on a port after the city of Colombo failed to repay Chinese loans, a move criticized as an erosion of Sri Lankan sovereignty."We have seen a lot of backlash and projects stalled," says Economy. "The talk about the major land acquisitions in Kazakhstan and the port in Sri Lanka has bred calls of neocolonialism." Problems with China's overseas business practices - such as debt sustainability, environmental concerns, and labor issues - are not new, but now the scale is magnified, analysts say.Exporting ideasThe gap between China's rhetoric of interconnected development and the reality of its policies on the ground is felt acutely on the streets of Kashgar. Wall paintings of smiling and dancing ethnic minorities and huge red banners proclaiming love for the Communist Party contrast with the fearful looks on the faces of people walking by. Helmeted police carrying rifles and shields scan people's IDs and cellphones at checkpoints before they can enter neighborhoods ringed with barbed wire and surveillance cameras. Police lead shopkeepers armed with clubs in mandatory anti-terrorism drills at set times each day."The Chinese state needs to be in complete control [in Xinjiang] and so they just keep hammering the nail harder," says Sean Roberts, director of the international development studies program at George Washington University's Elliott School of International Affairs. Dr. Roberts believes the government views the Uyghur population in Xinjiang as an obstacle to Beijing's economic expansion plans, and so is pressing ahead with strong-armed cultural and ideological assimilation.Chinese officials and experts defend the stringent security and reeducation camps - which they call "vocational training" facilities - as needed to prevent terrorism."The three evil forces - separatism, extremism, and terrorism - are stubborn diseases," wrote Niu Changzhen, an official at the general office of Xinjiang's Communist Party Committee, in an October article in the state-run Global Times newspaper. "Acute illnesses need equally drastic medicine."Since the 1990s, Uyghurs have committed a number of knife and bombing attacks, and some protests in Xinjiang have turned violent. But many foreign analysts who study the region say China has exaggerated the terrorist threat, inaccurately labeling Uyghur rights groups and a small number of militants as terrorists. They attribute spontaneous acts of violent resistance by ethnic Muslims to China's decades of repression. "The Chinese government has created the only enemy it ever faced from Uyghurs," Roberts says.As part of China's bid for greater influence, Beijing is promoting counterterrorism cooperation with Central Asian nations and others participating in BRI, while seeking to export its values, policies, security systems, and surveillance technology. This is a lucrative prospect for Chinese companies profiting in Xinjiang, and for China's race to lead the world in artificial intelligence.  A representative of the Chinese security software firm Leon Technology, which is heavily involved in Xinjiang's surveillance state, said at a 2017 conference that the market has "huge and unlimited potential" and Leon seeks to become the most influential security firm in Central Asia, according to a transcript of his speech by the ChinAI newsletter, which focuses on China's artificial intelligence policy and strategy."To crack down on the 'three forces,' international cooperation is of prime significance, especially coordination among countries in South and West Asia and Central Asia, which serve as the main gateways for infiltration and escape of Chinese terrorists," wrote Wang Peng, an associate research fellow at People's University in Beijing, in an August op-ed in Global Times.Chinese officials suggest other countries should emulate the anti-extremist policies and approach to human rights in Xinjiang. China's model emphasizes state-led development to provide for the basic needs of the majority, often at the expense of political, civil, and minority rights. The severe restrictions in Xinjiang are "ensuring most people's safety, which is protecting human rights to the greatest extent," said Li Wei, a Beijing-based terrorism expert, in a Nov. 20 Global Times article.Eyes on XinjiangYet China's aspirations as a global power may suffer as the world takes note of its actions in Xinjiang.More than 630 scholars from 40 countries, 21 of which participate in the BRI, have signed a statement urging action to address "the mass human rights abuses" in Xinjiang. The Nov. 26 statement calls for economic sanctions on Chinese leaders and companies involved with the detentions, UN action to investigate and close the camps, and expediting asylum requests for members of Xinjiang's Turkic Muslim minority groups. It urges countries negotiating BRI projects to make their participation contingent upon China ceasing repression in Xinjiang.Another group of more than 115 Sinologists from the Czech Republic and Slovakia - both in the BRI - have condemned the reeducation camps and called for their closure. Beijing is exaggerating the threat of religious extremism as a pretext to consolidate control over Xinjiang because the region is critical to the BRI, the statement says.Published on Dec. 10, Human Rights Day, the statement also voices strong concern over China's push under Mr. Xi's leadership to promote its own national concept of human rights, and encourages other nations to do the same. Denying the universal validity of the values embodied in the United Nation's Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and entitling governments to define them "in accordance with their own needs," will ultimately threaten "the rights and freedoms of other countries' citizens," it says."The issue of Xinjiang and political repression and aggression in China is raised at every conference," Economy says, "as a sign that China is not moving in the right direction." Graphic The Id Kah mosque in central Kashgar, Xinjiang region, China, is largely deserted apart from Chinese tourists, seen here taking a snapshot outside.

Wray, Nielsen: China Trying To Influence US Midterm ElectionsThe FrontrunnerOctober 11, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 Bulletin News Network, Inc.Section: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 1119 wordsBodyReuters (10/10, Chiacu) reports DHS Secretary Nielsen and FBI Director Wray warned lawmakers Wednesday that China "is waging an unprecedented campaign to influence American public opinion as November congressional elections approach and presents the greatest long-term counterintelligence threat to the United States." Asked by members of the Senate Homeland Security Committee about President Trump's assertion that China is interfering in US elections, Nielsen said, "China absolutely is on an unprecedented - or exerting unprecedented effort to influence American opinion. We have not seen to date any Chinese attempts to compromise election infrastructure." Wray, Reuters says, "went farther," saying, "China in many ways represents the broadest, most complicated, most long-term counterintelligence threat we face." Russia, he added, "is in many ways fighting to stay relevant after the fall of the Soviet Union. They're fighting today's fight. China's is fighting tomorrow's fight."Mnuchin Signals Crackdown On Chinese Investment In Sensitive US Industries.The New York Times (10/10, Rappeport, 16.73M) reports Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said Wednesday that the Administration "will begin cracking down on foreign investment in sensitive American industries like technology and telecommunications," and "will start using new powers that give the United States greater authority to review and block Chinese and other international transactions that pose a threat to national security." According to the Times, "The expanded review system, which Congress passed into law this summer, will apply to a wide array of foreign transactions but is aimed primarily at China." Said Mnuchin, "These temporary regulations address specific risks to US critical technology while informing the development of final regulations that will fully implement Firrma [the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act]."DOJ Charges Chinese Spy With Attempting To Steal Trade Secrets From US Firms.The Washington Times (10/10, Mordock, 520K) reports the Justice Department announced charges Wednesday against "a Chinese government operative who authorities say tried to steal tried secrets from US aviation and aerospace companies, including GE Aviation." Yanjun Xu, a "senior officer with the Ministry of State Security," is accused of "luring US executives to China with the attempt of stealing their company's technology, officials said."The AP (10/10) reports that from 2013 until he was arrested in April, Xu "would recruit employees from major aerospace companies, including GE Aviation, and convince them to travel to China under the guise that they would give a presentation at a university, prosecutors said." Xu was arrested in Belgium, and extradited to the US on Tuesday. In what the Washington Post (10/10, Nakashima, 12.5M) calls "a first, federal agents lured a Chinese government spy to Belgium, where authorities transferred him this week to the United States for prosecution on economic espionage charges." Current and former officials "said Xu's extradition is apparently the first time a Chinese government spy has been brought to the United States to face charges."The New York Times (10/10, Benner, 16.73M) reports in a statement, FBI Assistant Director for Intelligence, William Priestap, said, "This unprecedented extradition of a Chinese intelligence officer exposes the Chinese government's direct oversight of economic espionage against the United States." John C. Demers, head of the Justice Department's National Security Division, said the Department "is pursuing other thefts of trade secrets for prosecution. ... Together, he said, they show that China has a policy of developing its economy 'at America's expense.'" The Wall Street Journal (10/10, Viswanatha, Subscription Publication, 6.33M) reports the Chinese Embassy didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.Wray, Nielsen Pressed About Report On Malicious Chinese Server Chips.Bloomberg News (10/10, Strohm, 5.24M) reports that in testimony before the Senate Homeland Security Committee Wednesday, Wray "deflected questions from a Republican senator about a Bloomberg Businessweek report that China's intelligence services used subcontractors to plant malicious chips in servers bound for major US companies, including Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc." Sen. Ron Johnson, the panel's chairman, asked Wray, "How come I'm finding out from Bloomberg and not in terms of contact from the federal government? ... If this is not accurate, I would like to have the FBI or somebody come out and say it's not." At the same hearing, Nielsen "repeated her agency's previous position on the report," saying, "We at DHS do not have any evidence that supports the article."Apple's Cook Visits China.The Washington Post (10/10, Fifield, 12.5M) reports that Apple CEO Tim Cook was in China today in what are "trying times to be an American company operating in China, let alone an American tech giant that counts on China for contract manufacturing and sales." The Post adds, "Although Apple largely dodged the tariffs President Trump imposed on Chinese imports last month, it is still caught in the middle of the increasingly acrimonious trade war." According to the Post, "The Chinese government has repeatedly, and not very subtly, suggested that American corporate leaders such as Cook should help broker a solution to the trade war by talking sense to Washington."Axios: US Garlic Growers "Thrilled" With US-China Trade War.Axios (10/10, Brown, 591K) reports, "American farmers are livid with President Trump's tariffs. But not garlic growers. Reeling after a quarter-century-long war with Chinese garlic farmers, they are thrilled with a trade war that they say could finally give them the advantage on US turf." Ken Christopher, who runs the largest US garlic producer, "says that even though the tariff will not equal out the prices, the penalty will make it less profitable for Chinese growers."Lawmakers Urge FBI To Probe Claims Of Chinese Intimidation Against Immigrants.The Washington Post (10/10, Shih, 12.5M) reports US lawmakers on Wednesday "called for a stronger response to the Chinese government's repression of Muslims in China's far west and asked the FBI to investigate claims of intimidation against some immigrant communities in the United States." To the Post, the remarks, "coinciding with annual rights report by the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, were the latest signal of more assertive US statements on Chinese rights issues" as the Administration also "presses its trade battles with Beijing." The congressional commission, it says, "used this year's report to highlight the persecution of Chinese Uighurs."Load-Date: October 11, 2018End of Document

Google employees push to cancel Chinese search engine in new letteriCrowdNewswire (English)November 29, 2018 Thursday 12:10 PM GMTCopyright 2018 iCrowdNewswire, LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 912 wordsBody                   Google employees have renewed their public protests against  Project Dragonfly,  a censored and surveillance-enabling search app that Google is reportedly building for the Chinese market.

Continue reading Google employees push to cancel Chinese search engine in new letterGoogle employees have renewed their public protests against  Project Dragonfly,  a censored and surveillance-enabling search app that Google is reportedly building for the Chinese market. An open letter, published on Medium today, says Dragonfly would make Google complicit in human rights abuses by the Chinese government. It urges Google leadership to cancel the project and accuses them of ignoring repeated employee complaints.Over a thousand Google employees signed a letter protesting Dragonfly in August. This new Medium post focuses on similar concerns, but it s being posted online, rather than circulated internally.  Google leadership has failed to respond to employees who have raised questions for months,  it says.  So far, there have been no satisfactory answers. The letter outlines the core problems with Dragonfly: it would help the Chinese government extend its already extensive surveillance state, and it would signal that Google is willing to capitulate to other governments who want to censor the internet.Our company s decision comes at a time when the Chinese government is openly expanding its surveillance powers and mechanisms for population control. Many of these rely on advanced technologies, and combine online activity, personal records, and mass monitoring to track and profile citizens. Reports are already showing who bears the cost, including Uyghurs, women s rights advocates, and students. Giving the Chinese government ready access to user data, as required by Chinese law, would make Google complicit in oppression and human rights abuses.Dragonfly would also enable censorship and government-directed disinformation, and destabilize the ground truth on which popular deliberation and dissent rely. Given the Chinese government s reported suppression of dissident voices, such controls would likely be used to silence marginalized people, and favor information that promotes government interests.We refuse to build technologies that aid the powerful in oppressing the vulnerable, wherever they may be. The Chinese government certainly isn t alone in its readiness to stifle freedom of expression, and to use surveillance to repress dissent. Dragonfly in China would establish a dangerous precedent, one that would make it harder for Google to deny other countries similar concessions.Google has said little about Dragonfly, but numerous reports have detailed its planned features, which reportedly range from blocking specific keywords like  human rights  to linking searches with users  phone numbers. Its existence caused one former senior research scientist, Jack Poulson, to resign in protest. The new letter is currently signed by 11 employees, including Google Open Research lead Meredith Whittaker.This letter comes as Amnesty International protestors gather outside Google offices to protest Dragonfly. In a press release, technology and human rights researcher Joe Westby called the app  a watershed moment for Google.  Releasing Dragonfly would reverse a decision made in 2010 when Google pulled out of China to avoid working with government censors.Many of us accepted employment at Google with the company s values in mind, including its previous position on Chinese censorship and surveillance, and an understanding that Google was a company willing to place its values above its profits. After a year of disappointments including Project Maven, Dragonfly, and Google s support for abusers, we no longer believe this is the case. This is why we re taking a stand.We join with Amnesty International in demanding that Dragonfly be canceled. We also demand that leadership commit to transparency, clear communication, and real accountability. We deserve to know what we re building and we deserve a say in these significant decisions.Employees at other companies have previously used Medium as a way to highlight problems: Amazon and Microsoft employees published letters raising concerns about military contracts last month. And as the letter indicates, Google has raised employees  ire multiple times this year. It signed a deal with the US government for a military AI system called Project Maven, which it wound down after protests. Thousands of Google employees also protested the company s handling of sexual assault and harassment allegations, leading Google to change how it handled sexual misconduct.When reached for comment, a Google spokesperson directed The Verge to an earlier comment.  We ve been investing for many years to help Chinese users, from developing Android, through mobile apps such as Google Translate and Files Go, and our developer tools. But our work on search has been exploratory, and we are not close to launching a search product in China,  it reads.Tags: See Campaign:https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/27/18114285/google-employee-china-censorship-protest-project-dragonfly-search-engine-letterContact Information:Adi RobertsonTags:,            Wire,            Artificial Intelligence Newswire,            United States,            EnglishLoad-Date: November 29, 2018End of Document| About LexisNexis | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions | Copyright © 2021 LexisNexis Page 29 of 319Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee Issues Testimony From State Deputy Assistant Secretary Busby  Page 31 of 319Automakers give the Chinese government access to location data of electric cars  Page 35 of 319Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee Issues Testimony From State Department on China Challenge  Page 39 of 319U.S. Trade Representative Updates Section 301 Investigation  Page 42 of 319CHINA'S NON-TRADITIONAL ESPIONAGE AGAINST THE UNITED STATES: THE THREAT AND POTENTIAL POLICY RESPONSES  Page 45 of 319FBI Issues Statement on China's Non-Traditional Espionage Against U.S.  Page 48 of 319CARDIN, BIPARTISAN GROUP OF SENATORS URGE PRESSURE ON CHINESE AT G-20 TO END THE USE OF EXIT BANS ON AMERICANS  Page 51 of 319Sen.
