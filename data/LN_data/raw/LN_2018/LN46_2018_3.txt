The multiple commercial fronts opened by the United StatesCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJune 19, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 973 wordsBody This is a panorama of the commercial fronts opened by the White House.  China  The Department of Commerce announced on Tuesday its preliminary decision to apply anti-dumping measures to imports of ordinary aluminum sheets from China.  If the decision is confirmed from now to October 30 as established by the procedure, these measures of punishment, which are intended to compensate for supposed subsidies to these products, would represent a new blow to Chinese imports, already in the sights of Washington.  The Department of Commerce had initiated an investigation on its own on aluminum sheets in November, a measure described as "historic" by the government, since it normally launches research on the impact of subsidies only after a complaint from the private sector.  The last time the US government had taken the initiative in this appeal dates back to the imposition of anti-dumping measures in 1985 against the Japanese semiconductor industry.  In its preliminary decision, the Department of Commerce estimated that ordinary aluminum sheets were placed on the US market at a price 167.16% below their real value.  President Donald Trump on Monday asked his administration to identify 200 billion dollars of Chinese goods to apply additional tariffs of 10%.  This is a response from the US president to the "unacceptable" reprisals of Beijjing, after Trump announced on Friday last week tariffs of 25% on goods imported from China for 50 billion dollars, to compensate for the alleged theft of property. intellectual and technology on the part of the Asian giant.  The Chinese government responded by announcing equivalent reprisals against US products and called on the other affected countries to take "collective action".  The United States had already unilaterally imposed tariffs of 25% on steel imports and 10% on aluminum imports from any country, which affects China.  The Trump government seeks to reduce by 200,000 million dollars its trade deficit with Beijing, currently of 375,000 million dollars.  European Union  In retaliation to US tariffs on steel and aluminum, the European Union (EU) adopted reprisals "unanimously" last Thursday against dozens of US products, including tobacco, bourbon, jeans and motorcycles .  The European countermeasures on the products of the list seek to compensate in some 2,800 million euros the damages that will cause to their industry the American taxes.  Later, the EU could apply tariffs on other US products, worth 3,600 million euros, in case it wins a dispute that confronts the United States in the World Trade Organization (WTO).  In addition, the EU is concerned about the rates that the United States considers applying to imported cars. Those rates, which could reach 25%, would hit hard exporters like Germany.  We suggest: Europe approves the 'an eye for an eye & # 39; against Trump tariffs  Canada and Mexico  Trump warned that the recurring criticism of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who considers the US tariffs on steel and aluminum "insulting", would cost Canada "dear".  Canada announced retaliatory trade measures for July.  On the other hand, negotiations between the United States, Mexico and Canada to modernize the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in forcesince 1994 they skate.  The automotive industry is at the center of the discussions. The Trump government wants vehicles manufactured in Mexico or Canada to be mostly made up of parts manufactured in the United States.  It also calls for a "twilight clause," which would force the agreement to be renegotiated every five years, a proposal that has met with strong resistance from the representatives of Mexico and Canada.  Following Washington's announcement on steel and aluminum, Mexico decided to impose equivalent tariffs "on various products" imported from the United States, including some steels, fruits and cheeses.  Lee: Trump threatens tariffs on cars and calls Trudeau weak  Russia  Also affected by steel tariffs, Russia informed the WTO that it considers taking measures in reprisal. Moscow says that those US taxes cost about 538 million dollars.  Trade relations between the two countries are also marked by sanctions imposed by Washington against various personalities and entities, accused of participating in Moscow's "attacks" against "Western democracies".  Iran  The United States announced in early May its withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear agreement signed in the government of Barack Obama, and decided to reinstate its sanctions on Tehran and all companies with ties to the Islamic republic.  The Americans gave the companies 90 to 180 days to withdraw from Iran. The first stage of the reinstatement of sanctions, set for August 6, will include the civil aeronautics and automobile sector. On November 4, the energy and financial sectors will be added.  The French group Total announced that it will abandon a large gas project initiated in July 2017 in Iran unless it obtains a derogation from the provision by the US authorities. The PSA builder has already announced his retirement from Iran.  Japan  Affected since March by steel tariffs, Japan informed the WTO of its willingness to retaliate tariffs on US merchandise of 50,000 million yen (385 million euros).  We suggest: Justin Trudeau will cost his critics a lot of money, warns Donald Trump  Japan's main concern is tariffs that the United States can impose on imported cars. Those measures "would cause serious turbulence on international markets," Tokyo warned in a joint statement with Brussels.  South Korea  The White House announced on May 1 that it had renegotiated its free trade agreement with Seoul, thereby ending a conflict with South Korea.  For that agreement, Seoul agrees to open its market more to US cars and promised to reduce its steel sales to the United States by 30%. Load-Date: June 20, 2018End of Document

Stanford Study Offers a Glimpse Into Shortcomings in China's Anti-corruption DriveTargeted News ServiceJune 14, 2018 Thursday 7:26 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 907 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: STANFORD, California BodyStanford University issued the following news release:When Chinese President Xi Jinping took office in 2012, he launched the most extensive anti-corruption drive since Maoist rule in China.For many in China, the campaign was considered a success: it put government authorities under intense scrutiny and curbed corruption. But, as Stanford scholars have discovered, there are some shortcomings in how information about graft was gathered from the public.In a new paper published in the American Political Science Review, Jennifer Pan, an assistant professor of communication in the Stanford School of Humanities and Sciences, found that citizen complaints of lower management wrongdoing in one Chinese city were routinely concealed from senior authorities.Hidden in plain sightPan's study, co-authored with graduate student Kaiping Chen, comes from an analysis they conducted of a leaked email archive that came from a city in central China. Although the leaked email archive has received significant press coverage and has remained publicly available, it has not been systematically analyzed, the two scholars noted.In their investigation of the email archive, Pan and Chen found it contained not just internal communications among lower-tier officials of the city but messages they sent to senior authorities as well. Attached to their messages were more than 600 "Online Sentiment Monitoring Reports" that listed complaints local citizens submitted to their local government over social media."It was fascinating because it provided an inside look into how the Chinese government monitors social media and what types of things they pay attention to," said Pan about the glimpse into how a local government operated.When combing through 2,768 emails from 2012-14, Pan made a startling discovery. She found that the reports the city officials sent to central management did not include all of the public grievances she saw detailed in the department's internal communications."Not only do we know what they are monitoring but we also get a sense of how they are hiding information," said Pan about her discovery. Of the 28 percent of complaints related to government wrongdoing, only 31 percent of these were reported upward.Pan and Chen found that when city officials were accused of misconduct - such as embezzlement, graft and violence - they were less likely to report it upward than other governance issues, such as pollution or education policy.Pan and Chen explored various reasons that might explain why this information was held back. Did lower-tier officials think some complaints were unreliable? Were some complaints only hearsay? Were the complaints not deemed an important enough issue for superiors to deal with? Or were there political incentives at play?After cross-checking these different scenarios with the email archive and the public grievances posted online, Pan and Chen found that complaints implicating a city official or a person with political connections to city officials were less likely to be reported.Complaints about counties with workplace and birthplace ties to city politburo members (the most powerful group of officials in the city, controlling policy, judicial and bureaucratic functions of government) were 11 percent less likely to be reported upward. By comparison, content with the most positive sentiment was 51 percent more likely to be reported upward."In this era when machine learning and computational methods are getting better and better at mining large-scale data, there is still someone writing a report to summarize findings, and that's where there is an opportunity for bias, politics and manipulation," Pan said about the shortcomings she identified in one anti-corruption effort.In other words, at the end of the day there is still a person writing a report."Even though these complaints were submitted by the public and in plain sight, there are many ways to justify why certain complaints were not reported. There is subjectivity because someone is processing this data, that is is where manipulation comes in," Pan said about the partial concealment at play.Accountability in authoritarian regimesWhile China has built many channels to gather citizen complaints, Pan's research shows that there remain shortcomings in how an authoritarian regime gathers information from its public."What I found is contrary to an emerging view that accountability can be found in authoritarian countries," Pan said, noting that public participation is insufficient for accountability in non-democracies. Monitoring the behavior of regime agents will remain a challenge.Pan's research illuminates another concern: To what extent can citizens in an authoritarian regime hold non-elected, government officials accountable?"I think there's been optimism that even if you don't elect your officials, you can still somehow get the things that you want from the government," Pan said. "What I am showing is that there are significant limitations. We can't assume that because people are allowed to voice their grievances and report on corrupt officials to the government, that this information will make its way to the people who can sanction corrupt officials."Pan is an assistant professor in communication. Kaiping Chen, a doctoral candidate in communication, is co-author on the study.Contact: Melissa De Witte, 650/725-9281, mdewitte@stanford.eduCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6332306 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: June 15, 2018End of Document

Media Analyses: Trump's Overture To China On ZTE Is Stunning ShiftThe FrontrunnerMay 15, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 Bulletin News Network, Inc.Section: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 861 wordsBodyFollowing on his Sunday tweet about "working together" with Chinese President Xi Jinping "to give massive Chinese phone company, ZTE, a way to get back into business, fast," President Trump tweeted Monday afternoon, "ZTE, the large Chinese phone company, buys a big percentage of individual parts from US companies. This is also reflective of the larger trade deal we are negotiating with China and my personal relationship with President Xi." The AP (5/14) reports that the Commerce Department "last month blocked ZTE from importing American components for seven years" before the President's "surprising overture" this weekend. White House Deputy Press Secretary Raj Shah said that Trump has asked Commerce Secretary Ross "to look into lifting or easing sanctions" against ZTE "as part of a 'give and take' with China."The New York Times (5/14, Swanson, Landler, Bradsher, Subscription Publication, 18.33M) reports under the headline "Trump Shifts From Trade War Threats To Concessions In Rebuff To Hard-Liners" that "the shift is an abrupt reversal that reflects another twist in the pitched battle inside the White House between the economic nationalists...and more mainstream advisers." Treasury Secretary Mnuchin "has taken the lead role in trying to head off potentially harmful tariffs and investment restrictions on China and has succeeded, at least for now, in persuading Mr. Trump to adopt a more conciliatory approach." The Wall Street Journal (5/14, A1, Wei, Davis, Subscription Publication, 6.17M) reports on its front page that the President's announcement was not preceded by interagency discussions on the shift.Bret Baier reported on Fox News Special Report (5/14, 2.51M) that Trump is "raising eyebrows" with the move, while Jim Sciutto reported on CNN's Situation Room (5/14, 984K) that "every US intel agency said that ZTE phones...are at risk of surveillance, electronic backdoors, by the Chinese government." ZTE also violated US sanctions against both North Korea and Iran "and lied about" doing so. Tom Rogan of the Washington Examiner (5/14, Rogan, 355K) says ZTE is "a partial front company and cover operation for the Chinese intelligence community and a critical node by which Beijing seeks to steal American secrets." Bloomberg News (5/14, Sink, 4.02M) reports Trump's "conciliatory move to help" ZTE "stoked bipartisan condemnation in Washington Monday, as lawmakers warned the US president's concession could endanger national security." USA Today (5/14, Jackson, 9.97M) reports that "critics hit President Trump for seeking to help a Chinese phone company accused of involvement in cyber espionage against Americans."The Washington Post (5/14, Paletta, Lynch, Dawsey, 14.36M) reports that "senior Republicans said they were caught off guard." Sen. Charles Grassley said, "I'm kind of surprised, considering the decisions that were made previously on national security; it kind of surprises me, and I haven't figured it out." The Washington Post (5/14, Hawkins, 14.36M) reported earlier that Sen. Marco Rubio tweeted that the "problem with ZTE isn't jobs & trade, it's national security & espionage." Rubio said on Fox News' Ingraham Angle (5/14, 2.79M), "I don't feel bad for these companies, because frankly they have benefited greatly and continue to benefit greatly from the theft of intellectual property. ... To be selling American technology to ZTE is going to allow them to get it and then reverse-engineer it."Bloomberg News (5/14, Sink, 4.02M) reports that Senate Minority Leader Schumer was also critical, saying, "This leads to the greatest worry, which is that the President will back off on what China fears most - a crackdown on intellectual property theft - in exchange for buying some goods in the short run." Bloomberg reports Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan (D) pointed out that "Trump's tweets had highlighted layoffs in China even as autoworkers were losing their job in his home state." The Hill (5/14, Chalfant, Breland, 2.36M) headlines its report "Lawmakers Stunned By Trump Push To Help Chinese Company."Bloomberg News (5/14, Woods, Leonard, 4.02M) reports that hours before Trump's Monday tweet, Ross told reporters at the National Press Club that the US was "exploring alternatives to punish" ZTE. Ross said, "ZTE did do some inappropriate things. They've admitted to that. The question is, are there alternative remedies to the one that we had originally put forward and that's the area we will be exploring very, very promptly."In Tweet Today, Trump Says "Stay Tuned!" To Ongoing China Trade Talks.Trump tweeted this morning, "Trade negotiations are continuing with China. They have been making hundreds of billions of dollars a year from the U.S., for many years. Stay tuned!"Branstad: US, China "Still Very Far Apart" On Trade.Reuters (5/14) reports that US Ambassador to China Terry Branstad said Tuesday that the US "wants China to give a timetable on how it will open up its markets to US exports." Branstad said, "The Chinese have said, 'We want to see the specifics.' We gave them all the specifics in terms of trade issues. So they can't say they don't know what we're asking for. We're still very far apart."Load-Date: May 15, 2018End of Document

New Products Designed to Support China's Drive for Increased Construction Industry Sustainability and Efficiency, and Workplace Safety, Launched at BRE China Annual ConferenceTargeted News ServiceApril 25, 2018 Wednesday 7:00 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 423 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WATFORD, England BodyThe Building Research Establishment issued the following news release:New products designed to support China's drive for increased construction industry sustainability and efficiency, and workplace safety, have been launched at the second BRE China Annual Conference, on 18 April at the Waldorf Astoria in Shanghai.They include two digital tools, adapted for use in China with the help of Chinese software developers. The first of these - called SmartWaste - is a proven resource management tool that helps to reduce waste, and find ways of turning unavoidable waste into valuable assets.The second, called YellowJacket, focuses on enhancing workplace health and safety. "We believe that YellowJacket can help development projects to ensure the welfare of their construction operatives on sites across China," said Niall Trafford, Chief Operating Officer of the BRE Group and Chairman of BRE China, in his opening address to the Conference. "This will support the Chinese Government's drive to improve safety in workplaces, which has already seen a significant decrease in occupational accidents in 2016-17."In addition, access in China to the BREEAM sustainability assessment standard is being extended, with the introduction of BREEAM In-Use. "The great progress in building sustainability in this country has so far focussed on new housing developments," said Trafford. "But there is now a move to include the management and value of existing buildings. BREEAM In-Use has proved effective in helping building managers and owners to reduce running costs, improve environmental performance and increase the value of existing buildings."Also announced at the conference was the extension of BRE China's training activities (provided by the BRE Academy), with the launch of Building Information Modelling - or BIM - training courses. BIM is proving to be a valuable online tool for reducing waste and costs in the design, construction and operation of buildings.Niall Trafford took the opportunity provided by the Conference, to welcome the newly appointed General Manager of BRE China, Qian Li . She has taken over leadership of the company from Jaya Skandamoorthy, who has led BRE China since its launch in Shenzen in April 2016. "Our thanks to Jaya for his tireless work in establishing BRE China and its vital relationships with our valued Chinese partners," said Trafford, "and our very best wishes to Qian Li, under whose guidance I am sure BRE China will continue to flourish."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6263287 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: April 26, 2018End of Document

Battle Between Chinese Tech Giants Could Portend Future For InternetThe FrontrunnerJune 1, 2018 FridayCopyright 2018 Bulletin News Network, Inc.Section: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 190 wordsBodyThe New York Times (5/31, Zhong, Subscription Publication, 18.33M) reports that the "most bruising battle for supremacy" in the tech world is occurring in China, where Tencent Holdings and the Alibaba Group "are ratcheting up their no-holds-barred contest to dominate the ways 770 million internet users communicate, shop, get around, entertain themselves and even invest their savings and visit the doctor." China, the Times adds, "offers a spooky potential vision of the future" of the Internet, "one in which online behemoths like Tencent and Alibaba become the gatekeepers to the entire economy, wielding immense power over traditional industries and becoming very, very rich in the process."Chinese Government Intervening To Subdue Stock Market Volatility.The Wall Street Journal (5/31, Hong, Xie, Subscription Publication, 6.17M) reports in a front page story that China's volatile stock market has been enjoying a period of calm due in part to an effort by the Chinese government. According to traders and brokers, regulators are increasingly intervening to influence trades and create the appearance that the market is less volatile.Load-Date: June 1, 2018End of Document

Analysis: Tariffs won't slow China's tech riseCNN WireMay 3, 2018 Thursday 3:09 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 971 wordsByline: By Sherisse PhamDateline: HONG KONG (CNNMoney) BodyHONG KONG (CNNMoney) --  China's aggressive efforts to become a tech superpower have long worried many American business leaders, and now are fueling trade tensions with the United States. But experts say the US government needs to come up with a smarter response.President Donald Trump is sending his top economic advisers to China this week for talks about the trade dispute in which the two countries have threatened to slap tariffs on tens of billions of dollars of each other's exports. The US government says it's taking action against China over policies that have enabled Chinese firms to unfairly get their hands on sensitive technology from American companies. At the heart of the concerns is "Made in China 2025," Beijing's plan to pump hundreds of billions of dollars into industries like robotics, electric cars and computing with the aim of becoming a global leader in those areas.The proposed US tariffs target many products linked to the 2025 plan, but analysts say they are unlikely to make a big difference.Slowing down China's tech development "is not a reasonable goal," said James Lewis, senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. Instead, the United States needs to focus on getting Beijing to play by the same rules as everyone else, he said. Getting other countries on boardAmerica and its allies still have the clout to make that happen, experts say. Chinese companies and researchers need access to Western markets and technology, especially US technology, to continue to advance."The relationship between China and the US on tech is so deep and so interwoven, it'd be hard to pull it apart," Lewis said. "But [China] is still the junior partner." To pressure China to play by international rules, experts and tech companies argue the US government should put together a united front with allies who are also alarmed by Beijing's industrial policy."Instead of tariffs, we strongly encourage the administration to build an international coalition that can challenge China at the [World Trade Organization] and beyond," Dean Garfield, president of the Information Technology Industry Council wrote in a letter last month to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, one of the US officials visiting China this week. The trade group -- which represents more than 60 big tech companies including Apple, Amazon and Facebook -- said many countries share the United States' concern about Beijing's unfair trade practices. But Trump's tough line on US trade with other economies, including threatening tariffs on US imports steel and aluminum from allies such as the European Union and Canada, has made building a united front on China a lot harder.Rethinking US investment in techAnalysts say China's tech ambitions should also make the US government take a hard look at its own domestic policies. "After decades of doubting China's innovation potential, the United States now fears the rapid pace of China's technological catchup, and sees Chinese technology as a major (perhaps even existential) threat to US economic competitiveness," Matt Sheehan, a fellow at the Paulson Institute, wrote in a blog post last month. America is home to the world's leading researchers and universities, and Silicon Valley remains the tech industry's global hub. But the country has fallen behind when it comes to federal funding for science and technology research and development, according to Lewis, the CSIS expert. "China has less money than us but they're willing to spend it," he said. "We need to find a new way to invest in science and tech in the United States."Cracking down on China's shopping spreeThe US government is also aiming to make it harder for China to get hold of key technology by buying up American companies.Like former President Barack Obama before him, Trump has blocked some Chinese takeovers because of concerns about sensitive technology. On top of that, Trump in March asked Mnuchin to "address concerns about investment in the United States directed or facilitated by China in industries or technologies deemed important to the United States." A senior Treasury official said last month the department is considering using the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act as a way to restrict Chinese investment. The Treasury department is also supporting a bill to modernize reviews carried out by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, an inter-agency government committee that evaluates sales of US businesses to foreign entities to determine the impact on national security.Beijing's responseChina is unhappy about the Trump administration's allegations about its trade practices. It has dismissed the findings of the US government's investigation into intellectual property theft as "unfounded."State media outlets are also defending the country's technological prowess. "China's astronautics and aeronautics industries have a strong independent research and development ability," the Global Times, a provocative but government-sanctioned Chinese tabloid, said in an editorial last month. "China has surpassed the US in key areas ... It's unrealistic for the US to block these developments."And US moves to stifle Chinese tech companies, such as a recent ban on selling American-made parts to smartphone maker ZTE, are only likely to confirm Beijing's view that it needs to do more to bolster its domestic industries, according to Louis Kuijs, head of Asia for research firm Oxford Economics."The current US tech-oriented actions against China will lead China to double down its efforts to become technologically independent and develop homegrown technology," he wrote in a research note last week.-- Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Rep. Smith Issues Statement at Hearing on Foreign Plots Targeting America's Research, DevelopmentTargeted News ServiceApril 11, 2018 Wednesday 8:22 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 742 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe House Science, Space and Technology subcommittee on Oversight and subcommittee on Research and Technology, issued the following statement by Full Committee Chairman Lamar Smith, R-Texas, at a hearing entitled "Scholars or Spies: Foreign Plots Targeting America's Research and Development":"Foreign countries' attempts to access and steal U.S. research and development pose an acute risk to our national and economic security. In recent months, the public has become aware that we are under attack from foreign governments that want to steal our technological secrets and scientific discoveries and use them for their own purposes."Just last month, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) showed how serious the threat is. DOJ indicted nine Iranian nationals for breaking into university computer systems and stealing information and intellectual property worth billions of dollars. This brazen theft was on behalf of the Iranian government and universities in Iran."This was a widespread and concentrated campaign. Attackers hacked nearly 4,000 accounts of professors across 144 U.S. universities. According to informed sources, the attackers specifically targeted universities engaged in science, technology and medical research."According to the Justice Department, U.S. universities spent more than $3.4 billion on creating and developing the scientific information, academic data and intellectual property that was stolen. Nearly $3.5 billion of U.S. research - some of which was funded by American taxpayers - was illegally taken and is now in the hands of a hostile foreign nation. This is just one example."Unfortunately, Iran is not the only threat. China has actively and aggressively targeted research and development (R&D) at U.S. academic institutions for years."The Chinese government has been very clear about its long range plans for achieving global domination in critical areas of science and technology. China, however, has been less forthright about its methods, which include theft of confidential information and technological secrets from U.S. companies, cyber-attacks and other forms of spying to undermine our national security and putting sleeper agents at our research universities to steal our scientific breakthroughs."Chinese efforts are concentrated in the areas that it has prioritized: artificial intelligence, medical science and national security."By understanding China's priorities and the lengths to which it is prepared to go, we can adopt an effective approach. But the first step is recognizing the risks we face."The intelligence community has warned about these threats for years, ranging from cyber-attacks to human manipulation to break-ins. We know that foreign agents routinely target American students and educators in their priority areas. Faculty and administrators must be alert and educated to spot the warning signs of foreign operations."But many in academia have been unwilling to accept reality and unwilling to take any defensive measures to protect their researchers' work, their universities' scientific assets and taxpayers' investments."The University of Texas recently rejected funding from the China-United States Exchange Foundation, a China-based and government-connected foundation. The foundation is registered as a foreign agent representing China. The idea of a university taking significant funding from an organization controlled by a foreign government would be contrary to the independence and safeguards needed in academia. This action by the University of Texas was appropriate and the type of proactive oversight that needs to occur at other colleges."The National Science Foundation's grant guidance is clear - as grant recipients, universities bear full responsibility for the management and results of federally funded projects. The recent indictments of Iranian student-spies and other incidents are clear warnings about the need for swift, strong action. This includes improved cybersecurity, educating researchers to anticipate attempts to steal their work and more careful screening of those who come to the U.S. to study."I also look forward to hearing from our experts about how we can build appropriate defenses. On the one hand, we must maintain the open and collaborative nature of academic research and development. On the other, we must protect our research and development from actors who seek to do us harm."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6241404 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: April 12, 2018End of Document

ZTE could reportedly receive reprieve in tentative U.S.-China trade dealFierceWirelessMay 22, 2018 Tuesday 11:10 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Questex Media Group LLC All Rights ReservedSection: ARTICLELength: 352 wordsByline: Mike DanoBodyThe United States and China are reportedly nearing an agreement that would reduce the threat of a trade war between the two countries, and the ban against U.S. component sales to China’s ZTE could be lifted as part of that deal.The Wall Street Journal reported this morning that the White House and the Chinese government have reached a tentative agreement to rescind the U.S. Commerce Department’s ban on sales of U.S. components to ZTE. That ban, enacted last month, reportedly shuttered ZTE’s manufacturing operations and threatened to put the company out of business. That could have had a major impact on the U.S. wireless market, considering companies like Qualcomm derive significant revenues from sales of chipsets and other components to ZTE, and carriers like AT&T sell the company’s phones in the prepaid market.According to the WSJ—and bolstered by similar reports by Reuters—the Trump administration reached a tentative agreement over the ZTE situation; the Commerce Department had enacted the ban over what the agency said was a failure of ZTE to adhere to punishments stemming from the company’s business in Iran and North Korea.As both publications noted, the ZTE agreement appears to coincide with a reduction in trade war rhetoric by both companies. For example, the deal could include China removing tariffs on imported U.S. agricultural products, as well as buying more American farm goods. And the Chinese government appears to be moving forward on an approval for Qualcomm’s proposal to purchase NXP.President Trump initially signaled a U.S. willingness to ease restrictions on ZTE earlier this month when he tweeted that “President Xi of China, and I, are working together to give massive Chinese phone company, ZTE, a way to get back into business, fast. Too many jobs in China lost. Commerce Department has been instructed to get it done!”Looming over the issue, though, is the ongoing battle between the U.S. and China over 5G deployments. Both countries are hoping to gain an edge on the deployment of the technology in order to cash in on a worldwide move to the faster wireless standard.Load-Date: June 4, 2018End of Document

CHINA'S PILOT PROGRAM TO USE AI TO DETECT CANCERStates News ServiceJune 29, 2018 FridayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 468 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: BEIJING, China BodyThe following information was released by the Chinese Academy of Sciences:In China, algorithms crunching mountains of data have already shown their ability to improve people's lives. Artificial intelligence (AI) is reporting breakthroughs in detecting cancer.In the country, more than 2.7 million people died of cancer every year. That means cancer kills more than five Chinese people every minute.Dr. Xu Guoliang, the chief for Department of Endoscopy and Laser at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Treatment Center, has been trying to detect cancer in its earliest stages, which can improve a patient's chances of survival.Xu is an endoscopy specialist working at one of the largest cancer treatment centers in southern China. He searches for tumors inside body cavities and hollow organs like the stomach. The World Health Organization (WHO) says stomach cancer is a leading cause of death in China, but there aren't enough Chinese doctors like Xu.Xu told CGTN that five years ago, there were only about 29,000 qualified endoscopy doctors in China. But according to their estimates, there are 120 million patients that need an endoscopy each year. That means China has to increase the number of doctors 50 times to meet that demand. Clearly "that's almost impossible," Xu added.So, Xu turned to AI for help. His hospital has been working with Internet giant Tencent to develop an AI clinical diagnostic system called Miying.According to Xu, each endoscopy examination will produce 48 images that'll be simultaneously sent to Tencent's database. And the AI system will give feedback in four seconds. Based on a huge pool of data, it'll suggest which position could be the cancer lesion.Xu said AI's accuracy in diagnosing some types of cancer early is as high as 90 percent, and it is still improving.Patients in China's first-tier cities may still prefer human doctors at the best hospitals, but for the one billion or so people living in less-developed areas with limited medical resources, AI promises huge benefits."AI is able to learn from 'big data.' That's what humans can't do. We hope the system can reach remote areas and grassroots hospitals in China, where patients can get a diagnosis as accurate as the ones in first-class hospitals in big cities," said Zhou Xuan, a senior product director of the Miying AI project of Tencent.The Chinese government is part of a global trend. Last November, it announced plans to build a national platform for AI diagnostic imaging a commitment to AI as a pillar in the future of Chinese medicine.The UK government says in the next 15 years, AI could prevent more than 20,000 cancer deaths a year. And, scanning cell images only, US researchers have shown AI can distinguish types of cancer, in most cases with nearly 100 percent accuracy.

(Nasdaq:            FB) is in more hot water this week after the company said on Tuesday that it has ongoing data-sharing partnerships with Chinese device makers, one of which has been described by U.S. intelligence agencies as a national security threat. Facebook stock traded lower by 1 percent on Wednesday morning, and analysts say the latest data-related headlines are only making the Facebook regulatory spotlight even brighter. Earlier this week, Facebook admitted to data-sharing partnerships with a number of device makers, including Apple ( AAPL) and Microsoft Corp. (            MSFT). However, Facebook revealed on Tuesday that it has partnerships with a handful of Chinese device makers as well, including an ongoing partnership with Huawei. [See: 9 Mature Tech Stocks to Buy for Dividends.]In February, the heads of the FBI the CIA and the NSA recommended American citizens not buy products made by Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE due to the potential for "undetected espionage." The U.S. banned Huawei from bidding on U.S. government contracts in 2014. Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton once described Huawei as "effectively an arm of the Chinese government." Facebook vice president of mobile partnerships Francisco Varela defended the partnerships in a statement. "Huawei is the third-largest mobile manufacturer globally and its devices are used by people all around the world, including in the United States," Varela said. "Facebook along with many other U.S. tech companies have worked with them and other Chinese manufacturers to integrate their services onto these phones." Facebook said it is ending many of its data-sharing partnerships and will be terminating its Huawei deal this week. Huawei said it has never collected or stored Facebook user data, and Varela said user data was always kept on smartphone devices, never on Huawei servers. GBH Insights head of technology research Daniel Ives says China-related headlines are bad news for Facebook investors. "The last thing investors wanted to see this morning is a new Chinese data content/privacy issue come to light especially in the heat of the current political climate and negotiations between the US and China," Ives says. [See: 10 Stocks to Buy for the Stay-at-Home Economy.]Ives says Facebook and CEO Mark Zuckerberg have navigated the fallout from the Cambridge Analytica data scandal well up to this point, but the jury is still out on the Chinese data partnership news. GBH Insights maintains a "highly attractive" rating and $225 price target for FB stock.Wayne Duggan is a freelance investment strategy reporter with a focus on energy and emerging market stocks.

China Papermaking Industry Research Report 2018-2022 - ResearchAndMarkets.comBusiness WireMay 10, 2018 Thursday 4:07 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Business Wire, Inc.Distribution: Business EditorsLength: 482 wordsDateline: DUBLIN BodyThe "Research Report on Papermaking Industry of China, 2018-2022" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.The report predicates that, with the development of Chinese economy and the rising living standards, the demand for household paper is growing. The development of e-commerce has promoted the increase in the express delivery, further driving the demand for packaging paper. It is expected that from 2018 to 2022, the overall demand for paper products in the Chinese market will maintain an annual growth rate of 3% or more, and the papermaking industry, to a certain degree, can bring about some investment opportunities.Currently, the export volume of paper and paperboard only accounts for less than 5% of the total output. In order to protect environment as well as satisfy domestic demands, the Chinese government does not encourage the export of paper and paperboard. Therefore, governments at all levels rarely publish supportive policies for the papermaking industry.Chinese papermaking enterprises lack their own forestry property and mainly import raw materials for papermaking. The short supply of raw materials greatly affects the development of the papermaking industry as it rapidly grows. Also, the government policies and other extrinsic factors impact the import of raw materials.Key Topics Covered:1 Analysis on Development Environment of Papermaking Industry of China, 2015-20182 Operation Status of Papermaking Industry of China, 2013-20173 Analysis on Major Paper Products in China, 2013-20174 Analysis on Import and Export of China in Paper and Paperboard, 2013-20175 Analysis on Market Competition in Papermaking Industry of China, 2013-20176 Analysis on Papermaking Enterprises in China7 Forecast on Development of Papermaking Industry of China, 2018- 2022Companies Mentioned• Shandong Chenming Paper Group Co., Ltd.• Huatai Group Co., Ltd.• Shandong Sun Holdings Group• Nine Dragons Paper Co., Ltd.• Lee & Man Paper Manufacturing Co., Ltd.• Hengan Group Co., Ltd.• Anhui Shanying Paper Industry Co., Ltd.• China Paper Corporation• Ningbo Zhonghua Paper Industry Co., Ltd.• Gold East Paper Co., Ltd.• Shandong Bohui Paper Co., Ltd.• Jiangsu Longchen Greentech Co., Ltd.• Dongguan Jianhui Paper Co., Ltd.• Zhejiang Jingxing Paper Joint Stock Co., Ltd.• Gold Hongye Paper Group• Shandong Century Sunshine Paper Group Co., Ltd.• Hainan Jinhai Pulp & Paper Co., Ltd.• Dongguan Jinzhou Paper Co., Ltd.• UPM China• Shandong Tranlin GroupFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/l962xf/china_papermaking?w=4View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180510005900/en/CONTACT: ResearchAndMarkets.comLaura Wood, Senior Managerpress@researchandmarkets.comFor E.S.T Office Hours Call 1-917-300-0470For U.S./CAN Toll Free Call 1-800-526-8630For GMT Office Hours Call +353-1-416-8900Related Topics: Pulp and Paperhttp://www.businesswire.comLoad-Date: May 11, 2018End of Document

As in Black Mirror, China implements a social classification systemCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 23, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 405 wordsBody As if it were an episode of the Black Mirror series, in China a social rating system has been implemented that assesses whether citizens are eligible to access benefits or receive sanctions by the government.  An example of this new system was revealed this week, when the Chinese government denied 11 million people taking flights and 4 million taking the train because of a low social rating. The average, calculated by the government, is measured through financial, social, legal and political qualifications of each of its citizens.  All people go on to receive scores based on their behavior to estimate their "level of confidence" in a particular situation. According to the score of each one, there are benefits or sanctions.  Currently, there are more than a dozen national lists composed of names of citizens that are based on infractions committed, such as misconduct on airplanes or trains or failure to comply with a court ruling, for example. These people go on to compose a public list built by the Chinese Higher People's Court in which their names and identification numbers are recorded on a debtors website. You can read: What does the name of 'Black Mirror' mean? The system then determines what will be the penalties for these people that appear on this list, which can range from restricting them to taking a plane or a train to reducing the speed of the internet in their homes.  But in addition to this, offenders can not stay in four- and five-star hotels, send their children to expensive schools, book cheap rental cars or shop online luxury.  The goal of China's social credit system is to take action against those who do not pay or comply with patterns of behavior. Its defenders claim that this sends a strong message to society, while its critics say that this is a form of harassment and could hide even a political persecution.  Social pressure even goes further in some regions of China. There are provinces in which photographs of debtors are placed in cinemas, buses and newspapers with the aim of punishing the offenders. In others, for example, when trying to call an offender by cell phone, a message is reproduced in which it is remembered that the person they want to contact has a pending debt, according to Business Insider reports.  Only last December, 8.8 million new debtor names were added to these blacklists. The Chinese government hopes to perfect this mechanism by the year 2020. Load-Date: May 24, 2018End of Document

I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Thursday, April 12th. Your top stories at 8:00 a.m. Eastern. Under pressure; rising tensions over a possible strike on Syria weighing on stocks yesterday. Dow, NASDAQ and S&P, all snapping a two-day winning streak after President Trump tweeted missiles were on the way. The losses accelerated later on the trading day after the Federal Reserve minutes from the last meeting showed all members think inflation could soon rise, maybe signaling even more interest rate increases expected this year. Futures is doing this right here, right now, trying to reverse that 200- plus point loss on the Dow yesterday -- a 133-point gain on the Dow Futures right now. Investors watching in wait and watching President Trump's meeting with lawmakers later today to discuss trade tensions.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LARRY KUDLOW, DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNSEL: My take is good things are out there, OK. Now, President Xi in China gave a conciliatory speech. We heard these promises from China before. Now, they are welcome now. It's a change in their whole attitude.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: The latest as China says it will fight back if the U.S. escalates that scuffle. In Europe, mixed action earlier. Now, we have gains across the board. In Asia overnight, it was red across the screen; losses in all four major Asian markets. Crude oil reacting to the global tensions over Syria. Crude yesterday topping $67.00 a barrel. The first time that's happened in three years. And back in the hot seat, Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg faced another grilling from lawmakers on Wednesday and online. The hilarious reaction from the spectacle on Capitol Hill. Burning your money, the price tag on one Silicon Valley house raises some eyebrows. The shocking amount it will cost you to call the valley, home. Plus, charging the mound, there were several big hits in Major League baseball last night, but not the kind you think. Yes, the details as two games including the Yankees and Red Sox erupt into brawls. And could we soon hear master of puppet at The Masters? How the PGA could soon give new meaning to sling music. Here to break it down with me, Fox News Correspondent, Lea Gabriel, Former Home Depot CEO, Former Chrysler CEO, Bob Nardelli, and Benchmark Managing Partner, Kevin Kelly. Hello to all.KEVIN KELLY, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: You know, we talked about Hulu and Spotify, and I think that's pretty interesting because we always bring up Apple Music, how they have 40 million subscribers. One of the things that's not really appreciated by the marketplace yet is that how Spotify actually did an equity swap with 10-Cent Music over in China and that's the next leg of growth. So, 10-Cent Music owns part of Spotify, Spotify owns part of them. 10-Cent Music is going public soon. So, it's actually pretty interesting because Spotify has their eyes on the ball in China.MCDOWELL: Well, I love how you set up what Blake Burman is going to be talking about. Because again, it is about trade, it's about a global marketplace. President Trump is set to meet with congressional leaders to discuss ways to protect American farmers. This comes as China now says it won't hesitate to fight back if President Trump escalates current tensions over trade. Blake Burman is covering that story from the White House and he has the very latest. Good morning, Blake.BLAKE BURMAN, FBN WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Hi there, Dagen. Good morning to you as well. Yes, there was a bit of a warning last night from China, a spokesperson for the commerce ministry there saying that the speech that President Xi Jinping gave on Tuesday that was widely viewed was not a concession to Washington. Rather, that spokesperson saying what President Xi was doing was simply outlining China's further strategy ahead to open up its economy and that spokesperson also said this: "I hope some people in the U.S. do not misjudge the situation if the United States takes any action to escalate the situation, China will not hesitate to fight back." Now, after that speech on Tuesday, President Trump at least publicly appeared to be pleased, writing this on Twitter saying, "Very thankful for President Xi of China's kind words on tariffs and automobile barriers, also his enlightenment on intellectual property and technology transfers. We will make great progress together." However, here at the White House, many were skeptical saying that they wanted to see concrete actions.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BURMAN: Do you feel that there will actually be at some point concrete actions or is all of this right now hope and talk and --SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Again, we certainly hope so. We think this is an encouraging step in the right direction. But at the same time, we're going to continue moving forward in the actions that the President's announced and hopeful that we see something come out of the Chinese government.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURMAN: Possible, Dagen, that the comments last night from that spokesperson will be at play here at the White House at 11:00 -- three hours from now -- as governors and congressional leaders will come here to the White House, meet with President Trump. I'm told the focus of the meeting will be on agriculture and industry that is now suddenly caught in the crosshairs here of this spat between the U.S. and China over trade. Dagen.MCDOWELL: Thank you, so much, Blake Burman. Yes, and I will add that the Trump administration is actually looking at subsidies for the farm industry which could be hurt by this kind of tit for tat, willy-nilly, ham-handed policy so far, and is even looking at a depression era program. The commodity credit corp., it was created to stabilize incomes that allows borrowing by the farm community. So, again, handouts and subsidies because you can't get your trade policies straight.Joining us now is a Member of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana. You've introduced a bill that would end -- let's talk about China -- end taxpayer subsidies of mail from China. How big of a problem is this, really?We're going to get the senator's audio straight. But I want to ask you that. I know that those are tough words from me. But again, the knee-jerk reaction by politicians always seems to be let's throw money at the problem, let's throw more spending at the problem, when the issue is having a very firm, well-telegraphed trade dialogue with China rather than this back and forth, the $50 billion in tariffs here, a $50 billion here, maybe we'll go to a hundred.NARDELLI: It's interesting, Dagen, they talk about the Ag business, but they haven't talked about the, you know, pork business, which also was one of the first volleys coming out of China that they were going to raise tariffs on pork, which is one of their primary protein foods. So, that will be interesting, and then, the soybean thing. They took the tariffs down on autos which, of course, is very favorable.MCDOWELL: They said --NARDELLI: They said that.MCDOWELL: Xi Jinping mentioned that he would reduce --NARDELLI: Which would be more equitable, given the goes in and goes out tariffs on the auto industry.MCDOWELL: But how do you say, because I don't mean to sit here and preach, but how do you see the way this administration is handling trade, against the steel and aluminum tariffs, but also trade with China because the global supply chain is exceedingly complicated.NARDELLI: Yes, well, my example on the auto industry with steel and aluminum is the kind of an inverted triangle, right. So, the end consumer may pay a little bit more based on the tariffs, 125 percent, 110 on aluminum. Chrysler or the automotive would pay a little bit more. But when you aggregate all of the steel and the biggest pain's going to come on the producer, because you put all those tonnages together, and if, in fact, they switch from China sources back to the U.S. sources, which would be good, I think that has more implication. I don't believe in subsidies, Dagen, as you do. I think, you know, once you start, where do you stop? Because there could be issues. You know, when I was running G.E. Power Systems, there was always, until the recent corporate tax issue, I was always trying to offset competing with Siemens, ABD, and Alstrom. And we never got any subsidies. So, I think you've got to be careful where you start doling that out and where you pick first among peers and favored industries, particularly based on the voting base.MCDOWELL: Talk about this, Kevin, because Bob brought it up as soon as the show started about -- a little more than two hours ago: volatility in these stock markets, what's driving? Because again, in early February it was the worry about inflation and the policy out of the federal reserve and then it shifts to the trade war, potential trade war. Then, it shifts to technology and Facebook, and Facebook's misuse and reckless disregard for people's privacy, somehow that hammers the valuation of multiple technology companies. What is it? And can we find our footing as this earnings season is under way?KELLY: Yes, we're going to hopefully find our footing. But a lot of the earnings growth has already been baked into expectations. And so, that's why every investors are going to be focused on guidance going forward from the management and they're going to be focused on operating margins. We've seen over the last three years that every company has been running at peak operating margins now, as the cost of goods go up, talking about steel tariffs, let's take a building for example. Any company doing a new building, 14 to 16 percent of that is steel, right? That could be more expensive. The cost of labor is going up.So, that's -- those are the input costs that could impact operating margins for the companies going forward. That's why you've seen the multiple compress on the market. We were trading at 20 times forward earnings multiple. We're down to 16.2 -- we hit actually down to 16.2. We haven't seen that level since the British referendum. What does that go back to? That goes back to trade, international policies, because this market is so predicated on global growth. And we're starting to see, actually, global growth numbers come down a little bit, especially in the Eurozone. And so, that has been because of what's coming out of Washington our of China -- the two largest trading partners.MCDOWELL: We started the year with The Wall Street Journal talking about three worries for the market: central bank policies, the federal reserve overdoing it, a trade war ignited by policy out of Washington and the White House and geopolitical concerns, and we also have that. Let's talk about Syria. President Trump huddling with his national security team yesterday about how to respond to a reported chemical attack in Syria last weekend. This comes after the U.S. and Russia traded threats over the prospect of missile strikes. The President clarifying in a tweet this morning, writing this: "Never said when an attack on Syria would take place. Could be very soon or not so soon at all. In any event, the United States under my administration has done a great job of ridding the region of ISIS. Where is our thank you, America?" Oil prices were surging to a three year high yesterday after President Trump tweeted yesterday morning that missiles will be coming to Syria. Lea, your take, because you have an understanding of the Russian missile defenses, what the technology missiles that we would possibly use.GABRIELLE: Yes. Well, you know, we've really gotten ourselves in a pickle over the past few years. And during the Obama administration there was this desire to start pulling back from some of these conflicts. What we saw when we pulled out of Iraq is you can't tiptoe out of a conflict. And now, with Syria, you know, the issue is the potential for a power vacuum if Assad isn't there. Just the power vacuums, you know, as this conflict continues and what we're seeing with the brutality of the Assad regime. But the problem we have is, we stood by and watched while Russia moved into Syria. I mean, Russia is expanding its influence.When you hear the secretary of defense talking about what he's most concerned about, he's talking about great power competition. He's talking about Russia. He's talking about China. Russia, China, Iran, they're all pairing up. They're building up. And Russia is trying to look like the good guy in the world right now. So, Vladimir Putin has moved his forces in, and he's continued to build forces that can counter our forces. So, are we still the strongest military in the world? Yes, we are. But now, what we're facing is potentially a direct conflict with Russia and Syria. And it's not going to get any easier as time goes by. It's time to show Russia that we're serious.MCDOWELL: And to all the President's critics who called Putin's puppet and said he's been weak on Russia. Well now, what do they say? They're going to find fault with this. Again, we have sanctioned the oligarchs. The Treasury Department sanctions on the assets of oligarch, Putin's cronies, his very rich cronies, step by step, even in word and deed, the U.S. is getting tough with Russia. Bob, you want to ask Lea?BOB NARDELLI, FORMER CEO, CHRYSLER: Yes, I just want to -- as a Navy fighter pilot, explain to us what's happening with the Russia movement and the ships. I mean, is this a concern of a Pearl Harbor situation where if we did go in, we would take those ships out? Or is that why he's getting them out of the ports?GABRIELLE: I don't think that's really why he's getting them out of the ports. I think what he's really doing is signaling his capabilities. And right now, Russia's conducting naval exercises in that region and I think he's basically saying we're here, I have this base and you can't do anything about it. And I think it's time the U.S. is really going to have to show Putin that we're serious.NARDELLI: Yes.LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Naval power is power, is military power. And right now, our naval power is diminished. I can't remember a time when we didn't have an aircraft carrier in the gulf region and the med.MCDOWELL: Coming up, the Internet getting riled up about Mark Zuckerberg's second day of testimony. The reaction on social media.MCDOWELL: The Parkland School shooter wants to donate his inheritance to his victims. Adam Shapiro has the details on that story. Adam?ADAM SHAPIRO, FBN REPORTER: Dagen, Nikolas Cruz stands to inherit more than $800,000 from his mother's estate when he turns 22. Now his defense attorney said in court that he wants all that money that he's supposed to receive to go to a charity chosen by his victims' families that they think will help with the community's healing. The 19-year-old Cruz opened fire at Stoneman Douglas High School on Valentine's Day, killing 17 students and faculty. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.If you think you've got a big tax bill coming your way this tax season, listen to this. Hedge fund manager, John Paulson reportedly owes more than $1 billion to the IRS. Paulson's big bet against subprime mortgages ahead of the financial crisis earned him about $4 billion with a little help from Goldman Sachs, the Abacus deal, remember that? Now the IRS has told him it wants its cut. After some monster hurricanes last year, the World Meteorological Organization's hurricane committee now retiring four big names, they are Harvey, Irma, Maria, And Nate. Hurricane Harvey killed more than 80 people last year and Hurricane Maria killed more than 60. Atlantic hurricane and tropical storm names repeat every 10 six years unless one is so destructive that the committee votes to retire that name.And then there's this, those familiar words in real estate, location, location, location, they take on a new meaning when it comes to a new listing in Silicon Valley, a home in San Jose destroyed by fire and the surrounding 5800 square foot lot, it can be yours for a mere $800,000. That property is close to the proposed Google village and the realtor who is handling the sale reportedly expects it to trigger a bidding war. Can you say bubble?MCDOWELL: Bubble in tech and a bubble in real estate.KELLY: I wonder if Jing Ying set fire (INAUDIBLE) house. This sounds like -- that's not at Silicon Valley and HBO but we've seen actually -- yes. I should probably --MCDOWELL: Created by Mike Judd.KELLY: Yes. One of the -- on of the smartest funniest shows on T.V. but - - on HBO. So, we've seen actually Silicon Valley that a real estate is up year over year, like 10 percent in certain areas. I mean, it's really unaffordable. And they're having a hard time trying to figure out housing. And she's saying there's going to be a bidding war.SHAPIRO: But at what point does Google and the other tech companies say look, I can get for $800,000 in Cleveland, Ohio, you could get a mansion on, you know, Carnegie Boulevard. When did they start moving back to areas of the country that are affordable?KELLY: They're actually starting to build campuses and housing for their employees. So they actually don't even leave the campus. So, the tech giants are starting to look at that which is actually pretty interesting because you would never leave the campus, which is kind of scary at the same time.SHAPIRO: Hard to get -- hard to get U-hauls in California because they're all leaving the state.NARDELLI: I can believe it.(CROSSTALK)NARDELLI: Yes. Exactly.MCDOWELL: Because of gross overregulation.NARDELLI: Well, the middle class is getting squeezed. How does anyone raise a family, you know, $800,000 for a fixer-upper that burned down.GABRIELLE: Yes.MCDOWELL: I lived in San Francisco right as the first technology bubble was blowing up. And I lived in like it was a cracker box, a horrible apartment because I couldn't afford to live -- it was bad 18 years ago and now --NARDELLI: Yes. My family had recent experience in L.A. and not only is the property but even with the cap on -- but anytime you trade, that's your new tax basis even though they have a cap of one to two percent. It's still an unbelievable cost of living area.SHAPIRO: I love Cleveland. It's looking good.MCDOWELL: I love Cleveland too.SHAPIRO: And by the way, you could get that house so I said 800,000, you could get a house in Cleveland, four bedroom, four bath, unlike in your 400K, right there on the east side. I was an eastsider. So, the west siders, forgive me.MCDOWELL: And I love the people of Cleveland too.THIEL: Thank you. It's a great city. Five years I was there. It's great. Yes. Because the climate is (INAUDIBLE)MCDOWELL: The love for Cleveland. Amazon maybe that's where they go.SHAPIRO: Not a bad choice.MCDOWELL: Ed, thank you.SHAPIRO: Yes.MCDOWELL: Coming up. Twitter replacing a pistol emoji with a water gun. The backlash on social media, ahead.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: I think that it is inevitable that there will need to be some regulation. So my position is not that there should be no regulation but I also think that you have to be careful about what regulation you put in place.REP. ANNA ESHOO (D), CALIFORNIA: Was your data included in the data sold to the malicious third parties? Your personal data.ZUCKERBERG: Yes.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: That was Mark Zuckerberg spending his second day on the hot seat, answering questions about regulation, privacy, the reckless management of your most personal information. The Facebook CEO also got some interesting reactions on social media. Lauren Simonetti has everything.LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN REPORTER: Yes. First, let's sum up what happened. How do we think he did by the way overall? Give him an A, a B, a C, oh, thumbs down. All right.MCDOWELL: he got an A.GABRIELLE: I think it depends on how you quantify it though, right?NARDELLI: Yes. I think the media, you know, obviously is going to support him because it's consistent with what it is they do. But if, you know, if you really analyze his performance, he always went to home base.SIMONETTI: Uh-hmm. Yes.NARDELLI: You know, we need regulation, but we've got to be careful of regulation. So it's always a yin and a yang. I don't -- I don't think he did very well at all.SIMONETTI: Investors gave him a thumbs up for sure because we're going to take a look at the two days on Capitol Hill how the stock did, well it's up 5-1/2 percent.NARDELLI: Sure.SIMONETTI: Lawmakers might have been unsatisfied however. They asked a few questions. First off, you know, how did Facebook let this Cambridge Analytica scandal happen, harvest the data on 87 million of us and what they learned was that oh, yes, Zuckerberg's own information was sold too then they asked -- they asked him, should we regulate you in Silicon Valley? And he said, well, that's inevitable just don't go too far. And then finally, is Facebook willing to change its business model to protect you and he promised to follow up in writing. OK. So you might enjoy this. This is how the internet pokes fun at that. Are you human, Mr. Zuckerberg? Well, this is an important question, my team will get back to you on that. And he takes a sip, I think that's water, he switched to orange juice yesterday.As for actually working to protect user privacy. Well, it's basically our job as the user. So Mr. Zuckerberg, are you going to untag yourself from all of those photos? Say cheese. That's the mess we deal with, as users of the site. And what about this one when one senator asked, this was on Tuesday, is Facebook a monopoly? No, said Mr. Zuckerberg. But there he is, rich uncle penny bags. His worth by the way $66-1/2 billion according to Forbes. That makes him the seventh richest person in the world. And today he might be feeling like this. Myspace Tom. I had to look this up. The caption is TFW, that feeling when, did you guys know that?KELLY: Yes. I knew that.SIMONETTI: OK. Well, I have to Google that. That feeling when you aren't being grilled by the Senate Judiciary Committee. So he's done for now.NARDELLI: Hey, Lauren --MCDOWELL: The reason that he gets an A+ even for me and I have hammered them four years about their reckless disregard for people's personal information not being forthcoming, basically just being sleazy with their own users. But again, he didn't sweat, he made eye contact, he didn't say too much. He was so well-prepared by his legal team.SIMONETTI: He was polite. He addressed them as Senator.(CROSSTALK)GABRIELLE: He got away without answering a lot of the harder questions, like, you know, are you going to change your business model? Are you going to change the way you do business? You know, telecommunications company or publisher, which would open the door to FTC regulations, you know, he -- but he said he defines Facebook as a tech company of engineers that build code for other people. And they all just kind of go --(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: But he had a command of his business, he did. Again, don't say too much. You're under oath. Don't say too much. Don't offer what -- things that are not asked of you. Again, it was the question who asked him, Orrin Hatch, how do you sustain a business model? You run ads.(CROSSTALK)NARDELLI: Dagen, let's be fair.MCDOWELL: Yes.NARDELLI: Let's look at what happened to the CEO of Equifax, what happened to the CEO of Target, some of these others that had a breach, right? They're just not equitable treatment here.GABRIELLE: Yes.MCDOWELL: Well, Target is still in business.NARDELLI: No, no. But I'm talking about the leadership of those companies.GABRIELLE: You mean how hard lawmakers were.MCDOWELL: You can't fire him though. You can't fire him based on the share structure. That's the issue. He's running the company forever.KELLY: Well, he tried to revamping share structure too, and the three shared classes, should he ever get rid of shares. He's still in control and actually shareholders voted him down on that because they thought it was going too far.NARDELLI: Yes.MCDOWELL: Zuck isn't r going anywhere.SIMONETTI: Yes. And he proved he shouldn't go anywhere.MCDOWELL: Right. Thank you so much. He stood up for the shareholders of Facebook and the employees, that's for sure. Tesla's next target, the automaker's push to reportedly produce a sport utility vehicle amid rollouts struggles with the Model 3. And underfunded pensions that's costing some firefighters their jobs. The outcry after a union says it's forced to lay off half of its department, next.MCDOWELL: Welcome back. I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Thursday, April 12th. Your top stories at 8:30 a.m. Eastern. Relief rally on Wall Street, Futures are showing gains across the board, 142-point gain on the Dow Futures. This really the -- this buying really picked up steam, started accelerating after President Trump's tweet earlier this morning. Right about the time we went on the air. Mr. Trump said a missile attack on Syria may or may not happen. Checking the global market action in Europe, markets are edging higher as well, gains across the board. But in Asia overnight, it was red across the board.Delta one stock to watch that was flagged at the top of the 7:00 by Kevin Kelly. First-quarter revenue flying high, results beating estimates. Pension problem, some firefighters are losing their jobs in one Illinois town because of pension payments. The outrage ahead. Tesla fighting back, the automaker defending its auto pilot program, blaming the driver in last month's fatal car crash in California. This comes as the company launches new goals for production of its Model Y, despite massive delays on deliveries of its Model 3 vehicle.And charging the mound, there were several big hits in Major League Baseball last night but not the kind that you think about. The details as two games including the Yankees versus the Red Sox erupted into brawls. And PGA pump-up, how golf could soon give new meaning to swing music. And I also want to correct something, Mark Zuckerberg was not under oath but it's still a crime to lie to Congress even if you're not under oath. So, thanks to our viewers for pinpointing that. I stand corrected.And our top story this half hour, tensions over tariffs, China's commerce ministry said overnight that if the U.S. is not sincere in its attempts at dialogue, trade negotiations would be impossible. Joining us now is a member of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana. Senator, you introduced a bill that would end taxpayer subsidies of mail from China. How big of a problem is this?SEN. BILL CASSIDY (R-LA), SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE MEMBER: a big problem. And it's not related to tariffs. It's actually a U.N. treaty that says that the American taxpayer subsidizes postal rates for Chinese businesses to send goods to the United States at a lower cost of delivery than a U.S. company. So again, taxpayer dollars here subsidizing Chinese businesses to put our businesses out of business. We should do something different.MCDOWELL: Senator, Bob Nardelli has a question.NARDELLI: So, Senator, does that cover all goods coming in from China or is there any exemptions on that as you're outlining your proposal?CASSIDY: It's the goods that relate to the U.S. Postal Service. And again, all we -- I just don't want subsidies. I don't want the U.S. taxpayer subsidizing the delivery of mail from merchants in China. So, it is a reverse tariff, if you will, currently where we are putting a burden upon ourselves in order to help the Chinese. Let's just make it a level playing field.MCDOWELL: How much money are we talking about, though, Senator?CASSIDY: Tremendous. My daughter bought a Lego set for her -- for my grandson and it came three weeks later from China. Because again, it was cheaper to mail from China. So, if you look at everything you're buying online, good chance that it's being sent from China because it's cheaper. It's just remarkable. We got to -- by the way, we also heard from, I think, the National Association of Manufacturers that most of the counterfeit items that are coming in are coming in from China on subsidized -- U.S. subsidized mail.MCDOWELL: But again, I think that sometimes lawmakers can't see the forest for the trees in terms of the spending that's going on down there. If you look at that omnibus spending bill that was passed and signed by President Trump, that omnibus bill had almost $14 billion more for just transportation and housing in 2018 that the House passed in its appropriations. Again, in terms of the potential rescissions and the reckless spending by lawmakers, right and left, what are you doing about that?CASSIDY: Well, first, I voted against that omnibus bill until --MCDOWELL: I'm trying to get your ire up. That's why I asked you that.(LAUGHTER)CASSIDY: I'll be like Yosemite Sam with smoke blowing out my ears. No, absolutely, we've got to do something about that. And of course, discretionary spending is only a small part of what we need to do. Right now, the Medicare and Social Security trust funds are going bankrupt. And none of the tax cuts that we did affected that revenue stream. It is just a 10,000 baby boomers a day become eligible for those benefits. So, Congress has to address both. And I'm personally very invested in investing both. One way to help, though, is by increased economic growth. And increased economic growth also relates to not subsidizing Chinese businesses so that they can better compete against our businesses.MCDOWELL: There's a bipartisan bill aimed -- this is switching gears a bit -- aimed at protecting special counsel Robert Mueller's job. It's on track for a vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee. This comes as lawmakers on both sides of the aisle warned President Trump not to fire Robert Mueller. And here's what Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley told me earlier this week, just listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. CHUCK GRASSLEY (R-IA), SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: I have confidence in Mueller. The President ought to have confidence in Mueller. And I think to answer your question, it would be suicide for the President to want to talk about firing Mueller.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: Senator, President Trump tweeted this morning if I wanted to fire Robert Mueller in December as reported, I would have fired him. What do you say to what's happening with the special counsel?CASSIDY: I agree, it would be political suicide for the President to fire Mueller. I will also say I'm not sure that Congress has the constitutional right to keep the President from firing people. I think Congress lost that argument when Andrew Johnson tried to fire Lincoln's appointees. And lastly, I'm not sure it matters. Because we know from experience that if a chief investigator is fired, the investigation continues. And so, on the whole, I think the President should keep Mueller. If not, I'm sure the things we're discussing would even matter.MCDOWELL: Yes, Judge Andrew Napolitano points out over and over that be careful what you do and wish for because the replacement for Archibald Cox during the Watergate investigation was tougher with Leon Jaworski. I want to get your take on Paul Ryan, less than three years into his tenure as House Speaker. He is leaving Congress in January, not going to run for re- election. The announcement a surprise to some, whereas the -- some in the GOP to expect to face an increasingly challenging election in November. Your reaction to Paul Ryan leaving and do your maybe attention and money now turn to the Senate and those Republican candidates there?CASSIDY: I read the statement, I totally agree with it. When I was elected to Congress, my children were preteens, now my son is about to enter graduate school in Chicago. And so, I missed those years being at home. When he speaks of missing his teenage children's years, I totally relate to that. It may make it tougher. Of course, I'm for Scalise to take his place. He's a -- he's a homey for me. And -- but I think the Republicans will be able to pick up the pieces.MCDOWELL: Senator Bill Cassidy, thank you so much for being here. Apologies for the technical problems earlier. You stuck around for us and we greatly appreciate it. Thank you so much, Sir.CASSIDY: Thank you.MCDOWELL: Turning to a pension crisis. In a drastic response to a lack of pension funding, Harvey, Illinois has laid off half of its firefighters. Jeff Flock is in Harvey this morning with more. Good morning, Jeff.JEFF FLOCK, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Half the police as well, Dagen. This is what happened when push comes to shove, not meeting your pension fund funding obligations. I'm at the fire station here, as we said, this is a town that for the last 10 years has not funded the pension funds for the fire and the police. I've got the alderman of this town, or one of them, at least, Alderman Clark. What happened here?CHRISTOPHER CLARK, ALDERMAN, HARVEY, ILLINOIS: Well, we're in a situation where basically moneys were taxed, they were collected, and the police pension and the fire pension weren't paid. As a result, now, the comptroller has held that money from -- the state comptroller has held that money from the City of Harvey, Illinois and we don't know how we're going to make payroll and other essential services.FLOCK: There is now a state law here. You know, you wonder what happens when you don't fund these pensions. There's now a state law that says the state can withhold tax money from the town and that's what's happening by law and so you've got no other choice but to -- and I want to put a quote up from the police and firefighter's union and I ask you to react to it. They say, "This is not a pension crisis. Blaming the pension fund for the city's absolute refusal to properly fund it is pathetic and laughable. This is a management crisis." People would argue there is widespread corruption in your town, is that true?CLARK: I would agree with that. First of all, it's not a pension crisis, it is a management crisis. They -- we called, they came, they served, we owe that to them and the pension fund should always be paid, in my opinion. As far as the management is concerned, it's been financial mismanagement that has been documented year after year about this city and this administration.FLOCK: I just want to leave you, Dagen, with one example of that. This is a check that we've obtained. This is where -- so, you say where did that money go? Obviously, you've got tax money. Where did it go? Here's just one example that we've obtained. This is a check from the city for $12,000 worth of hair and makeup for a town that is poor. What could that have been spent on, Alderman?CLARK: Well, obviously, hair, makeup, and spa services. The biggest question is how was it signed off on. Our council is supposed to approve the payment of all bills. However, this check was written and submitted to that particular beauty salon. We don't know how it happened but we know it's signed off by the mayor and the city clerk.FLOCK: And Dagen, that's just one example that folks would cite as widespread corruption in a town that has now resulted this is push coming to shove, this is what happens when you don't fund your pensions. We'll be here all day in the town of Harvey, Illinois, shining some light. You said sunshine is what?CLARK: Sunlight is the best disinfectant.FLOCK: Sunlight today on the Fox Business Network in the town of Harvey, Illinois, south of Chicago. It's sunny today, Dagen, but there is a huge cloud over this town.MCDOWELL: Jeff, thank you for that reporting, as always. Terrific work, Jeff Flock. Coming up, Twitter gets political. The backlash after the social media company switches its pistol emoji for a water gun, really following in the footsteps of Apple. Plus, a new twist to the PGA Tour. Why golfers will get to use walk-on music for the very first time. I can't wait for that, straight ahead.MCDOWELL: Tesla reportedly has a target date to start production of its Model Y SUV even though it's struggling to get Model 3s off the line. Nicole Petallides at the New York Stock Exchange with more. Nicole?NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN ANCHOR: Yes, I remember the phrase, right, production hell and they just still haven't gotten up to capacity to get those out. In the meantime -- but they say they will. And Tesla right now is looking up about one percent for the year. Year-to-date is a lagger, three percent. But now, it's all about the Model Ys, you know, the sporty compact crossover. It's a companion to the Model 3. And so, now, they're targeting November of 2019 for production start and working with different suppliers to figure this one out. In the meantime, they are blaming the driver of that fatal crash, Walter Huang, in California, saying that he had it on the automatic pilot but knew there were issues and it was a perfectly clear day, several hundred feet of visibility.Moving onto Twitter. Twitter is replacing its gun emoji with a water gun. This is to -- they say to get rid of abuse, hate speech and harassment that takes place using this emoji. Twitter following -- you can see the before and after there -- following Apple's lead in this particular emoji change. Back to you.MCDOWELL: Thank you, Nicole. Despite tensions over Syria, trade wars, worries with China, the market seems to be brushing it off. Joining me now is the host of "VARNEY & COMPANY" Stuart Varney. Stuart, your thoughts.STUART VARNEY, FBN HOST: You know, you could really say crisis, crisis, everywhere and yet the market goes higher. You do have something of a crisis in the Mideast with the Syria situation, you do have something of a leadership crisis within the GOP after the retirement of Paul Ryan and we do have the Mueller probe now being extended to events way before the Presidential election and way before President Trump became a politician. So, you've got all these crises and yet Dow Futures set to open about 150 points higher. I think this is all about profits. We're going to start getting these profit reports tomorrow, early tomorrow morning. Whether they're good or not, I don't know. But they're supposed to be excellent. And I think that's why the market is rallying. And I also notice that Larry Kudlow was saying just the other day that we're going to get three, maybe four percent growth by the end of this year. That's another plus for stocks.So I think the market's ignoring politics, ignoring crises, and going straight to the heart of what motivates the market and that is profits and a growing economy. I think that's where we are this Thursday morning.MCDOWELL: We've got that CBO report earlier in the week, Stuart. Everybody focused on the debt -- on the debt and deficits, but it said that the tax cut is going to help the economy grow at 3.3 percent this year, 2.4 percent in 2019. We haven't grown that fast since 2005.VARNEY: And since when has the CBO been right about the future direction of the economy 16 months down the road?NARDELLI: But you know, Stuart, your point is today's up, don't cover yesterday's downs. And if you look at where we are year-to-date, we're negative. So, I agree with you, I mean, the economy is as strong as it's ever been, yet the market is not responding commensurate with that performance.VARNEY: On a daily basis that's true. But we're in a range, aren't we? We haven't sunk below, what is it, 23.6 or something and the high is 26.5 - - whatever.NARDELLI: 26.5.VARNEY: That's a range, a fairly wide range. But it's nothing like the sharp-edged declines that we might have expected if all these crises that had a real effect on the market. That's my point.NARDELLI: Yes.MCDOWELL: And we will get all of your points. We got three hours of you every day, Monday through Friday.VARNEY: Lucky you.MCDOWELL: That's right. 10 minutes from now exactly, 9:00 a.m. to noon, "VARNEY & COMPANY," Mr. Stuart Varney, always a pressure. Coming up, a remix for the PGA Tour. Why golfers will get to use walk-on music for the first time. Snd a bench-clearing brawl, the rivalry between the Yankees and Red Sox reaches a fever pitch.MCDOWELL: It was a winner-take-all NBA game to get into the playoffs. Jared Max has all the details and some awesome sports stories too.JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTSCASTER: Good morning, Dagen. 80-second final game of the regular season. Minnesota Timberwolves and Denver Nuggets went into overtime. The winner to claim the final spot in the Western Conference. Now, the T wolves have given away an eight-point lead to the final five minutes, but in O.T. they scored nine of the last 11 points. Minnesota ends a 13-year playoff drought. The T Wolves will face the Rockets in the first round. While the New York Knicks ended their season with a win over the Cavaliers. The Knicks reportedly fired head coach Jeff Hornacek.But the big story at Madison Square Garden last night was the Cavaliers' Tristan Thompson who was booed every time his face was shown on the Madison Square Garden jumbotron. Why? Because Thompson, who's the father of Khloe Kardashian's unborn baby, allegedly cheated on her with multiple women. Fans of the game showed their support for Khloe Kardashian. We 'heart' Khloe sign. Incidentally, the Cavs will play the Pacers in the first round.Mr. Triple Double did it again. One season after Russell Westbrook joined Oscar Robertson as the only player to average a triple double every game of the season. Westbrook became the first to do it twice. He made 34 rebounds the last two games, got it and more. Thunder against the Jazz in the first round.All right. MLB meets UFC, it was a double feature fight night on the Baseball Diamonds. No rivalry in baseball as heated as the Yankees and the Red Sox. And boy, here they go, last night at Fenway. Teams' benches -- the benches empty twice. First, no punches, but the second time, yes. A different story, the Yank's Tyler Austin was hit in the back with a 98- mile-an-hour fastball from Boston's Joe Kelly. All in all, four players ejected. Yankees win 10-7. From one Rocky movie to Rocky 2 or Rockies 2, as in the Colorado Rockies. Nolan Arenado charged the mound after the Padres' Luis Perdomo almost hit him with a pitch. Hockey fight broke out. Five players ejected, Rockies win 6-4. So, baseball takes a page from hockey or MMA, and golf is borrowing from baseball. Yes, check this out at the Zurich Classic in New Orleans later this month, two-men golf teams will walk to the first tee with their own theme music. Perhaps Dustin Johnson's team will pick a Miley Cyrus song.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(END VIDEO CLIP)MAX: Dustin Johnson and fiance Paulina Gretzky making that video.

AMID U.S.-CHINA TRADE IMBALANCES, COMPROMISES SEEM LIKELYStates News ServiceApril 23, 2018 MondayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 446 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: LOS ANGELES BodyThe following information was released by UCLA's Anderson School of Management:By Paul FeinbergWith daily headlines regarding U.S.-Sino trade relations as a backdrop, UCLA Anderson Forecast economist William Yu remains skeptical that the two nations will engage in a full-blown trade war, despite the public posturing of U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping."Global trade imbalances cause trade tensions," Yu said. "President Trump has been complaining about trade deficits for decades. President Xi has talked about China's willingness to deal and that's very good news." His remarks kicked off the day's first panel at Anderson's 2018 Wilbur K. Woo Greater China Business Conference. Yu's panel included moderator Seamus Jiang, managing director and co-leader for China-U.S. cross-border deals at PwC, and Feng An, founder and executive director of the Innovation Center for Energy and Transportation at U.S.-China Cleantech Center.The panelists indicated that trade agreements between the two countries will not come easily. The $375 billion U.S. trade deficit with China represents fully half of the U.S.' overall deficit, as the United States imports everything from high-tech cell phones, computers and telecommunications equipment to apparel, cookware and other household goods, while the country exports goods ranging from civilian aircraft to medical equipment to cars and car parts. "The impact of a trade war doesn't affect every sector equally," An said. "It's not just about high tech. The impact will be mixed."Yu noted that Chinese investments in the U.S. have decreased from $45 billion in 2016 to just $29 billion in 2017. In addition, he said, Chinese acquisitions of U.S. companies with cyber and national security considerations are difficult while Chinese debt-based foreign domestic investment is discouraged by the Chinese government, though long-term green field investment the type of foreign direct investment in which a parent company builds its operations from the ground up would be welcomed by the Americans.Despite the complexity and tensions, Yu remains sanguine. "President Xi and President Trump will decide if there will be a trade war or not. Trade compromises seem likely."Organized by the Center for Global Management with Anderson's Greater China Business Association and UCLA Chinese Student and Scholar Association, the annual Wilbur K. Woo Greater China Business Conference brings together successful U.S. and Chinese leaders, investors and influencers from a variety of industries and sectors to discuss the importance of innovation, collaboration and new technology, as well as diversification and localization.Load-Date: April 23, 2018End of Document

China, to the conquest of the West with its television programsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishApril 15, 2018 SundayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 601 wordsBody There have never been so many positions of Chinese chains and producers in the MipTV, the great world market of television, whose edition 2018 ended on Thursday in Cannes, in the south of France.  There, the second world economic power presented with great fanfare a selection of broadcasts, such as talent shows or kung-fu competitions for children, always with the national culture as a backdrop.  For example, in the "Readers" broadcast, stars like Jackie Chan and anonymous individuals read classics of literature in a grandiose setting.  "Until now, the Chinese bought many broadcasts abroad, all the programs that worked in the world have their Chinese version," explains Bo Zhang, representative in Asia of the French institute Eurodata.  With audiences of more than 100 million viewers and omnipresent advertising, these emissions are profitable locally. "We are prepared" But the trend changed in 2017. According to several observers, the Chinese government gave a new directive to the chains and producers of the country: they have to develop their own programs and export them very far, beyond Southeast Asia and Africa, where they are already present .  As Japanese and Korean producers did a few years ago, the Chinese "now want us to listen to them, they want to make themselves known", underlines Bo Zhang.  Production companies have multiplied in recent years and now there are some 1,500, some of which are close to international standards. "They professionalized very quickly, they learned to be creative," says a producer from the Dutch company Talpa.  "We are ready, and you are?" Yang Zheng, a vice president of the Chinese audiovisual sector, told mandarins in MipTV.  The US Netflix platform has already responded affirmatively, buying a Chinese series, the dark police serial "Day and Night". Like Google and Facebook, Netflix is ??banned in China.  The country will also bet more and more on its creativity online. "579 million Chinese people watch videos online," says Yang Weidong, president of the Youku platform, owned by online trade giant Alibaba.  "It's a fantastic opportunity, especially because viewers are willing to pay for quality content," he says. Its competitor Tencen (which has 100 million users, 43 of them paying subscribers) launched several fictions and a huge singing contest, which is only broadcast online and is sponsored by a beer brand. An almost perfect copy "It is an unprecedented effort, but it will take time," says Ted Baracos, director of the new Mip Hangzhou room, the Chinese little brother of MipTV.  Several interviewed professionals also believe that although the associations with local producers are multiplying, it will still be 10 to 20 years to see Chinese content on the main Western television networks.  "They have the means to produce large emissions, but they still do not have the know-how," says Ted Baracos. "Their productions are still very far culturally, thought of entry to their own market." With the effort launched last year, "especially seek to ensure the influence of their culture."  Another problem is counterfeiting. The Korean producer Jin Woo Hwang showed on MipTV how the Chinese platform iQiyi had "88%" copied the music contest that his company had developed with a high cost, "Produce 101", although the emission rights had been bought by his Tencent competitor.  For the Danish Jan Sailing, specialist in intellectual property, it is almost impossible to prevent these Chinese copies by legal means. However, he points out that, if they want to export,Chinese producers will learn to practice "mutual respect". Load-Date: April 16, 2018End of Document

REPORT EVALUATES CHINA'S NATIONAL CARBON MARKETStates News ServiceMay 23, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 945 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF):EDF and Energy Research Institute create framework for gauging performance of China's emissions trading systemA report evaluating the performance of China's national carbon market was released today by Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) and the Energy Research Institute (ERI) of China's National Development and Reform Commission. "The Progress of China's Carbon Market 2017" (English version, Chinese version) establishes a baseline for monitoring year-over-year progress on the legal, policy and accountability mechanisms of the market, which was launched in December and will become the world's largest emissions trading system. The report, released after the conclusion of the program's top-level design phase, also offers recommendations for Chinese authorities to address operational, structural and regulatory issues.Unveiled at the Innovate4Climate conference co-hosted by the World Bank Group and the governments of Spain and Germany, the report is a unique collaboration between ERI, a prominent think tank in the field of energy related policy research in China, and EDF, the first registered international non-governmental organization under China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment. The report is the first in a series to be released on an annual basis."This report provides a valuable step toward ensuring a proper annual evaluation of China's national carbon market that will allow us to watch the market closely, measure progress, and make recommendations to ensure its smooth operation into the future," Xiaolu Zhao, Climate Change and Carbon Market Project Manager for EDF and one of the report's authors, said.The report details the first-ever timeline of the carbon market's development, including an overview of the seven pilot markets that preceded the national rollout. These pilots covered almost 3,000 entities from more than 20 industry sectors by the end of 2017. The total trading volume reached 200 million tCO2e, and total trading value was about 45.1 billion yuan with a price range between 1-123 yuan/tCO2e. China Certified Emission Reduction (CCER) credits that are allowed to be used for compliance had a total traded volume of 130 million tCO2e with a total value of 920 million yuan. The pilots helped the Chinese government and industry gain experience for the wider, more complicated national carbon market rollout.The report also provides recommendations on issuing detailed and operable market rules, and establishing a corresponding support and management system, all of which will help ensure market-wide accountability, investments in clean technology, and emissions reductions."The development of China's carbon market has global significance. This report systematically reviews the progress of China's carbon market from the pilot to the country under the background of global carbon market development, and focuses on the latest development of the national carbon market system design. The report opens a window for all domestic and international parties who may be concerned about the establishment of China's carbon market. It also provides recommendations for the next step to improve the national carbon market system design and promote the implementation of the national carbon market," said Yanbing Kang, Director of Energy Sustainability Center for ERI one of the report's authors.The report explains the ideology behind the market's design and operation processes, such as the "1+3+4" basic framework. The "1" refers to the management decree that serves as the legal basis for the market. The "3" are the three core management measures: Carbon Emission MRV Measures ensures reliable and accurate emission data; Carbon Allowance Management Measures regulates allowance allocation, surrender and compliance; Market Transaction Measures guarantees smooth and efficient market operation, as well as fairness and openness of market transactions. The"4" refers to four supporting infrastructure systems: Carbon Emission Data Reporting System supports emissions reporting from key enterprises; Carbon Registry tracks and keeps records of carbon allowances; Carbon trading system supports the operation of the market transactions; Carbon emissions transaction clearing system supports the clearing of allowance transactions."This report provides a comprehensive overview of the development of the global carbon market and the progress of the China's carbon market. It reviews the purpose, significance, basic principles, framework, and steps for the establishment of China's carbon market. China's national carbon market, which will cover the power generation sector in the first phase, will be the largest carbon market in the world. This report has important reference value for the power generation sector that is starting to run the carbon market," Zhixuan Wang, Secretary General of China Electricity Council, said.EDF has been working for more than two decades to help build China's capacity and ambition to address climate change. The report was developed with support from the Children's Investment Fund Foundation, and was unveiled in Frankfurt at an event co-hosted by the International Emissions Trading Association (IETA) and EDF.Download EDF and ERI's report, "The Progress of China's Carbon Market 2017," in English and Chinese.# # #Environmental Defense Fund (edf.org), a leading international nonprofit organization, creates transformational solutions to the most serious environmental problems.

This year, the expo was jointly hosted by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the Provincial Government of Guizhou and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT). China's President Xi Jinping also sent a congratulatory letter on the successful launch of the expo.THEKEY was granted a National "Technology Innovation Award of 2018 Chinese Government's Information Product" for its MVP/Testnet product and its application in medical insurance payments - Virtual Social Security Card Application Based on Blockchain Technology and IDV, in order to build a Medical Insurance and Medical Big Data Platform. And besides THEKEY, the award was also granted to some of the other outstanding and world renowned enterprises in each industry. For instance, Xinhua News Agency and Kingsoft have won the "Technology Innovation Award of 2018 Chinese Government's Information Product" in the newswire agency and software development fields respectively. Additionally, THEKEY MVP is the only award-winning project with blockchain technology in this selection.Through Blockchain Based Dynamic Multi-dimension Identification (BDMI) technology, "undeniable" and "unalterable" online IDV results were generated for the first time in the world. In addition, BDMI embraces 6 elements simultaneously to realize EA5 (e-authentication-5) level IDV services. THEKEY adopted a 5-pillar private key management system, through which the initial results appear to provide a great starting point for a feasible solution for private key management, deviceless IDV and deviceless payment. Also for the first time, THEKEY was able to integrate IDV and digital wallets to form a real identity wallet (RIW), which can lay a solid foundation for the healthy development of cryptocurrencies and the digital economy.Prior to this expo, Catherine received an exclusive interview by CGTN (China's new international media organization launched by the national broadcaster CCTV) and she mentioned that she was very satisfied with the substantial progress THEKEY MVP/Testnet has already achieved, and for the next stage, THEKEY will focus on improving the performance, efficiency and reliability of BDMI technology. In addition, THEKEY understands the vital need to have equipment which is trusted and secure to underpin any of the work BDMI technology will be based on, and thus it will look to develop exclusive hardware devices in the future.View the video:https://youtu.be/ug14W5VQEycAbout THEKEYTHEKEY is a decentralized ecosystem of an identity verification tool using national big-data and blockchain.

S. intellectual property theft and forced transfers of technology.China hit back by saying that it plans to impose the same tariff on 106 US products worth USD50 billion, including aircraft, cars, chemicals, and soybeans.But after high-level bilateral trade talks, both sides agreed to put on hold the proposed tariff hike on each other's imports, pledging not to engage in a trade war.However, on Tuesday, the White House made it clear that the final list of targeted Chinese items would be announced by June 15, and the revised tariffs would be imposed on their import to America shortly thereafter.The US Chamber of Commerce said that the government's decision is in fact a tax on American consumers, and will undermine the competitiveness of American companies, "just as the administration's steel tariffs have dramatically raised prices on steel in the US."Its President and CEO Thomas Donohue had recently reiterated the trade body's position for opening China's markets through systemic reforms rather than imposing tariffs.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi made a scathing attack of President Donald Trump on the issue, saying that his "continued chaotic trade brinkmanship threatens to invite retaliation that harms American workers and farmers and the American economy.""Last week, the President revealed the utter hollowness of his promises by pledging the American government resources to a Chinese company that has violated US sanctions by selling technology to North Korea and Iran, and that is a known cyber security risk to the US," the Congresswoman alleged, referring to Trump repealing a US export ban against Chinese telecommunications giant ZTE.It came shortly after Ivanka Trump's business was granted approval from the Chinese government for multiple trademark applications, raising potential ethics issues over the Trump family's business connections to China.The hiked tariffs aren't effective, according to Erik Paulsen, Chairman of Congress Joint Economic Committee."They'll harm US jobs and consumers".

CONGRESSMAN MATT GAETZ: "THE PRESIDENT IS PROTECTING AMERICAN BUSINESSES FROM CHINA'S PREDATORY TRADE POLICIES AND IP THEFT"States News ServiceMay 29, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 601 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the office of Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz:U.S. Congressman Matt Gaetz (FL-01) today issued the following statement in response to the recent steps President Donald Trump has taken to protect American inventors, entrepreneurs, and innovators from China's unfair trade practices, market manipulation, and IP theft:"I commend President Trump for taking action against China's ruthless and unfair trade practices, as well as its state-sponsored theft of American innovators' intellectual property. For too many years, China has pursued trade practices and business policies that make it impossible for foreign companies to compete on a level playing field with Chinese companies. These policies, like its "Made in China 2025 policy," hurt American companies and limit economic growth worldwide.In August of 2017, Dr. Neal Dunn (FL-02) and I held a field hearing in Tallahassee: Wanton Loot How China is Stealing Ideas from American Entrepreneurs. This hearing featured a panel of experts on Chinese trade and industrial policy. We learned about the many ways in which China consistently and deliberately steals American technology, then profits from it. China's clear violations of patent and trademark law undermine American entrepreneurship. We also heard specific examples of alleged Chinese misconduct from Dean Minardi, CEO of Florida-based Bing Energy. A Chinese investor in his company absconded with intellectual property that had taken years to develop.IP theft costs the US economy over 225 billion dollars a year. The greatest perpetrator is China, and as a member of the Subcommittee on Intellectual Property, I applaud the bold steps President Trump is taking to address this troubling issue. China is one of America's largest trading partners; their predatory behavior is unacceptable.China is engaging in a systematic and multifaceted strategy to steal intellectual property. Beyond the economic costs, this theft presents significant concerns for national security. The majority of Chinese companies that steal or benefit from stolen intellectual property are state-owned. The Chinese government is known for using their military's cyber capabilities to hack into private US tech firms, stealing IP, then transferring the technology to state-run companies who profit from its development.Following the field hearing, I had the opportunity to speak with senior White House officials about this crucial issue facing America. I am pleased that these conversations were productive, and that many of the recommendations we received from scholars and entrepreneurs are being put forth as official policy. Over the past several months, President Trump has been taking concrete steps to address the critical issue of China's aggressive IP theft and unfair trade practices, which have cost America billions, if not trillions, of dollars in lost revenue and thwarted economic opportunities.For too long, Presidents of both parties have failed to curb China's wanton disregard for international law and IP rights. President Trump's "America First" policies are a much-needed step in the right direction, and a victory for American innovation and creativity. America does not need a playing field tilted in its favor; our products are the best in the world, and American manufacturers only need to compete on a fair and level playing field in order to succeed. President Trump is leveling the playing field for the first time in well over a generation, and his actions will help American businesses thrive in today's fast-paced global environment," said Rep. Gaetz.###Load-Date: May 30, 2018End of Document

This message appears as a result in the search engine of the electronic portal JD, one of the most famous online stores in China, although it specializes in electronics, it sells almost all types of products.  The sacred book does not appear in any T aobao shop, the portal belonging to the giant of electronic commerce, Alibaba, where millions of retailers offer their articles.  In the portal there is the possibility of entering into a written conversation with the vendors through a chat and one of the portals confirmed to Efe that they had removed the Bible, but offered the possibility of selling it outside that platform. "Now we can not sell it in public, lately the situation is very tense," said the seller, who provided photographs of the bibles he sells.  In another store of religious articles they also said that they do not sell it, while other online bookstores and similar stores, where it does not appear either, did not respond to the message.  However, in several stores you can find books related to Christianity or children's stories about it, but not the original Bible.  Efe proved that the book is not present either in the aforementioned JD and Taobao, nor in the Chinese version of Amazon or in Dang Dang, a portal specializing in the sale of books.  Through Wechat , the most popular instant messaging tool among Chinese people, there is also a message circulating in Christian groups these days that says that as of March 30, the Bible can not be sold through the Internet.  Precisely yesterday the Chinese government published a new rule on religious beliefs in which he said that "religions in the country should be of Chinese orientation and provide an active orientation to religions so they can adapt to the socialist society."  In China, although there are no official data, it is estimated that there are between 60 and 70 million Christians of all denominations and that more than half of them are grouped in congregations not affiliated with the Government, which is why they are often persecuted. Load-Date: April 4, 2018End of Document

The amendment could be removed as the bill is reconciled with a House version.• Numerous Republican and Democratic senators said their vote related to national security issues after numerous intelligence warnings about ZTE this year.The US senate has voted to reinstate a ban on China's ZTE, despite President Donald Trump's attempts to lift sanctions on the telecommunications company.ZTE essentially shutdown operations in May after it was banned from importing US components for seven years for misleading regulators about violating sanctions on North Korea and Iran. But, on Trump's orders, fewer than two weeks ago the administration made a            deal to end ZTE's sanctions in exchange for a $1 billion fine, a move that was originally            part of a larger trade deal that was unpopular with both            Republicans and            Democrats.On Monday night, the Senate tried to take control of the situation by passing the annual National Defense Authorization Act, which included an amendment to stop Trump's deal allowing US companies to trade with ZTE. The legislation, which is considered crucial for continuing defense funding, was passed with 85-10 votes, one of a handful of times the Republican-controlled Senate has deviated from a Trump policy.But the amendment is not guaranteed to become law. The bill will now need to be reconciled with a House version - where the amendment could be stripped out - voted through both the House and the Senate, and signed into law by Trump.National security concerns appear to have been a crucial factor with US Senators Marco Rubio, Tom Cotton, Chuck Schumer, and Chris Van Hollen releasing a joint bipartisan statement."We're heartened that both parties made it clear that protecting American jobs and national security must come first when making deals with countries like China, which has a history of having little regard for either," they said.Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner also tweeted that the Senate had "blocked" the Trump administration from making a "bad deal with ZTE.""If the President won't act on warnings from his own top intelligence officials about the dangers posed by ZTE, we will," Warner said.Earlier this year six intelligence chiefs - including the heads of the CIA, FBI, and NSA - testified they do not use, and would not recommend private citizens use products from ZTE or China's Huawei. And the Pentagon announced in early May that it had stopped selling Huawei and ZTE phones and modems in stores on its military bases because they "may pose an unacceptable risk."And last month FBI Director Christopher Wray told a Senate hearing that the agency is "deeply concerned" about companies like ZTE."We the FBI remain deeply concerned that any company beholden to foreign governments that don't share our values are not companies that we want to be gaining positions of power inside our telecommunications network that gives them the capacity to maliciously modify or steal information, that gives them the capacity to conduct undetected espionage, that gives them the ability to exert pressure or control," Wray said when asked about the risks of giving ZTE more access to the US market.There have also been allegations in recent months that ZTE was established for the very purpose of spying on other countries.Despite these concerns, after ZTE was hit with sanctions, Trump ordered the Commerce Department to lift the ban and help ZTE "get back into business, fast." The timing raised questions as three days earlier the            Chinese government agreed to provide $500 million in loans to an Indonesian theme park that the Trump Organization has a deal to license President Donald Trump's name to.NOW WATCH: This top economist has a radical plan to change the way Americans voteSee Also:• Conclusive proof that it is Trump's policy to separate children from their families at the border• Melania Trump says US should 'govern with heart' when it comes to migrant children• Trump repeats falsehood that Democrats are to blame for forced family separations at the US-Mexico borderSEE ALSO: The very purpose of the Chinese tech company ZTE is to spy on other countries, a competitor alleges in new court documentsLoad-Date: February 11, 2019End of Document

A Chinese space station is hurtling toward Earth - here's how to track the crash as it happensBusiness Insider USApril 1, 2018 Sunday 12:48 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 484 wordsByline: lgarfield@businessinsider.com,  (Leanna Garfield)Highlight: Scientists are not sure exactly where China's out-of-control Tiangong-1 space station will crash. Here's how to follow along as it falls.BodyShutterstock• A falling Chinese space station dubbed Tiangong-1 will soon break up into chunks in the atmosphere and crash to Earth. It will likely go down on Sunday.• Scientists say it is nearly impossible to determine the exact time and location of the station's crash.• But you can follow along as it descends using sites from SatView, the European Space Agency, and more.On Sunday, a Chinese space station called            Tiangong-1 is expected to crash to Earth.The 9.4-ton spacecraft went up into space in 2011, but in 2016, the Chinese government lost communication with it due to an apparent technical malfunction.It's difficult to predict exactly when Tiangong-1 will re-enter Earth's atmosphere, and where it will break up into pieces before it lands. On Monday, the space station was at an altitude of about 130 miles. It has been falling more than a mile every day since then, and its rate of descent is also accelerating.The exact location of the impending Tiangong-1 crash is still a mystery, but it will likely hit somewhere 42.7 degrees north or south of the equator. The chances of Tiangong-1's re-entry are slightly higher in New Zealand, Tasmania, the northern states of the US, northern China, the Middle East, central Italy, northern Spain, and parts of South America and southern Africa.If you'd like to track Tiangong-1 as it falls, there are several sites you can check:• The European Space Agency's Space Debris Officeis tracking Tiangong-1's altitude and continuously updating its prediction for the station's re-entry time.• A nonprofit based in California, the Aerospace Corporation, created a page with information on Tiangong-1's status and when it will likely re-enter Earth's atmosphere.• On March 18, China's space agency, China Manned Space, began publishing daily updates on the space station's current location and orbit,            according to the GB Times.• SatViewprovides a map of where Tiangong-1 is at any given moment and the craft's predicted path.• Astrophysicists like Dr Marco Langbroek and            Quan-Zhi Ye are tweeting updates using the hashtag            #Tiangong1, too.• Business Insider is updating several stories on the Tiangong-1 crash here »As of Sunday afternoon, Tiangong-1 should reenter Earth's atmosphere on April 1 at 8:10 p.m. ET (give or take 2.5 hours), according to the Aerospace Corporation.Aerospace's map, seen below, shows the station's approximate location in its orbit (as of Friday afternoon):The Aerospace CorporationNOW WATCH: This incredible animation shows how humans evolved from early lifeSee Also:• China's bus-size space station is about 8 hours from crashing into Earth• A Chinese space station is about to crash to Earth - here's what it was doing• China's out-of-control space station may release a toxic chemical when it crashesSEE ALSO: China's out-of-control space station may release a toxic chemical when it crashesLoad-Date: February 11, 2019End of Document

Markets Still Spooked By Trade Fears; Tech Sector Leads Stocks LowerBenzinga.comJune 25, 2018 Monday 8:14 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Accretive Capital LLC d/b/a Benzinga All Rights ReservedLength: 489 wordsByline: Elizabeth BalboaBodyTech shares dragged the entire market down Monday as traders readied for continued blows between the U.S. and Chinese governments.Among others:Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) sold off 3.4 percent;Facebook, Inc.(NASDAQ: FB) 2.7 percent;Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) 3.1 percent;Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX) 6.5 percent; andAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL) 2.6 percent.Consequently, PowerShares QQQ Trust, Series 1(ETF) (NASDAQ: QQQ) closed down 2.3 percent, the S&P 500 Index 1.3 percent and the Dow Jones Industrial Average 1.3 percent. The Dow closed at 24,252.80, below its 200-day moving average for the first time in over 500 days.What HappenedFears mounted Sunday after President Donald Trump threatened tougher trade policy on unyielding partners.The United States is insisting that all countries that have placed artificial Trade Barriers and Tariffs on goods going into their country, remove those Barriers & Tariffs or be met with more than Reciprocity by the U.S.A. Trade must be fair and no longer a one way street!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 24, 2018The Wall Street Journal then reported Trump would soon block more tech exports to China and prohibit Chinese companies from investing in U.S. technology. Chinese President Xi Jinping allegedly said Beijing would  punch back. An attempt at reassurance from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin didn t improve sentiment.On behalf of @realDonaldTrump, the stories on investment restrictions in Bloomberg & WSJ are false, fake news. The leaker either doesn t exist or know the subject very well. Statement will be out not specific to China, but to all countries that are trying to steal our technology.  Steven Mnuchin (@stevenmnuchin1)            June 25, 2018Neither did confirmationfrom Peter Navarro, director of the National Trade Council, that the Administration has no plans to impose investment restrictions.Navarro on Monday afternoon dismissed the market s struggles as a product of momentum investing and advised that long-term investors will profit from the president s trade strategies.Why It s ImportantThe markets have consistently closed lower on news of escalated trade tensions between the U.S. and its major trading partners, China, Canada, Mexico and the European Union.American tariffs on foreign goods have threatened domestic supply chains and foreign manufacturing strategies for U.S. multinationals, and they ve prompted retaliatory tariffs from trade partners expected to stunt international sales for U.S. companies.What s NextAlthough the WSJ reported Trump s new strikes against China will be announced by the end of the week, Navarro denied the allegedly impending event.Instead, he said the Treasury Department will report to Trump on China trade issues Friday.Related Links:Trump's Trade Strategy: Pros And ConsAnalysts Weigh In On US-China Trade Developments© 2018 Benzinga.com.

US lawmakers examining Google's relationship with Huawei, Chinese tech firmsCNN WireJune 7, 2018 Thursday 9:58 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 609 wordsByline: By Jackie WattlesDateline: NEW YORK (CNNMoney) BodyNEW YORK (CNNMoney) --  At least two members of Congress are looking into Google's ties to Huawei, a massive Chinese tech firm that is under scrutiny over data sharing with Facebook and has been flagged by US officials as a possible security threat.Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said in a statement Thursday that his office has sent a letter to Google parent company Alphabet requesting information about its partnerships with Huawei and other Chinese companies."We look forward to answering these questions," a Google spokesperson said in a statement. "We do not provide special access to Google user data" as part of the agreements the company has with device manufacturers.A separate, similar letter by Warner was sent to Twitter.A spokesperson for Republican Congressman Mike Conaway also confirmed he is looking into ties between Google and Huawei. The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg earlier reported moves by Congress members to look more deeply into Google's relationship with Huawei. The Senate Intelligence Committee will call on Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Alphabet/Google's Larry Page and Twitter's Jack Dorsey to address their data-sharing deals with Chinese device makers if and when they appear before Congress this summer, a Senate source told CNNMoney's Dylan Byers.Huawei is the world's third largest smartphone maker behind Samsung and Apple. It's also a leading provider of telecom equipment in Asia, Europe and Latin America.But the company has been the focus of national security concerns in the United States. Intelligence officials have warned that the Chinese government can use Huawei smartphones and other products for intelligence gathering.Huawei has strongly denied it poses a risk to the United States. Huawei did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday. In his letter to Alphabet, Sen. Warner says he is aware of "strategic partnerships" between Google and Chinese smartphone makers Huawei and Xiaomi, as well as tech conglomerate Tencent."The possibility of Chinese vendors with documented ties to the Chinese Communist Party having access to Facebook's private API (and potentially Alphabet's) - particularly as China develops tools to harness individual-level data for surveillance and social control - raises serious national security concerns," the letter reads.Xiaomi did not immediately respond to a request for comment and Tencent could not immediately be reached.A few days ago, Facebook confirmed it provided Huawei access to user data.Facebook said it has been operating data-sharing partnerships with four Chinese device makers that enabled the companies to recreate Facebook-like experiences for their users.It was previously known Facebook had such deals with around 60 companies when mobile phones were less powerful and app stores did not yet exist, and the company announced in April it was winding down the partnerships. It said Tuesday that it has ended more than half of them and that its partnership with Huawei will shut down this week.In his letter to Twitter Tuesday, Warner asks the company whether it has any agreements similar to the ones Facebook has disclosed.Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment. "There are now indications that this practice of embedding social media sharing functions with Chinese [device makers] may have been more widespread, including potentially through agreements between Twitter and these Chinese companies," he wrote.- CNNMoney's Jethro Mullen and Dylan Byers contributed to this report.TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us this morning.I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Tuesday, June 19th.Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.The trade war threat slamming global markets this morning. Take a look at futures indicating a sharp selloff at the start of trading. Down one and a third percent on the Dow, beyond better than 1 percent on the S&P and the Nasdaq right now.The Trump administration is threatening another round of tariffs against China -- 10 percent on $200 billion worth of goods. It could escalate from there as well. We are waiting on new restrictions and investment as well.This, after markets were mostly lower yesterday -- the Dow closing lower for a fifth session in a row with a decline a hundred points yesterday, almost one-half of a percent.Fears of a trade war ripping through global markets this morning as well. As you can see the FT 100 is down a half of a percent, the CAC 40 and the DAX index down better than 1 percent.Overnight in Asia, a sharp selloff there and it started in China. The Shanghai composite, the worst performer, down almost 4 percent on the session.We are also watching the price of oil which is down this morning. Crude sliding more than 1 percent on a tariff threat, more supply likely coming to the market -- that has oil at $64.89 a barrel.Securing the southern border -- the Trump administration is standing firm in enforcing its zero tolerance policy. President Trump slammed Democrats for their inaction.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Immigration is the fault in all of the problems that we're having because we cannot get them to sign legislation. We cannot get them even to the negotiating table. And I say it's very strongly the Democrats' fault. They're really obstructionists and they are obstructing.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: It comes ahead of the President's meeting with House Republicans later this morning when they will try to hammer out a deal on legislation. We'll hear from one lawmaker who will be at the meeting, coming up.And a scare for social media -- the implications for the sector after a new report shows people are deleting their profiles in droves. Take a look at those stocks this morning -- Snap down almost 2 percent, Twitter down almost 2 percent, Facebook down almost 1 percent.JetBlue 2.0 -- the airlines' founder reportedly eyeing the sky all over again, details on his low cost airline coming up.Plus, the pricing power of Disney -- the company testing a new strategy to see how much people are willing to pay up to get a preview of a new park.All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning and joining me to talk all about it -- Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, CFRA investment strategist Lindsey Bell, and former CIA covert operations officer, Diligence president Mike Baker. Great to see you this morning.MIKE BAKER, PRESIDENT, DILEGENCE: Great to see you, too. It's shocking that Disney may be thinking about raising prices. I'm stunned.BARTIROMO: I think they just raised prices a month ago actually for their parks.BAKER: Yes.BARTIROMO: We've got a serious situation under -- we're watching this morning rather -- and that is markets selling off -- Lindsey. And we're talking about a 300-point selloff given the fact that the President is talking about further investment restrictions and further tariffs against China.LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA: And we were talking about earlier, isn't it impressive that President Trump is willing to risk the economic growth that we're seeing here just to get fair trade for us and probably the rest of the world. We'll see how things play out.On Friday we saw the markets sell off strongly on the $50 billion -- announcement of $50 billion in tariffs but it came back at the end of the day. It still ended up down. We'll see.This is a much sharper move, it's the retaliation and the escalation of this conversation. It's starting to get out of hand and that is freaking the market out.MCDOWELL: The calculation out of the White House does seem to be that we have greater leverage in using tariffs because we import, what, more than $500 billion in goods from China every year. China only imports about $130 billion. So we have more room to do damage with tariffs.But the point being China, it's a centrally-planned government, essentially, it's communist. They can do a lot more to disrupt business going on over there but even disrupt the supply chain. So say, a shoe manufacturer -- the shoes are made here in the U.S. but they source the soles, the rubber soles from China, you can get a supply disruption.And again, it not only hurts Americans through higher prices, we're talking about Disney raising prices -- well, the White House is essentially raising prices for everybody but also disrupting where their goods come from and also the cost that manufacturers are having to pay as well.BAKER: But the administration's absolutely correct to focus on the theft of IP. Look, the Chinese have -- the government has over two dozen information warfare units and dozens of academic institutions funded by the PLA, the People's Liberation Army, that are designed to focus on ways to more efficiently do economic espionage, to gather up information from around the world and to use that to bypass the cost of traditional research and development and engineering.So they're right to focus on this. My concern is that they don't have a playbook.(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: But is the tariff the way to fight it? That's the --BARTIROMO: How do you fight it?MCDOWELL: Right. How do you -- is a tariff going to change China's behavior on that? Maria talked about this endlessly.BARTIROMO: What will change the behavior? What will stop China from stealing our IP and forcing the transfer of technology? Nothing.BAKER: As long as it's --BARTIROMO: They're not going to.BAKER: As long as it's in their best interest.BARTIROMO: They won't even admit they're doing it.BAKER: Yes. As long as it's in their best interest, they won't do it. That's just how they function, how they operate.My concern again is that I don't think he -- I don't think the President has necessarily a playbook with a mapped-out set of guidelines for how to do this. I think there's more of a feel that he's winging it --BARTIROMO: Yes.BAKER: -- and that's a concern because the Chinese don't wing anything.BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, it's interesting because at one point I felt that this market was sort of giving this president a break -- thinking everything was a negotiation.And you know, everything's a negotiation so we're just going to, you know, buy stocks, look at the long-term and get set -- not get too up in arms about this.But at the same time, he comes out yesterday or the weekend and says look, there are more tariffs coming on further goods. People do not know what this president will do and the uncertainty of it -- you know, the wild card that is President Trump has markets on edge.BELL: This is going to hurt the consumer here and it's going to make CEOs really second guess how they're going to spend the cash flow and benefits from the tax plan.MCDOWELL: I know we want to wrap --BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: -- but I will say this. It was so important to get that permanent corporate tax cut, to give businesses certainty in this country about operating. Down the road I can make long-term investment plans. This is the kind of uncertainty you don't need introduced into the business community.BARTIROMO: You're opening up uncertainty again after we got the certainty.We want to look at this market and we'll keep following it, down 338 points now on the Dow. And that is off of the lows of the morning.Joining the conversation coming up, we're going to speak with Allianz chief economic advisor Mohamed el-Erian is with us this morning to navigate these markets. President Trump's attorney and former New York City Mayor, Rudy Giuliani with me this morning as well -- don't miss that special interview. And Fox News senior strategic analyst, retired General Jack Keane is also here.A lot to come in this hour, don't miss it.And we are watching the border as well this morning. Immigration front and center as President Trump is getting set to meet with House Republicans later todayGriff Jenkins is covering the story. He's at the U.S. Border Patrol central processing center in McAllen, Texas. Griff -- good morning to you.GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning -- Maria.We are outside of the Rio Grande Valley sector's processing center here in McAllen, Texas. It's one of the largest in the country. This is where you come, whether you're an adult or a minor, as soon as you've been apprehended by the border patrol and just is releasing some images in there.But you know, as we entered this national dialogue, Maria, about the humanity of how these people who have come here illegally are being treated, the President wanted to make it very clear that he won't stand to have migrant camps across the country. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: The United States will not be a migrant camp and it will not be a refugee holding facility. If the Democrats would sit down instead of obstructing we could have something done very quickly.(END VIDEO CLIP)JENKINS: Maria -- the Secretary of DHS Kirstjen Nielson also took to the White House podium to defend the zero tolerance policy. She says that, well, here is how you get real border security. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY: This entire crisis, just to be clear, is not new. It's been occurring and expanded over many decades. But currently it is the exclusive product of loopholes in our federal immigration laws that prevent illegal immigrant minors and family members from being detained and removed to their home country.(END VIDEO CLIP)JENKINS: And not to go too deep in the woods, Maria, but there's three loopholes that the administration says they need to address. One is the Trafficking Victims Prevention Reauthorization Act of 2008. That was in President George W. Bush.The asylum needs to be reformed because there was a 1,700 percent increase in the last decade of asylum claims made within the southern border as well as a third thing, going back to 1997, the Flores settlement.We're going to hear more, a lot about that. And we're going to try and get inside this facility and get our own images for you -- Maria.BARTIROMO: All right. Griff -- thanks so much. We'll be watching that. Griff Jenkins there joining us on the border.Joining us right now is House Judiciary member, Texas Congressman Louie Gohmert. And good to see you -- sir, thanks so much for joining us.REP. LOUIE GOHMERT (R-TX), HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: And you -- thank you.BARTIROMO: You will be at that meeting with the President later today.GOHMERT: You bet.BARTIROMO: Immigration is the big issue in your home state of Texas. How do you see it?GOHMERT: Well, I've been down there many times. I've been inside the facility where Griff is and spent a lot of nights down there on the border. And what really gets to me is the Democrats' answer basically is well, just do what President Obama did. Don't follow the law; just make it up as you go along like Obama did.Well, we have a president that took an oath and he's actually trying to follow it. And God bless Jeff Sessions is enforcing the law, following the law. And nobody seems to understand that these children being separated happened when Clinton was president, when George W. Bush was president, Obama was president -- but people get upset if you want to go back and talk about that.But it points at the fact that we do need to fix the law. And I want to see a law that I've got prepared that says if you come across anywhere except the proper marked border entry ports, then you cannot claim asylum. And that will end a lot of this very quickly. You don't let them step foot on our soil if they're not coming through an actual official port of entry.But they're following the law. They're enforcing the law. We do need to fix a number of things but we don't need to have another 1,700 percent increase as Griff was talking about. It's outrageous.BARTIROMO: Yes. So it is Congress that can actually change the situation.GOHMERT: Exactly.BARTIROMO: I mean people are blaming congress here.GOHMERT: You bet. You bet.BARTIROMO: So what can be done? I mean What's your time line and will you get common ground with your colleagues on the left?GOHMERT: Well, I don't think so because the Democrats have shown when they had the House and the Senate, the White House, they had no interest in fixing the problem. They didn't even try to fix the problem. They were more interested in taking away people's different choices on health care.BARTIROMO: Right.GOHMERT: They didn't even try to fix it. Why? Because they know that's an issue they use every election. They want to bring in as many people illegally as possible --BARTIROMO: yes.GOHMERT: -- and it ought to scare anybody that's a Democrat that the hope for the Democratic Party is to bring in more people that don't speak the language, that they are easily swayed by people that appear to be caring, which is basically what the Democrats are doing when they're luring people through horrific circumstances to get into this country whereas we want to continue to encourage people to come in legally, do it legally. Let's keep families together.But you're probably aware, you know, there's like 10,000 to 12,000 kids --BARTIROMO: Right.GOHMERT: -- that are currently detained, came in unaccompanied.BARTIROMO: Yes.GOHMERT: Their parents sent them through hell without the parents' help. And then some of them that come in, they're not with their parents. I've seen that over and over. I've seen them passing off kids, ok, who's going to claim they're the parents. It's really ridiculous.BARTIROMO: Congressman -- I've got to move on to trade.GOHMERT: You bet.BARTIROMO: I've got to move on to trade as well as the IG report.GOHMERT: Yes, sure.BARTIROMO: Michael Horowitz is going to be testifying this morning. Do you think we're actually going to see accountability here in this situation where we see this IG report is laced with bias every page?GOHMERT: Yes. We had hoped that the IG report would be able to actually draw proper conclusions so we could get this dark chapter behind us. But it basically, Maria, he did what Comey did in his July 2016 announcement. Laid out the facts that show this is a big case here, bias was a big deal. And then comes to the conclusion that even though the conclusion of the prosecution was exactly like the bias would indicate it was going to be, we don't find any evidence that bias affected it.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Right. So will there be accountability -- sir? What do you think? How about the accountability is what I'm asking? I recognize that, that he's saying that there's no bias when in fact we recognize that there's an incredible amount of bias and that had to lead to the decision making.GOHMERT: Of course. And he did document that.BARTIROMO: Right.GOHMERT: He did document that. But the accountability is only going to come if we get what I've been begging for, for over a year -- that is a second special counsel to investigate all of these players including Mueller and his players, and including Rosenstein's role in the previous Russia investigation. How they supplanted the information so the sale of our uranium could go through to get in Russian hands.There are a lot of issues here. This is going to really is going to take a second counsel to examine. And I hope we're going to get that at some point. It's the only way I see getting out of this.BARTIROMO: We'll see about that. And then there's the new 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports. Are you for that? Real quick.GOHMERT: I've never been a fan of tariffs but the President is trying to get better deals for us.BARTIROMO: Right.GOHMERT: And I'm willing to give him whatever leeway he needs to get us better deals --BARTIROMO: All right.GOHMERT: -- and the Chinese better understand it. He is serious.BARTIROMO: Congressman -- good to see you, sir.GOHMERT: You bet.BARTIROMO: Thanks so much.GOHMERT: Great to be with you -- Maria.BARTIROMO: Louie Gohmert joining us.We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.As we've been reporting, we've got a sharp selloff underway this morning for futures, indicating a decline of about 350 points right out of the gate this morning on the Dow Industrials as new trade worries unnerve investors.The President is looking to identify more products from Beijing to slap tariffs on; looking for an additional $200 billion in products for 10 percent tariff. This is what he's told his team to identify. Markets are selling off as a result.Meanwhile, police now say that the man who saved lives by stopping an attempted carjacker at a Wal-Mart is a pastor.Cheryl Casone with the details on that now -- Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: We brought this story to our viewers yesterday, Maria. And the armed civilian is being called a hero. He killed a gunman who injured three other people during a rampage at a Wal- Mart in Washington State. Now this all happened on Sunday.Well, police say the faith leader shot and killed the suspect, Tim O'Day -- a man with a lengthy criminal history. Police say that O'Day tried to carjack at least five vehicles, shooting one driver. That victim receiving emergency medical help from the pastor who, of course, shot the suspect before being air-lifted to a hospital. The pastor, of course, was armed at the time. That victim remains in critical condition.Well, Facebook already prohibiting ads from guns and starting Thursday they're going to stop advertisers from showing weapon accessory ads to minor. This means that products like a holster, a bullet-proof vest, camouflage gears are only going to be shown to adults. This comes in the wake, of course, of the deadly school shootings at Parkland, Florida and Santa Fe, Texas that happened earlier this year.YouTube started restricting certain videos featuring firearms and accessories.Well, Facebook no stranger to privacy scandals and according to a new study, four out of 10 people have deleted their social media accounts in the last year because of privacy concerns. This study has revealed a lack of trust in social media, not only because of the collection of personal information but also the circulation of fake news. 62 percent of users want more regulation on all of these platforms.Just take a look at some of them right now. Shares of Facebook, Twitter, Snap -- all feeling the pressure, of course, as a broader market selloff is under way. All of those names are in the red.Shares of Square though hitting a record high yesterday; they did get the green light from New York State to trade bit coin on the cash app. Square actually closed up nearly 3 percent yesterday. Bitcoin trading on Square's Cash app now available in every state of the U.S. with the exception of Georgia and Hawaii.There you go -- Maria. Those are your headlines.BARTIROMO: All right. Thanks -- Cheryl.Coming up, North Korea's Kim Jong-un is back in Beijing this morning after the historic summit with President Trump. These meetings may be sending a strong signal to the U.S. We're getting answers next, coming up.And then paying even more at Disneyland -- the new strategy to allow super fans to pay more for a preview of the park's newest and latest attraction.Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Well, it's going to be rough at the start of trading this morning. Investors in for a wild ride -- Dow Industrials right now down 1.5 percent, that's 376 points lower. This is inching toward the lows again, down 376 on the Dow. Down 87 on the Nasdaq; that's one and a quarter percent.So things have worsened in the last 20 minutes after President Trump has threatened another round of tariffs against China.Joining us now is Wells Fargo Investment Institute head and global market strategist Paul Christopher. Paul -- good to see you, thanks so much for joining us.PAUL CHRISTOPHER, GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT INSTITUTE: Thank you -- Maria.BARTIROMO: How serious is this?CHRISTOPHER: This is part of the overall increased volatility that we've been looking for. As an issue in and of itself, what it shows us is that investors were originally thinking oh, well it's just a negotiating ploy. Well, yes, it is a negotiating ploy but it's probably going to be a harder negotiation than investors were originally thinking. You've still got a lot of institutional investors holding currencies and equities in places like Korea, Mexico, Taiwan -- they're very vulnerable.BARTIROMO: Yes but you just said I'm expecting higher highs this year and higher highs next year.CHRISTOPHER: We are expecting higher highs this year and next year but with a lot of volatility in between on days like this.BELL: Well, you've also seen investors kind of rotate in the last month into some of the higher yielding sectors like real estate, utilities, even consumer staples --CHRISTOPHER: That's right.BELL: -- have done a little better. Do you think that's -- you should get exposure to that right here, right now just to kind of help yourself as an investor really wait until we get to the higher highs?CHRISTOPHER: We've been underweight most of the interest rate sensitive stuff and we finally got out of REITs when we had that nice pullback for the last couple of months. Because we see increased sensitivity to the rates in all of those sectors across the board. We'll be pulling from there and putting into cyclical sectors. We still believe the economy has good growth this year and next.BARTIROMO: Let me welcome Susan Li to the conversation. Thanks for joining us -- Susan.SUSAN LI, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning.BARTIROMO: And I know you've been on the phone with strategists in the U.S. as well as China this morning. Tell us what you're hearing.LI: I'm making calls around the big trading desks across the Asia-Pacific and you know, they tell me that it really wasn't that hard to drag down China, to be honest. I mean we were in a tightening cycle anyways where they were trying to clamp down on credit, making up sheet credit and the loans, keep putting them onto the books of banks, right.So it was already in a tightening cycle. We had disappointing macro data. And this whole talk of trade tariffs and this trade war, you know, really was an excuse for them to sell.And you know, it's not a one day event because there was the biggest fund outflows that they've seen in years in the Asia Pacific, ETFs unwinding. And when you know, mom and pops and retail investors start unwinding that event is not a one-day event, it's not a weekly event -- it's probably months in order for them just to sell out of the market for these, you know, these massive passive funds, right.So right now it's concerning especially as we're looking at the worst selloff since 2016. I was there in 2016 when China went down 6 percent, 7 percent day after day. And they're concerned that, you know, in this environment where there isn't that much cushioning, you know, it could get a lot worse.BARTIROMO: I just wonder if you really should be thinking about how you're going to get out of this market. I mean maybe you just hold on. I don't know -- what do you think? What are you telling clients this morning?CHRISTOPHER: You know, what you really have to do at this point is, first of all, make sure you have some dry powder. Take those profits where you can. If you're overweight -- if you're higher than where you want to be, take some profits, keep some dry powder for the next round of pullbacks like we're seeing today.You're going to have more of that to take advantage of. It's a higher bet to bet on the economy growing at this point.MCDOWELL: Why not just keep it in cash if the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates. Your cash is earning a lot more and you don't have the volatility certainly that you see not just in U.S. stocks.But we're talking about real uncertainty and weakness globally. And that's one of the things that in terms of -- which could cause a great unwinding as we've talked about the emerging markets here and is enough attention being paid there and what's going on in nations like Brazil and even weakness in developed markets across Europe.BELL: Well, I would love to get your take because the concern is, you know, now we're expected to have four rate hikes this year from the Fed. But interestingly, this trade war spat has really held inflation -- helped hold inflation down. So where do you see interest rates going? What is the risk around the world for that and how do you play that?CHRISTOPHER: Interest rates are rising but gradually. The levels don't really matter for stocks yet. Stocks are still very competitive compared to bonds at levels. If rates continue to rise gradually we've still got more time to be in stocks.But we don't disagree. We would be moving money out of long duration, long maturity bonds into shorter duration bonds as rates rise.MCDOWELL: And that's what's been happening because you've seen the yield on the 10-year just come way down -- I forget where it was. It was at 2.88 percent last night I think.CHRISTOPHER: Right. That's a good place to take some money, rotate it back into shorter term.LI: Aren't tariffs -- I mean isn't that inflationary?CHRISTOPHER: Ultimately they would be but think about it, we still have very selected groups of tariffs. Even $200 billion is not that large an increase or hit to the Chinese economy.If you want to see a real trade war, it's 60 percent tariffs across everything. That's what we had in 1930. It's corroborated by academic research as well. You really have to get up that high to have a trade war. We're not there yet. It's right to be concerned but we're not there yet.BARTIROMO: All right. You're not as worried as some others.Real quick -- are you expecting a slow down for the consumer in the next quarter?CHRISTOPHER: No, we're not. It's solid consumer sentiment, solid consumer buying, good wage growth. Look, wages are still rising faster than inflation.BARTIROMO: Yes. I couldn't believe Macy's stock the other day when I look a look at it. What it's done over the last couple of months, just indicating a stronger consumer. And that's not what we're hearing. There's a narrative going around that the consumer does slow down but you're not buying it.It's good to see you -- Paul.CHRISTOPHER: Thanks -- Maria.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. Paul Christopher there, Wells Fargo.Coming up, BJ's going big-time, the bulk retailer files terms for its IPO. We'll tell you what the company could be valued at, next.And then JetBlue's founder is taking flight once again -- the details on the possible new low cost airline hitting the runway from the founder of JetBlue.Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us this morning. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it's Tuesday, June 19th. Your top stories right now, 07:32 on the East Coast.Global stocks are tumbling this morning as trade fears are intensifying. President Trump has threatened to slap a 10 percent tariff on another $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. He's asked the U.S. trade representative to identify $200 billion worth of goods to slap that 10 percent tariff on it. This may very well not be the end of it. Investors are sounding the alarm over the escalating trade debate. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 381 points, 1.5 percent lower. We're expecting a sharp selloff right out of the gate this morning. S&P 500 is also lower by 1.25 percent, that's 35 points lower and the NASDAQ is down one and a third percent, that's 100 points lower on the NASDAQ right now.Yesterday the markets were mixed. The Dow registering its fifth straight decline on trade tensions, the Dow was down 100 points, the S&P was down six points, the NASDAQ manages to squeak out a gain but it was just a fraction.In Europe this morning, the indices are following the U.S. lower. As you can see, the FT-100 is down two-thirds of a percent, the DAX Index the worst performer in Germany, down almost two percent right now.And in Asia overnight, a region-wide selloff with China the hardest hit. The Shanghai Composite down 3-3/4 percent. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong down 2-3/4 percent.Meanwhile, we're watching oil prices this mornings. They're down, traders are digesting the Trump tariff threat. And then OPEC meeting at the end of the week. The price of crude is down 1-2/3 percent, that's $64.75 a barrel.China's president Xi Jinping is meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong- un in Beijing this morning following last week's historic summit in Singapore with President Trump. He will talk sanctions and denuclearization.Meanwhile, South Korea agrees to nix war games with the U.S. in August of the name of -- in the name of momentum. We will have the very latest.JetBlue founder is reportedly taking off with a new low cost airline.

We'll tell you its potential market value, coming up.Plus, Disney is putting its pricing power to the test. How much admission to the new Pixar Pier a day before it opens it is going to cost you? We will tell you.We want to take a look at markets this morning. That' really where the action is this morning. We're seeing a sharp selloff on the worries over trade. The Dow Jones Industrial Average off of the lows of the morning but has been down about 300 points pretty much while we were on the air, down 376 points on the Dow right now, 1.5 percent. S&P is down 1.25 percent and the NASDAQ down 1-1/3 percent.And of course, Susan Li is with us this morning covering Wall Street and the impact here. And I know you've been talking a lot about China. Dagen made the point earlier, if China slows down, what's the impact for the rest of the global economy?LI: The impact is huge, right? The second largest economy in the world. And making calls around the trading defs. And again, you know, they said that this selloff we're at the lowest now in two years, the last time we hit this levels when they accidently or stupidly devalued the currency. And that was a mistake and a wrong signal to the market. But here we are again, this is more on macro fears. There was already a China slowdown taking place. You saw that in a lot of the economic headline numbers, investment, growth and the like and it really didn't take a lot to take down the market. It was just a spark that was needed and the tariffs was basically it, right? And right now we're looking at people taking money out of China at this point. It was a tightening environment anyways. We had a strong RMB at the highest in five months. There's concerns about oil prices and what OPEC does. So, it's a tightening environment. And I think the government and the Central Bank really needs to add some liquidity or do something about it.BELL: I think the question really is both in China and in the U.S., these are sharp selloffs today. How long is this going to last, you know?LI: Yes, that is the question. And as I said, when you have retail investors starting to unwind that process is not just a one-day, as you know, Maria.BARTIROMO: Yes.LI: Not a week event.MCDOWELL: Well -- and its erratic behavior out of the people who work for President Trump and the White House. As Steven Mnuchin goes over to China and comes back and says the trade war is off for the time being.BARTIROMO: It's on hold -- it's on holdMCDOWELL: There aren't going to be any tariffs, it's on hold. And then it's -- well there are going to be tariffs, it's going to be $50 billion in tariffs. And $34 billion of them kick in on July the 6th. Now another $200 billion. And oh, if you fight back, another $200 billion on that. There is no end in sight and what's it doing in terms of intellectual property theft and the forced surrender of technology, tariffs nothing. They would say, nothing.BARTIROMO: Well, what are they going to do about that? That's the big issue here.MCDOWELL: Right.BARTIROMO: But let me ask, let's not forget the broader macro issues that we talk about every morning and that is the economic growth. That means earnings growth. We had 26 percent earnings growth in the first quarter. We're looking at what? 20 percent earnings growth in the second quarter. We still have a solid backdrop in terms of economic growth and profit growth.BELL: Right, exactly. And that, you know, there's a lot of talk about earnings peaking, you know the first quarter being the peak. The third quarter is actually we're looking for 22 percent earnings growth and that's probably low. You always see the numbers coming better than expected and 2019 even if you want to look out that far, earnings growth of 10 percent is actually really pretty solid. The historic averages of some people --MCDOWELL: But slower is slower and it will weigh on stocks. With a European economies that are looking weak. A Federal Reserve is still poise to continue to raise interest rates this year, four times total. And now, a trade war, again, that's a reason to sell.BARTIROMO: Selloff. There's a lot to consider for sure. I want to turn to the diplomacy with North Korea. Meanwhile, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un landed in Beijing this morning to meet with Xi Jinping. Chinese State media is reporting that President Xi promised Chinese friendship with North Korea will never change. Joining me right now is retired four star general, Jack Keane, a Fox News senior strategic analyst. General, it's great to see you this morning. Thank you so much for being here.GEN. JACK KEAN (RET.), FOX BUSINESS CHIEF STRATEGIC ANALYST: Yes, good to see you, Maria.BARTIROMO: So, what do you think as Kim Jong-un's third trip to China this year scheduled just one week after his meeting with President Trump? Are China and North Korea signaling a message to the U.S. by getting even tighter and closer?KEANE: Well, I think this is just largely the fact that China wants to make certain that North Korea stays in their orbit and they don't fall under the orbit of the United States unduly. Listen, President Xi understands Maria, that Kim Jong-un is not his grandfather or his father. He started this diplomatic blitz around the Olympics. That was just four months ago. And since that time, he's had six meetings with national leaders, three as you mentioned with Chinese, two with the South Koreans and also President Trump. This is really quite extraordinary. He had no meetings since he took over five plus years ago with any national leader. So, we clearly are dealing with somebody who I believe is clearly sending all the signals that he does want change.BARTIROMO: Yes.KEANE: And I think Kim Jong-un is there meeting with Xi at Xi's request, making certain that he understands exactly where this youngster is going. He lay down for me again, what actually took place at the summit, what promises did you make. I mean, obviously, Pompeo has briefed the Chinese. But he wants to get it from Kim Jong-un. He wants to look in his eyes and make certain that he's on the right path here.BARTIROMO: So, you think that change that Kim Jong-un is adopting, is going to include denuclearization? I mean, is it that significant a change in mentality?KEANE: Certainly the fact that he's committing to that and signed a paper, I think in itself while that has been done in the past and they've never come through, given everything else that's going on around this young leader.BARTIROMO: Right.KEANE: I think there's some change coming. Now, at the end of the day is it likely he would probably want to hold onto some of his nuclear capability, conceal that from us? Probably so. We're going to know here pretty soon. Because, you know, what happens is we know where most of their nuclear facilities are and their ballistic missiles. But we don't know where all of it is.BARTIROMO: Right.KEANE: They're going to have to voluntarily give that to us, Maria. And when we see the details of that, we'll know whether they're telling us the truth enough. Because we're going to go some of it is right and some of it it's wrong, we can challenge him on it.BARTIROMO: What is your take about the suspension of the August war games with South Korea? North Korea and China have long viewed these military exercises as quite provocative but then after the president says we're going to suspend them, a lot of debate about readiness, should we be suspending this military exercises? What do you think about the president's pledge to end them?KEANE: Well, first of all, the training that goes on among the South Korean military and the United States military every single day is not affected by this one. The regular individual collective training that's being done is going to continue. This exercises is largely what we refer to in the military, Maria, a command post exercise. Largely without maneuver troops. It's done for the headquarters to practice the decision making process that involves a campaign of war. And then they're assessed and evaluated on that. We do another one in the spring where we bring all the troops together, air power and the rest of it. That exercise has -- the second one has not been suspended. He's doing -- he's canceled the first one or suspended it based on good faith by the North Koreans and its condition based. (INAUDIBLE) I'm not as concerned about it as some others. I don't believe that combined arms training between South Korea and North Korea is going to go down the tube because of one command post exercise that we're not going to do.BARTIROMO: Yes.KEANE: But I -- in a few months Maria, we're going to have an answer. Whether these guys are serious about the communicated that they signed with President Trump.BARTIROMO: Yes.KEANE: Probably not enough time to put that exercise back on the burner but certainly not to -- suspend anymore. And I totally disagree with the thought of reducing our troops in South Korea. Not even -- we shouldn't have a discussion of that until they have voluntarily given up their missiles and their nuclear weapons.BARTIROMO: Yes, I sort of -- I sort of expected you to say that. That's been a debate as well.Let me ask you, general, we're watching this market selloff today. The market is down 300 plus points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average because the president has asked the U.S. trade representative Mr. Lighthizer to identify $200 billion of additional products that could be tariffed at 10 percent coming out of China. Markets are worried about this. How do you see it?KEANE: Well, I just think it's high time that somebody push back on the economic warfare and economic aggression that China has been using globally, not just in their region, but around the world and the United States is standing up to that.BARTIROMO: Yes.KEANE: And this imbalance we have I think is worth doing something about and it's certainly worth taking on the intellectual property theft that's been going on, the greatest transfer of wealth from one country to another in the history of the planet.BARTIROMO: Yes.KEANE: I mean, it's got to come to a halt. I mean, in an agreement with the president. We've got to do something about the fairness of this and stop --BARTIROMO: Yes.KEANE: -- taking this the way we have been doing. And I certainly there's some risk involved here. And the advisors he has around him know more about that economic risk than I do in terms of financial markets and what it may do to the engine of the economy.BARTIROMO: Yes, you know, I agree with you. I wrote a whole op-ed on it. The crown jewels are the most important for China and you know, they want our crown jewels. They want our technology.KEANE: Yes.BARTIROMO: But the question is, is tariff the way to do it? I don't know what else -- what other tools the administration has but certainly this is -- this is an aggressive one. We'll be watching it. General, it's always wonderful to see you. Come back soon, please.KEANE: OK, Maria. Take care.BARTIROMO: General Jack Kean joining us. Coming back in business, retail sales are surging. Americans are shopping again. Have you looked at Macy's stock recently? We break down what this really means amid the U.S.- China trade war.Then, you could be the very first to experience Disney's new Pixar Pier. It's going to cost you though. We will tell you how much you might have to cough up for this VIP experience, right here, next.BARTIROMO: Take a look at Futures. We are looking at a serious selloff at the start of trading this morning. The Dow Industrials are down 360 points right now, down 1.5 percent, the S&P better than one percent. Does as the NASDAQ sharp selloff this morning on worries over trade with the president asking to identify an additional $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to tariff. We will watch the developments here.Meanwhile, the founder of JetBlue reportedly planning to launch another new low cost airline. Cheryl Casone with it now on headlines, Cheryl.CASONE: It's interesting for JetBlue founder David Neeleman is reportedly working to raise a $100 million to start a new lower cost carrier. The airline's going to be named Moxie. It's expected to debut by 2020. But Neeleman launched JetBlue in 2000. But he left the company in 2007. Now, he may be targeting his former company as well as another rival, Southwest Airlines. Well, taking a look at shares of JetBlue, down about 14 percent so far this year.Well, we are learning more about the upcoming IPO for B.J.'s wholesale club. According to a regulatory filing, the company's going to offer 37.5 million shares. What you're expected to be priced between $15.00 and $17.00 each. That would value B.J.'s wholesale at more than two billion. The company taken private back in 2011. But they filed to go public again last month. The stock will trade on the New York Stock Exchange. (INAUDIBLE) resembles is going to be B.J.All right, this is interesting. Disney is offering their fans a sneak peek at its new Pixar Pier in Los Angeles. This is a new attraction. It's opening up on Friday. $299 if you want to get in there. Die hards can attend a six hour preview on Thursday, but again, $299 that charge are more. And also this is interesting. The journal is reporting that Disney is basically testing out a new pricing system in the middle of all of this. It would price -- prices would fluctuate with demand for its parks. I mean, they want to keep the parks full but they don't want high prices and long lines to keep people away. So, we'll see if that's kind of the future. Shares of Disney are lower in the premarket. And obviously with all the hit movies, whether it's "Frozen" or "Star Wars", there's a theme park for that, Maria.BARTIROMO: There's a theme park for that too. You're right. Thanks, Cheryl.Coming up, shop until you drop, retail sales have been surging as Americans are shopping once again online, in stores and everywhere in between. We break down what that really means as gasoline prices are rising and the tariff threat is looming. Will the consumer slow down as some are predicting? Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Americans are getting back to spending money big, take a look. Retail sales are up eight, 10 of a percent in May. Remember, we got that number last week. Spending is up nearly six percent from a year ago. Joining us now is the author of Retire Inspired and Ramsey Solutions financial expert, Chris Hogan. Chris, good to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.CHRIS HOGAN, FINANCIAL EXPERT, RAMSEY SOLUTIONS: Well, thank you.BARTIROMO: So, you take -- you look at this as a bump-up in spending and retail sales. What does that mean in terms of our overall financial picture?HOGAN: Well, Maria, I think it's a strong indicator of the strength of the economy but also the job rate is -- unemployment is very, very low. So, people are very confident. The problem is that this confidence can relate to overspending when you start to look at retail sales. The increased spending in restaurants, home improvement stores, all indicates that it's summertime and for a lot of people they're unplugging and they're clueless as to what's going on financially for themselves and their future.BARTIROMO: Yes, it's funny that we've been talking about this, Dagen. We've been talking about a slowdown in the consumer. Stephanie Pomboy one of our regular guest, our favorite economist, has been saying that the consumer is showing weakness. And then you got that, low at number last week on retail sales and then you look at like Macy's stock among others, it's doubled in the last couple weeks.MCDOWELL: In the Wall Street Journal writes about today the rising level of economic confidence among lower income Americans. There has been a jump, a big jump in confidence among the bottom third of consumers followed in the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index. And Chris, a lot of that is its higher wages. We've talked about just as an example, Chick- fil-A, the minimum wage out in California with one operator is going to be $15.00. But it's also this extraordinary low unemployment for all Americans at this point with a record low for black Americans.HOGAN: Well, it is. And Dagen, I agree. I mean, the confidence unfortunately gets equated to the stuff that we buy. You know, it's summertime. So, people want to enjoy. They start to get this desert mentality that they worked hard to get here to summer and they want to have some fun and enjoy it. And listen, I'm fine with people buying stuff as long as they have the money. But if you don't have the money, it means you can't afford it. So using any kind of tool of debt is dangerous. It's putting yourself in a financial hole that can take you months, maybe years to dig out from.BARTIROMO: Yes, that's true. But what about longer term? I mean, longer term -- you need to plan in place as you hear what we say. You need a plan in place for what you want for your future and how to pay for it.HOGAN: You really do. And having that plan means that you've sat down and actually taken the time to think about what is your financial reality right now, where do you stand? How much debt do you have? Are you following the spending plan such as a budget? Do you have awareness? And I think Maria, when people sit down and they start to look at this and understand, if where they are isn't where they want to be, then they have to start to make some changes. You have to start to put a plan in place. The government's not going to save you. News reports aren't going to save you. You have to get intentional for yourself and your family.BARTIROMO: All right, we will leave it there.MCDOWELL: By the way, real quick, Chick-fil-A it's $17.00 to $18.00 an hour, not $15.00. So, I want to check that.BARTIROMO: (INAUDIBLE) it's that much more, 17 to 18.MCDOWELL: And you know what? Every dollar matters, Chris. We both know that. So, if I get stuff wrong, I'll fess up.BARTIROMO: Well, thank you for that. Chris, good to see you, sir. Thank you so much.HOGAN: Thank you for having me.BARTIROMO: You know, it appears to me that this market is obviously reacting to these most recent comments from the president on a list. But this is only a threat. Let's not forget. I mean, the markets are down 334 points. We'll see what actually materializes.MCDOWELL: It's a nine -- more than 9-year-old bull market with very high valuations.BARTIROMO: There you go.BELL: And anxious investors, fragility.BARTIROMO: More to come, right here, MORNINGS WITH MARIA. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, June 19th.

This vegetarian company wants to disrupt China's pork industryCNNMoney.comApril 15, 2018 Sunday 1:41 AM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: SMALLBUSINESSLength: 617 wordsByline: Sherisse PhamBodyDavid Yeung wants to take a bite out of China's massive meat market.When the founder of Green Common, a vegetarian grocery store and casual dining chain in Hong Kong, started bringing plant-based burgers and other meatless products to Asia, he saw an opportunity."One of the most consumed meats in the world is actually overlooked -- that is pork," Yeung told CNNMoney.Yeung on Monday launched a new product called omnipork which he hopes will change people's diets in mainland China, the world's largest consumer of pork. Omnipork is made from soy, pea, mushroom and rice proteins, but it tries to mimic the taste and feel of real pork.Yeung's company -- Right Treat -- is currently seeking approval from Chinese regulators and expects to start selling omnipork in mainland China before the end of the year.In China, pork is a beloved meat: the Chinese character for family is a pig under a roof. Until recently, the country's growing ranks of middle class consumers had fueled a massive rise in pork consumption.People in China will eat about 56 million tons of pork this year, more than any other country, according to US Department of Agriculture estimates.But demand may be peaking. Last year, overall pork consumption in China hit a three-year low of 54.8 million tons.The dip came after the Chinese government issued dietary guidelines in 2016, outlining a plan to cut meat consumption in half. An official campaign included commercials featuring actor and former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzeneggar encouraging Chinese people to eat less meat to help the planet.Yeung hopes to tap into China's changing diets, but it's still a lofty goal to convince people who grew up chowing down on pork dumplings and sweet-and-sour pork to choose meatless alternatives.He compares his ambitions to what Starbucks has achieved in China."China has never been a coffee drinking country. For the last 5,000 years, Chinese people drink tea," he said. "But what Starbucks has done is they create a lifestyle, and it is aspirational, it's about much more than what is inside the cup, it is everything around it."Yeung is joining other startups that are looking to shake up the global meat industry. They include Beyond Meat, which is bankrolled by actor Leonardo di Caprio, Microsoft founder Bill Gates and agricultural giant Tyson Foods.Yeung is also an investor in Beyond Meat and brought its meatless burger and other products to Hong Kong. He said his company saw sales of Beyond Meat grow fourfold in one year, and there are plans to take it to mainland China by the end of the year.Impossible Foods, a startup behind a meatless burger that bleeds, launched in Hong Kong last week, its first international market.But Yeung says those startups' products generally appeal to Western palates. He made omnipork specifically for Asian dishes, enlisting a Michelin star chef -- Li Yuet Faat at Ming Court -- to tackle a few Chinese staples.At first, Li said he wasn't sure what to do with omnipork. Eventually, he decided to try using it for xiaolong bao, steamed soup dumplings typically stuffed with pork. It took the chef and his team several tries before they finally made a version with omnipork that they were ready to serve.This CNNMoney reporter and three colleagues did a blind test of omnipork soup dumplings alongside regular ones -- and everyone could taste the difference. But everyone also agreed that the omnipork soup dumplings were still tasty. Li will also roll out a sweet-and-sour pork dish using omnipork in June."You can use this ingredient many ways, steam it, cook it, fry it, pan fry it, stuff it in dumplings, meatballs," Yeung said. "This is something that we want to be really all purpose."Load-Date: April 25, 2018End of Document

China&#39;s Retaliation Has Arrived: Tariffs on 106 Products Impacting $ 50 BillionCE Noticias Financieras EnglishApril 4, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 410 wordsBody       China was quick to respond. Following the list of 1,300 Chinese products that are going to have additional tariffs to enter the US, the Chinese Government responded with a list of only 106 products, but of equal value.  China's response to the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration has arrived. This Wednesday, April 4, the Chinese Executive has unveiled a list of 106 US products that will be subject to additional tariffs to enter the Chinese market. The number of products is well below the list of 1,300 goods presented by the United States, but the import value range is intended to be the same: 50 billion dollars. The information is being advanced by the Xinhua and Bloomberg news agencies.  Both agencies cite a statement from the Chinese Finance Minister, adding that the additional tariffs on the 106 North American products listed will be 25%. Xinhua reports that there are 14 categories of goods, including products such as soybeans, automobiles and chemicals. Bloomberg corroborates this information, adding that airlines are also included in the list.  The date of implementation of these tariffs will depend on the arrival in the field of the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, of equal value, on Chinese products.  In a statement issued on Wednesday, Zhang Xiangchen, the Chinese representative to the World Trade Organization, called the plans of the United States "an intentional and gross breach of the WTO's fundamental principles of non-discrimination and tariff capping."  "The United States has this vicious intent to strangle China's high-tech innovation," said Wei Jianguo, a former deputy Chinese trade minister and current chairman of a trade-related think tank dedicated to the executive in statements to Bloomberg. "China will not be subjected to US bullying. Our countermeasures will reach their weaknesses," he promised.  For their part, the US argues that the choice of products is justified by the fact that the sectors concerned benefit from state subsidies, which they consider to be unfair. Trump's administration list includes aerospace goods, information and communication technologies, robotics, machinery. There are also satellites, steel components for televisions, medical appliances, dishwashers, among many others.  The list of goods will be in public consultation for 60 days, and may be submitted amendments until 11 May. On 15 May there will be a public hearing to discuss the contributions. Load-Date: April 4, 2018End of Document

Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi is going after EuropeCNN WireJune 12, 2018 Tuesday 10:50 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 726 wordsByline: By Sherisse PhamDateline: HONG KONG (CNNMoney) BodyHONG KONG (CNNMoney) --  First, it conquered India. Now, it wants to win over Europe. Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi is making an aggressive play for European markets like France, Italy and Spain. The expansion comes ahead of the company's highly anticipated IPO, which is expected to raise billions of dollars this summer. Xiaomi is best known for selling cheap, high performance smartphones. The bulk of its sales - more than 70% - are in China. But it has made inroads in other Asian countries, recently overtaking global leader Samsung to become the top smartphone seller in India.Now, the Chinese company is looking to repeat that success in the more mature markets of Europe, and it's off to a strong start. Xiaomi is currently the fourth largest smartphone company in Europe, behind Samsung, Apple and Chinese rival Huawei, according to research firms IDC and Canalys. It's competing strongly in Spain, Greece and Russia. Impressive growthFrancisco Jeronimo, a London-based analyst with IDC, said the buzz surrounding Xiaomi in Europe reminds him of the early success of the iPhone."I haven't seen any other vendor able to attract and push demand from consumers directly like Xiaomi is doing now and Apple did in the past," he said. Xiaomi is riding the momentum, launching in France and Italy with splashy new stores in Paris and Milan late last month. Although the company has achieved rapid growth, it's not nipping at the heels of the top players yet. According to Canalys, Xiaomi sold 2.4 million phones in Europe last quarter, far fewer than Samsung's 15.2 million, Apple's 10.2 million and Huawei's 7.4 million. "It doesn't seem like a huge amount at the moment, but the rate they're expanding is impressive, considering it's been less than a year" since Xiaomi entered the European market, said Ben Stanton, a Canalys analyst based in the United Kingdom. Can it win over carriers? Maintaining that growth rate, especially in countries like France and the United Kingdom, will depend a great deal on Xiaomi's relationships with wireless carriers. As many as 50% of consumers in western European buy their smartphones through carriers, according to IDC.Forging ties with European carriers is more complicated than Xiaomi's preferred strategy of selling phones directly through online sales, retailers or its own stores. For one thing, Xiaomi wants to keep prices low, announcing last year that it would cap smartphone profit margins at 5%. So the margins Xiaomi is offering carriers "are not very good," making them wary of partnering with the company, according to Jeronimo. Xiaomi will also have to make alterations to its phones, which will increase production costs. "If it wants to work with carriers, it has to learn to do things like SIM-locking phones, which has to be done in factory," Stanton said. Half the price of an iPhoneXiaomi appears willing to adapt to the different markets, partnering with CK Hutchison's mobile carrier network Three last month. Under the deal, Xiaomi phones will be sold in Three's stores in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Austria, Italy, Denmark and Sweden. Xiaomi has so far succeeded in Europe by wrestling market share away from other low- and mid-range smartphone makers; the vast majority of phones it sells in Europe cost less than (EURO)200 ($235). "What consumers want is a device that looks like an iPhone, performs like an iPhone, but is half the price of an iPhone ... and Xiaomi has been able to nail it," Jeronimo said. In the next year, analysts predict Xiaomi will focus on expanding into as many European markets as possible, and eventually start pushing pricier smartphones.Is the US next?Xiaomi is also interested in the United States - CEO Lei Jun has previously said he wants Xiaomi to make its US debut by early next year. But that could be a tougher challenge than Europe. Major Chinese smartphone makers Huawei and ZTE have faced significant challenges in the United States, including accusations from government agencies that their devices could pose security risks because of ties to the Chinese government. Huawei and ZTE dispute the claims.Xiaomi hopes to avoid that fate, and could use success in Europe to help shape its strategy for the United States. "Europe is the stepping stone," Stanton said.TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Bruins, Flames going to China as NHL continues outreachAssociated Press InternationalMay 3, 2018 Thursday 1:07 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: SPORTS NEWSLength: 825 wordsByline: By STEPHEN WHYNO, AP Hockey WriterBodyThe NHL is staging more exhibition games in China this fall, hoping to make further inroads in establishing hockey as a sport in the world's most populous nation.The Boston Bruins and Calgary Flames will face off Sept. 15 in Shenzhen in southeast China and then again Sept. 19 in Beijing in the second incarnation of the China Games.The Los Angeles Kings and Vancouver Canucks played preseason games in Shanghai and Beijing last September, the NHL's first foray there.China represents an as-yet untapped resource for the NHL, especially ahead of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.Commissioner Gary Bettman has so far been noncommittal about the NHL going to the 2022 Games after skipping South Korea this year, but the work is already underway in China, where the NBA has had a presence for decades."I think there is an enthusiasm to grow the sport, first at the grassroots level, but I think bringing games there and bringing NHL teams there and NHL players helps kind of support the story from the top down, as well," deputy commissioner Bill Daly told The Associated Press by phone Wednesday."It's really a two-pronged approach where you're trying to build hockey infrastructure in a society that's never really had any and then in order to drive that, you're bringing hockey at its highest level so that people can appreciate what the sport can look like."Growing youth hockey and bringing NHL games to China is the plan, but from the league's perspective, it's not a three-pronged approach tied to Olympic participation."I was there in the spring and we had lots of discussions with officials at all levels to talk about the development of hockey and how we can work together, and those are things that we're working on," Bettman said last month."Not once did we get asked about the Olympics in 2022. I'm not sure if we're helping develop the game particularly at the grassroots level and giving them our software, if you will, whether or not we play for two weeks makes a difference."The league is working with local authorities to develop hockey programs as the government of the country with a population of 1.3 billion aims to have 300 million participants in winter sports by 2022. The Bruins made visits each of the past two summers to participate in hockey camps."Over the past three years we have collaborated with (businessman Zhou Yunjie) on growing the game both within the Chinese community in Boston and with youth hockey players in China," Bruins president Cam Neely said."We look forward to continuing these efforts by bringing Bruins hockey to China with these two preseason games."Shenzhen's location close to Hong Kong, its burgeoning population and its world-class facility that's home to the two China-based Canadian Women's Hockey League teams made it a natural fit along with Beijing for NHL preseason action. More cities are in the running in the future, which could at some point include regular-season games."Part of it is exposing the sport in different major cities throughout the country," Daly said."These games over the next number of years are going to hit different locations, and we'll see what's worked well and what can be improved and it's very much kind of a learning process for us."Hockey in China is one big learning process, and the NHL is in the early stages of its assistance.China is ramping up its hockey programs with an eye toward the 2022 Olympics, but that doesn't mean the NHL is a sure thing to go. Daly said the league sees hockey in China and the NHL at the Beijing Olympics as mutually exclusive."Our philosophy is one that isn't necessarily connected to the other," Daly said. "I don't think the fact that we want to grow our presence in China and grow hockey's presence in China necessarily means we have to be in the Olympics. But it doesn't necessarily preclude us from being there if ultimately we want to be."Bettman noted that Germany reached the gold medal game at the non-NHL Olympics in February, and wondered if staying out would actually be beneficial."Maybe the Chinese would have more success in 2022 in being competitive if we're not there," Bettman said. "A lot of variables to be considered."One of those variables that could help the NHL return to the Olympics for the sixth time would be the Chinese government pushing for it.

Bruins, Flames going to China as NHL continues outreachAssociated Press State & LocalMay 3, 2018 Thursday 1:07 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: SPORTS NEWSLength: 825 wordsByline: By STEPHEN WHYNO, AP Hockey WriterBodyThe NHL is staging more exhibition games in China this fall, hoping to make further inroads in establishing hockey as a sport in the world's most populous nation.The Boston Bruins and Calgary Flames will face off Sept. 15 in Shenzhen in southeast China and then again Sept. 19 in Beijing in the second incarnation of the China Games.The Los Angeles Kings and Vancouver Canucks played preseason games in Shanghai and Beijing last September, the NHL's first foray there.China represents an as-yet untapped resource for the NHL, especially ahead of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.Commissioner Gary Bettman has so far been noncommittal about the NHL going to the 2022 Games after skipping South Korea this year, but the work is already underway in China, where the NBA has had a presence for decades."I think there is an enthusiasm to grow the sport, first at the grassroots level, but I think bringing games there and bringing NHL teams there and NHL players helps kind of support the story from the top down, as well," deputy commissioner Bill Daly told The Associated Press by phone Wednesday."It's really a two-pronged approach where you're trying to build hockey infrastructure in a society that's never really had any and then in order to drive that, you're bringing hockey at its highest level so that people can appreciate what the sport can look like."Growing youth hockey and bringing NHL games to China is the plan, but from the league's perspective, it's not a three-pronged approach tied to Olympic participation."I was there in the spring and we had lots of discussions with officials at all levels to talk about the development of hockey and how we can work together, and those are things that we're working on," Bettman said last month."Not once did we get asked about the Olympics in 2022. I'm not sure if we're helping develop the game particularly at the grassroots level and giving them our software, if you will, whether or not we play for two weeks makes a difference."The league is working with local authorities to develop hockey programs as the government of the country with a population of 1.3 billion aims to have 300 million participants in winter sports by 2022. The Bruins made visits each of the past two summers to participate in hockey camps."Over the past three years we have collaborated with (businessman Zhou Yunjie) on growing the game both within the Chinese community in Boston and with youth hockey players in China," Bruins president Cam Neely said."We look forward to continuing these efforts by bringing Bruins hockey to China with these two preseason games."Shenzhen's location close to Hong Kong, its burgeoning population and its world-class facility that's home to the two China-based Canadian Women's Hockey League teams made it a natural fit along with Beijing for NHL preseason action. More cities are in the running in the future, which could at some point include regular-season games."Part of it is exposing the sport in different major cities throughout the country," Daly said."These games over the next number of years are going to hit different locations, and we'll see what's worked well and what can be improved and it's very much kind of a learning process for us."Hockey in China is one big learning process, and the NHL is in the early stages of its assistance.China is ramping up its hockey programs with an eye toward the 2022 Olympics, but that doesn't mean the NHL is a sure thing to go. Daly said the league sees hockey in China and the NHL at the Beijing Olympics as mutually exclusive."Our philosophy is one that isn't necessarily connected to the other," Daly said. "I don't think the fact that we want to grow our presence in China and grow hockey's presence in China necessarily means we have to be in the Olympics. But it doesn't necessarily preclude us from being there if ultimately we want to be."Bettman noted that Germany reached the gold medal game at the non-NHL Olympics in February, and wondered if staying out would actually be beneficial."Maybe the Chinese would have more success in 2022 in being competitive if we're not there," Bettman said. "A lot of variables to be considered."One of those variables that could help the NHL return to the Olympics for the sixth time would be the Chinese government pushing for it. Sochi was an example of that."I think it could happen, but even if that was something that they weighed in on, I'm not sure at the end of the day that would be a determining factor for us," Daly said."I think there are a whole host of factors. It's not just about kind of the conditions under which we go. It's all the other things that are associated with Olympic participation, including what's happening back here in North America."___Sports Deputy Editor for Newsgathering Howie Rumberg in New York contributed.___Follow Hockey Writer Stephen Whyno on Twitter at https://twitter.com/SWhyno___More NHL hockey: https://apnews.com/tag/NHLhockeyLoad-Date: May 3, 2018End of Document

How is the technology that China applies to &quot;read the mind&quot; in its industry and its ArmyCE Noticias Financieras EnglishApril 30, 2018 MondayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 401 wordsBody Chinese technology firms with government support are developing "mind-reading" systems capable of determining the emotional state of a person, which are already applied in factories, hospitals, trains or even in the army, reports the South newspaper Monday. China Morning Post.  Although other countries like the United States have similar technologies, China is the first that has given them a practical use and so extensive, highlights the Hong Kong newspaper, which warns that these advances pose ethical dilemmas.  To "read the mind" small wireless sensors are used in contact with the head, often hidden under helmets or caps, which constantly monitor the brain waves of the subject and send data to computers that use artificial intelligence algorithms to measure them.  This allows to detect emotions such as depression, anxiety and anger, something that is used for example in the Chinese high speed railways: if one of these sensors discovers that the driver feels drowsy, an alarm goes off in the cabin.  Its use has also been extended to factories and industrial centers, according to the newspaper, which gives as examples the Zhongheng Electric telecommunications equipment production line, in Hangzhou (east), or the electric company of that same city, facilities where an error human can cause many economic losses.  "When the system issues a warning, the boss asks his employee to take a day off or move him to a less critical position, some jobs require high concentration and no mistakes," explains the professor of neuroscience and cognitive psychology. Jin Jia, from the University of Ningbo (east).  This university is one of the main research centers for brain reading technologies, through its Neuro Cap project, funded by the Chinese Government.  This type of sensors have also been used in Chinese military operations, they confirmed from the project, although they did not give more details given the secrecy that usually surrounds the Chinese Armed Forces.  Responsible for these programs in China recognize the fear that reading minds can arouse in many, as well as other technologies that the country is developing, such as facial recognition systems.  "They think we can read their minds, which causes them discomfort and resistance at first, but after a while they get used to the device, which looks like a safety helmet," Professor Jin Jia told the South China Morning Post. Load-Date: April 30, 2018End of Document

China threatens tariffs on US lobsters as business boomsAssociated Press InternationalJune 16, 2018 Saturday 2:44 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 532 wordsByline: By PATRICK WHITTLE, Associated PressDateline: PORTLAND, Maine BodyPORTLAND, Maine (AP) - A set of retaliatory tariffs released by China on Friday includes a plan to tax American lobster exports, potentially jeopardizing one of the biggest markets for the premium seafood.Chinese officials announced the planned lobster tariff along with hundreds of other tariffs amid the country's escalating trade fight with the United States. China said it wants to place new duties on items such as farm products, autos and seafood starting on July 6.The announcement could have major ramifications for the U.S. seafood industry and for the economy of the state of Maine, which is home to most of the country's lobster fishery. China's interest in U.S. lobster has grown exponentially in recent years, and selling to China has become a major focus of the lobster industry."Maine's lobster industry is an irreplaceable piece of our state's economy that supports thousands of jobs and entire coastal communities," the state's congressional delegation said in a statement. "Just two weeks ago, the Maine delegation heard directly from our state's lobster industry about the economic hardship a trade war with China would cause them."The delegation - Republican Sen. Susan Collins, Independent Sen. Angus King; Democratic Rep. Chellie Pingree and Republican Rep. Bruce Poliquin - said they plan to outline their concerns to federal trade officials."Hopefully cooler heads can prevail and we can get a solution," said Matt Jacobson, executive director of the Maine Lobster Marketing Collaborative. "It's a year round customer in China. This isn't good news at all."A Chinese government website on Friday posted a list of seafood products that will be subject to the tariffs, and it included live, fresh and frozen lobster. The website stated that the items would be taxed at 25 percent.The announcement came in response to President Donald Trump's own increase in tariffs on Chinese imports in America. The Republican president announced a 25 percent tariff on up to $50 billion worth of Chinese goods on Friday.The news raised alarms around the Maine lobster industry, as China's an emerging market for U.S. lobster, which has gained popularity with the growing middle class. Maine lobster was worth more than $430 million at the docks last year, and the industry is a critical piece of the state's economy, history and heritage.The U.S. isn't the only country in the lobster trade. Canada also harvests the same species of lobster and is a major trading partner with China."Anything that affects the supply chain is obviously not a great thing," said Kristan Porter, president of the Maine Lobstermen's Association. "The lobstermen obviously are concerned with trade and where they go."The value of China's American lobster imports grew from $108.3 million in 2016 to $142.4 million last year. The country barely imported any American lobster a decade ago.China and the U.S. are major seafood trading partners beyond just lobster, and the new tariffs would apply to dozens of products that China imports from the U.S., including salmon, tuna and crab. The U.S. imported more than $2.7 billion in Chinese seafood last year, and the U.S. exported more than $1.3 billion to China.Load-Date: June 16, 2018End of Document

Micron Investors Shouldn't Fret About China -- For NowRealMoneyJune 5, 2018 Tuesday 6:51 PM EDTCopyright 2018 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 898 wordsByline: Eric JhonsaHighlight: While a new DRAM price-fixing probe likely won't do serious damage, Beijing's attempt to create a large domestic memory industry bears watching.BodyFor a couple of reasons, investors in Micron  -- and for that matter, DRAM rivals Samsung and SK Hynix -- probably don't need to worry too much about the Chinese government's price-fixing probe.However, Beijing's clear long-term desire to reduce, if not break, the market power wielded by the DRAM industry's big-3 is certainly worth keeping an eye on. Even if it's the kind of effort that could take several years or more to have a big impact on DRAM industry profits.On Monday,  that Chinese regulators had begun probing Micron, Samsung and Hynix over allegations of price-fixing. All three companies have reported getting visits from regulators, and a South Korean ministry has issued a statement calling on Beijing to provide fair treatment to Samsung and Hynix.It's not hard to figure out why China might be displeased with the DRAM industry status quo: DRAM prices skyrocketed in 2017, and (though price increases have moderated in 2018) remain far above their late-2016 lows. That has done wonders for the top and bottom lines of the big-3 -- Micron's DRAM revenue rose 76% annually during its February quarter, and was responsible for the lion's share of the $3.5 billion in net income it reported -- but hasn't been so wonderful for the many Chinese electronics makers that buy from them.Throw in the success that Beijing has seen in some other battles large foreign tech companies -- for example,  lower 3G/4G royalty rates from Qualcomm  -- and it's understandable why some investors could be on edge about the price-fixing probe.But proving that overt price-fixing occurred could prove tricky. While the DRAM price surge seen over the last 18 months does have a lot to do with the efforts of DRAM makers to keep a lid on supply growth, no evidence has surfaced to date indicating that they directly colluded with each other to fix prices.What appears to have happened, rather, is that the Micron, Samsung and Hynix each followed the public disclosures that the other two made (via earnings calls and other events) about how much they plan to grow their DRAM bit shipments. And with those disclosures in mind, the companies made sure their own future DRAM investments wouldn't lead to industry supply exceeding demand.That kind of behavior naturally isn't going to sit well with customers that have to contend with higher prices because of it. But that doesn't make it illegal.The other reason China is unlikely to crack down too hard on the big-3: Its massive electronics manufacturing/export industry can't afford to see any major disruption to its DRAM supplies. For all their understandable gripes about higher DRAM prices, the likes of Foxconn, Huawei and Pegatron would rather contend with higher prices than any disruption to hardware output caused by a crackdown -- for example, if the big-3 responded to Chinese DRAM price controls by giving priority to shipments made to other regions.Political considerations could also affect how China acts in the near-term. Beijing is offering to take major steps to narrow its trade surplus with the U.S., should the Trump Administration abandon its plans to impose new tariffs on Chinese goods. Needless to say, an attempt to seriously crack down on Micron wouldn't mesh with such an effort.For all these reasons, the price-fixing probe could ultimately end in a settlement that amounts to a slap on the wrist. One that could yield, for example, moderate price cuts and a commitment to keep prices from rapidly growing in the future, rather than any massive reduction in prices.On the other hand,  to become a major DRAM producer -- part of a broader effort to grow its domestic chip industry -- might eventually make life a lot tougher for Micron, Samsung and Hynix. A pair of local chipmakers, JHICC and Innotron Memory, are promising to begin volume production of DRAM in late 2018 and early 2019, respectively. State-run Tsinghua Unigroup, which one showed buyout interest Micron before political opposition made it think twice, is also promising to make large memory fab investments.However, for now, JHICC and Innotron plan to rely on 22-nanometer manufacturing processes that are easily less advanced than Micron, Samsung and Hynix's cutting-edge processes. Catching up with the big-3 from a technology standpoint -- both with regards to manufacturing processes and other fields -- will be challenging, and could be complicated by U.S. export controls on chip manufacturing equipment.In addition, it looks as if both firms' DRAM output will be a small fraction of that of the big-3 in 2018 and 2019, even if they don't see any delays (hardly a given). Innotron, for its part, is aiming for a modest initial capacity of 10,000 DRAM wafer starts per month.However, with Chinese authorities committing billions in funding to growing the local memory industry, the story might be very different in a few years' time. Particularly -- as Bernstein analyst Mark Newman  -- if Beijing can leverage its price-fixing probe to obtain technology transfers that strengthen the competitive standing of local players.Considering how many billions in long-term profits are at stake here for Micron and its peers, this is a story that deserves close monitoring, even if there's no need for panic at such an early juncture. Especially since markets could start pricing in the impact of a Chinese DRAM production surge well before it happens.Load-Date: June 6, 2018End of Document

Man charged in Sweden for spying on Tibetans on behalf of ChinaCNN.comApril 12, 2018 Thursday 7:03 AM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: EUROPELength: 607 wordsByline: By James Griffiths, CNNBodySweden has charged a 49-year-old Tibetan man with spying on fellow exiles on behalf of Beijing.The man -- who has not been named -- is suspected of gathering information about exiles' family relationships, addresses, political affiliations and meetings with the intent to "pass this information to representatives of the Chinese state," authorities said Wednesday, according to CNN affiliate Expressen.Prosecutor Mats Ljungqvist said the man's alleged spying occurred between July 2015 and February 2017, and the information was transmitted to Chinese officials in Poland and Finland.Ljungqvist said the man was himself of Tibetan descent and had been spying "for a long time, and may have caused or may cause a large number of persons serious harm."China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement Thursday it was "not aware of the situation." Swedish authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Jamyang Choedon, president of the Tibetan Community in Sweden organization, told CNN many in the community were left feeling "very, very scared" by the news."We were all shocked," she said. "There are only about 140 Tibetans in Sweden. That the (Chinese government) is sending a spy for just 140 people is almost comical."But many exiles still have family in Tibet, she added, and they could be at risk if they were deemed to be engaged in activities critical of Beijing.Swedish citizen still in custodyAlleged spying by China on Swedish residents could further damage relations between Stockholm and Beijing, which were already damaged by the continued detention of Swedish citizen Gui Minhai.Gui, one of several Hong Kong-based booksellers detained by China since 2014, was seized by plainclothes police on a train in January in front of Swedish diplomats."The brutal intervention in January against a Swedish support operation was conducted in spite of repeated assurances from the Chinese authorities that Mr. Gui was free at that time," Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom said in February after Beijing confirmed it had detained Gui."The current situation also raises questions about the application of the rule of law, including the prohibition of arbitrary deprivation of liberty. We demand that our citizen be given the opportunity to meet Swedish diplomatic and medical staff, and that he be released so that he can be reunited with his daughter and family."Gui, 53, who wrote and published numerous titles critical of the Communist leadership, was traveling to Beijing to be examined by a Swedish doctor at the embassy when he was taken, his daughter Angela told Radio Sweden last month.Cyber espionageSwedish media reported on the arrest of a man last year for similar spying activities.Tibetan exiles in Sweden have long complained of surveillance and harassment from China, which regards the community with suspicion, accusing them of supporting separatists within Tibet.The Tibetan community in India -- where the majority of exiles live -- has been targeted for over a decade by cyber espionage operations most analysts link to China.In January, the Toronto-based Citizen Lab uncovered a hacking operation that "ran for 19 months, and which targeted the Tibetan community, and potentially other groups including ethnic minorities, social movements related to China, a media group, and government agencies in South and Southeast Asia."Choedon said she was aware of the hacking risk, but said it was just one element in a broader intimidation campaign against Tibetans abroad."Even though they are living in a free country, still they cannot really enjoy their full free democratic rights," she said.Load-Date: April 13, 2018End of Document

We demand that our citizen be given the opportunity to meet Swedish diplomatic and medical staff, and that he be released so that he can be reunited with his daughter and family."Gui, 53, who wrote and published numerous titles critical of the Communist leadership, was traveling to Beijing to be examined by a Swedish doctor at the embassy when he was taken, his daughter Angela told Radio Sweden last month.Cyber espionage Swedish media reported on the arrest of a man last year for similar spying activities. Tibetan exiles in Sweden have long complained of surveillance and harassment from China, which regards the community with suspicion, accusing them of supporting separatists within Tibet. The Tibetan community in India -- where the majority of exiles live -- has been targeted for over a decade by cyber espionage operations most analysts link to China. In January, the Toronto-based Citizen Lab uncovered a hacking operation that "ran for 19 months, and which targeted the Tibetan community, and potentially other groups including ethnic minorities, social movements related to China, a media group, and government agencies in South and Southeast Asia." Choedon said she was aware of the hacking risk, but said it was just one element in a broader intimidation campaign against Tibetans abroad. "Even though they are living in a free country, still they cannot really enjoy their full free democratic rights," she said. CNN's Serenitie Wang and Lauren Kent contributed reporting. TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

And to provide these documents to the U.S. House of Representatives.CHANGES IN EXISTING LAW MADE BY THE BILL, AS REPORTEDH. Res. 898 makes no changes to existing law.DISSENTING VIEWSOn Wednesday, June 6, 2018, the Committee on Homeland Security rejected H. Res. 898, a Resolution of Inquiry directing the Secretary of Homeland Security to transmit certain documents to the House of Representatives regarding Department of Homeland Security (DHS) policies and activities relating to homeland security information produced and disseminated regarding cybersecurity threats posed by the ZTE Corporation, a telecommunications company headquartered in Shenzhen, China.ZTE has a long track record of rejecting international business norms, operating in secrecy, and doing the bidding of the Chinese government. In 2012, ZTE and another Chinese telecommunications equipment manufacturer, Huawei, were the subject of a high-profile investigation by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, which ultimately concluded that "the risks associated with Huawei's and ZTE's provision of equipment to U.S. critical infrastructure could undermine core U.S. national-security interests."1 The report included sweeping recommendations for the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC) to "remain vigilant and focused on this threat . . . [and] actively seek to keep cleared private sector actors as informed of the threat as possible."2 It also directed the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to block acquisitions involving ZTE, and urged private entities to "consider the long-security risks" of doing business with ZTE.31U.S. House of Representatives Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Investigative Report on the U.S. National Security Issues Posed by Chinese Telecommunications Companies Huawei and ZTE, 112th Con. (Oct. 8, 2012), available at https://intelligence.house.gov/sites/ intelligence.house.gov/files/dicynets/huawei- zte%20investigative%20report%20(final).pdf.2Id.3Id.In 2016, the Commerce Department imposed stiff penalties on ZTE for violating U.S. sanctions by making hundreds of shipments of microprocessors, routers, servers and other telecommunications equipment that was made with U.S. parts to Iran, Sudan, North Korea, Syria, and Cuba. In 2017, the Commerce Department entered into a settlement with ZTE where the company agreed to pay fines and punish employees involved in breaching U.S. sanctions or have its export privileges denied for seven years. In April, when the Commerce Department learned that the settlement had been breached, it was forced to bar U.S. companies from exporting to Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE for seven years. In May, the Department of Defense (DOD) announced that it was banning U.S. military bases from selling Huawei and ZTE phones on the grounds that the devices "may pose an unacceptable risk" of spying on soldiers or revealing troop whereabouts,4 and the Federal Communications Commission proposed rules barring small, rural carriers from buying Chinese-made telecommunications equipment.54"Pentagon Orders Stores on Military Bases to Remove Huawei, ZTE Phone," The Wall Street Journal (May 2, 2018), available at https:// www.wsj.com/articles/pentagon-asking-military-bases-to-remove-huawei- zte-phones-1525262076?mod=djemalertNEWS&#38;ns;=prod/accounts-wsj&#38;ns;=prod/ accounts-wsj&#38;ns;=prod/accounts-wsj&#38;ns;=prod/accounts-wsj&#38;ns;=prod/ accounts-wsj&#38;ns;=prod/accounts-wsj.5Federal Communications Commission Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, Protecting Against National Security Threats to the Communications Supply Chain Through FCC Programs, FCC 18-42 (Apr. 18, 2018).Then, inexplicably, on May 13, 2018, President Trump tweeted, without warning or explanation, that he had spoken with President Xi of China and that he was directing the Commerce Department to work to save ZTE and Chinese jobs.6 It is unclear whether the President familiarized himself with the IC's significant concerns about ZTE or whether there was any engagement with the IC or DHS prior to tweeting this new policy on ZTE. What we do know is that two days before the announcement, the Chinese government agreed to help finance the development of a Trump-branded resort property in Indonesia, offering roughly $500 million toward construction of the project. We also know that a day after the President tweeted about easing sanctions on ZTE, the company hired Bryan Lanza, a former Trump Campaign staffer to lobby on its behalf.6Twitter, Donald J. Trump, @realDonaldTrump (May 13, 2018 at 11:01 AM).I introduced this Resolution of Inquiry in response to urgent warnings from national security experts, including the Director of National Intelligence and top officials at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the National Security Agency, among others, that the use of ZTE products could create an access point for the Chinese government to conduct espionage.7 Consideration of H. Res. 898 provided Members of the Committee on Homeland Security with the opportunity to send a strong statement of concern about the direction the Trump Administration is going on this national security matter.7Testimony of Daniel R. Coats, Director of National Intelligence, Michael Pompeo, CIA Director, Adm. Michael Rogers, NSA Director, and Chris Wray, FBI Director, before the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence hearing entitled Worldwide Threats (Feb. 13, 2018).The Resolution of Inquiry would have forced DHS to provide Congress with information to get a better understanding of the implications, particularly the cybersecurity implications, of easing sanctions against ZTE. Given that the Pentagon was in the process of barring the sale of ZTE devices on military bases, it seems reasonable that DHS would have conducted its own investigations and arrived at its own national security conclusions. Unfortunately, the Majority chose to stay silent on this urgent national security issue and unanimously voted to report the measure unfavorably to the House of Representatives. With this vote, the Majority essentially decided to look away as the Trump Administration pursued efforts to relax its punishment of ZTE, discounting the significant national security concerns voiced by DOD, the IC, security experts and U.S. allies. The day after the markup, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross announced that the seven-year ban on ZTE buying American parts would be relaxed, as the company had agreed to pay a $1 billion fine and adopt a new compliance regime.Congress has a responsibility to be a check on the Administration. By voting down H. Res. 898, the Majority chose to sit on the sidelines and let the Trump Administration ease sanctions on a company that DOD, the IC, security experts and U.S. allies believe to be a threat to our national security. As such, I dissent against the Committee's decision to stand in the way of oversight of this urgent national security matter.Bennie G.

Can US-China talks calm global trade war fears?CNNMoney.comJune 1, 2018 Friday 5:46 AM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: ECONOMYLength: 595 wordsByline: Daniel ShaneBodyAs fears of a global trade war escalate, all eyes will be on Beijing this weekend.US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross arrived in the Chinese capital on Saturday for talks with trade negotiators from the world's second-biggest economy.Ross is due to hold meetings on Sunday, before departing Beijing on Monday, a US Commerce Department official told CNN. The official would not provide any more information about the meetingsThe negotiations come after a rocky week during which the United States tore up a tentative trade truce with China and hit Canada, Mexico and the European Union with big tariffs on metal imports. All three will retaliate.What are the talks about?Washington and Beijing have been exchanging threats for months, announcing plans for tariffs on tens of billions of dollars of each others' exports.President Donald Trump wants China to engineer huge cuts in its $375 billion trade surplus in goods with its biggest trading partner.At the last round of talks in Washington, China pledged to significantly boost its purchases of American goods and services.Senior US officials have said that during the Beijing visit, Ross will be seeking commitments on how that will happen in areas such as energy and agriculture.But experts are skeptical that the United States will be able to get China to do enough to significantly close the huge trade gap.Other big US demands may also be on the table.Speaking on Thursday, Ross said the objectives of the Trump administration hadn't changed."Our basic objectives with China are to sell them more product, get less in the way of tariff and non-tariff trade barriers, and then ultimately, and most importantly ... deal with the problems of intellectual property, technology transfers, the whole litany of high-tech things," he told CNBC.The United States is pressing Beijing to move away from industrial policies that critics say subsidize Chinese companies on the global stage and pressure foreign firms to hand over key technologies.US officials are particularly concerned about "Made in China 2025," which seeks to pump hundreds of billions of dollars into high-tech industries like robotics, electric cars and computing with the aim of becoming a global leader in those fields.Analysts say China is unlikely to budge on those plans, which it sees as crucial for developing its huge economy.What could go wrong?The Trump administration upped the stakes ahead of Ross' expected visit by saying Tuesday it planned to forge ahead with tariffs on about $50 billion worth of Chinese goods, as well as measures to restrict Chinese investment in the United States.The move was unexpected, as trade tensions appeared to have eased in recent weeks after both sides said they had agreed to put plans for tariffs on hold while they tried to make progress in negotiations.Analysts at Oxford Economics suggested that the announcement was "aimed at renewing pressure on China ahead of the bilateral talks and the possible North Korea summit," according to a research note this week.The Chinese government said the move went against the recent consensus between the two countries. It reiterated its stance that it doesn't want a trade war but isn't afraid of fighting one.But it has resisted announcing any retaliation so far. A US delegation arrived in Beijing on Wednesday for preliminary talks to establish the outlines for the weekend negotiations.China previously said it could strike back with tariffs on American goods such as soybeans.-- Jethro Mullen, Alanna Petroff, Steven Jiang and Kevin Bohn contributed to this report.Load-Date: June 3, 2018End of Document

China: 'The US has launched a trade war'CNN WireJune 15, 2018 Friday 6:47 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 566 wordsByline: By Mark ThompsonDateline: LONDON (CNNMoney) BodyLONDON (CNNMoney) --  The world's two biggest economies are now at war over trade.China accused the United States of firing the first shot on Friday when the White House said that it would impose tariffs of 25% on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods.The announcement confirms a threat first made by President Donald Trump in March and follows months of trade talks between the two sides. A truce was announced in May, but it proved short-lived. "The United States has kept changing its mind and now launched a trade war," China's Commerce Ministry said in a statement. The Chinese government said it would respond in kind to the US tariffs, which will apply to roughly 1,100 exports and will target China's aerospace, robotics, manufacturing and auto industries."China does not want a trade war," it said, adding that it would "fight back vigorously" in defense of its national interests, globalization and the world trade system."We will immediately launch tariff measures that will match the scale and intensity of those launched by the United States."Beijing also said "all economic and trade agreements reached by previous negotiations will be nullified at the same time." That includes a tentative deal to increase Chinese purchases of US energy and agricultural goods. Like the US tariffs, China's retaliatory tariffs will be rolled out in two waves, the Finance Ministry said. And they will start on the same day.Beijing will impose tariffs on 545 US items worth $34 billion - including agricultural products, automobiles and seafood - starting on July 6. Tariffs on the remaining 114 items, including chemicals, medical equipment and energy products, will start later.The United States is targeting 800 Chinese exports, worth about $34 billion, starting July 6, and another 280 or so after a public comment period.Trump has long complained about China's huge trade surplus with the United States. In a statement Friday, he said trade with China "has been very unfair, for a very long time."The US president said the new tariffs were designed to punish China for the theft of American intellectual property and technology. And he warned that any retaliation by Beijing would trigger another round of tariffs on Chinese goods. That raises the specter of an intensifying trade war, which would hurt consumers, companies and the global economy. The Dow fell nearly 200 points on Friday after the tariffs were announced. Growth forecasts for major economies are already being slashed due to the rise of protectionism. Germany's central bank cut its forecast for Europe's biggest economy on Friday. "An escalating global trade dispute or widespread rises in import tariffs would have a marked negative impact on Germany's export oriented economy," it said. The United States has already imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum from Canada, Mexico and the European Union. All have promised to hit back. The 28 members of the EU agreed Thursday that retaliatory tariffs would go into effect in the coming days. "In this day and age, launching a trade war is not in the interest of the world," China's Commerce Ministry said. "We call on all countries to act together to firmly stop such an outdated and backward move, and to firmly safeguard the common interest of all mankind."-- Steven Jiang contributed to this article.TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Hillary Clinton is warning Australia to resist China's creeping influence in Asia before it spreads to the rest of the worldBusiness Insider USMay 10, 2018 Thursday 09:37 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 559 wordsByline: rosie.perper@businessinsider.com.au,  (Rosie Perper)Highlight: Clinton said China wants to extend its influence "first throughout Asia - then, throughout the world." The former Secretary of State compared China's "under the radar" efforts to the way Russian actors used covert social media campaigns to influence the 2016 US election.Body• Hillary Clinton warned Australia must stand up to the creeping influence of the Chinese Communist Party before it spreads.• Clinton said China wants to extend its influence "first throughout Asia - then, throughout the world."• The former Secretary of State compared China's "under the radar" efforts to the way Russian actors used covert social media campaigns to influence the 2016 US election.• Australia has been closely monitoring China and its efforts to sway policy and expand its military presence in the Pacific region. Hillary Clinton warned Australia must stand up to the creeping influence of the Chinese Communist Party before it spreads, and drew parallels between its actions and that of Russian interference in the 2016 US election.Speaking in Melbourne at the Growth Faculty's "An Evening with Hillary Rodham Clinton" speaker series, which was attended by Business Insider, Clinton raised the urgency of fighting interference from China."What we're seeing now is a desire by China to extend its influence and project its power. First throughout Asia - then, throughout the world," Clinton said. "I would hope that Australia would stand up against efforts under the radar, as we say, to influence Australian politics and policy," she told former Prime Minister Julia Gillard, who moderated the event.Clinton compared the Chinese government's efforts to influence and interfere with Australian politics to Russia's meddling in the 2016 US election, where she lost the presidency to Donald Trump.Clinton said Russia was waging an information war against the United States, including its use of fake ads on Facebook.James D. Morgan/Getty Images"The Russians are still playing on anything and everything they can to turn Americans against each other, from issues of race and gun violence to the humanitarian crisis in Syria," she said."And it's not just happening in the United States... This is bigger than one candidate, one election or even one country."In the case of China, Clinton said: "This is an urgent problem and one we must confront immediately and together."Australia has been closely monitoring China's growing influence in policy, education, trade, and military efforts in the Asia Pacific. In December, Australia's Prime Minister proposed banning foreign political donations, citing "disturbing reports about Chinese influence." Turnbull also stated that foreign actors had made "unprecedented and increasingly sophisticated attempts to influence the political process."China has also been heavily investing in Pacific Islands. According to data from the Lowy Institute, China spent $1.7 billion in aid and concessional loans to fund 218 projects in the Pacific Islands between 2006-2016. China has significantly bolstered its position in the South China Sea and, according to recent reports, Beijing was considering            increasing its military presence in Vanuatu.NOW WATCH: What Trump University was really like - according to a former professorSee Also:• Hillary Clinton is sounding the alarm over China's efforts to covertly interfere with politics worldwide• Ian Bremmer: Why the American dream doesn't exist anymore• Trump is setting up high stakes trade fights that could end in economic disasterSEE ALSO: The leaders of France and Australia just took aim at China with pointed comments about following the rule of lawLoad-Date: February 11, 2019End of Document

China's ZTE to US: Let us buy American technology againCNN WireMay 7, 2018 Monday 8:17 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 438 wordsByline: By Sherisse PhamDateline: HONG KONG (CNNMoney) BodyHONG KONG (CNNMoney) --  ZTE, one of China's biggest tech companies, is asking the United States to suspend a ban that threatens to cripple its business.ZTE said it has submitted a request for the US Commerce Department to put on hold an order forbidding American firms from selling parts and providing services to it. The Chinese company, which sells smartphones and telecommunications equipment around the world, has found itself caught up in a tense US-China trade fight. The Commerce Department said it slapped the seven-year export ban on ZTE because the Chinese company lied to American officials about punishing employees who violated US sanctions on North Korea and Iran. But the crackdown has been widely interpreted as part of a broader push by the United States to stifle China's tech ambitions. ZTE is not officially part of the dispute over intellectual property that's fueling the US-China trade clash, but it "represents the same nexus of tech and national security issues," Eurasia Group director Evan Medeiros wrote in a research note last week. Beijing specifically brought up the restrictions on ZTE during high level trade talks between US and Chinese officials last week. The Chinese government said it lodged "solemn representations" with the United States over the ban.ZTE has said the US export ban is a massive disruption to its business, with Chairman Yin Yimin calling it unfair and unacceptable. The company relies on US firms for key smartphone components, including microchips from Qualcomm and glass from Corning. ZTE said in its latest statement, which was filed late Sunday with the Hong Kong stock exchange, that it has submitted additional information required by the Commerce Department. The Commerce Department did not respond to a request for comment outside of business hours. US concerns over Chinese tech and national security are a recurring problem for ZTE and Huawei, another huge Chinese company that makes smartphones and telecommunications equipment. In February, US intelligence agencies warned Americans against buying ZTE and Huawei phones, saying the companies posed a security threat to American customers.Huawei is effectively shut out of the United States, but ZTE has made significant inroads there.

China's ZTE to US: Let us buy American technology againCNNMoney.comMay 6, 2018 Sunday 4:17 AM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: TECHNOLOGYLength: 419 wordsByline: Sherisse PhamBodyZTE, one of China's biggest tech companies, is asking the United States to suspend a ban that threatens to cripple its business.ZTE said it has submitted a request for the US Commerce Department to put on hold an order forbidding American firms from selling parts and providing services to it.The Chinese company, which sells smartphones and telecommunications equipment around the world, has found itself caught up in a tense US-China trade fight.The Commerce Department said it slapped the seven-year export ban on ZTE because the Chinese company lied to American officials about punishing employees who violated US sanctions on North Korea and Iran.But the crackdown has been widely interpreted as part of a broader push by the United States to stifle China's tech ambitions.ZTE is not officially part of the dispute over intellectual property that's fueling the US-China trade clash, but it "represents the same nexus of tech and national security issues," Eurasia Group director Evan Medeiros wrote in a research note last week.Beijing specifically brought up the restrictions on ZTE during high level trade talks between US and Chinese officials last week. The Chinese government said it lodged "solemn representations" with the United States over the ban.ZTE has said the US export ban is a massive disruption to its business, with Chairman Yin Yimin calling it unfair and unacceptable. The company relies on US firms for key smartphone components, including microchips from Qualcomm and glass from Corning.ZTE said in its latest statement, which was filed late Sunday with the Hong Kong stock exchange, that it has submitted additional information required by the Commerce Department.The Commerce Department did not respond to a request for comment outside of business hours.US concerns over Chinese tech and national security are a recurring problem for ZTE and Huawei, another huge Chinese company that makes smartphones and telecommunications equipment.In February, US intelligence agencies warned Americans against buying ZTE and Huawei phones, saying the companies posed a security threat to American customers.Huawei is effectively shut out of the United States, but ZTE has made significant inroads there. The company accounted for 10% of the US smartphone market last year, making it the fourth largest supplier, according to market research firm Counterpoint Technology.ZTE shares, which trade in Hong Kong and Shenzhen, have been suspended since the Commerce Department announced the ban last month.Load-Date: May 8, 2018End of Document

All Rights ReservedSection: PRODUCT / SERVICES ANNOUNCEMENTLength: 638 wordsBodyNew Ring7 FastTrack Service, in Response to Latest Great Firewall VPN Regulations, Is Now Globally Available to Provide Authorized Video Content Delivery to and From ChinaBUDAPEST, Hungary, June  25, 2018  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- VideoShip Enterprise Ltd., a global leader in advanced workflow and Content Distribution Network (CDN) services for the broadcast, film and cable industries, announced today at the National Association of Television Program Executives (NATPE) Annual Budapest International Marketplace and Conference, the availability of their new Ring7 FastTrack video program content delivery service for China.Colin Grimes, VP Business Development of VideoShip Enterprise stated, "We announced our strategic partnership with CNLive, one of the largest media companies in China, for the Ring7 FastTrack service earlier this year at the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) conference in Las Vegas in response to the new Chinese Great Firewall regulations that went into effect in April. We have had good initial interest in the service with over 45 end-users already connected in China and we are pleased to be able to launch the service and make it commercially available globally starting today."The Ring7 FastTrack service with its combination of VideoShip's secure end-to-end CDN technology and CNLive's direct in-country ISP connectivity and official license for content approval provides an authorized, high-speed and cost-effective alternative for those organizations moving video program content to and from China. The service also includes the ability to showcase and promote authorized content for rights holders in China via market target specific portals and storefronts.New regulations blocking the use of unauthorized Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and other software to bypass cross-border Internet controls put in place by China came into effect on 1 April 2018. After this date, organizations and individuals are only allowed to use government-approved VPNs or they will need to apply for a leased line VPN license with the Chinese government and provide usage records.Tom Grimes, CEO and Founder of VideoShip added, "We are sending a team to NATPE International in Budapest this week to meet with rights holders, syndicated media distributors and potential distribution partners who are interested in accessing the Chinese market, one of the largest and fastest growing markets for media in the world. In addition to meeting with Tier 1 users, we are particularly interested in meeting 2nd and 3rd Tier organizations who want a convenient and easy to use "drag and drop" type service and do not want to bother with the costs, delays and bureaucracy of leasing private line services and getting qualified on their own for program content distribution in or out of China."About VideoShipVideoShip, established in 2004, is an international company with headquarters in Ottawa and operations in Pensacola, Singapore and Dublin.

China applies tariffs to the EUCE Noticias Financieras EnglishApril 2, 2018 MondayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 394 wordsBody China will apply tariffs of between 15 and 25% on imports of 128 products originating in the United States, in response to President Donald Trump's decision to impose tariffs on foreign purchases of Chinese merchandise worth up to 60,000 million dollars a year.  Tariffs will be imposed on goods that include fruit and pork, the Chinese Ministry of Finance reported on its website.  The measure is aimed at balancing the losses caused by tariffs imposed by the United States on the steel and aluminum products it imports from the Asian giant.  "With the aim of protecting our interests and compensating for the damage caused by the measures adopted by the United States, as of April 2, China ceases its obligation to reduce customs duties for 128 products from seven categories imported from Washington," he said.  The Chinese government explained that the tariff will be 15% for 120 products, including fruit, and 25% for eight other products, including pork.  Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 gives the United States the authority to impose trade sanctions on foreign countries that violate trade agreements or engage in other unfair business practices.  Trump authorized on March 22 to impose tariffs on imports of products originating in China worth up to 60,000 million dollars a year as compensation for alleged theft of technology and trade secrets.  The Trump administration's argument is that these Chinese policies harm innovators in the United States and around the world by interfering with the ability of foreign technology holders to establish market-based terms in licenses and other technology-related contracts. .  According to the USTR, China appears to be violating WTO rules by denying foreign patent holders, including US companies, basic patent rights to prevent a Chinese entity from using the technology after a license agreement ends.  He argued that China appears to be violating WTO rules by imposing compulsory adverse contractual terms that discriminate and are less favorable for foreign imported technology.  In turn, China argued that these are "legitimate measures to follow the rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and safeguard its interests."  The measure was adopted in an attempt to reduce Washington's huge trade deficit with China, the second largest economy in the world, which in 2017 reached 375 billion dollars. Load-Date: April 2, 2018End of Document

PACIFIC ? Is Facebook a security threat?CNNMoney.comJune 6, 2018 Wednesday 7:09 PM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: TECHNOLOGYLength: 1662 wordsByline: Dylan ByersBodyWhat's Next: Facebook's China Problem: Facebook has acknowledged that it is sharing user data with Chinese companies, including Huawei, the smartphone maker that US intelligence agencies have called a security threat.Sign up for PACIFIC: The new CNNMoney newsletter about the center of change and innovationThe admission comes after the New York Times revealed that Facebook shared data "with at least 60 device makers," including Apple, Amazon and BlackBerry, even after claiming to have shut down third party access to user data in 2015. Facebook now says it will stop sharing data with Huawei this week.The China factor makes it worse:? US officials have repeatedly expressed concerns that the Chinese government can use Huawei smartphones to gather intelligence on US citizens.? US lawmakers have new ammunition: Sen. Marco Rubio says Facebook "might as well have given [user data] directly to the government of China," and Sen. Mark Warner wants to know "how Facebook ensured that [user] information was not sent to Chinese servers."? US citizens might understandably question the sincerity of Facebook's stated commitment to protecting user privacy, given that the company never seems to own up to its problems until they are exposed by the media.How Facebook sees it: Francisco Varela, VP of Mobile Partnerships, says this was standard industry practice: Other US tech companies did it and Facebook's integrations were controlled and approved by Facebook.The Big Picture: Facebook can never fully control what third parties do with your data. What it can control is how transparent it is with the public -- and on that front it doesn't appear to be doing very well.But ... Congress has failed as well. Their inability to curb Facebook's data sharing practices is a sign of their own ineptitude and inattention.Bonus: The US and China are nearing a deal to save ZTE, per Reuters. Sen. Chuck Schumer says Trump is putting "China, not the United States, first.---Today's PACIFICGavin Newsom will almost certainly be California's next governor.Antonio Villaraigosa conceded the gubernatorial race late Tuesday night, leaving Newsom to face Republican John Cox in a state where only a quarter of the population is registered Republican.What's Next, via Politico: "With an eye toward his next job as chief executive of the world's fifth largest economy, the former mayor is talking about tackling issues like jobs, housing, income inequality and homelessness."---Moon Shots: Amazon seeks cancer cureAmazon has a secretive group at its Seattle headquarters that is dedicated to ambitious projects, including an attempt to cure cancer.The Details, via CNBC's Eugene Kim and Christina Farr:? Grand Challenge is led by Babak Parviz, the creator of Google Glass, and focuses "on a series of bold projects involving cancer research, medical records and last-mile delivery."? "Similar to Alphabet's experimental research lab, X ... Grand Challenge is a research team set up to explore ambitious new ventures that can eventually expand Amazon's already wide footprint."? "The group, which also operates under the monikers 1492 and Amazon X, has added over 50 people since 2014."The Big Picture: Grand Challenge "illustrates how far out Amazon is going to pursue innovative projects, beyond its primary businesses of e-commerce, consumer devices and Amazon Web Services."Bonus: Amazon is reportedly upping its investment in India by $2 billion.Sign up for PACIFIC: The new CNNMoney newsletter about the center of change and innovation---Future of Media: Facebook's next: TV newsFacebook is partnering with ABC, CNN, Fox News and other media organizations to launch a series of news programs on its Watch video service.The shows, which will be financed by Facebook and appear there exclusively, are part of the social media company's effort to restore user trust in the wake of misinformation scandals and repair its tenuous relationship with the news industry.Campbell Brown, Facebook's head of global news partnerships, talks to PACIFIC:? "This is an investment in quality news on Facebook."? "We have pushed intensely over the last six months to emphasize quality over quantity -- down-ranking click bait, down-ranking sensationalism."? "We want to explore new and different ways people are engaging with news and information today."The first slate of shows look as if they will be very similar to broadcast and cable: ABC's "On Location" will feature ABC News journalists reporting from around the globe, while CNN and Fox's shows will be hosted by star anchors Anderson Cooper and Shep Smith, respectively. Univision, ATTN, Mic and Alabama's AL.com will also have shows, and Facebook plans to add several more media partners before the launch later this summer.The Big Picture: Facebook's news programming will serve as yet another test of whether linear television programming can work on digital platforms. The success or failure of that effort will likely depend on whether news organizations tailor their shows to mobile consumption habits or simply repurpose conventional programming.Bonus: NBC News, which does not have a Facebook Watch show, has begun hiring for an online streaming network that will soft-launch this summer, per Variety. The channel will feature "original video content, not pick-ups of programs that already exist on NBC or MSNBC."---Future of Social: Instagram goes longFacebook's Instagram is preparing a new feature that will give users the ability to post long-form videos, possibly up to an hour in length.The Details, via WSJ's Ben Mullin:?

"The branding campaign, which kicked off in the U.S. last month with television ads featuring Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, includes additional product-focused television ads starting this week, as well as online and billboard ads."?

Cambodia deports 89 suspects in online scam to ChinaAssociated Press InternationalApril 11, 2018 Wednesday 1:56 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 257 wordsDateline: PHNOM PENH, Cambodia BodyPHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) - Cambodia on Wednesday deported nearly 100 Chinese citizens accused of defrauding people in China in an internet scam, a senior Cambodian Interior Ministry official said.Gen. Ouk Haiseila, chief of the Immigration Investigation Bureau, said the 89 suspects, including 15 women, were flown out of the Cambodian capital on two planes sent by the Chinese government. He said members of the group contacted women in China over social media and tricked them into sending nude or erotic photos, then extorted money by threatening to spread the images online.Ouk Haiseila said they were arrested last month after a police investigation.Online scams by Chinese gangs that operate from foreign countries and target mainland Chinese are common throughout Southeast Asia. Since 2012, Cambodia has sent at least 1,000 Chinese and Taiwanese residents involved in such schemes to China.The gangs, who use the internet and internet phone services, have also been caught operating as far afield as Kenya and Spain.The arrests have caused controversy because suspects from Taiwan are usually deported directly to China in deference to Beijing, which views Taiwan as its own territory without sovereign legal status. Taiwan rejects China's claim to its territory and wants its citizens returned there.The deportations highlight Beijing's efforts to assert its sovereignty over Taiwan, and the leverage it wields over smaller nations to achieve that.___This story has been corrected to show that deportation was Wednesday, not Tuesday.Load-Date: April 12, 2018End of Document

The Bible, a book impossible to find in China&#39;s online storesCE Noticias Financieras EnglishApril 4, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 381 wordsBody The sacred book of Christianity, the Bible, can not be purchased in China for several days through the Internet, where the largest electronic sales portals have withdrawn, as Efe has been able to verify.  "Sorry, there are no related products." This message appears as a result in the search engine of the electronic portal JD, one of the most famous online stores in China, although it specializes in electronics, it sells almost all types of products.  The sacred book does not appear in any store of Taobao, the portal belonging to the giant of electronic commerce, Alibaba, where millions of retailers offer their articles.  In the portal there is the possibility of entering into a written conversation with the vendors through a chat and one of the portals confirmed to Efe that they had removed the Bible, but offered the possibility of selling it outside that platform.  "Now we can not sell it in public, lately the situation is very tense," said the seller, who provided photographs of the bibles he sells.  In another store of religious articles they also said that they do not sell it, while other online bookstores and similar stores, where it does not appear either, did not respond to the message.  However, in several stores you can find books related to Christianity or children's stories about it, but not the original Bible.  Efe proved that the book is not present either in the aforementioned JD and Taobao, nor in the Chinese version of Amazon or in Dang Dang, a portal specializing in the sale of books.  Through Wechat, the most popular instant messaging tool among Chinese people, there is also a message circulating in Christian groups these days that says that as of March 30, the Bible can not be sold through the Internet.  Precisely yesterday the Chinese government published a new rule on religious beliefs in which he said that "religions in the country should be of Chinese orientation and provide an active orientation to religions so they can adapt to the socialist society."  In China, although there are no official data, it is estimated that there are between 60 and 70 million Christians of all denominations and that more than half of them are grouped in congregations not affiliated with the Government, which is why they are often persecuted. Load-Date: April 4, 2018End of Document

China's ZTE fires back over US ban: 'We cannot accept it'CNNMoney.comApril 19, 2018 Thursday 6:50 AM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: TECHNOLOGYLength: 465 wordsByline: Jethro MullenBodyOne of China's top tech companies has lashed out at the US government's move to prevent it from buying technology from American companies.ZTE, which sells smartphones and other telecommunications equipment around the world, said Friday that the ban imposed this week by the US Commerce Department was "extremely unfair" and that the company "cannot accept it."It warned in a statement that the move "not only endangers ZTE, but also hurts ZTE's cooperative partners, including many American companies."The seven-year ban affecting ZTE, which will take a toll on the company's US suppliers such as Qualcomm, comes at a time of severe tensions between China and the United States over trade and technology.The Commerce Department said Monday that ZTE had lied to US officials about steps it had taken to punish employees who violated US sanctions against North Korea and Iran. The Chinese company last year agreed to pay a $1.2 billion fine after a US investigation found it had illegally shipped telecommunications equipment to the blacklisted countries.Instead of punishing those involved, "ZTE paid full bonuses to employees that had engaged in illegal conduct, and failed to issue letters of reprimand," the Commerce Department said.ZTE said Friday that the Commerce Department was ignoring the "arduous efforts" it has made to follow export rules, the steps it has taken to deal with people "who neglected their duty," and its hiring of an American law firm to carry out an independent investigation.At a news conference later Friday, Chairman Yin Yimin said the US restrictions have plunged the company into "a state of shock," Chinese state media reported."The US side, by magnifying a slight issue without restraint, has greatly disrupted our business," he said. "We attach great importance to this issue and will use all available legal means to deal with the problem."Yin also struck a nationalistic tone."We have a strong motherland and 1.3 billion people behind us, and they provide us with the confidence and determination to overcome all kinds of difficulties," he was reported as saying.ZTE shares, which trade in Hong Kong and Shenzhen, have been suspended since the Commerce Department announced the ban.The company delayed its first-quarter earnings, which it originally planned to release on Thursday, while it assesses the impact of the US ban.The Chinese government has repeatedly attacked the US government's decision, calling it reckless.China and the United States are already locked in a bitter confrontation over their trading relationship and, in particular, China's acquisition of US technology. The two sides have threatened each other with steep new tariffs on exports worth tens of billions of dollars.-- Nanlin Fang and Steven Jiang contributed to this report.Load-Date: April 21, 2018End of Document

I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Thursday, April 19th.Your top stories at 7:00 a.m. Eastern.Earnings in focus on Wall Street. Futures searching for direction, 27- point loss on the Dow futures; this is ahead of the open. Strong earnings did lift the Nasdaq and S&P 500 yesterday but IBM was one big drag on the blue chip, pulling the Dow down 38 points. IBM suffering its biggest selloff in five years on weak guidance.Oil fueling global markets this morning after hitting about a three-and-a- half year high yesterday. Again, one of the problems is bottlenecks hits in the U.S. oil business, in the shale business.In Europe we look at England, France and Germany. We have a slight loss on the Dax in Germany.In Asia overnight green across the board with the Hang Seng being the biggest winner, up nearly 1.5 percent.Diplomacy with a catch -- why President Trump is saying now he would be willing to walk away from the table, walk away from the table on that planned summit with Kim Jong-un.Plus, tough talk against Vladimir Putin -- President George W. Bush warning about the Russian leader during his exclusive interview with Maria yesterday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GEORGE W. BUSH, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: -- person who wants to reinstate Soviet influence even though the Soviet no longer exists. And therefore, I always felt it was very important for the United States to be very forceful in dealing with Putin, not belligerent but forceful.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: More from Maria's exclusive interview with President Bush and first lady, Laura -- ahead.Plus, like something out of a movie, a home explosion rattles a north Texas neighborhood with a police officer nearly caught in the flames. What investigators say caused that blast in Hurst, Texas.And moving the chains on a football tradition -- the big changes coming to the NFL this season, reportedly under consideration. We will bring you that.And even the assemblers need some assembly. How robots are mastering the art of putting IKEA furniture together -- coming up this morning.We also will be talking with House Financial Services Committee member Congressman Lee Zeldin of New York; former Reagan economic adviser Art Laffer; and former NFL star Ryan Nece; and host of "VARNEY AND CO.", Stuart Varney. Don't miss any of it.But first to our top story this hour -- the Comey media tour continues. The fired FBI director was a registered Republican for most of his life. But in an interview Comey said now the GOP has lost its way.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: In your heart of hearts, do you still consider yourself though a Republican?JAMES COMEY, FORMER FBI DIRECTOR: No, no. The Republican Party has left me and many others. I need no better evidence than their new Web site which I think is lying Comey maybe, attacking me. I just think they've lost their way and I can't be associated with it.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When did you see that change take place?COMEY: Probably over the Trump presidency and probably began during the campaign of '16, came to the conclusion that these people don't represent anything that I believe in.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: Comey went on to say he still respects some Republicans, though most notably Mitt Romney who he called, a quote, "person of principle and honor".Joining me now, Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel.Maybe I would argue, I'm just going to ask you, are they glad to see Comey go? Don't let the door hit you where the good lord split you as my father would say.RONNA ROMNEY MCDANIEL, CHAIRWOMAN, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE: I will say he left the Republican Party, we did not leave him. He has left. And we're glad to see him go at this point with what he's done with this self- serving book tour, monetizing his relationship with the President.We know now how unfit he was to be FBI director with the mistruths that he's put forward. And I think really this book shows Comey's character which is one of salacious details, one of disclosing private conversations with the President of the United States.And let's just talk about the Republican Party and leadership. Unemployment at a record low; jobs are coming back to this country; wages are up. Two-thirds of Americans have bigger paychecks. If that's the party leaving him, then he's left the American people.MCDOWELL: This is my own opinion, but Jim Comey is a member of the party of one. He's a member of the party of Jim Comey. And that is part of the problem. It's why the "Wall Street Journal" warned President Trump not to keep him on as FBI director before the inauguration early last year.Do you think that the Comey media tour if it continues -- are you lucky maybe, that it's going on right now, that there's some distance between this book and all this talk out of Jim Comey and the election in November, the midterm?MCDANIEL: Well, I think what you're saying is exactly right. And the more the American public gets to see him, they see how much Jim Comey thinks of Jim Comey. "A Higher Loyalty", we put the cover out to "Me, Myself and I". It's about him.And I think seeing the way that he's disclosed private conversations with the President of the United States, he's made giant leaps. He only met with the President three times in person and yet he's made these giant leaps.And now you see that his family was huge Hillary Clinton supporters. I think he's actually trying to make good with the Democrats and trying to find a new home and hoping that they will embrace him.But I don't think they're going to do that either because they blame him for Hillary Clinton's woes.MCDOWELL: Yes. I think the headline from that, Ronna, was wait Jim Comey was a Republican?MCDANIEL: Exactly.MCDOWELL: That was my takeaway. He did confirm in an appearance on "The View" that Comey was the one who kick started the probe that led to his former deputy Andrew McCabe's firing. Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MEGHAN MCCAIN, TV HOST: Your second in command, McCabe, was fired for lying multiple times within the FBI. You defended his character on Twitter. That's ok. Lying is ok internally.COMEY: No, it's definitely not. In fact the McCabe case illustrates what an organization that's committed to the truth looks like. We investigated -- I ordered that investigation. We investigate and hold people accountable. Good people lie.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: Well, if you lie to the FBI -- so in that IG report, Andrew McCabe lied to Jim Comey and lied about Jim Comey. He lied to Jim Comey about the leak to the "Wall Street Journal" reporter.If you lie to the FBI, you go to jail. They prosecute you and send you to jail for a felony. What about Andy McCabe and other people within the FBI who have been lying?MCDANIEL: Absolutely. I think this is a real concern. Listen, we love the FBI. We know the men and women of the FBI serve our country well.But there are bad actors within the FBI -- McCabe, Strzok, Lisa Page -- they've done some things that need to be called out so we can restore our faith in that institution. And if we can't call out bad actors within that institution, what can we do?And James Comey, he lied. He lied under oath. He said he hadn't leaked and then he gave his internal memos to the "Washington Post" through his Columbia professor friend. He is somebody who was dishonest with the American people.The President did the right thing by removing him. We can't have an FBI working to undermine the President of the United States.MCDOWELL: Meantime, Dan Henninger in the "Wall Street Journal" today in his column that he writes every Thursday says, "The GOP is the party of Trump. Donald Trump's lasting contribution to our electoral politics was drawing attention to forgotten voters especially in rural areas. But 2016's win also depended on support from moderate to conservative suburban Republican voters. And the party can't lose them. Donald Trump is a unique, charismatic, political figure but the evidence so far is that the party of Trump begins and ends with one man."Does this ring true for you?MCDANIEL: It doesn't. I look as President Trump as someone who came to those forgotten men and women and said that you deserve a champion. Your wages are stagnant. You've been forgotten in Washington. You don't have lobbyists.I'm a deal-maker. I'm a businessman. I know how to get Washington working again.Look what's happened in a year and four months. Jobs are coming to this country, three million. Record unemployment for the Hispanic and African American communities; women unemployment down 18 to the lowest in 18 years.And then you look at our military being funded; ISIS on the run. He's a bold leader. He likes to see results. He's a change agent in Washington and he appealed to a different base than what the Republican Party has normally appealed to.MCDOWELL: But in terms of keeping the majority particularly in the House with the midterms coming up, you've got to -- the Republicans have to run better candidates than the man who ran against, say, Conor Lamb or that was, you know, who won the Alabama senate race.I'll point to -- there's a Reuters story out that the Democrats have a $10.5 million fund raising advantage over the Republicans in the 25 most competitive House races.Paul Ryan, he's leaving. He's been a great fundraiser for the Republicans, raising $54 million so far. But now that he's told the American people I'm out the door, how does that money part --MCDANIEL: So Paul will continue to be an excellent fundraiser. And he's going to continue focusing on keeping the majority.The RNC has doubled the DNC in fund raising. We have $42 million cash on hand. We're in 25 states. We build the infrastructure. We determine who the likely voters are, the persuadable. A lot of the things the candidates don't have the bandwidth to do, we're confident in what we set up for these midterm elections. The candidates do matter. That is a fair point.MCDOWELL: We always spoke to some in the RNC, you being the chairwoman versus the DNC. But at the ground level, there is incredible enthusiasm by the Democrats for the candidates out there and there is some -- there is strong individual fund raising.Steve Forbes -- and I'm going to quote him because I asked him this before he left the set -- he thinks that the Republicans need to do something between now and the midterms, propose a new tax cut, an additional tax cut. And he said you need to do something on health care because people are going to find out about their premium increases right before the midterms in November.MCDANIEL: I think that's fair. I mean Congress can't stop working and we can't stop working on behalf of the American people.Listen, let's look at the Democratic accomplishment column -- nothing. Obstruct, resist. We put together the best tax cut. People are getting more money in their paychecks. They're feeling better. But hey want to see us continue to work on their behalf.I will say, though, we have a fund raising advantage over the Democrat Party with the DNC. We are laying the groundwork for these midterms and look at our candidates in these Senate races where these Democrat incumbents are -- in Missouri, in Indiana, in Florida with Governor Scott - - all across the country.We have opportunities to pick up seats. Republicans are energized. We have to stay energized if we're going to keep our majority.MCDOWELL: But you look at Ted Cruz running against Beto O'Rourke down in Texas. In a new Quinnipiac poll found that the race is too close to call. It is so tight. So again, it's just like Conor Lamb winning and you have this young, energetic kind of newcomer running against Ted Cruz. I mean you can't say Ted Cruz is out of this by any stretch of the imagination but --MCDANIEL: Yes.MCDOWELL: -- Beto O'Rourke is giving him a run for his money and more.MCDANIEL: We can't take any race for granted. It's going to be all determined by how many voters show up. We need Republicans to show up. I wouldn't count Ted Cruz out. He did double Beto O'Rourke in those primary votes. He had (INAUDIBLE) at 1.5 million or something around that number of votes in that primary doubling Beto's numbers. And I think if Texans get to know Beto O'Rourke and his record, they're going to return to Ted Cruz.But we're going to keep working in every single state across the country. We have good candidates. We have to keep our majority because look what we lose if we don't. Those tax cuts will come back. People will see their paychecks not increase. They're going to see more money going to the government.So these are things that Americans are going to fight for. Democrats are going to tax them more and bring less jobs to this country.MCDOWELL: Yes. I love how the Democrats now are so worried about the national debt.MCDANIEL: Oh yes.MCDOWELL: That's comedy. That's funnier than what you see on late night TV. Thank you.MCDANIEL: Thank you.MCDOWELL: Ronna it was great to see you.MCDANIEL: Thanks for having me.MCDOWELL: Ronna Romney McDaniel -- take care.MCDANIEL: Thank you.MCDOWELL: A warning for Kim Jong-un -- President Trump putting the art of the deal to work saying he would walk away from the negotiating table. More on the tough talk from the White House.Plus no assembly required -- robots now have completed a task that many, many humans dread -- putting together IKEA furniture. Find out how long it took these robots to assemble a dining chair.MCDOWELL: Tesla facing new scrutiny.Cheryl Casone has more details -- Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FBN HOST: Oh yes. The state of California, Dagen, looking into the working conditions at Tesla's factory in Fremont. This comes just days after a report said that Tesla is underreporting workplace-related injuries and illnesses.Tesla is denying the claim. They call it an ideologically motivated attack by an extremist organization. Tesla is struggling to boost production on its Model 3 Sedan at the plant. That Model 3 has had quite many problems. Tesla shares lower in the premarket, down more than a quarter percent right now.Meanwhile SpaceX, another Elon Musk company, has successfully completed its first rocket landing by sea in nearly six months. They've also launched a planet hunting NASA satellite into space with its Falcon 9 rocket. The $337 million satellite nicknamed Tess is going to study many more stars to pinpoint thousands of new planets, focus on those that are frankly similar to the size, maybe the shape even of earth.Well, President Raul Castro, brother of the late Fidel will hand over power to the first vice president today -- Miguel Diaz-Canel. Castro stepping down to ensure that new leaders maintain the government's grip on power. His departure from the president a major change for a country that has been under the rule of one family since the revolution back in 1959. But Castro's not totally giving up power. He is going to remain head of the communist party until 2021.Well, Saudi Arabia screening Hollywood blockbuster "Black Panther".(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What happens now determines what happens to the rest of the world.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: This marks the country's first film screening in more than three decades as it ends a ban on movie theaters. But 40 seconds of the film's final scene involving a kiss has been censored.Ok. And then there is this. Americans just can't seem to keep their foul mouth clean. A new survey says that the average American utters their first curse word by 10:54 in the morning -- Dagen. One in four Americans can't even make it past 9:00 a.m.That same survey found financial stress to be the biggest cause of frustration for 56 percent of Americans -- just like it drives some people to run off some steam well in the day. By the way, Dagen -- the other major stressor and why we're cursing so much and I say we lovingly -- lack of sleep. Done, yes.MCDOWELL: My first curse on average happens at 2:46 a.m. every morning.CASONE: Ok. Yes. I get the 4:30 a.m. version from you, so --MCDOWELL: 2:46 -- that's enough time for me to get out -- the alarm to go off and get out of bed and hit my head on the bathroom door or stub my toe or trip over something and fall face first.CASONE: That's enough.MCDOWELL: 2:46 a.m. --CASONE: Love it.MCDOWELL: -- is my first curse words. Luckily Charlie doesn't mind -- Charlie dog.Coming up, President Trump bullish on talks with North Korea's leader. But he says he's willing to walk away from talks with Kim Jong-un fall short of expectations.Plus an astonishing moment caught on camera, when a police officer, a dash- cam captures a moment a home explodes into a fire ball.MCDOWELL: The pursuit of peace with North Korea, President Trump reiterating plans yesterday for a summit with Kim Jong-un, focused on denuclearization talks. However, during his news conference yesterday at Mar-a-Lago, the President said there is one way that the meeting could get scrapped.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I hope to have a very successful meeting. If we don't think it's going to be successful, Mark, we won't have it. We won't have it.If I think that it's a meeting that is not going to be fruitful, we're not going to go. If the meeting when I'm there is not fruitful, I will respectfully leave the meeting.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: Joining us this morning a former army commander in Iraq and Afghanistan -- Colonel Jay Voorhees. Colonel -- how significant potentially is this diplomatic breakthrough?COL. JAY VOORHEES, FORMER ARMY COMMANDER: Well, obviously, you know, nobody prays for peace and a diplomatic solution more than a soldier so I think it's a move in the right direction. But also I think President Trump is just setting the tone that, hey you know, if you're looking for concessions just for coming to the table, that's not going to happen.So I think he's continuing to be strong. I think it's important that he does not back down because Kim Jong-un is a bully. And he is responding to pressure and pain, economically, with all the sanctions. And that's what's making it happen.So I think at the end of the day he's setting the tone that we're just not coming here to talk and a give you concessions. We want some concrete results. And I think it's a good thing -- Dagen.MCDOWELL: Colonel -- Steve Forbes is here with a question.STEVE FORBES, CEO, FORMBES MEDIA: Colonel -- do you think the North Koreans are going to push to have the U.S. pull its troops out of South Korea as part of the deal? Is that part of their hidden agenda?VOORHEES: Steve -- it's great to talk to you this morning. It's been that way for a long time. The North Koreans have used the leverage of the nuclear weapons to keep themselves in power. But there's absolutely no doubt that they do not want the U.S. presence on the peninsula, you know.And I think that is the red line, if you will, with President Trump. He's not going to give in to it. But of late, with I think, again, with some of the pressure, not backing down and also the military threat, the real military threat, I think maybe Kim Jong-un is reconsidering that.But at the end of the day, he does not want that presence there. It's not good for his power. It's not good for his regime. And it ultimately, yes, he doesn't want us there.ROBERT WOLF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Colonel -- it's Robert Wolf. Thank you for everything you've done.Just a question -- do you think that lifting sanctions and kind of opening the markets is going to be enough for them to denuclearize?VOORHEES: No, I think the key player in this whole arrangement -- two things. The threat of the nuclear, the going to war and the destruction of North Korea, as terrible as that would be, has got his attention.The other main player here is China. China is the big influencer on North Korea and I think that's the big key and I just don't think they're ready to denuclearize right now.I really am concerned that, again this is just another attempt to buy some time. And I think that's why President Trump is sending the message that if you're not serious, we're going to back away.WOLF: Colonel, do you think -- what's going to be the attitude of the South Korean president who is known as a dove? Is he going to be willing to make more concessions than Donald Trump and how do we make sure we're not fighting each other while we're trying to negotiate?VOORHEES: It's a great point. You know, there's no doubt that there are two opposite ends of the spectrum when it comes to President Moon and President Trump. And it's a little dicey.At the end of the day though, President Moon is the one that has to look out for the best interests of South Korea. So he's going to push for some kind of concessions that might be a little weaker than what President Trump wants.The good thing is, again I think it's a very positive thing that for the first time President Trump, an American president is going to sit down with Kim Jong-un and have talks. The diplomatic solution is absolutely the way to go with all of our other instruments of national power and the military solution needs to be the absolute last resort in this case.MCDOWELL: Meantime there are new questions, speaking of North Korea, surrounding CIA director Mike Pompeo's secret mission to North Korea just a short while ago. He's currently facing a Senate fight over his nomination as secretary of state. He failed to disclose the trip to Pyongyang during his confirmation hearing.Colonel -- what do you see with this issue? Because, again, there's a lot of pushback from the Democrats, Democrats on the Foreign Relations Committee; all but one have said we're voting no on this. It would be unheard of in the last basically century that a secretary of state nominee did not get a favorable vote, a vote of favorability out of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. What do you make of all of this?VOORHEES: Yes. What I make is it's kind of sad -- Dagen. I mean we're politicizing everything right now. The fact that Mr. Pompeo made trip is a good thing. But you know, it's almost like depending on what side of the aisle you're sitting, if it would have been on the other side it would have been a good thing for the Democrats if somebody might have traveled over and had a meeting. And it's just craziness.The bottom line is this -- again we need to push for a diplomatic solution. The fact that Mr. Pompeo met with Kim Jong-un is a good thing. And I don't think anybody could deny it when you remove all the politics.So it is in my opinion sad. We want to use all of our instruments of national power, information, economic and diplomatic before we use the military one. And I think it's really sad that we're using this as a political tool when it comes to confirming a secretary of state. That's just my opinion.MCDOWELL: Colonel -- great to see you this morning. Great to see you always. Colonel Jay Voorhees. And thank you for your service. Thanks to everyone who has ever served in these Armed Forces. Take care -- Colonel.VOORHEES: Good to see you guys this morning.MCDOWELL: Coming up -- remembering first lady Barbara Bush. Maria sat down exclusively with her son, President George W. Bush yesterday. We have more from that interview.And some assembly required -- the new robots that could save your marriage, save your sanity by taking the headache out of IKEA furniture.MCDOWELL: Welcome back. I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Thursday, April 19th. Your top stories at 07:30 a.m. Eastern. Markets on edge, Futures pointing to a slightly lower open, 11-point loss on the Dow Futures, that follows a mixed day on Wall Street yesterday. The Dow dragged down by IBM. But the Nasdaq and S&P posted their third straight day of games.We're also watching oil prices. Crude hitting North now of $69 a barrel, getting very close to the $70 a barrel mark, that's the highest price for oil in more than three years, about 3-1/2 years. Checking the global market action, in Europe we have gains in England and France. And in Asia overnight, it was green across the board. The biggest winner there, the Hang Seng, up one -- almost 1.5 percent.Procter and Gamble reporting first quarter earnings earlier this hour. The consumer products giant posting better than expected results, more on that. We have about a half of one percent gain on Procter & Gamble right now.And then remembering first lady Barbara Bush. Maria sat down with President George W. Bush and first lady Laura where they offered their memories but also addressed key issues facing this world.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LAURA BUSH, FORMER FIRST LADY: One of the things we've worked on from the beginning really is how to empower women, that if half of the population is left out of the country then you see a failed country. And that's what we saw in Afghanistan under the Taliban.GEORGE W. BUSH, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: We think women will lead the peace movement in a part of the world that needs peace.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: More of Maria's exclusive interview straight ahead. A home bursting into a fire ball. A new dashcam video shows a police officer narrowly escaping the explosion after a vehicle crashed into the home. Watch this.MCDOWELL: We will show you more of that video. Plus, big changes coming to the NFL. Why East Coast fans will be cheering the news.And the rise of the robots, while their concerns are about taking jobs. There's one task no one will complain about, assembling IKEA furniture. Now there are machines that can do just that.And then targeting trade, President Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe addressing tariffs issues during their meeting at Mar-a-Lago. This comes as the administration is working on a new NAFTA deal which could come in weeks. The president and future of NAFTA, one of the many questions that Maria was able to ask President George W. Bush and first lady Laura Bush at the Bush Presidential Center. The exclusive interview right now.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN HOST: In terms of Mexico and Canada, you mentioned Mr. President, do you worry about the conflicts that are going on right now, given the debate over trade and open trade and NAFTA?G. BUSH: Well, I hope that people, as they debate whether or not the trading regime has worked with Canada and Mexico look at the facts. And we want our neighbors to be healthy and strong. And so, our view is, how can we best expedite positive trade, which benefits everybody, but also to make the point that the three of us countries are going to need to work together to be able to compete with China in the long term. And so, you know, I don't -- I -- these days I'm getting too old to worry about much, but I do -- I -- my only point is, is that we promote a positive agenda here and make the case why in this case, trade with Canada and Mexico, collaboration with Canada and Mexico, working closely with Canada and Mexico, not only benefits U. S. citizens, but benefits the citizens of all three countries.BARTIROMO: Since you left the White House, you've become an avid painter.G. BUSH: I have.BARTIROMO: I love your work.G. BUSH: Thank you.BARTIROMO: And --G. BUSH: Well, if that's the case --BARTIROMO: And we want to show some because we shot some of the pictures that you've done. Tell me, how often are you painting?G. BUSH: Daily, except yesterday.BARTIROMO: What are you working on?G. BUSH: I'm working on two snow owls. So, our daughter Jenna, who is fairly outspoken child, demanded -- not demanded, forcefully asked for me to paint two snow owls for a new house that she and Henry are --L. BUSH: Furnishing.G. BUSH: Furnishing. So, I'm working on that.BARTIROMO: OK.G. BUSH: Yes.BARTIROMO: But is it relaxing? Why do you like painting?G. BUSH: It's mind expanding. It's doing something I never dreamt I would do. Tell them your line.L. BUSH: He was actually an art agnostic.BARTIROMO: Really?L. BUSH: He never even looked at art. And we lived in the White House with a really beautiful art collection. The White House has a great collection of American art. But he didn't really look at it. But now he does.BARTIROMO: Do you -- do you also paint, Mrs. Bush?L. BUSH: No.BARTIROMO: No. OK.G. BUSH: And she's not a very good subject.BARTIROMO: What? Why?L. BUSH: No, I haven't been really loud about --BARTIROMO: You haven't -- you haven't painted Laura?L. BUSH: Any of the portraits he's done of me.G. BUSH: I -- well, I tried one, and, believe me --BARTIROMO: Well, it better be good. It better be good.L. BUSH: Exactly.G. BUSH: It was never good enough.BARTIROMO: I bet. The painting that -- well, we're showing some pictures right now. The painting that you did of Vladimir Putin --G. BUSH: Yes.BARTIROMO: Is great.G. BUSH: Thank you.BARTIROMO: I have a picture of it and I remember the line, and you looked into his eyes and saw his soul.G. BUSH: Saw his soul, yes.BARTIROMO: A lot of people feel like, if there's anybody who knows Putin the best out of everybody, it's you?G. BUSH: Yes, I know him pretty well.BARTIROMO: Are you surprised at what has taken place about Russia?G. BUSH: Well, what happened was, when I looked into his eyes and saw his soul, Russia was broke. I mean short term broke. And the price of oil goes up and Putin changed. And, look, he's a -- he's a very smart tactician. The problem is, his whole attitude and -- on most issues is, I'm going to win and the U.S. is going to lose. And so, I'm not very surprised. I mean he is a very aggressive person who wants to reinstate Soviet influence, even though the Soviet no longer exists. And, therefore, I always felt it was very important for the United States to be very forceful in dealing with Putin. Not belligerent, but forceful. And, you know, he's good.BARTIROMO: Are we still being forceful enough or are we not being forceful enough?G. BUSH: Well I don't know. You know, Maria, I made it a point not to second guess my successors. You know, we'll just have to see. All I know is, I used to tell people -- like they'd say, well, Putin's popular I said, yes, I'd have been popular if I owned one of the big networks, too.BARTIROMO: Right.G. BUSH: I mean there's no -- there's no media pushback on Vladimir Putin. Not much competition. So, he's got pretty free rein domestically, except for the fact that his economy isn't all that strong and the demographics in Russia aren't very positive.BARTIROMO: In fact, some people would say it's about the size of Texas.G. BUSH: Yes, well, a pretty good size.BARTIROMO: Well, it's a pretty good size, but relative to a county is the point that I --G. BUSH: No, there's no question.BARTIROMO: Mr. President, let me ask you a little about news because, of course, last week we saw President Trump pardon Scooter Libby.G. BUSH: Yes, good.BARTIROMO: Your reaction?G. BUSH: My reaction is, I'm happy for Scooter and his family.BARTIROMO: Did you see The Wall Street Journal headlined saying Scooter Libby was the soldier left on the battlefield?G. BUSH: No, I didn't see that. But, you know, I'm sure he's got some friends in the editorial board there. And, you know, as I said, I'm happy for his family and praying for Scooter.BARTIROMO: Mrs. Bush, you remain one of the most popular and loved first ladies of all time.G. BUSH: All right.BARTIROMO: And you have your own incredible leadership style. Do you want to pass on any words of advice to our current first lady, Melania Trump?L. BUSH: Well, no, I wouldn't give her advice. But I've met Melania. She invited me to tea at the White House. She's a beautiful woman, and very, very lovely. And I --G. BUSH: So are you, honey.L. BUSH: Oh, thank you darling. And I think she'll -- I think she will do really very well.BARTIROMO: And -- and before we go, Mr. President, as we see what's happening in the world today, from North Korea to Syria, we still have these radicals trying to undo who we are. Your thoughts on what to do and how to respond to what's happening.G. BUSH: Well, look, here's the thing. If you go down to our exhibit in the museum, there's a very powerful 9/11 exhibit.BARTIROMO: I've seen it.G. BUSH: There are two of them, here and Ground Zero. People are forgetting the lessons of 9/11. And one of the major lessons of 9/11 is, the human condition elsewhere matters to our national security. It's in our nation's interest for women to be successful in the Middle East, for example, or for civil society to take hold, because it's with civil society and people having a say in the future of their governments that the foundation for peace is laid. And so my thoughts are, remember the lessons of 9/11.BARTIROMO: And, Mrs. Bush, I want to thank you so much for what you've done for women.L. BUSH: Oh, thank you.BARTIROMO: In America we know that the battle is so much harder and tougher away from here --L. BUSH: That's right.BARTIROMO: Outside of America. But even here, women have a hard time breaking through that CEO corner office.L. BUSH: That's right. Well, I think that's changing for sure. And I'm happy about that. I'm happy that the whole trend that's started now, making sure that women and men, that everybody's included, at leadership, in leadership tables. And that's what our women's leadership, all the different types that we've done does is try to help women, especially across the broader Middle East, in north Africa, develop the institutions that will support their democracies. The ones we inherited that we didn't have to do anything for.BARTIROMO: And this doesn't happen by coincidence.L. BUSH: No.BARTIROMO: This happens as a result of leaders like yourself --L. BUSH: Oh, well, thank you.BARTIROMO: Pushing for change.L. BUSH: Thank you so much.G. BUSH: Or for men like me who've always been surrounded by strong women. My mother, my wife and now our daughters.BARTIROMO: And don't forget you've got a bigger and growing family.L. BUSH: Yes, two more little girls.G. BUSH: Oh, yes, two more girls.BARTIROMO: Hey, do you still go down and get Mrs. Bush coffee in the morning, like you said --G. BUSH: Yes, there's no down to it. We live on one floor and, yes, I do.L. BUSH: Yes, he goes across and brings me coffee.BARTIROMO: You're still bringing her coffee?G. BUSH: Yes, I am. Yes.L. BUSH: This morning.G. BUSH: Yes. Awesome example, isn't it, for husbands?BARTIROMO: You are.G. BUSH: First guy up, go get the coffee.BARTIROMO: It's wonderful (INAUDIBLE).L. BUSH: Let the dog out. Let the cat in.G. BUSH: Yes.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much.G. BUSH: Thank you, Maria, for having us.L. BUSH: Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Mr. President, Mrs. Bush, thank you.L. BUSH: Thank you.G. BUSH: And, again, I want to thank everybody across the nation for praying for dad and for being so thoughtful.BARTIROMO: How are the girls doing, your daughters? Are they emotional?G. BUSH: Yes, you know, but as I explained to them, we ought to be joyful that we had, one, such a wonderful woman in our lives, and, two, that she passed with such belief, strong belief, and that she truly was peaceful.BARTIROMO: Do you want to share anything she may have said to you in the final days?G. BUSH: Well, I told you about, you know, being pregnant -- been smoking and drinking when she was pregnant with me. Other than that, you know, it was just -- you know, mom, I, you know, I love you. And she would say, I love you too. Basically, what it was. And they weren't long, philosophical discussions at this point. It was just a reaffirmation of, in my case, 72 years of being with an awesome woman.BARTIROMO: And the world and certainly America was a lot better off as a result of her.G. BUSH: Sure, thank you.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much, Mr. President. Thank you, Mrs. Bush.L. BUSH: Thank you, Maria. Appreciate it.BARTIROMO: Great to see you both.L. BUSH: Thanks a lot.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: The president and the first lady were incredibly gracious and wonderful to our entire crew. We'll show you a photo coming up. But those are two class acts right there.Coming up, stunning moments caught on camera, this home explosion rattling a North Texas neighborhood, catching a police officer in the shock wave. What investigators say caused that blast.And the future of furniture, the new robot that can save your relationship by assembling that IKEA purchase.MCDOWELL: Welcome back. Let's take a quick check on the markets. Futures are pointing to a lower open, 19-point loss on the Dow Futures right now. Lindsey, give us a quick snapshot of how earnings have come in, 12 percent of companies that reported, 78 percent are beating earnings and revenue estimates. How does that stack up in past quarters, do you think?LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA: Well, so historically, 66 percent of companies beat on the bottom line. So that's a huge beat number. So, we're early in the season. But stocks aren't reacting well to this. On average, a company that's reported the stock has declined five percent on the day of the report.MCDOWELL: Great earnings out of the banks and the financial services companies. But not good enough because of the run-up, because of the overvaluation.BELL: Yes, of the 10 banks in have reported so far, pretty much every single one of them beat on the bottom line. There were a couple slight misses on the top line. But only two traded up. And that was Morgan Stanley which was basically flat on the day and then you also have Bank of America which was up half of a percentage point. And the Regional Banks really got hit hard. They traded up this year, year-to-date they were a little weaker last year on expectations of higher interest rates, potentially better loan growth. We're not getting that.MCDOWELL: We'll get Robert Wolf's take on that coming up since he run a big Wall Street firm. A police officer meantime says divine intervention saved his life. Brand-new dashcam video showing the officer nearly blown away when a home explodes in Texas. Cheryl Casone has more.CASONE: It doesn't even look real this video, Dagen. But look at it for yourself, if the officer had arrived any earlier, he may have died.That's officer Travis Hiser. Who's investigating an unlicensed driver who slammed into a home and hit a gas line. Well this is what happened. The officer -- everyone inside the home survived. One woman we should say this morning is still hospitalized after that incredible blast at that home.Well, China raising questions about Qualcomm's plan to buy NXP Semiconductor. A Chinese commercial officer says a review official -- excuse me, to review the $44 billion deal has found "issues that are hard to resolve." The Chinese government wants to be the last one to sign off on the chip deal. NXP's a Dutch company Qualcomm stays in the U.S. But this all comes as China and the U.S. are threatening each other with a potential trade war. Shares of Qualcomm are lower in the premarket, down more than 1.5 percent.Well, Procter & Gamble buying the consumer health business of German Merck. The deal worth 4.2 billion and it adds products like vitamins and food supplements to P&G's existing lineup over the counter medicines you probably know very well. Shares of Procter & Gamble down about 13 percent so far this year.And then finally check this out. This is pretty cool. A robot assembling an IKEA chair without having an emotional meltdown. Researchers in Singapore programmed this robot to come up with a plan to put together the chair. It took the robot, guys, 20 minutes to build it using 3D sensors who got the two robotic arms. The researchers put all the stuff -- you know how you open the box at IKEA and you put all the crap on the floor and you just try to make it work? That's what they did with the robot, 20 minutes. That would have taken me two hours.MCDOWELL: At least.WOLF: It would take me over two hours. I've done that many times I got the over and mine was over two.FORBES: How much did the robot cost?CASONE: Well, there's no price. I mean, they're still saying it's four or five years away. But please God, please let this robot work. Because assembling furniture is a nightmare.FORBES: Also assembling toys for kids for Christmas too.MCDOWELL: Yes, real quick to correct --WOLF: I'm asking up for Mulligan.MCDOWELL: OK, you're going to get a Mulligan. But last hour, we were talking about the death of Bruno Sammartino and we showed this photo. It was Ivan Koloff.WOLF: The Russian Bear.MCDOWELL: That's Ivan Koloff, correct? Right, but not -- you said it was Nikolai Volkoff.WOLF: Nikolai Volkoff.MCDOWELL: So, again --WOLF: The Russian Bear. My brother's going to be so upset that I didn't get that.MCDOWELL: Anyway, we corrected it because the viewer.CASONE: Geez Robert.MCDOWELL: -- the viewers called us out on it and we corrected it. Coming up, East Coast football fans may be able to catch a few more plays this fall. The NFL making changes to its primetime lineup, next.MCDOWELL: The NFL could move the chains on primetime games. The league reportedly planning to move up the Kickoff time for night games, Sunday night football games. Will start about 08:20 Eastern instead of 08:30. Monday and Thursday night games could also kick off slightly earlier. Joining me now, Private Wealth Advisor Jordan Waxman and Managing Partner at HSW Advisers and Former NFL Linebacker Ryan Nece. Ryan, GOOD -- earlier start time is good for the game?RYAN NECE, MANAGING PARTNER, HSW: Yes, it's great for the game, get people watching the game more, hopefully engaging the fans better. So, absolutely it's a great move by the NFL.MCDOWELL: So, what about the draft, the draft is coming up. We're about a week away from the draft beginning. I told you all when you sat down, I watch the NFL combine.NECE: I was shocked when you said that.MCDOWELL: (INAUDIBLE) I'm so desperate. I hate baseball. I can't wait for the NFL start -- to start.NECE: Now, the NFL is obviously an exciting business. It's a year-round business with the combine, the draft and obviously the season. But the draft is an opportunity for some young men's lives to be changed. I think that's why we're glued to it. It's just such a passionate time. And now, they've taken it around the country. It's a road show. It's a money maker for the league because it's so exciting. And for me, I'm looking at the draft and I'm looking at a young man coming out of UCLA, that could be a number one draft, Josh Rosen. So, it's a good time to be glued in as a Bruin Alumni.MCDOWELL: Yes, even that -- so, while the top picks at the draft will sign big money deals, nearly 80 percent of NFL players go broke within three years of retirement, this is according to Sports Illustrated. Jordan, what should be the first financial steps? What are you -- what are you doing, you two together, to work on basically financial planning? I have incredibly, incredible sympathy for these NFL players, really risking their lives and their health.JORDAN WAXMAN, ADVISOR, PRIVATE WEALTH: It's different from the other sports.MCDOWELL: Very different.WAXMAN: I mean, it's much more -- it's much more aggressive on the field, careers are much shorter. We have 40 athletes and entertainers that we take care of in part of our business and the toughest thing for an aggressive, young athlete is to think defensively, is to think, well, I'm going to make more money than I've ever made in my life, probably more than I expected to when I was a young kid, how do I make that last? Short career, long retirement.Everyone here at the table we're going to work until we have -- we've got gray hair and probably have a short retirement, if that at all. These guys have to budget, whatever they're going to make as upfront money in the draft has to last until the first paycheck in the fall. Whatever money comes then has to last until the end of the season and then beyond that. Because the paychecks stop in January or February. And then they have to think asset protection, insurance, you know, basically protect their downside.MCDOWELL: Ryan, real quick --NECE: Yes, Jordan you know, makes some great points. But knowledge is power, right?MCDOWELL: Amen to that.NECE: And the more the athletes can educate themselves and understand all the different facets that come along with managing your wealth, the better off they're going to be. Too much is given, much is required. And you got to have advisers like Jordan and others to help them through that process.MCDOWELL: Ryan, when you come back. I want to talk about the draft next week.NECE: I'm in -- I'm in.MCDOWELL: Ryan Nece, Jordan Waxman.WAXMAN: I hope you're accurate with your boy from UCLA being number one.NECE: That's what I like (INAUDIBLE)Load-Date: April 20, 2018End of Document

Clinical Trial: Leveraging WeChat Social-Media and Messaging Platform to Increase Physical Activity in Chinese Glaucoma PatientsUS Fed NewsJune 26, 2018 Tuesday 4:30 PM  ESTCopyright 2018 HT Media Ltd. All Rights ReservedLength: 622 wordsDateline: U.S. BodyU.S., June 26 -- ClinicalTrials.gov registry received information related to the study (NCT03567226) titled 'Leveraging WeChat Social-Media and Messaging Platform to Increase Physical Activity in Chinese Glaucoma Patients' on May 29.Brief Summary: The positive effects of exercise on ocular health are known, but modern lifestyles have made it difficult to incorporate physical activity into the daily lives of the Chinese population. Recent studies suggest that exercise plays an important role in lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) by protecting retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in glaucoma patients as well as other potential neuroprotective benefits. Increasing the amount of physical activity within the Chinese glaucoma population may have marked effects on health outcomes and coincides with the Chinese government's efforts to make exercise an urgent public health priority. There is a need for innovative, cost-effective, and proven interventions to promote exercise behavior change and social media platforms may be able to fill this niche. WeChat is China's largest and most frequently used social media and messaging application with an estimated 570 million users. The platform has been found to be a useful tool in healthcare settings to promote weight-loss, health literacy, and patient adherence in Chinese populations. This study is a 5-weeks randomized control trial with three total study visits. 80 patients from an academic glaucoma clinic in Wenzhou Medical College will be randomized into two groups. The intervention group will be enrolled into an Official WeChat Group and receive periodic reminders to exercise, health education materials, and motivational incentives. The control group will receive weekly reminders and leaflets at the first clinic visit. Patients' daily step data will be monitored using an Accelerometer WGT3X-BT. The intervention duration will include an initial clinic visit, a one-week follow-up after wearing the accelerometer, and then a subsequent one-month follow-up visit after wearing the accelerometer. At the one-week visit the patient will be randomized and at the subsequent one-month visit there will be a close-out discussion about the study. In addition to collecting step data at clinic visits, investigators will also measure patients' visual field tests, optical coherence tomography angiography (angio-OCT), and intraocular pressure (IOP) using Goldmann Tonometry. The investigators' hypothesis is that using an Official WeChat Patient Group will be a robust and effective stimulus to increase physical exercise.Study Type: InterventionalCondition: GlaucomaIntervention: * Behavioral: WeChat GroupConsenting participants will be randomized to either the intervention or the control arm after successfully wearing an accelerometer for one week. The WeChat Group will be a community forum to share information, encourage each other, and receive communications from the study team. In addition, the study team will disseminate the following information through the group:Daily/Weekly Reminders to exerciseHealth education materials regarding glaucoma and general health and exerciseMotivational contentSurveys to gauge what information participants found most interesting and useful to help them exercise* Behavioral: CounsellingStudy participants in the control group will receive a handout telling them to increase walking and will be counseled that walking may be helpful for the eye at the return visitRecruitment Status: Not Yet RecruitingSponsor: Johns Hopkins UniversityInformation provided by (Responsible Party): Johns Hopkins University For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at content.services@htlive.comLoad-Date: June 26, 2018End of Document

Hospital Management Asia announces conference in Wuxi, ChinaPR NewswireMay 3, 2018 Thursday 9:00 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 489 wordsDateline: SINGAPORE, May 3, 2018 Body Hospital Management Asia (HMA), the region's leading thought-leadership platform organized by Clarion Events for senior-level decision makers in hospitals and the healthcare industry, has announced an inaugural China-focused conference in Wuxi, China from July 18-20, 2018 leading up to the flagship HMA event later this year (September 13-14, Bangkok).Well-known for connecting industry leaders and igniting conversations for future innovation, this will be the series' first event in China in its 17-year history -- reflecting the country's dramatic economic growth across all industries, including healthcare. According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China, nearly 2,000 new private hospitals have emerged in China, boosting the total number of hospitals to 29,000, up from 6 per cent in 2015. Among them, 160,000 are privately owned while 130,000 are public hospitals. The number of private hospitals has more than doubled in the past six years, from 7,068 in 2010 to 160,000 in 2016[1].  Attendees will learn more about the One Belt, One Road (OBOR) initiative -- an effort by the Chinese government to recreate the Silk Road through infrastructure projects that connect Asia, Europe and Africa, as well as its impact on the development of healthcare."Hospital Management Asia has grown to become one of the leading conferences for hospital owners and senior management personnel for over a decade. We are excited to build a bridge between Chinese hospitals and our international HMA community with endless possibilities as a united front in healthcare to tackle common challenges such as servicing the ageing population and the accessibility of healthcare in larger countries," said Richard Ireland, Managing Director of Clarion Events."As such, our presence in China is imperative as the country has been regarded as the largest innovation superpower of the world. Chinese hospitals are already using frontier technologies such as the Internet of Things to close the gap in their healthcare system, and we look forward to learning about how they are working towards being hospitals for the future."Programme highlights include plenaries discussing the future trends of Healthy China 2030, the impact of block-chain technology in healthcare and innovation projects in hospitals.With the Chinese Hospital Association as its advisor, this conference is co-hosted by Wuxi No. 2 Hospital and supported by the European Union of Private Hospitals.For more information, please visit the website athttp://www.hospitalmanagement-china.com.[1]Credit: National Bureau of Statistics of China.

Polar power play: Who will prevail at the rooftop of the world?; The world's superpowers rush to exploit the Arctic as the sea ice melts.The Christian Science MonitorMay 18, 2018 FridayCopyright 2018 Christian Science Publishing Society All Rights ReservedSection: WorldLength: 3122 wordsByline: Peter Ford Staff WriterBodyRune Rafaelsen is a man with a very ambitious plan.Mr. Rafaelsen is the mayor of Kirkenes, a small port at the northern tip of Norway, 250 miles inside the Arctic Circle. Kirkenes is the end of the line for a passenger ship that trundles daily up the coast through scenic coastal fjords. Its 3,000 inhabitants live in the shadow of an iron-ore works that went bankrupt in 2015. The town is best known for its dramatic northern lights and king crabs, the massive crustaceans with legs the size of sculling oars.And yet snowy Kirkenes is the place that Rafaelsen envisions as a "new Singapore," the crucial pivot of a revolutionary global trade route across the rooftop of the world linking the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.It seems an unlikely prospect. But as melting sea ice opens up the Arctic for the first time in tens of thousands of years, the remote and inhospitable region is emerging as one of the last frontiers of a great geopolitical clash. The world's big powers - including Russia, China, and to a lesser extent the United States, as well as several other countries - are competing fiercely to exploit the Arctic's shipping lanes, tap its vast booty of minerals and energy, and otherwise gain an economic and military toehold in this strategically important region.All this may turn out to make Rafaelsen's dreams for Kirkenes less quirky than they sound. Indeed, it could put the remote town, where whale steak enlivens local restaurant menus and tourists can stay in one of the world's few ice hotels, at the eye of a gathering storm of interest, investment, innovation, and tussles for influence in the Arctic."The Arctic has turned into an incredibly interesting place where climate change and geopolitics are becoming intertwined," says Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center, a US research institute in Boulder, Colo.***While countries have been laying plans to take advantage of the Arctic for decades, it's only been recently that the climate and technology have changed enough to allow those ideas to move from notional to something more concrete. Earlier this year the Eduard Toll, a liquefied natural gas (LNG) tanker named after a 19th-century Russian Arctic explorer, was the first ship to make the winter voyage from one end of the Arctic to the other without assistance from an icebreaker."Pretty crazy things are happening," says Dr. Serreze. Arctic temperatures are rising twice as fast as the world average. The four lowest measurements of winter ice were all taken in the past four years, and summer ice cover levels have been falling by 13 percent each decade since 1981.By midcentury, experts predict, there will be no ice in the Arctic during the four months of summer, just a blue ocean. That probably means no polar bears either.But in Kirkenes it means much more than that. "I'm not in favor of global warming but it's happening, and in Kirkenes we need to exploit it," says Kenneth Stålsett, head of the local government's business development arm.Mr. Stålsett, an enthusiastic young man with a doctorate in innovation and strategy (read "disruption"), is promoting the construction of a railroad south from Kirkenes toward European markets. The scheme has won tentative approval from the Norwegian and Finnish governments.It is not hard to see where supporters of the project expect to find enough cargo to make the rail link profitable. On one wall of Rafaelsen's office, near his ceremonial mayor's chain, hangs a scroll decorated with a scarlet Chinese paper-cut - a souvenir from one of his visits to the Middle Kingdom.The Chinese government is putting high hopes in a future Arctic Northern Sea Route: One trial voyage from Shanghai, China, to Rotterdam, Netherlands, took less than two-thirds of the time it would have taken to sail via the Suez Canal - the normal route going from east to west - with corresponding savings in fuel and other costs.China's state-owned shipping giant ­COSCO has begun building ice-rated container vessels for its own fleet and is building smaller ice-capable ships that the world's biggest shipper, A.P. Moller-Maersk, will operate on feeder routes. "We are closely following the development of the Northern Sea Route," says Anders Boenaes, head of network for the Danish firm.Beijing is more enthusiastic, taking "a forward-leaning view of a long-term strategy," says Heather Conley, an Arctic affairs specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington.A Chinese white paper published in January, setting out Beijing's Arctic policy for the first time, declares its intention to build a "Polar Silk Road" by developing Arctic shipping routes.Russian President Vladimir Putin told the Russian parliament in March that his goal was to make the Northern Sea Route, which runs along 3,000 miles of his country's coastline and which Moscow claims - controversially - as its internal waters, "a truly global and competitive transport route."He will face many hurdles. There are no ship repair or rescue facilities yet in the Arctic. Nautical charts are poor or nonexistent. Communications are difficult at high latitudes. Drift ice poses a threat to shipping lanes, and the weather is often foul.An ocean-to-ocean transit route "may be possible, but there is a lot of work to be done," cautions Lawson Brigham, a former US Coast Guard icebreaker captain who now teaches at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. To think that the 15,000 vessels that currently transit the Suez Canal each year are going to switch soon and join the two dozen now working the Arctic passage is "nuts," he says. But the Northern Sea Route "could be a seasonal supplement."That's all that Stålsett says he needs to make his port and railroad vision come true in Kirkenes, the first European port where a Chinese vessel traversing the Arctic could berth. Even if just 10 percent of China's seaborne exports pass through the town by 2030, that would mean "an enormous increase in Arctic shipping," he points out. "We need to start building tomorrow."***It is hard to imagine how dramatically such a project would transform Kirkenes, a snow-muffled utilitarian town tucked between barren hills and the sea. The community grew up around the now-defunct iron-ore works, but today half the residents work in government administration.Tourism is the biggest local industry, serving the passengers from the coastal cruise ship. In winter, which is most of the time here, visitors line up to take king crab "safaris." Guides zip them by snowmobile across frozen fjords, drill holes in the ice, set traps, and then pull up the mammoth creatures, which everyone later eats, one succulent leg at a time. Others stay in the hotel sculpted seasonally entirely out of ice and snow, an experience that local boosters - perhaps with too much marketing time on their hands during the endless winter nights - call very "snice."The scruffy port of Kirkenes does a steady business servicing Russian trawlers and the Chinese seismic exploration vessels that are seeking oil for Russian companies. The town of red, white, and mustard-colored homes sits just nine miles from the Russian border and includes among its inhabitants the occasional reindeer herder.The idea of becoming a global trade hub appeals to everybody in Kirkenes, says Terje Sirma-Kristiansen, who works on a nearby military base. "It would mean growth now that the mine has closed," he says. "We can't live from hunting anymore."While the town may experience a boom, so, too, will the cobalt waters off its coast. Russia, for one, plans to ship more and more of its mineral wealth along the Northern Sea Route to international markets.The Eduard Toll, the vessel that made a historic winter passage last January, serves Yamal LNG, a $27 billion liquefied natural gas plant on the Yamal Peninsula in Siberia that Mr. Putin opened in December. The ship is one of four such tankers; 11 more are on order, their reinforced hulls enabling them to steam east or west, to Asia or Europe, throughout the year. By 2023, they will be leaving the newly built port of Sabetta at the rate of more than one ship a day.And it is not just a matter of hydrocarbons. The Arctic contains a wealth of resources that are "absolutely crucial to major economies in the 21st century," according to Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson, a former president of Iceland who now chairs the Arctic Circle, a forum for debate on regional issues.In Russia, Norilsk Nickel is the world's largest producer of nickel and palladium and a big supplier of platinum and copper. On Canada's Baffin Island, one of the world's highest quality iron-ore mines began shipping in 2015. Chinese and Australian firms are preparing to mine zinc, uranium, and rare-earth metals in Greenland.Finnish, Japanese, Norwegian, Russian, and Chinese officials are discussing laying a 6,500-mile fiber-optic cable across the Arctic Circle by as early as 2020. The region is rich in geothermal and wind energy potential.In more traditional terms, the US Geological Survey has estimated that about 30 percent of the world's undiscovered gas and 13 percent of the world's undiscovered oil may be found within the Arctic Circle. Most of those reserves lie on land or inside one country or another's maritime exclusive economic zone. But that hasn't stopped Denmark, Canada, and Russia from filing rival competing claims to parts of the Arctic seabed that each argues is an extension of its continental shelf.The Kremlin claims almost half of the Arctic Ocean floor, and a patriotic Russian adventurer once descended in a mini-submarine to plant a titanium Russian flag on the seabed directly beneath the North Pole.The US, though a polar nation because of Alaska, can press no such territorial claims, since any petitions will be decided by a commission under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which Washington has not ratified.***These varied resources and their newfound accessibility have invested the Arctic with unprecedented geostrategic importance. Russia, whose territory makes up more than half of the Arctic Ocean's coastline, is best placed to benefit. After two decades of neglect in the wake of the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, Moscow has been making some decisive moves in the region."The wealth of Russia will grow with the expansion into the Arctic," Putin said at last December's annual Kremlin press conference.Already, the Arctic accounts for 20 percent of Russia's exports and 10 percent of its gross domestic product. The LNG plant at Sabetta, and a sister plant due to come on line within five years, will make Russia "the new Qatar," according to Novatek, the private Russian company leading the project.Putin is reestablishing the military control over the Arctic that had lapsed for two decades. In recent years, the Russian Army has rebuilt or expanded six forward bases on Arctic islands and is equipping them to host tactical combat aircraft, according to a Danish Defence Intelligence Service report.The Arctic is also home to most of Russia's strategic submarine fleet and to its fleet of icebreakers - the largest in the world. The Kremlin has ordered two ice-breaking warships, armed with cruise missiles, for delivery in 2020."To what end is opaque," Adm. Paul Zukunft, the US Coast Guard chief, told Defense & Aerospace Report last December. "Is it to make this an area that the United States would be denied access? We have to assume that the answer to that question ... is yes."***China is no less ambitious with its Arctic plans. When five Chinese Navy vessels sailed into US territorial waters off Alaska in September 2015, they were not threatening force but sent a very clear message: that Beijing wants to become a polar great power. President Xi Jinping has been working assiduously ever since to advance that goal, which he first declared in 2014.China has branded itself a "near Arctic state" (although Beijing is closer to the Equator than to the North Pole) and has stepped up its Arctic activities dramatically over the past decade. Beijing's strategy fits a grander vision than that of most Western governments: Along with the deep seabed and outer space, the North and South Poles are defined as China's "new strategic frontiers" in a 2015 national security law."China now has more money to spend on new polar infrastructure, such as bases, planes, satellite installations, and icebreakers, than any other state," says Anne-Marie Brady in her new book, "China as a Polar Great Power."The time and money that China has devoted to Arctic scientific research has earned it observer status on the Arctic Council, the intergovernmental forum for cooperation among Arctic states.Beijing has won recognition as a legitimate business partner with its heavy investment in the region: Chinese companies own 30 percent of Yamal LNG, and Chinese firms are making billion-dollar investments in biofuel projects in northern Finland and mining ventures in Iceland and Greenland. Chinese shippers are testing Arctic routes for their commercial viability."We are seeing an incredible uptick in Chinese economic and commercial activity," says Ms. Conley.In its white paper setting out policy for the region, Beijing focused on shipping and energy and mineral exploration, as well as fisheries and tourism. Behind those priorities, however, lie deeper geopolitical ambitions - notably becoming a great maritime power. "China's thinking on the polar regions demonstrates a level of ambition and forward planning that few, if any, modern industrial states can achieve," writes Dr. Brady in The Polar Journal, of which she is the executive editor.China's white paper was released in January, just three days after Stålsett, Kirkenes's development director, came out with his study on a rail line to the Norwegian town. He couldn't believe his good fortune. Here was a major Chinese policy statement whose sections on Arctic shipping suddenly gave him a whole new level of credibility. Geologists from the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications are already running tests on the proposed site of a new shipping port in Kirkenes.***No such grand infrastructure projects are under way in the US Arctic. None, in fact, have been built since the trans-Alaska oil pipeline was commissioned 40 years ago. "We are an Arctic nation," says Dr. Brigham, "but we lack infrastructure." All the practical stuff, such as docks, ship repair facilities, and salvage operations, "is missing," he adds.The US certainly has plenty of military assets in the Arctic, with airbases, ballistic defense installations, and nuclear missiles at Thule in Greenland and Fort Greely in Alaska. Its nuclear submarines prowl beneath the Arctic ice. In March, US forces staged exercises testing new under-ice weapons systems.But since the cold war ended, the US Navy has focused more on the Pacific than the Arctic, even though the region "is vitally important to our interest" for economic and national security reasons, former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told researchers at the Wilson Center, a think tank in Washington, last November. "We're late to the game."Mr. Grímsson, the former Icelandic president, jokes that during his years in office, from 1996 to 2016, he visited Alaska more often than any of his US counterparts.The US Coast Guard has only one fully functional icebreaker. For eight months of the year, no US Navy surface vessels can function in Arctic waters.The Russians "have got all their chess pieces on the board right now, and right now we've got a pawn and maybe a rook," Zukunft lamented last year at an event hosted by the CSIS. "If you look at this Arctic game of chess, they've got us at checkmate right at the very beginning."Congress has now approved the funds to build a new icebreaker, due to launch in 2023, but the problem, says CSIS expert Conley, is that Washington "does not have a long-term strategic view of the Arctic, and a new icebreaker will not solve the policy deficit."Perhaps even more ominous for the US, China and Russia are cooperating closely in the region. The Arctic could become a testing ground for a challenge to Washington and the prospects for a new, more multipolar world order."That is a very powerful development," says Arild Moe, an Arctic affairs analyst at the Fridtjof Nansen Institute in Oslo. "Stronger relations between Russia and China could affect the international power balance."***One reason for all the jockeying in the region is that no single rule book exists to oversee everyone's ventures. Unlike Antarctica, which is governed by international treaty, the Arctic is regulated by an incomplete and ad hoc patchwork of institutions, treaties, and agreements."Never before have nations faced the challenge of building a rules-based system for an area the size of Africa ... that plays such a crucial role in the global climate," says Grímsson.Yet nations are finding ways to work together. Strikingly, nine countries and the European Union agreed last December to ban fishing in the high seas of the Central Arctic Ocean for at least 16 years. That will allow scientists to measure and track the region's fish stocks and marine ecology before anyone has a chance to ravage them.A similar mood of cooperation prevails in the Arctic Council, the intergovernmental forum concerned with sustainable development, where deals on scientific cooperation, oil spill management, and search and rescue protocols have been hammered out.Several Arctic states have competing claims to the seabed, but the disputes have not turned ugly. Western relations with Russia and China on Arctic issues are generally cordial, too, diplomats say. Russia is interested above all in preserving the regional stability that will attract foreign investment, and China - aware of its rapacious reputation - "is very careful not to do anything that would incite suspicion or criticism from other nations," says Grímsson.But the stakes are high for nations whose welfare, from their weather to their wealth and security, depends on the Arctic. Sovereignty disputes are likely to break out as Arctic waters become more accessible and valuable as trade routes and resource reserves. Nations are unlikely to always agree on how far environmental safeguards should limit mining and drilling.Such risks are not enough to dim the visionary glint in Rafaelsen's eye. As he looks out from his office onto Kirkenes's quiet, snowbound streets, the mayor with the white goatee and affable demeanor sees a town that will be transformed. "If this all works," he says, "it will be a game changer for world transport. And it will mean a completely new Kirkenes. We have to be ready for this."  Graphic MAYOR RUNE RAFAELSEN PETER FORD/THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITORLoad-Date: May 18, 2018End of Document

Trump flouts national security advice in bid to save ZTEPolitico.comJune 6, 2018 Wednesday 9:56 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 1270 wordsByline: mmatishak@politico.com,  (Martin Matishak)BodyThe Pentagon was so concerned about the "unacceptable risk" posed by the Chinese tech giant ZTE in April that it banned sales of its cellphones on military bases. The same month, British officials cautioned that using ZTE equipment was so problematic national security concerns "cannot be mitigated."Yet the Trump administration's proposal to reverse a Commerce Department ban forbidding American companies from selling to ZTE doesn't protect U.S. customers from surveillance, hacking or digital espionage, say experts and lawmakers. Negotiators are reportedly close to a deal on that proposal.Critics of that proposal say it shows that President Donald Trump is willing to ignore the national security advice of his own intelligence and defense officials in his pursuit of a larger trade agreement with China. Even Trump's new CIA Director Gina Haspel said during her recent confirmation hearing that she would not use ZTE phones."This is where you have unanimity between both the Obama and Trump administration officials talking about ZTE and Huawei - this is a national security concern," Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the Intelligence panel's ranking member, told POLITICO. "You don't trade that away in an off-again, on-again conflict with China."Washington lawmakers, military and intelligence officials, as well as cybersecurity experts have become increasingly worried about the risks posed by foreign tech companies, especially considering Russia's campaign to influence the 2016 presidential campaign. The overarching concerns with both ZTE and another Chinese telecom giant, Huawei, are the companies' close ties to the Chinese government, spurring concerns that Beijing could harness technology sold in the U.S. to steal data, eavesdrop on conversations, or even carry out cyberattacks. The FCC expressed similar concerns about ZTE and Huawei and has proposed steps to discourage American companies from using their products. In another sign of Washington's unease about foreign tech companies, Warner raised issues Wednesday about Facebook's practice of sharing users' data with Huawei and other Chinese tech firms, such as TCL and Lenovo. "Concerns about Huawei aren't new - they were widely publicized beginning in 2012, when the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence released a well-read report on the close relationships between the Chinese Communist Party and equipment makers like Huawei," Warner said in a statement. "The news that Facebook provided privileged access to Facebook's API to Chinese device-makers like Huawei and TCL raises legitimate concerns."The growing focus on threats posed by foreign tech companies isn't limited just to China. For instance, Washington recently banned federal agencies from using software from the cybersecurity vendor Kaspersky Lab, which was founded in Moscow and still has offices in Russia. Agencies are in the process of stripping Kaspersky programs from their networks. Many experts say that technology providers based in China and Russia could become portals for espionage either knowingly or without the firms' knowledge."The concern is you have big telecom backbone manufacturers and the Chinese government uses one of them for espionage purposes, why wouldn't they use the other?" said James Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former Commerce Department official, referring to past allegations against Huawei.For its part, Huawei has rejected any notion that it's a proxy for Chinese espionage operations. "We remain committed to openness and transparency in everything we do and want to be clear that no government has ever asked us to compromise the security or integrity of any of our networks or devices," it said in a statement about the Pentagon's ban on sale of its phones.ZTE could not be reached for comment and has not issued a statement about U.S. officials' security concerns regarding its products.The unease about the potential for a deal to rescue ZTE has led to multiple legislative attempts to block the agreement. The House included a provision in its annual defense policy bill, barring government agencies from using ZTE technology and banning the Defense Department from working with contractors that do business with the company. The Senate version of the bill restricts the ability of the Trump administration to lift the penalties on ZTE without congressional notification and tacit approval."I don't want their hardware in our country," said Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger (D-Md.), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee when it issued a 2012 report originally outlining the potential danger that ZTE and Huawei posed to U.S. national security."If they have their hardware in our country, they will have the ability to get in the back door," said Ruppersberger, adding nothing in the companies' behavior had changed since he co-authored the report.The proposal to reverse the ban, which resulted from the company's dealings with Iran and North Korea, would force ZTE to pay more than $1 billion in fines, embed American compliance officers in the company, and hire new management, according to an earlier POLITICO story on the proposal.Early last month, ZTE announced it was shuttering major operations as a result of the ban. Trump first tweeted that he would help save ZTE on May 13, as he sought to engage Chinese officials in trade talks. In a May 25 tweet, he said, "Senator Schumer and Obama Administration let phone company ZTE flourish with no security checks. I closed it down then let it reopen with high level security guarantees, change of management and board, must purchase U.S. parts and pay a $1.3 Billion fine. Dems do nothing....""It remains a bad deal," Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) told POLITICO. Along with fellow Senate Intelligence Committee member Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Rubio introduced legislation earlier this year that would block the U.S. government from buying or leasing telecommunications equipment from the two Chinese companies.While Reuters reported Tuesday that ZTE signed an "agreement in principle" to the Commerce ban, a department spokesperson told POLITICO that "no definitive agreement has been signed by both parties."Even if lawmakers are able to block or delay a deal to undo the Commerce ban on ZTE, experts say it may be too late to remedy any threat posed by ZTE. "It's probably about 10 years too late and it's pretty much irrelevant," said Lewis, the cyber expert who worked at Commerce, referring to the fact that ZTE technology is already widely used across the US telecommunications landscape."This happens every few years with a company," according to Lewis. "They're caught violating sanctions on Iran or violating export control requirements or doing something illegal and the ingredients in the response are always the same: big fine, strengthen compliance and change in management team." Still, he said, the proposed deal with the ZTE includes the "right fixes" at this moment.But David G&oacute;mez, a retired FBI executive, described the potential penalties and changes to ZTE's management team as "symbolic.""I don't think that they affect the root problem that ZTE and other telecommunications companies in China that are now looking at the U.S. market represent," said G&oacute;mez, a senior fellow at the George Washington University Center for Cyber and Homeland Security.The U.S. should scrap the proposed deal, he said. "The company either complies with U.S. trade requirements and opens up their software and hardware to complete inspections by the U.S. government ... or we just don't buy it."Load-Date: June 7, 2018End of Document

Foreign companies complain that will limit or outright block their access to those industries.___Q: WHAT HAVE THE TWO SIDES DONE SO FAR?A: Trump approved tariff increases on steel and aluminum imports in response to complaints American suppliers were threatened by unfairly low-priced imports.The United States buys little steel and aluminum from China, but analysts said Beijing felt compelled to respond, partly as a "warning shot" ahead of an expected fight over technology.On Monday, China raised duties on pork and aluminum scrap by 25 percent and on apples, sparkling wine, steel pipes and other goods by 15 percent. The measures appeared to target farm states that voted for Trump in 2016.___Q: WHAT IS AT STAKE?A: The United States and China have the world's biggest trading relationship. That gives them an incentive to reach a settlement to avoid damaging many businesses on both sides.Exports to China directly or indirectly supported 1.8 million new U.S. jobs in 2015, according to the U.S.-China Business Council, an industry group.Wednesday's Chinese tariff hike targeted goods including soybeans, the biggest U.S. export to China, and aircraft.Economists and investors worry other governments might respond by raising their own import barriers. That might chill commerce and set back a global economic recovery.___Q: WHY DOES TECHNOLOGY MATTER?A: The latest tariff dispute strikes at the heart of technology industries China's leaders consider vital for its economic future.Chinese factories assemble most of the world's smartphones, computers and consumer electronics. But Beijing wants to capture more of the profits by becoming a creator of technology instead of a low-cost factory.The ruling Communist Party is spending heavily and pressing foreign companies for help in developing Chinese global competitors in telecoms, electric cars and other technologies.Washington is trying to promote technology exports to offset its imports from China and support higher-paying jobs.American and other foreign companies have long complained about Chinese rules that require automakers and others to work through local partners, compelling them to share technology with potential competitors.Last month, Washington filed a World Trade Organization complaint over Chinese policy it said limits the ability of foreign companies to control and profit from their technology.___Q: WHAT'S LIKELY TO COME NEXT?A: Chinese officials have acknowledged their country has more to lose in a full-blown conflict with Washington but say they will endure the cost.Beijing has options for retaliating against U.S. companies operating in China. Regulators could withhold licenses or alter other conditions to hamper foreign business activity.Some economists have suggested Washington could target state-owned enterprises that dominate industries including energy, telecoms and banking.Europe and Japan also have grumbled about the monopolies and other privileges given to SOEs.

Regulators could withhold licenses or alter other conditions to hamper foreign business activity.Some economists have suggested Washington could target state-owned enterprises that dominate industries including energy, telecoms and banking.Europe and Japan also have grumbled about the monopolies and other privileges given to SOEs. Washington may try to get them to jointly pressure Beijing for change.Load-Date: April 5, 2018End of Document

Analytics 4 Life® Expands Its Medical Advisory Board with Global Experts in Cardiology; Experience and global insights to guide Company's clinical program expansion to ChinaBusiness WireMay 23, 2018 Wednesday 11:00 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Business Wire, Inc.Distribution: Business Editors; Health/Medical WritersLength: 1117 wordsDateline: RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C. & TORONTO BodyAnalytics 4 Life , a digital health company applying the power of artificial intelligence to develop solutions that improve existing care pathways, today announced that it has expanded its Medical Advisory Board with the addition of two global experts in cardiology and digital health. Junbo Ge, M.D. is president of the Chinese Society of Cardiology and chairman of the China Cardiovascular Association. Sanjeev Bhavnani, M.D. is a cardiologist and physician-scientist at the Healthcare Innovation and Practice Transformation Laboratory at Scripps Clinic."We are thrilled to welcome Drs. Bhavnani and Ge to our esteemed Medical Advisory Board. Their experience and insight will be critical as we seek to bring AI-backed, cloud-based diagnostic imaging to resource-constrained countries," said Don Crawford, Analytics 4 Life chief executive officer. "Dr. Bhavnani's passion for and expertise in running digital health clinical trials and Dr. Ge's deep-understanding of the Chinese healthcare system will help propel Analytics 4 Life's efforts to initiate its first clinical trial in China."Cardiovascular diseases are the number one cause of death globally - more people die annually from them than from any other cause with approximately 7.3 million deaths worldwide due to coronary artery disease (CAD). While there is global progress being made in the prevention of cardiovascular disease, an ongoing shortage of physicians, limited medical resources and challenges relating to access to healthcare have made it difficult for providers to deliver quality care."The estimated national rate of percutaneous coronary interventions in China have increased more than twenty-fold over a ten-year period," continued Don Crawford. "But millions of people in rural areas do not have access to modern healthcare, resulting in overwhelming patient traffic in several major urban hospitals. There is a profound need to reduce cardiovascular disease-related deaths through earlier detection and timely diagnosis with non-invasive testing. We're encouraged by CorVista's promising potential as an alternative cardiac imaging technology that could make a significant difference in the lives of the millions of people suffering from CAD in China and globally."Sanjeev Bhavnani, M.D. currently serves as a practicing cardiologist and physician-scientist at the Healthcare Innovation and Practice Transformation Laboratory at Scripps Clinic. Dr. Bhavnani was chair of the Writing Committee for the American College of Cardiology's Roadmap for Innovation, a policy statement on healthcare transformation through new technologies. He was a Qualcomm Wireless Health Scholar at TSRI, where he was involved in the design of next generation digital medicine clinical trials. The health innovation laboratory develops new methods to innovate care delivery and to translate the advances in medical technologies - mHealth, big data, and precision medicine - to patient care.Dr. Bhavnani leads a team of clinicians, researchers, biomedical engineers, translational informaticians and biostatisticians. Collectively, they have executed clinical trials in the United States and in resource limited areas - Uganda, India, and Mexico. These programs have created the first smartphone-connected mHealth clinics and have enrolled 20,000+ patients.He serves on innovation advisory boards of several national medical societies and has worked with digital health think tanks to develop the CONNECT legislation and 21st Century Cures Act. He has authored over 50 peer-reviewed publications and has received multiple grants exploring new methods for large scale community engagement with new technologies.Junbo Ge, M.D. currently serves as president of the Chinese Society of Cardiology, chairman of the China Cardiovascular Association, and chief of the cardiology department at Zhongshan Hospital at Fudan University. He is passionate about improving CAD diagnosis and treatment through innovation, making extraordinary advancements in intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). Dr. Ge has been responsible for over 20 scientific research projects supported by the Chinese government. He has published over 300 papers in internationally-recognized journals, edited 20 books, and co-edited more than 20 monographs and textbooks. He is the chief editor of Internal Medicine (8th edition), Practice of Internal Medicine (15th edition), and Cardiology Plus and deputy editor of Herz. Dr. Ge was bestowed one of China's most prestigious academic awards, the Scholars of the Yangtse River. He has also been awarded the National Labor Medal by the National Federation of Trade Unions, the Tan Jiazhen prize in life sciences, and the national "Bethune" Medal, and the Shanghai Science and Technology Association has named him among the "science and technology elite."About Coronary Artery DiseaseCoronary Artery Disease (CAD) is when the heart becomes weakened from a deficient supply of oxygenated blood due to a buildup of plaque in the coronary arteries, which can lead to blood clots, chest pain, and cardiac arrest. CAD affects approximately 15.5 million Americans and is the number one cause of death in the U.S.About CorVista(TM)CorVista is designed to scan signals emitted by the body with a synchronous array of seven sensors without radiation, exercise, or pharmacologic stress. After the signals are acquired, the signal package is instantaneously transmitted to the cloud where it will be analyzed by a machine-learned algorithm to generate a unique image and a heart model indicating areas of potential heart disease associated with the presence of CAD. The results of the test are displayed on a secure physician web portal that, in combination with a patient's medical history, risk factors, and symptoms, are used by the interpreting physician to recommend further treatment. CorVista is an investigational device limited by federal law to investigational use. CorVista is not available for commercial distribution.About Analytics 4 LifeAnalytics 4 Life is pioneering digital health using artificial intelligence to develop a completely new form of medical imaging. With an initial focus on coronary artery disease, Analytics 4 Life is advancing a novel, radiation-free, and exercise-free cardiac imaging technology aimed at improving existing care pathways.

REPORT: UYGHURS IN CHINA FORCED TO INSTALL SURVEILLANCE APP THAT LEAVES THEIR DATA UNSECUREDStates News ServiceApril 10, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 666 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:By Roseanne GerinThe surveillance application that authorities in northwestern China's volatile Xinjiang region are forcing Muslim Uyghurs to install on their mobile devices to track online activities and censor content lacks encryption to secure the transfer of collected data, according to a report by a group that supports global internet freedom technologies.The Open Technology Fund (OTF), a program under the auspices of U.S.-government funded Radio Free Asia, said in a recent report that the app sends the unsecured data to an outside central server operated by the Chinese government.Authorities began requiring citizens in Xinjiang to install the Android app known as Jingwang, or "clean internet" in Chinese, on their mobile devices last year in another move to fuel repression in the heavily surveilled Muslim-majority region.Local police have enforced the policy with spot-checks of mobile phones on the street.The app records each device's identifying information, scans the device's external storage for files it deems "dangerous," and transmits the information to the server without encryption, said OTF, which supported the investigation of Jingwang by third-party cybersecurity researchers."This means all the data the app collects is transmitted to the unknown entity on the receiving end in a way that allows someone with a trivial amount of technical knowledge to intercept and potentially manipulate," OTC said in a blog post on Monday."While the forced installation of this mobile app serves to monitor the activities of an entire population, the broad scope of the app combined with its lack of basic security only further harms those required to use it," the post said.Though the server scans the transmitted data for information the government disapproves of and prompts users to delete it, it is not yet clear what content is being targeted for deletion, said Omer Kanat, chairman of the executive board of the World Uyghur Congress based in Munich, Germany."The fact that this makes all private data easily hackable by criminals further demonstrates that the government has little concern for its citizens," he said in a statement to RFA's Uyghur Service on Tuesday. "Uyghurs are once again the first targets of new repressive technology."Police continue to physically check Uyghurs' phones on the streets of Xinjiang to ensure they have installed the app, Kanat said."This new technology means that Uyghurs have lost whatever privacy they might have had, making it extremely dangerous for them to express any dissent or dissatisfaction," he said. "This reminds everyone that they are constantly being monitored, and this 'automated repression' is truly something unprecedented, and again shows how Orwellian life has become for Uyghurs."Authorities in Xinjiang also use surveillance cameras and facial-recognition systems to monitor Uyghurs, and have recently expanded their activities by implementing a "big data" program, called the Integrated Joint Operations Platform (IJOP), designed to predict offenses, Human Rights Watch said in a report it issued in March.The system combines information from police reports, vehicle checkpoints, banking and health-care records, and technological collection systems into a single program for police reference, the report said.Since Xinjiang party chief Chen Quanguo was appointed to his post in August 2016, he has initiated unprecedented repressive measures against the Uyghur people and ideological purges against so-called "two-faced" Uyghur officialsa term applied by the government to Uyghurs who do not willingly follow directives and exhibit signs of "disloyalty."China regularly conducts "strike hard" campaigns in Xinjiang, including police raids on Uyghur households, restrictions on Islamic practices, and curbs on the culture and language of the Uyghur people, including videos and other material.Additional reporting by Alim Seytoff for RFA's Uyghur Service.Load-Date: April 11, 2018End of Document

China slashed tariffs on imported cars: Here's what happens nextMcKinsey & CompanyJune 11, 2018 MondayCopyright 2018 McKinsey & Company, Inc All Rights ReservedLength: 432 wordsByline: McKinsey & CompanyHighlight: After the Chinese government's decision to reduce import tariffs on passenger cars and auto parts, will imports of foreign cars skyrocket? Not so fast.Body Link to Image In an attempt to further open up the Chinese market to international players, China recently announced it would lower import tariffs on passenger cars. The announcement has attracted significant attention in the global auto industry, and has been celebrated in the US as a major step forward. Let's take a look at what is happening behind the headlines, and what this move will mean for the automotive industry.China's Ministry of Finance (MoF) ended speculation on May 22 with its announcement to cut import tariffs on passenger vehicles from 25% to 15%, and on auto parts from 8-25% to 6%. Many global auto players reacted swiftly with press releases confirming the intent to pass on tariff reductions to China's car buyers by lowering list prices. Domestic automakers may use this move to cut prices on their vehicles to stay competitive.Should we now expect imports of foreign cars into China to sky-rocket, fueling the growth of international car companies?Not so fast! China today is already the largest car market in the world and foreign brands hold more than 60% market share - largely through joint ventures with domestic automakers. Only a small share (3% or 1.2 million vehicles) of all cars sold in China were imported in 2017. Despite the recent cuts in tariffs, we don't anticipate this to change very much.Almost all major global auto brands have localized manufacturing and now assemble a large part of their global product line-up in China. The are only two notable exceptions, which have not yet set up local manufacturing in China.Let's take a closer look at the type of cars China is importing today. Approximately 80% of imported vehicles are considered premium or luxury, compared to just 8% of the overall market. Top imported brands include three German and two Japanese brands; only one American brand can be found among the top 15.And the "winner" is? Most likely Japan. At 350,000 vehicles exported to China last year, Japan is the largest source of imported vehicles in China and tariff cuts may well protect Japan as a manufacturing base for premium vehicles. Seventy-percent of all exports to China come from just three countries: Japan, followed by the US and Germany.We should know very soon how brands take advantage of this new move, and how Chinese consumers react to lower car prices. In the meantime, I'd like to invite you to comment on this topic. What impact do you expect lower tariffs will have on sales of imported cars in China?McKinsey InsightsFor more of McKinsey's latest thinking, install our app for iPad or            Android.Load-Date: February 20, 2020End of Document

Too many jobs in China lost. Commerce Department has been instructed to get it done!"

CHINA DETAINS FOUNDER, MEMBERS OF PRISONER SUPPORT CHAT GROUPStates News ServiceApril 18, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 767 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Authorities across China have criminally detained several members of a social media support group for the families of prisoners of conscience, and called several others in for questioning by their local state security police, RFA has learned.Guo Qingjun, who founded the group and moderates it on the popular WeChat app, was detained by police in Jiangxi's Ganzhou city on April 11 on suspicion of "picking quarrels and stirring up trouble," according to a copy of his detention notification.Group volunteers Liu Chunlin, Dai Xiangnan, Sun Wenke and Li Xiaohong have also been detained, along with volunteers identified only by their online nicknames Baoluo, Lubi and Meizi Qingxuan, sources said.An employee surnamed Zhang at a nongovernmental organization in the southern city of Shenzhen said that Dai Xiangnan and two others hailed from the city, and were known to have been criminally detained."So far I have only received a notification of detention for Dai Xiangnan, and I'm not sure about the others, but I'm guessing they're being held on the same charges," Zhang said."We are currently arranging for a lawyer to visit them, but we won't know the details of the situation until those meetings have taken place," he said.Zhang said the chat group members had been detained because they organized support for the families of Chinese prisoners of conscience.No official documentsA source who asked to remain anonymous said the family of Sun Wenke, a resident of the southwestern city of Chongqing, had also received verbal notification of his detention for 30 days, but that no official document had been issued so far."There have been a few [group chat members] who have received these notifications," the source said. "This was a coordinated operation to detain them, led by the state security police in Ganzhou.""Sun Wenke from Chongqinghis kid is just four months old, and he was arrested just as he was arriving home," the source said. "A bunch of them restrained the kid and the mother, and another grabbed Sun Wenke, which was pretty traumatic for them all.""The family said they were shown a notification of detention for 30 days, but then it was taken away again, not handed over to them."She said the detainees not resident in Ganzhou had been taken to detention centers in the city anyway."They are all being held in locations in and around Ganzhou," the source said. "One is in the Ganzhou Detention Center, and another in the nearby county detention center. There were eight of them, and I don't think they're being held together."She said another Chongqing member of the group had been called in for questioning by police, and had made a statement.The crackdown had targeted "hundreds" of people across China, she added, drawing parallels with a crackdown on rights lawyers begun in July 2015."According to my understanding, a lot of them are Protestant Christians, good people, and they were willing to selflessly invest their spare time and energy in helping people in difficulty," she said. "They set up a chat grouphow can that be the same as opposing the [ruling Chinese Communist] party and opposing the state? It's too harsh."'Illegal social organizations'The detentions come as China's civil affairs ministry said it had banned more than 300 "illegal social organizations" across the country that hadn't registered with the authorities.The groups ranged from special interest groups for people practicing sports and hobbies, like martial arts, to associations for "public welfare," the ministry said in a recent announcement.Xia Ming, a political science professor at the City University of New York, said the government fears that if it shows any relaxation on controls of civil society groups, that they will become a hotbed of demands for political reform and democratization."One issue is that civil groups and nongovernmental groups ... can act as gateways for religion, and also for underground economic activity such as informal lending networks," Xia said.He said one example was the recent closure of online satire app Neihan Duanzi, which had more than 100 million members across the country."The Chinese government was terrified by Neihan Duanzi, because it connected members in a network with its own peculiar culture, slogans, secret sayings to use to other members and so forth," Xia said.According to Xinhua News Agency, the crackdown on "illegal" social organizations will last until the end of this year.Reported by Yang Fan and Jia Ao for RFA's Mandarin Service.

China is prepared to react using regulations of that organization and "other necessary ways" to safeguard their rights and interests, he added.  Trump authorized the end of March to impose tariffs on imports of products originating in China worth up to 60,000 million dollars a year as compensation for alleged theft of technology and trade secrets.  In turn, China's measure of raising tariffs on US products includes imports worth an annual value of around 3,000 million dollars.  rmorales@eleconomista.com.mx Load-Date: April 3, 2018End of Document

The USTR was required to share the list of products by Friday under President Trump's China tariff proclamation signed on March 22.Said Alliance for American Manufacturing (AAM) President Scott Paul:* If China doesn't play by the rules, it should lose some of its access to the U.S. market. Otherwise, nothing will change and American jobs will continue to suffer at the hands of Beijing's practices.* Manufacturers of everything from computers to metals have been forced to compete against the very products they spent years and significant financial resources to develop after Chinese companies illegally lifted proprietary knowledge.* The administration's proposed actions will help restore some balance with China, as well as recreate an environment where some of the millions of jobs we've lost to China will have a chance of being restored.A recent USTR report found that "the protection and enforcement of trade secrets in China is a serious problem" and highlighted concerns with the Chinese government and military infiltrating American computer systems "for the purpose of providing commercial advantages to Chinese enterprises."[Category: Manufacturing]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6230469 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: April 4, 2018End of Document

CHINA SHUTTERS MAOIST 'UTOPIA' WEBSITE, SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTStates News ServiceMay 21, 2018 MondayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 678 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:The ruling Chinese Communist Party has pulled the plug on a prominent Maoist website amid concerns it may boost extreme nationalist sentiment that could undermine Beijing's trade policy with the United States, analysts said on Monday .The leftist ideology website Utopia issued a statement on Saturday confirming that its WeChat account had been permanently deleted because the website had previously published multiple articles that "disclosed the capitalistic media's suppression of left-wing voices."WeChat, China's hugely popular social media platform, said Utopia had "violated relevant laws and regulations."Utopia's main website was also unavailable at its usual address on Monday . The site's organizers have previously said they believe that permanent closure is only a matter of time.Commentators said the closures may have more to do with current diplomatic negotiations, however.The administration of President Xi Jinping has shut down a number of Maoist websites in recent years, including Utopia, but has generally allowed them to re-open after politically sensitive events, such as the trial of leftist icon and former Chongqing party chief Bo Xilai in 2013.Former Tsinghua University politics lecturer Wu Qiang said the closures could be a bid to suppress nationalist commentary following apparent concessions made by Beijing in trade negotiations with the U.S."The outcome of the negotiations ... has been a substantial compromise, and basically the acceptance of the U.S. position overall," Wu said."So China's internet authorities have cracked down in a preventative manner and banned this Maoist social media account, to stop them from attacking the negotiations as ... selling the country out by treaty, or betrayal," he said.Leftist criticism of international concessions made by the Chinese government focuses on the country's memory of unequal and humiliating treaties signed with colonial powers in the 19th century, including the 1842 Treaty of Nanking that ceded the island of Hong Kong to Britain "in perpetuity."Shoring up ties with the leftHong Kong current affairs analyst Willy Lam said the kind of leftist, ultra-nationalist ideology espoused by sites like Utopia has a considerable following in China."It wouldn't be out of the question for leftist sites like Utopia to post articles attacking Xi Jinping as being incapable of protecting China's sovereignty, and as making huge concessions and caving in to U.S. imperialism," Lam said."This would be anathema to Xi Jinping."Lam said Xi also needs to preserve his relationship with the left wing of the party."Xi Jinping has partially restored Maoist thinking, and some of his own thinking has partially revived Mao Zedong's ideas," he said. "Some people even think that Utopia follows some of Xi Jinping's ideas, policies and viewpoints.""There has always been an extreme leftist current of thought, both within the party and outside it, and it looks as if it will be here for a long time to come," Lam said.Utopia's editor-in-chief Diao Weiming was among 36 people killed when a tour bus crashed in North Korea last month.Diao had also headed Utopia's travel arm, Spark Travel, which ran revolutionary tours to the the secretive Stalinist regime commemorating China's role in fighting the U.S. during the Korean War (1950-1953).Zhejiang-based rights activist Chen Zongyao told RFA at the time that China's state media had played down the accident, and hadn't named Diao, during its coverage."There has been very little information on this bus crash here in mainland China," Chen said. "There is almost nothing. Official media reports are just saying that 36 people died in a bus crash.""Previously, when there have been accidents [involving Chinese nationals] in foreign countries, they have been reported in great detail, but ... there have been no details about who these people were," he said.Reported by Gao Feng for RFA's Mandarin Service, and by Wen Yuqing for the Cantonese Service.

Foxconn chief: US-China dispute over tech, not tradeAssociated Press InternationalJune 6, 2018 Wednesday 12:15 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 360 wordsByline: By KELVIN CHAN, AP Business WriterDateline: SHENZHEN, China BodySHENZHEN, China (AP) - The CEO of Taiwan's Foxconn, which assembles Apple iPhones and other products for tech companies, said Wednesday that Washington's dispute with China is over technology rather than trade.Terry Gou's comments at an event celebrating the anniversary of Foxconn's first investment in mainland China follow Beijing's threat to scrap trade deals with Washington if President Trump's tariff hike on Chinese technology products goes ahead."This is not a trade conflict but rather a competition and comparison of technology," said Gou in a video shown in the event.Foxconn Technology Group, also known as Hon Hai President Industry Co., is the world's biggest contract manufacturer of smartphones, computers and other technology products and is trying to develop its own brands.Gou said he planned to take part in a groundbreaking ceremony at the end of June for a $10 billion factory that Foxconn is set to build in Wisconsin, but he and other executives said nothing else about the company's plans there or other initiatives outside China.The White House renewed its threat last week to impose 25 percent tariffs on Chinese technology-related goods in response to complaints Beijing steals or pressures foreign companies to hand over technology. It is due to release a list of products on June 15.The Chinese government warned Sunday it would scrap deals to narrow its trade surplus with the United States by purchasing more American soybeans and other goods if Trump's tariffs went ahead.In the video, Gou said the "U.S. is significantly ahead of China" in areas such as jet engines and semiconductors."If China is to catch up, allow me to speak frankly, it must be in the areas of manufacturing technology, design and manufacturing technology," he said.

US proposes to apply more tariffs to Chinese importsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishApril 4, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 445 wordsBody The government of President Donald Trump on Tuesday strengthened its energetic approach to trade by recommending the application of tariffs of 25% on imports of Chinese goods for 50,000 million dollars to sanction the alleged theft of US technology by Beijing.  The Office of the United States Trade Representative presented a list of 1,300 Chinese products that would be affected, including industrial robots and telecommunications equipment.  The proposed tariffs would not take effect immediately: a period to receive public comments ends on May 11, and there is a hearing on the tariffs scheduled for the 15th of the same month. Businesses and consumers will have the opportunity to lobby for some products to be removed from the list or to include others.  The move could exacerbate trade tensions with China, which on Monday imposed taxes on US goods worth $ 3 billion in response to tariffs that the United States imposed earlier on steel and aluminum imports.  On Tuesday night, the Chinese embassy in Washington said in a statement that it "strongly condemns" the measure: "it does not serve the interests of China or the United States, much less the interests of the global economy."  China is likely to retaliate against new US tariffs, targeting the technology and advanced manufacturing sectors that Beijing is supporting. The sanctions were designed to punish China for resorting to energetic tactics in its purpose of becoming a global technological powerhouse.  These include putting pressure on US companies to share technology in exchange for access to the Chinese market, forcing US firms to license their technology in China under unfavorable conditions, and even hacking the computer systems of US companies for steal business secrets  The government tried to draw up the list in a way that limits the consequences of tariffs on US consumers, while hitting Chinese imports that benefit from Beijing's advantageous technology policies. However, some detractors say that the Americans will end up injured.  "If you intend to sanction a $ 50 billion trade, you will inevitably hurt someone, and someone will protest," said Rod Hunter, a former National Security Council officer and currently a partner in Baker & McKenzie LLP.  Even representatives of the technology industry, which for years have complained that China has stolen US technology and discriminated against US companies, censored Washington's most recent measure.  "Unilateral tariffs could do more harm than good and serve little to address problems in China's policies (on intellectual property) and technology transfers," said John Frisbie, president of the US-China Business Council. Load-Date: April 4, 2018End of Document

China is beating the United States in the race for 5GCNNMoney.comApril 16, 2018 Monday 6:46 PM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: TECHNOLOGYLength: 678 wordsByline: Julia HorowitzBodyThe global race to own 5G technology is on ? and China is winning.That's according to a report released Monday by CTIA, a trade association for the US wireless industry.The study, which was conducted by telecom research firms Analysys Mason and Recon Analytics, found that China is most prepared to launch the next generation of super-fast wireless technology. South Korea is second, while the United States ranks third.Around the world, mobile carriers are sprinting to adopt 5G networks, which will ultimately be used to power self-driving cars, virtual reality and smart cities. Whichever country gets 5G networks up and running first will have a huge global investment and hiring advantage.The US wireless industry is prepared to pump $275 billion into 5G deployment, which could boost the country's GDP by $500 billion, according to a 2017 Accenture study also commissioned by CTIA.It could also create up to 3 million new jobs, the study said. Tens of thousands of people will be tapped install the necessary infrastructure. After that, high-speed 5G will support all kinds of technology companies, especially those that focus on smart cities ? and they'll start hiring, too.But right now, there's fear that the United States lags behind."China holds a narrow lead in the race to 5G thanks to a combination of industry momentum and government support," the CTIA report said.There are a few things that need to happen to make a broad commercial rollout of 5G a reality.Companies need to invest in research and development. But the government also needs to allocate additional radio frequencies to wireless companies, since 5G requires more bandwidth.The CTIA analysis notes that Beijing plans to deploy 5G on a large commercial scale by 2020, and China's top carriers have all pledged to meet this timeline. The Chinese government has also already distributed a good portion of the necessary radio frequencies."China benefits from extensive coordination between government and industry when it comes to telecom," said Dan Hays, a consultant at PricewaterhouseCoopers who specializes in telecom issues.South Korea, meanwhile, gained a lot of momentum due to this year's Winter Olympics, which provided "a focal point for early investment, research, and trials," according to the report.The United States, in third place, remains "near the top," the report said. Wireless providers like Verizon and AT&T are charging ahead, and want to start launching their 5G technology in select markets before the end of 2018.Despite the current state of affairs, many experts still believe the United States could come out on top in the end."We may have lost some early battles in the war for 5G supremacy, but we haven't yet lost the war," Hays said.However, some obstacles remain.The United States needs a clearer schedule for the allocation of radio frequencies, like what's been announced in China and South Korea, CTIA said. Plus, lawmakers still need to enact some necessary legislation to make way for an infrastructure overhaul, according to the report.CTIA itself is lobbying for such reforms."The United States will not get a second chance to win the global 5G race," CTIA President Meredith Attwell Baker said in a statement. " ... Today's research highlights the importance of policymaker action in 2018."The US government has indicated before that it wants to win the 5G race, and is cognizant of the threat coming from China.Last month, President Donald Trump blocked Broadcom's $117 billion bid for Qualcomm due to national security concerns.The deal, which would have combined two computer chip makers, had been under investigation by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS.The inter-agency panel, which vets deals that could give a foreign investor control of a US business, said one big concern is that a takeover would cause the United States to fall behind on the development of 5G technology, allowing China to take the lead.Qualcomm, a leader on 2G and 3G wireless network technology, has been investing heavily in 5G research.Load-Date: April 26, 2018End of Document

Following Security Threats, Murphy Calls on Sec. Mattis to Ban Defense Department Use of Foreign-Made Commercial Drones & Instead Support U.S. Drone ManufacturersTargeted News ServiceMay 8, 2018 Tuesday 7:02 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1131 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe office of Sen. Christopher Murphy, D-Connecticut, issued the following news release:U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) wrote a letter to U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) Secretary James Mattis on Tuesday expressing concern that the U.S. government continues to use drones manufactured in China even after DoD has deemed them as potential national security threats. Citing the "cyber vulnerabilities" posed by these foreign-made unmanned aerial systems (UAS), Murphy called on Mattis to provide him with an update on DoD policy regarding the use of commercially available drones manufactured in foreign countries, and asked Mattis to consider banning the use of foreign-made drones until further threat-assessments have been completed. As the author of the BuyAmerican.gov Act and the American Jobs Matter Act, Murphy also emphasized that American UAS manufacturers are ready to fill DoD's needs.Despite several memos from the Departments of the Army and Navy, and from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement stating that Da Jiang Innovations - a Chinese manufacturer of drones used by the U.S. government - provided critical infrastructure and law enforcement data to the Chinese government, the U.S. government continued to purchase UAS from Da Jiang Innovations."I am writing with concern over the continued use by the Department of Defense of commercial unmanned aerial systems (UAS) that at least three separate agencies have found pose a potential national security threat," Murphy wrote. "These vulnerabilities pose a tremendous national security risk, as the information obtained by the Chinese government could be used to conduct physical or cyber-attacks against U.S. civilian and military targets."Murphy continued, "The burgeoning domestic UAS industry is currently competing with artificially priced foreign products that have been dumped in our domestic market. With some assistance, U.S. manufacturers are ready to fill your Department's needs. Our adversaries will always see value in surveilling our critical infrastructure, and without a trusted domestic source of UAS, we will continue to be vulnerable."The full text of the letter is below and available online (https://www.murphy.senate.gov/download/drone-letter):The Honorable James N. MattisSecretary of DefenseWashington, DC 20301-3010Dear Mr. Secretary:I am writing with concern over the continued use by the Department of Defense of commercial unmanned aerial systems (UAS) that at least three separate agencies have found pose a potential national security threat.As you know, a Department of the Army memo dated August 2, 2017,[1] ordered a halt to the use of commercially available UAS made by Da Jiang Innovations (DJI). That memo stated that there was "increased awareness of cyber vulnerabilities associated with DJI products," and referenced two previous reports from 2017 from the Army and Navy highlighting security threats posed by DJI's UAS.Subsequently, on August 9, 2017, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement issued an Intelligence Bulletin asserting that DJI was using its products to provide critical infrastructure and law enforcement data to the Chinese government.[2] The Bulletin stated that "much of the information collected includes proprietary and sensitive critical infrastructure data, such as detailed imagery of power control panels, security measures for critical infrastructure sites, or materials used in bridge construction."These vulnerabilities pose a tremendous national security risk, as the information obtained by the Chinese government could be used to conduct physical or cyber-attacks against U.S. civilian and military targets. For example, according to the August 9th Bulletin, DJI focused on targeting utility companies responsible for providing drinking water to major American cities.Given the directive in the August 2017 Army memo, I was extremely concerned to learn of active U.S. government solicitations, including one from the Department of the Army, for DJI UAS. One such solicitation, Benning375EMB0007[3], for 16 DJI UAS, was awarded on April 18, 2018. These 16 UAS add to a fleet of hundreds of previously purchased DJI UAS that were in operation prior to the August 2017 memos.Since it appears that Benning375EMB0007 was awarded contrary to the August 2017 directive, I ask that you provide me an update on the DoD policy regarding the use of UAS owned by or manufactured in a foreign nation, and whether the DoD still believes DJI UAS pose a security risk. I encourage you to consider a DoD-wide directive banning the use of UAS owned by or manufactured in a foreign nation at a minimum until further threat-assessments can be completed.More broadly, since 2017, the Departments of Transportation, Agriculture and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have also issued solicitations for DJI UAS. Given the potential national security risk, and the fact that threat information led to the discontinuation of DJI drones by the Army was based on classified information, do you believe that your Department has any responsibility in alerting other agencies of these potential vulnerabilities? If there are additional resources or authorities that you believe are necessary in order to coordinate a government-wide review of foreign owned or manufactured UAS, I stand ready to assist you.This situation underscores a concern I have raised with several of your predecessors. These Chinese-made UAS are just a small part of the deluge of foreign-made military equipment purchased by the Department of Defense. I have always been a strong advocate of strict enforcement of the Buy American Act and other statutes that require the U.S. government to purchase American-made manufactured goods.

MURPHY CALLS ON SEC. MATTIS TO BAN DEFENSE DEPARTMENT USE OF FOREIGN-MADE COMMERCIAL DRONES AND INSTEAD SUPPORT U.S. DRONE MANUFACTURERSStates News ServiceMay 8, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 1108 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Connecticut Senator Christopher Murphy:U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) wrote a letter to U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) Secretary James Mattis on Tuesday expressing concern that the U.S. government continues to use drones manufactured in China even after DoD has deemed them as potential national security threats. Citing the cyber vulnerabilities posed by these foreign-made unmanned aerial systems (UAS), Murphy called on Mattis to provide him with an update on DoD policy regarding the use of commercially available drones manufactured in foreign countries, and asked Mattis to consider banning the use of foreign-made drones until further threat-assessments have been completed. As the author of the BuyAmerican.gov Act and the American Jobs Matter Act, Murphy also emphasized that American UAS manufacturers are ready to fill DoDs needs.Despite several memos from the Departments of the Army and Navy, and from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement stating that Da Jiang Innovations a Chinese manufacturer of drones used by the U.S. government provided critical infrastructure and law enforcement data to the Chinese government, the U.S. government continued to purchase UAS from Da Jiang Innovations.I am writing with concern over the continued use by the Department of Defense of commercial unmanned aerial systems (UAS) that at least three separate agencies have found pose a potential national security threat, Murphy wrote. These vulnerabilities pose a tremendous national security risk, as the information obtained by the Chinese government could be used to conduct physical or cyber-attacks against U.S. civilian and military targets.Murphy continued, The burgeoning domestic UAS industry is currently competing with artificially priced foreign products that have been dumped in our domestic market. With some assistance, U.S. manufacturers are ready to fill your Departments needs. Our adversaries will always see value in surveilling our critical infrastructure, and without a trusted domestic source of UAS, we will continue to be vulnerable.The full text of the letter is below and available online:The Honorable James N. MattisSecretary of DefenseWashington, DC 20301-3010Dear Mr. Secretary:I am writing with concern over the continued use by the Department of Defense of commercial unmanned aerial systems (UAS) that at least three separate agencies have found pose a potential national security threat.As you know, a Department of the Army memo dated August 2, 2017,[1] ordered a halt to the use of commercially available UAS made by Da Jiang Innovations (DJI). That memo stated that there was increased awareness of cyber vulnerabilities associated with DJI products, and referenced two previous reports from 2017 from the Army and Navy highlighting security threats posed by DJIs UAS.Subsequently, on August 9, 2017, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement issued an Intelligence Bulletin asserting that DJI was using its products to provide critical infrastructure and law enforcement data to the Chinese government.[2] The Bulletin stated that much of the information collected includes proprietary and sensitive critical infrastructure data, such as detailed imagery of power control panels, security measures for critical infrastructure sites, or materials used in bridge construction.These vulnerabilities pose a tremendous national security risk, as the information obtained by the Chinese government could be used to conduct physical or cyber-attacks against U.S. civilian and military targets. For example, according to the August 9th Bulletin, DJI focused on targeting utility companies responsible for providing drinking water to major American cities.Given the directive in the August 2017 Army memo, I was extremely concerned to learn of active U.S. government solicitations, including one from the Department of the Army, for DJI UAS. One such solicitation, Benning375EMB0007[3], for 16 DJI UAS, was awarded on April 18, 2018. These 16 UAS add to a fleet of hundreds of previously purchased DJI UAS that were in operation prior to the August 2017 memos.Since it appears that Benning375EMB0007 was awarded contrary to the August 2017 directive, I ask that you provide me an update on the DoD policy regarding the use of UAS owned by or manufactured in a foreign nation, and whether the DoD still believes DJI UAS pose a security risk. I encourage you to consider a DoD-wide directive banning the use of UAS owned by or manufactured in a foreign nation at a minimum until further threat-assessments can be completed.More broadly, since 2017, the Departments of Transportation, Agriculture and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have also issued solicitations for DJI UAS. Given the potential national security risk, and the fact that threat information led to the discontinuation of DJI drones by the Army was based on classified information, do you believe that your Department has any responsibility in alerting other agencies of these potential vulnerabilities? If there are additional resources or authorities that you believe are necessary in order to coordinate a government-wide review of foreign owned or manufactured UAS, I stand ready to assist you.This situation underscores a concern I have raised with several of your predecessors. These Chinese-made UAS are just a small part of the deluge of foreign-made military equipment purchased by the Department of Defense. I have always been a strong advocate of strict enforcement of the Buy American Act and other statutes that require the U.S. government to purchase American-made manufactured goods. If the hundreds of DJI drones purchased by the U.S. government in the last several years had been American-made, we would not have subjected ourselves to this massive potential intrusion and exploitation of sensitive U.S. sites.To the extent that your department is purchasing DJI drones because there is no suitable domestic alternative, I ask that you leverage existing resources like the Defense Production Act to bolster our domestic manufacturing capabilities. The burgeoning domestic UAS industry is currently competing with artificially priced foreign products that have been dumped in our domestic market. With some assistance, U.S. manufacturers are ready to fill your Departments needs.Our adversaries will always see value in surveilling our critical infrastructure, and without a trusted domestic source of UAS, we will continue to be vulnerable.Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to your response.Sincerely,Christopher S.

Global 3D Non-Volatile Memory Patent Landscape Report 2018: 3,400 Patent Families Categorized by Memory Types and Main ArchitecturesPR NewswireApril 19, 2018 Thursday 3:00 PM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1225 wordsDateline: DUBLIN, April 19, 2018 BodyThe"3D Non-Volatile Memory Patent Landscape Analysis"report has been added toResearchAndMarkets.com'soffering.A Young Market With Big Players And A Fast-Moving IP Landscape3D NAND Flash Memory devices appeared on the market in 2015 with 3D V-NAND - 32L of Samsung Electronics, followed in 2016 with 3D NAND V2 - 36L of SK Hynix, 3D NAND - 48L of Toshiba/SanDisk and 3D NAND - 32L of Micron/Intel. In recent times, it happens a lot in the 3D non-volatile memory (3D NVM) field with the acquisition of SanDisk by Western Digital, The investments of Chinese government in memory, or the Intel announcement of the Intel/Micron separation for further development of 3D NAND.We witnessed these evolutions in the IP landscape through the recent increase of 3D NVM-related patents filed by Chinese players (YMTC/YRST) and the numerous Samsung's patents published the latest months in China, USA and Korea, reflecting its willing to strengthen its 3D NVM IP portfolio. Also, we observed non-practicing entities (NPEs) like Conversant IP and WiLAN are entering the landscape. The presence of such companies is a tangible sign of the market explodes, heralding future IP battles when they will assert their patents to make money.In this report, the publisher has thoroughly investigated the patents related to 3D non-volatile memories and draws a picture of the current patent landscape and its potential evolution. SanDisk/Western Digital, Samsung and Toshiba are leading the 3D NVM patent landscape. They hold together more than 65% of the patents, Western Digital and Toshiba signed a JV extension until 2029, and Samsung and Western Digital renewed a patent cross-license agreement until 2024. On the other hand, we witnessed the emergence of Chinese players in the IP landscape.Patent activity related to 3D non-volatile memory (3D NVM) emerged in the 1990s with Toshiba and SanDisk. They signed Joint Venture agreement on Flash Memory in 1999. In the late 2000s, the research and development of 3D architectures appeared with IP related to BiCS (Bit Cost Scalable, SanDisk and Toshiba), TCAT (Terabit Cell Array Transistor, Samsung Electronics) and FG (Floating Gate, SK Hynix). Few years later Micron Technology developed also FG architecture, and Macronix International developed in 2015 SGVC architecture (Single Gate Vertical Channel). Since 2008, the number of patents related to 3D NVM has continuously increased, and today the 3D NVM patent landscape represents over 3,400 patent families including more than 9,400 patents. The landscape is very competitive, with several big companies and the entrance of Chinese players these last years.Identify Key Ip PlayersThis report reveals the relative strengths of the top patent owners derived from their portfolio size, patent citation networks, countries of patent filings, and current legal status of patents. Through this in-depth analysis, each of 6 major market players are profiled in this report: SanDisk/Western Digital, Micron Technology, SK Hynix, Toshiba, Samsung, Macronix International. Each profile includes a detailed portfolio analysis with IP dynamics, IP strategies and key patents linked to 3D NAND products. The 3D non-volatile memory patent landscape involves big companies, and this closed domain is very difficult to enter for newcomers. Nevertheless Chinese companies are entering the landscape thanks to their financial means and will maybe change the 3D NVM development of further 3D memory layers. Note that equipment manufacturers like Applied Materials, Tokyo Electron and Lam Research have less than 20 patents related to a 3D non-volatile memory.Identify Key TechnologiesThe 3,400 patent families selected for this study have been categorized by memory types and main architectures. This report reveals the IP strategy and technical choices of patent assignees. We analyzed the current IP position of key players regarding the type of memory (Flash, MRAM, ReRAM, PCRAM) and the architecture (vertical, cross-point). Some companies concentrate on one memory type such as Micron Technology on PCRAM as we expect it with the research on 3D Xpoint Memory. Others like SanDisk are involved in several 3D Non-Volatile Memories.Focus On ChinaWith all the funds invest by Chinese government in Memory, YMTC/YRST developed last year old generation 3D NAND 36L and try to catch up with major companies. However we can ask us, where do Chinese companies get their IP ? The China memory-related IP landscape is analyzed (2D, 3D, DRAM, SRAM, Flash, Emerging Memories) in order to understand the IP trends and technologies owned by Chinese players such as XMC, YRST, Tsinghua Unigroup, SMIC, etc. We also investigated what IP do the major companies involved in China have like Samsung, SK Hynix or Intel.Useful Patent DatabaseThis report also includes an Excel database containing the >9,400 patents analyzed in this study. This useful patent database allows multi-criteria searches and includes for each patent its publication numbers, the hyperlink to the original document, its priority dates, title, abstract, patent assignees, memory types/architectures, and current legal status.Key Topics Covered:1.

All Rights ReservedSection: RESEARCH ANALYSIS AND REPORTSLength: 1208 wordsBodyDublin, April  19, 2018  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The     "3D Non-Volatile Memory Patent Landscape Analysis"   report has been added to     ResearchAndMarkets.com's  offering.       A Young Market With Big Players And A Fast-Moving IP Landscape3D NAND Flash Memory devices appeared on the market in 2015 with 3D V-NAND - 32L of Samsung Electronics, followed in 2016 with 3D NAND V2 - 36L of SK Hynix, 3D NAND - 48L of Toshiba/SanDisk and 3D NAND - 32L of Micron/Intel. In recent times, it happens a lot in the 3D non-volatile memory (3D NVM) field with the acquisition of SanDisk by Western Digital, The investments of Chinese government in memory, or the Intel announcement of the Intel/Micron separation for further development of 3D NAND. We witnessed these evolutions in the IP landscape through the recent increase of 3D NVM-related patents filed by Chinese players (YMTC/YRST) and the numerous Samsung's patents published the latest months in China, USA and Korea, reflecting its willing to strengthen its 3D NVM IP portfolio. Also, we observed non-practicing entities (NPEs) like Conversant IP and WiLAN are entering the landscape. The presence of such companies is a tangible sign of the market explodes, heralding future IP battles when they will assert their patents to make money.In this report, the publisher has thoroughly investigated the patents related to 3D non-volatile memories and draws a picture of the current patent landscape and its potential evolution. SanDisk/Western Digital, Samsung and Toshiba are leading the 3D NVM patent landscape. They hold together more than 65% of the patents, Western Digital and Toshiba signed a JV extension until 2029, and Samsung and Western Digital renewed a patent cross-license agreement until 2024. On the other hand, we witnessed the emergence of Chinese players in the IP landscape. Patent activity related to 3D non-volatile memory (3D NVM) emerged in the 1990s with Toshiba and SanDisk. They signed Joint Venture agreement on Flash Memory in 1999. In the late 2000s, the research and development of 3D architectures appeared with IP related to BiCS (Bit Cost Scalable, SanDisk and Toshiba), TCAT (Terabit Cell Array Transistor, Samsung Electronics) and FG (Floating Gate, SK Hynix). Few years later Micron Technology developed also FG architecture, and Macronix International developed in 2015 SGVC architecture (Single Gate Vertical Channel). Since 2008, the number of patents related to 3D NVM has continuously increased, and today the 3D NVM patent landscape represents over 3,400 patent families including more than 9,400 patents. The landscape is very competitive, with several big companies and the entrance of Chinese players these last years.Identify Key Ip PlayersThis report reveals the relative strengths of the top patent owners derived from their portfolio size, patent citation networks, countries of patent filings, and current legal status of patents. Through this in-depth analysis, each of 6 major market players are profiled in this report: SanDisk/Western Digital, Micron Technology, SK Hynix, Toshiba, Samsung, Macronix International. Each profile includes a detailed portfolio analysis with IP dynamics, IP strategies and key patents linked to 3D NAND products. The 3D non-volatile memory patent landscape involves big companies, and this closed domain is very difficult to enter for newcomers. Nevertheless Chinese companies are entering the landscape thanks to their financial means and will maybe change the 3D NVM development of further 3D memory layers. Note that equipment manufacturers like Applied Materials, Tokyo Electron and Lam Research have less than 20 patents related to a 3D non-volatile memory.Identify Key TechnologiesThe 3,400 patent families selected for this study have been categorized by memory types and main architectures.  This report reveals the IP strategy and technical choices of patent assignees. We analyzed the current IP position of key players regarding the type of memory (Flash, MRAM, ReRAM, PCRAM) and the architecture (vertical, cross-point). Some companies concentrate on one memory type such as Micron Technology on PCRAM as we expect it with the research on 3D Xpoint Memory. Others like SanDisk are involved in several 3D Non-Volatile Memories.Focus On ChinaWith all the funds invest by Chinese government in Memory, YMTC/YRST developed last year old generation 3D NAND 36L and try to catch up with major companies. However we can ask us, where do Chinese companies get their IP ? The China memory-related IP landscape is analyzed (2D, 3D, DRAM, SRAM, Flash, Emerging Memories) in order to understand the IP trends and technologies owned by Chinese players such as XMC, YRST, Tsinghua Unigroup, SMIC, etc. We also investigated what IP do the major companies involved in China have like Samsung, SK Hynix or Intel.Useful Patent DatabaseThis report also includes an Excel database containing the >9,400 patents analyzed in this study. This useful patent database allows multi-criteria searches and includes for each patent its publication numbers, the hyperlink to the original document, its priority dates, title, abstract, patent assignees, memory types/architectures, and current legal status.Key Topics Covered:          1.
