China has found a new way to block banned wordsCNN WireMarch 1, 2018 Thursday 1:28 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 657 wordsByline: By Sherisse PhamDateline: HONG KONG (CNNMoney) BodyHONG KONG (CNNMoney) --  China's vast censorship apparatus is using a new technique for rooting out banned words, experts say. Censors are now scanning images shared in the hugely popular messaging platform WeChat and pulling them if they contain certain sensitive words or phrases, according to a new report from the SANS Internet Storm Center, an international monitoring organization. Some Chinese social media users had started using images featuring sensitive words because they could slip past the censors' software that scours the text of posts. Images are much harder to filter because they typically require humans to look at each one.Now Chinese authorities have found a way to use computers to do some of the work, according to the internet center's report.The new approach, which uses what's known as optical character recognition technology, is "highly sophisticated" and demands a lot of computing resources, said Johannes Ullrich, the center's director. Ullrich said he and his colleagues started seeing the new technique in action just this week. It first came to their attention when censors banned a photo of a breakfast recipe, much to the amusement of Chinese internet users. The image was banned because the recipe contained the word "end" (instructing cooks to "cut the end of mini sausages into an X-like shape"). In Chinese, "end" sounds like "emperor" or "throne." Those words became sensitive this week because they have been used to criticize President Xi Jinping. China on Sunday proposed amending its constitution to allow Xi to stay in power indefinitely, prompting dissidents and critics to call him "Emperor Xi." Other images featuring sensitive words related to Xi were also being pulled out of WeChat, which is owned by Chinese tech company Tencent. The SANS Internet Storm Center tested the new Chinese filter earlier this week with a list of 25 sensitive words and phrases, such as "long live my emperor," "immortality," "unlimited," and so on. The problematic images were censored while in the digital pipeline between WeChat senders and recipients. They simply didn't arrive. "It's about speed," Ullrich said. "They don't want to appear to remove images after the fact. They have a second or so to do it." The technique suggests tight collaboration between Chinese government censors and Tencent.Tencent and China's Cyberspace Administration did not respond to requests for comment. In order to operate their highly profitable internet businesses, Chinese tech companies have to play by the government's rules. US social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter are blocked in the country. The new image censorship on WeChat also appears to be very targeted. SANS Internet Storm Center tested it in a WeChat group with a few dozen people. Users in the US received and saw images containing banned words, while those in China did not.It's unclear how widely Chinese authorities have deployed the technology, though. CNN employees in Beijing and Hong Kong were able to share images with the sensitive words with each other on WeChat.Still, using the software to partially scan some of the huge number of images sent over WeChat highlights the trend of China's increasing automation of censorship."They are more throwing technology at the problem instead of people power, which they had done in the past," Ullrich said. That shift fits with China's vow to become a global leader in artificial intelligence. AI has been hailed as a life changing leap forward for humanity by some, and a harbinger of doom by others. In China, the rise of the technology will likely serve multiple purposes, says Ullrich. "With AI it's about keeping people happy by keeping them rich, and also keeping them happy by keeping bad information out of the country," said Ullrich. -- Qiaoqiao Yu, Nanlin Fang and Steven Jiang contributed to this report.TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

China criticizes US moves on intellectual property, telecomsAssociated Press Financial WireJanuary 18, 2018 Thursday 9:41 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 618 wordsByline: By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN, Associated PressDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - China on Thursday criticized recent moves by the U.S. targeting the sale of fake goods and Chinese telecoms equipment, saying Washington lacks "objectivity" in its approach to Chinese businesses.Separately, the foreign ministry sought to deflect accusations that China is requiring foreign firms to hand over intellectual property into order to gain market access - the basis of an ongoing U.S. trade investigation.Commerce Ministry spokesman Gao Feng told reporters the U.S. Trade Representative lacked direct conclusive evidence and supporting data for listing three Chinese online commerce platforms and six physical bazaars within China as "notorious markets" engaging in commercial-scale copyright piracy and trademark counterfeiting."We have to question the objectivity and credibility of the relevant U.S. department in issuing its report," Gao told reporters at a news conference. "The Chinese government has always attached great importance to the protection of intellectual property, the results of which are obvious to all."The USTR's Notorious Markets List issued this month said the offending platforms and markets based in China and elsewhere caused financial losses for U.S. businesses and copyright holders and could pose safety risks. It does not involve penalties but the list aims to motivate private businesses to reduce piracy and counterfeiting.Among the online platforms listed was e-commerce giant Alibaba's online marketplace Taobao, which has struggled for years to shed its reputation as an Internet emporium for fake goods. Physical outlets included Beijing's famed Silk and Hongqiao markets popular with tourists.Alibaba Group President Michael Evans said in a statement the company has worked above and beyond on each of the list's concerns to protect brands and copyright holders."In light of all this, it's clear that no matter how much action we take and progress we make, the USTR is not actually interested in seeing tangible results," Evans said, adding that the company had "no other choice but to conclude that this is a deeply flawed, biased and politicized process."At the news conference, Gao also criticized a U.S. House bill introduced on Jan. 9 that would prohibit government purchases of telecoms equipment from Huawei Technologies Company and smaller rival ZTE Corporation, citing their ties to the Chinese military and backing from the ruling Communist Party.He said the bill would harm U.S.-China cooperation in telecommunications and shake the confidence of Chinese enterprises in the U.S.Huawei's U.S. business suffered a setback when a congressional panel recommended in 2013 that phone carriers avoid doing business with it or ZTE. Beijing rejected the report as false and an effort to keep Chinese companies out of the U.S. market.Earlier this month U.S. carrier AT&T dropped plans to sell Huawei's smartphones in the U.S.Huawei, founded in 1987 by a former military engineer, is the world's No. 3 phone maker and first Chinese brand to break into the top ranks of global technology suppliers.On the issue of forced transfer of intellectual property and proprietary technology, foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said China had no law mandating such practices.President Donald Trump has also threatened to level a "fine" on China over the practice, potentially including trade sanctions and retaliatory tariffs."Such cases might occur in some commercial cooperation, but that is purely the market behavior between the enterprises," Lu said at a regularly scheduled news conference."Fair exchange is no robbery. There is no interference from the government," he said, adding that China would "firmly defend its legitimate rights and interests."Load-Date: January 19, 2018End of Document

Vietnam Stands to See Modest Wins if China, U.S. Start Trade WarASEAN TribuneMarch 30, 2018 FridayCopyright 2018 ASEAN Tribune All Rights ReservedLength: 836 wordsBody 30 March 2018 (VOA) A wider Sino-U.S. trade dispute would help export-reliant Vietnam compete against Chinese companies but put the country at risk of any global fallout, analysts say.The numerous exporters in Vietnam that ship manufactured goods to the United States would save money compared with Chinese peers if not subject to American tariffs, said Dustin Daugherty, senior associate with business consultancy Dezan Shira  and  Associates in Ho Chi Minh City.The U.S. government said this month it would develop a list of tariffs on up to $60 billion in Chinese imports. China has threatened to impose its own in response.'Let's say (the United States) went the more traditional route, tensions kept escalating and more tariffs are slapped on Chinese products,' Daugherty said. 'In that case Vietnam's export sector definitely benefits. We're already seeing the U.S. being very warm to Vietnam and U.S. businesses keen on doing business with Vietnam.'But Chinese firms hit by tariffs might flood Vietnam with raw materials for local manufacturing, while overall world market volatility caused by a Sino-U.S. trade dispute could hamper the country's trade, said Carl Thayer, emeritus professor at the University of New South Wales in Australia.A tariff-free Vietnam scenarioVietnamese exporters would save money compared to their Chinese peers if the U.S. government placed tariffs on Chinese firms alone without touching their cross-border supply chains, Daugherty said.The government of U.S. President Donald Trump calls China unfair in its trade practices, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative says on its website. China enjoys a $375 billion trade surplus with the United States.Vietnam counts the United States as its top single-country export destination and it shipped $46.484 billion worth of goods to that market last year.Vietnamese officials have carved out an investment environment since the 1980s that hinges on low costs for manufacturers. American-invested factories such as a Ford Motor plant and an Intel chip factory are among those active in Vietnam today.Foreign investment contributed to exports worth $155.24 billion in 2017, financial services firm SSI Research in Hanoi says. Vietnam's economy grew about 7 percent in the first quarter this year, it says.Attractive investmentVietnam would be a more attractive investment compared with China under higher U.S. tariffs, analysts say.Some new investors might be formerly China-based firms hoping to flee the tariffs, said Song Seng Wun, an economist in the private banking unit of CIMB in Singapore.China itself might offer Vietnam, along with other countries, preferential trade policies or infrastructure help to shore up trade ties, some believe. Stronger trade relations outside the United States would help China offset any tariff damage, Daugherty said.This week China's commerce minister pledged to relax trade rules affecting India.Specter of a broader trade warU.S. import tariffs that hit China's extensive cross-border supply chain would hurt Vietnam as a place that finishes Chinese goods for final export, Thayer said. It's unclear whether Washington would tax Chinese firms alone or their wider supply networks.Chinese firms already co-invest with Vietnamese partners, Song said, and supply chains for goods such as consumer electronics can net multiple countries, not just China.More co-investment might follow if Vietnam can offer shelter from tariffs. But Sino-Vietnamese political tension over a maritime dispute risks giving Vietnamese firms a bad name at home if they work too extensively with Chinese partners.'I would say there will be all kinds of repercussions and implications just because of the very integrated supply chain in the world these days,' Song said. 'Take an Apple phone as an example. Parts from here and there are assembled in China.'Steel, aluminum tariffsU.S. steel and aluminum tariffs that took effect last week cover much of the world including China and Vietnam. Vietnam exported 380,000 tons of steel, worth $303 million, to the United States in 2017, domestic news website VnExpress International says.Chinese firms hit by the range of tariffs being mulled now in Washington might boost sales to Vietnam, Thayer said. Chinese sellers of raw materials for Vietnamese exports could dump goods into Vietnam to keep up their own balance sheets as U.S. tariffs hurt them, he added.Chinese sellers often have an economy of scale that lets them sell for less in Vietnam than local vendors do. Vietnam counts China as its top trading partner.An escalation of Sino-U.S. trade tensions could also chill global markets or trade as a whole, some analysts fear. That fallout could slow global growth, he said.'Disruption to trade shouldn't affect Vietnam overall, but it's the way the entire globe is reacting to this that I think could affect Vietnam,' he said. 'Vietnam is overall heavily committed to global integration with a number of partners, so disruption along that way would have an effect.'Load-Date: March 31, 2018End of Document

The global number of cellular IoT subscribers reached 648 million at the end of 2017PR NewswireJanuary 18, 2018 Thursday 12:51 PM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1205 wordsDateline: LONDON, Jan. 18, 2018 BodyThe Global M2M/IoT Communications Market analyses the latest trends and developments in cellular IoT and low power wireless networking.Download the full report:https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/4487447This strategic research report from Berg Insight provides you with 170 pages of unique business intelligence including 5-year industry forecasts and expert commentary on which to base your business decisions.Highlights from this report:- 360-degree overview of the cellular IoT communication ecosystem.- Update on the adoption of NB-IoT and LPWA standards for M2M/IoT networking.- Reviews of the IoT strategies of leading mobile operators.- Summary of industry trends in all world regions.- Statistical data on cellular IoT subscribers in all world regions.- Extensive global and regional market forecasts lasting until 2022.The global number of cellular IoT subscribers reached 648 million at the end of 2017Berg Insight estimates that the global number of cellular IoT subscribers increased by 56 percent during 2017 to reach 647.5 million at the end of the year - corresponding to around 8 percent of all mobile subscribers. Until 2022, the number of cellular IoT subscribers is forecasted to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 33.1 percent to reach 2,700.1 million at the end of the period. During the same period, cellular IoT network revenues are forecasted to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27.3 percent from (EURO) 6.3 billion in 2017 to approximately (EURO) 21.2 billion in 2022. Meanwhile the monthly ARPU is expected to drop to (EURO) 0.65.The global cellular IoT market is going through a massive change, driven by the Chinese government's policies for accelerating adoption. China has set the ambitious goal of reaching 600 million NB-IoT connections in 2020, three years after the launch of the first commercial networks.Berg Insight believes that the target must be seen as realistic in light of the 150 million net additions and almost 100 percent yearly growth rate in 2017, the year before low-cost NB-IoT devices were even available.China has embarked on one of the world's largest digital infrastructure projects that will result in billions of new connected devices in the coming five years. The massive effort will be a catalyst for reducing the price of cellular IoT chipsets and modules below US$ 2 and driving the global transition from 2G to 4G networks. China's choice of NB-IoT as the country's preferred LPWA technology will elevate the emerging standard to global dominance. It will also change the structure of the global cellular IoT subscriber base.The next wave of cellular IoT adoption is focused on new vertical segments like smart cities and infrastructure, smart industrial supply chains and connected consumer products.Berg Insight believes the new wave will start in China, where government authorities and manufacturing companies will be first in the world to deploy connected devices using NB-IoT technology on a massive scale. Berg Insight does not expect to see similar levels of adoption in any other world region in the coming five years.Most new connected consumer products will launch first in China and get exported if successful. Berg Insight finds it likely that embedded cellular IoT connectivity will become a standard feature in mass-market whitegoods and similar high-volume consumer goods.China Mobile is the world's largest provider of cellular IoT connectivity. At the end of Q2-2017, the operator reported 150 million IoT subscribers and a year-on-year growth rate of 87 percent. Vodafone ranked second with 59 million IoT subscribers and a yearly growth rate of 43 percent.China Unicom captured the third spot with 50 million, surpassing AT&T at close to 36 million. China Telecom grew at an exceptional 250 percent year-on-year to reach 28 million cellular IoT subscribers in the period. Deutsche Telecom, Softbank/Sprint, Verizon and Telefónica currently have in the range of 15-20 million cellular IoT subscribers, which are growing at yearly rates of 15-30 percent.Telenor was the last player in the top ten with approximately 12 million cellular IoT subscribers. With an aggregate base of 407 million connections in mid-2017, the top ten mobile operators had a combined global market share of 76 percent. IoT is starting to make a substantial contribution to the revenues of the world's mobile operators.Top international players such as AT&T, Verizon and Vodafone generate in the order of (EURO) 1 billion in sales from IoT. Overall, the share of mobile operator revenues from IoT is in the range of 1 percent. This is consistent with IoT's share of total mobile data traffic reported by telecom regulators in Scandinavia.Cellular IoT communication providers are at the forefront of adopting next generation network technology. Global IoT connectivity platforms aggregate cellular and non-cellular networks in every part of the world on a shared core network infrastructure.Some players have even developed complete mobile core networks based on virtualized network infrastructure and operated as a service on commercial clouds. From a technical perspective, network aggregation has intrinsic advantages in terms of coverage and flexibility. Any provider of international IoT connectivity must rely on external radio networks. Being tied to a single radio network in the domestic market can sometimes be a disadvantage. The main competitive advantages of traditional telecom operators in IoT are not technical but commercial. In the end, any technical platform will only be as good as the underlying commercial relationships between the connectivity provider and the radio network operators.This report answers the following questions:How will the global cellular IoT market evolve over the next five years?How will Chinese government policies shape the global IoT market?Which are the main market trends in Europe and North America?What is the status of cellular IoT in emerging markets?What are the leading global mobile operators' strategies for the IoT market?How much revenues did leading telecom groups generate from IoT in 2017?When will NB-IoT replace GPRS in mass-market applications?What is the outlook for emerging low power wireless networking technologies?Who should buy this report?The Global M2M/IoT Communications Market is the foremost source of information about cellular IoT and low power wireless networking in all regions and major M2M/ IoT vertical markets.Whether you are a chipset or module vendor, software vendor, utility, vehicle manufacturer, telecom operator, investor, consultant, or government agency, you will gain valuable insights from our in-depth research.Download the full report:https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/4487447AboutReportbuyerReportbuyer is a leading industry intelligence solution that provides all market research reports from top publishersFor more information:Sarah SmithResearch Advisor at Reportbuyer.comEmail:sarah@reportbuyer.comTel: +1 (646) 453 6293Website:           http://www.reportbuyer.com View original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-global-number-of-cellular-iot-subscribers-reached-648-million-at-the-end-of-2017-300584766.htmlSOURCE ReportBuyerLoad-Date: January 19, 2018End of Document

Germany urges release of detained China human rights lawyerAssociated Press InternationalFebruary 1, 2018 Thursday 9:38 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 461 wordsDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - Germany is calling on China to release a prominent human rights lawyer charged with inciting subversion, drawing a sharp rebuke from Beijing.German Human Rights Commissioner Barbel Kofler this week said Yu Wensheng is innocent of wrongdoing and had only sought to campaign for democratic reforms and "support fellow citizens who were harassed for exercising their human rights.""I call on the Chinese government to release Yu Wensheng without delay, and to fully respect the civil rights guaranteed in the Chinese Constitution," Kofler said in a statement posted on the website of the German Federal Foreign Office.Asked about Kofler's comments, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying gave no details about Yu's case, but said China would "firmly oppose any foreign government or individual in an attempt to interfere in China's internal affairs.""The relevant German official is absolutely not qualified or entitled to ask China to release anyone involved," Hua said.Yu, an informal spokesman for a group of Chinese human rights lawyers, was grabbed by police on Jan. 19 while preparing to take his 13-year-old son to school.Police informed Yu's wife of the charge against him on Saturday, lawyer Huang Hanzhong said. Inciting subversion is a vaguely worded charge often used to muzzle dissent and sometimes results in years-long prison sentences.Yu's detention extends a crackdown on independent legal activists in recent years by China's authoritarian one-party Communist government.His seizure came a day after he posted a letter online calling on the ruling party to reform the constitution and allow open presidential elections."The president, the head of state, is basically appointed without any meaningful election. It has no credibility for the country, for civil society and for countries across the world," Yu said in the letter.Police searched Yu's home and office and seized computers, USB drives, cellphones and files documenting cases that Yu had handled in recent years, Huang said.Yu gained widespread attention after being detained for three months in 2014, during which he says he was tortured and questioned. He was detained again in 2015 but released after a day when his case received wide publicity.China routinely dismisses attempts by foreign governments to intervene in civil rights cases and has extended its crackdown on civil society activists to foreign citizens.Beijing has rejected calls by the U.S. and European governments to release Gui Minhai, a Swedish citizen who sold gossipy tomes about Chinese leaders from his Hong Kong bookshop.Around 10 Chinese police officers surrounded Gui and Swedish diplomats on Jan. 20 as they traveled by train to Beijing. Gui was seized and his whereabouts remain unknown.Load-Date: February 2, 2018End of Document

FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION UNDER THREATStates News ServiceJanuary 12, 2018 FridayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 1294 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, N.Y. BodyThe following information was released by Human Rights Watch:Graeme ReidDirector, Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Rights Program GraemecreidInvisibility and stigma go hand in hand. "Coming out" became a central part of the gay liberation movement in the United States and Europe from the 1960s, a strategy adopted as a prerequisite for claiming rights. And in the late 1980s, in response to the AIDS crisis, ACT UP (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power) adopted the slogan "Silence=Death," which became the rallying cry of a movement challenging silence and stigma. Globally, in the past three decades, there has been a rapid increase in queer visibility, facilitated by many factors including images and ideas circulating through the internet, interconnectedness among LGBT organizations and individuals, and the global response to HIV/AIDS.As of 2017, the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA) has 1,228 member organizations in 132 countries. Yet visibility also comes with risks. As the visibility of sexual and gender minorities has increased, so too has the prevalence of laws that seek to ban public expressions of identity. When "the love that dare not speak its name" moved into the public square, LGBT activists in many parts of the world were treated with suspicion, accused of importing foreign concepts, promoting homosexuality, and threatening "traditional values."In the first week of January, a Chinese court accepted a case challenging a ban on depictions of homosexuality from online video platforms. The vague and sweeping regulations, imposed in June 2017 by the media regulatory authority under the Chinese government, prohibit portrayals of "abnormal sexual lifestyles or behavior," including homosexuality. Also among the taboo subjects are portrayals of "Chinese imperialism," "sexual liberation," or "excessive drinking."The guidelines were an attempt to bring internet content in line with Chinese television regulations that have explicitly banned depictions of same-sex relationships since 2016. This despite the fact that homosexuality is not criminalized in China, and the Chinese Society of Psychiatry removed homosexuality from its official classification of mental disorders in 2001. These new restrictions are part of a pattern of ever-tightening social control in China.Similarly, Indonesia's parliament is considering a revised broadcasting bill that would ban "showcasing lesbian, homosexual, bisexual, and transgender behaviors." Lawmakers say that the ban could include dramas with gay characters, broadcasts advocating for the rights of LGBT people, and traditional folk performances that often include waria (loosely translated as "transgender women").Dede Oetomo, an activist, decried this threat to make wariac haracters, ubiquitous in Indonesian entertainment and beauty culture, invisible on broadcast media. Bobby Rizaldi, a lawmaker, said: "LGBT is not criminal, but if it enters the public sphere, if it is broadcast to the public, then of course it must be regulated." Another member of parliament said that if the content were aimed at "fixing the abnormality" it would be allowed. The highly polarized debate about LGBT issues in Indonesia is shorthand for competing claims between pluralism and fundamentalism.In 2013, Russia imposed a national ban on "propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations to minors." Similar propaganda-style legislation has been debated in Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova and Ukraine, leading to an increased public discussion of "traditional values" and the perceived threat posed by sexual and gender minorities. In 2017, the European Court of Human Rights condemned the Russian law for reinforcing stigma, encouraging homophobia, and discriminating against a vulnerable minority. Russia is obligated to abide by the ruling, yet continues to charge people under the law an administrative offense that, at worst, imposes a fine. But its effects are widespread and insidious, leading to self-censorship and contributing to bias-motivated violence. The government of Vladimir Putin has used this law to mobilize popular support domestically and take on the mantle of protecting "traditional values" internationally.Nigeria's Same-Sex Marriage (Prohibition) Act (2014) goes a lot further than banning same-sex marriages. The law punishes establishing, supporting, and participating in gay organizations and public displays of affection with 10 years in prison. The law was passed in the midst of security concerns, corruption scandals and a looming election in Nigeria, serving its purpose as a political football.The idea that homosexuality can be improperly "promoted" is rooted in the fear of same-sex relations as a social contagion. Just as laws prohibiting same-sex conduct seek to regulate what consenting adults may and may not do with their bodies, so too do propaganda and promotion laws that seek to regulate what is permissible in the social sphere. Sodomy and propaganda laws are based on similar ideas of contagion and social pollution.In this respect, Chechnya is an extreme example. In April 2017, news broke of a systematic purge against gay and bisexual men, who were rounded up and tortured before being released to their families in public rituals of humiliation that encouraged so-called "honor-killings." Alvi Karimov, spokesperson for the Chechen strongman, Ramzan Kadirov, said at the time, denying the abuses: "If there were such people [gays] in Chechnya, law enforcement agencies wouldn't need to have anything to do with them because their relatives would send them somewhere from which there is no returning." In this discourse, gay people are completely erased from Chechnya. Their existence is impossible.One of the ways governments attempt to curtail visibility is by making it difficult for LGBT groups to operate. In the past year alone, police raids in Uganda forced the closure of the Kampala International Queer Film Festival and a week of activities linked to Uganda Pride. In Turkey, the governor of Ankara imposed an indefinite ban on all public LGBT events in the province. In Egypt, after 75 people were arrested and 40 convicted in late 2017 after a rainbow flag was displayed at a music concert, the government imposed a media blackout on all positive depictions of homosexuality. And Tanzanian authorities suspended an organization that works on LGBT health rights and arrested a prominent South African human rights lawyer together with 12 of her colleagues and activist clients for "promoting homosexuality."But in legal systems under which the judiciary enjoys a degree of independence, courts are playing an important role in providing a remedy. Recent court rulings in Botswana (2016), Kenya (2014) and (2015), Tunisia (2016), South Korea (2017), and Mozambique (2017) have asserted the right of LGBT groups to register and advocate for their rights, despite laws in some of these countries that restrict same-sex practice.Claims such as those by Ugandan leader Yoweri Museveni that homosexuality is "un-African" can hardly stand in the face of an increasingly visible, mobilized, indigenous African LGBT movement, and the same holds true for other parts of the world. Homophobia is a convenient political tool precisely because it can be portrayed as a dangerous foreign influence. Symbols of a transnational movement, such as rainbow flags, pride parades, queer cultural events, or LGBT organizations can be used by unscrupulous politicians to stir moral panics about LGBT rights to distract attention from economic woes, social tensions, and political problems.Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.Load-Date: January 13, 2018End of Document

China's president had 2 books about artificial intelligence on his shelf in his New Year speechBusiness Insider USJanuary 3, 2018 Wednesday 07:14 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 630 wordsByline: sshead@businessinsider.com,  (Sam Shead)Highlight: Xi Jinping has copies of 'The Master Algorithm' and 'Augmented: Life in the Smart Lane' on his book shelf.BodyYouTube/CCTV English• Chinese President Xi Jinping has "The Master Algorithm" and "Augmented: Life in the Smart Lane" on his book shelf. • The books describe some of the basic principles of machine learning and paint a vision for the future. • China wants to become a world leader in the field of artificial intelligence by 2025. Every new year, China's president Xi Jinping greets his nation with a video recorded from his office. Behind the desk he sits at is an impressive book shelf that reveals what the world leader has been reading; it gets closely analysed every year,            as we first saw via Quartz.This year, there were at least two books on his shelf about artificial intelligence (AI). They were Pedro Domingo's "The Master Algorithm: How the Quest for the Ultimate Learning Machine Will Remake Our World" and Brett King's "Augmented: Life in the Smart Lane".Released in 2015, "The Master Algorithm" describes how machine learning is remaking business, politics, science and war. It details the various methods of machine learning and explains them by comparing them to neural connections in the brain, logic, and probability, among other things.The book also describes a fictional master algorithm, which develops a perfect understanding of how the world and the people within it work; the master algorithm is a "universal learner capable of deriving all knowledge from data," according to the book's synopsis.The other book, "Augmented: Life in the Smart Lane," looks at the new "augmented age" and explains how it is going to cause disruption and shift the way we as humans behave. It also delves into how robots will replace human jobs and whether AIs will subsume us as inferior intelligences.The fact that China's president has these books on his book shelf is interesting and it could be interpreted as a signal that China is serious about its bullish AI ambitions.China published its AI strategy in July and said that it wanted to be the world leader in AI by 2025 and it wants to make the domestic industry            worth $150 billion (£111 billion) by 2030.The Chinese government is building a $2 billion (£1.5 billion) AI research park as it looks to become a world leader in the field by 2025,            Reuters reported on Wednesday, citing local news agency Xinhua.Russian president Vladimir Putin believes that in the future, the country that leads in AI could dominate the world, while tech billionaire            Elon Musk thinks AI will be the most likely cause of WWIII (although his comments should be taken with a pinch of salt).Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google parent company Alphabet, warned in November that China is poised to overtake the US in the field of AI if the US government doesn't act soon.Speaking at the Artificial Intelligence and Global Security Summit, the former Google CEO said: "Trust me, these Chinese people are good."While the US has Google, Facebook, Microsoft, IBM, OpenAI and others, China has its own enormous tech giants aggressively pursuing AI research. Examples include Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent, to name but a few."It's pretty simple," said Schmidt. "By 2020 they will have caught up. By 2025 they will be better than us. And by 2030 they will dominate the industries of AI. Just stop for a sec. The [Chinese] government said that."NOW WATCH: 7 science-backed ways for a happier and healthier 2018 - this is what you do the very first weekSee Also:• China is reportedly building a $2 billion AI park as it looks to become a world leader in the field• We talked to Sophia - the first-ever robot citizen that once said it would 'destroy humans'• DeepMind's CEO told Prince Harry his AI lab now employs 700 staff: 'It's really the biggest collection of brain power anywhere in the world on this topic'Load-Date: February 11, 2019End of Document

China Interdye and China Textile Printing to Take Place in April in Shanghai; The event will focus on the twin themes of Science and Technological Innovation and Green DevelopmentPR NewswireMarch 16, 2018 Friday 6:12 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1173 wordsDateline: SHANGHAI, March 15, 2018 BodyThe 18th China International Dye Industry, Pigments and Textile Chemicals Exhibition (China Interdye) and China International Digital Textile Printing, Printing and Dyeing Automatics Exhibition (China Textile Printing), is scheduled to take place from April 11 to 13, 2018 at the Shanghai World Expo Exhibition & Convention Center. The 40,000-square meter exhibition area will house 630 exhibitors from 17 countries and regions. Exhibitors plan to showcase a variety of advanced environmentally-friendly dyestuff, organic pigments, catalysts, intermediates, as well as environmental impact assessment equipment and digital textile printers in addition to printing and dyeing automation technologies and materials. The two exhibitions, one with a focus on Science and Technological Innovation and the other on Green Development, will be hosted by China Dyestuff Industry Association, China Dyeing and Printing Association and China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, Shanghai Sub-Council and co-organized by Shanghai International Exhibition Service Co., Ltd.18th China Interdye continues to lead industry developmentImproved downstream demand revives dyes and textile chemicals sectorsAfter destocking for several consecutive years, the printing and dyeing industry has been revitalized by the textile sector. From January to November, 2017, the printing and dyeing producers above a designated size produced 49.14 billion meters of printed and dyed fabrics, an increase of 5.63 per cent over the same period of a year earlier. Sector-related business revenue reached 354.9 billion yuan (approx. US$56.1 billion), up 6.2 per cent year on year, while profits grew 9.8 per cent year on year to 18.6 billion yuan (approx. US$2.9 billion).Industry leaders participate in the exhibition and continue to lead development of the sectorAt this year's exhibition, a robust roster of the global leaders, including Tanatex, Huntsman, Yorkshire, Archroma, Zschimmer & Schwarz, Pulcra, Nicca, Chia Her Industrial, DuoWen, Bozzetto, Evonik Industries, Rudolf, Daikin, AGC, Datacolor, Intertek, and domestic leaders, among them, Zhejiang Longsheng Group, Zhejiang Runtu, Hangzhou Jihua Group, Yabang Chemical, Shanghai Liansheng Chemical, Transfar, Dymatic Chemicals, Hubei Hwalle Dyestuff industry, Kaida, Runhe Chemical Industry, Boao, Tianyuan Chemical, Shanghai Anoky Group, Merida, Jingjin, Xingyuan and Tongda, plan to promote new products and new technological applications that focus on the green and environmental aspects of the industry. In addition, delegations of exhibitors from India, Korea and Taiwan will join hands in a move to increase participation. This year's gathering will mainly focus on scientific and technological innovation and green development in a move to drive sustainable development over the industry.China Textile Printing highlights the combination of technology, fashion and environmental protectionWith the gradual transformation of the printing and dyeing industry, automation, digitalization and information technologies are being seen as a necessity and being more widely applied across the industry, driven by factors that include China's adjustment to a slower expected annual growth of the economy (what is often referred to as the "New Normal", the advent of Internet+ [the Chinese government's program to encourage manufacturers to incorporate the internet into their industry chain]) and intelligent manufacturing. The advances in digital printing technologies are increasingly meeting the expectations of consumers as it relates to color and function, and are becoming a new highlight and growth point of the industry as the economic model of China's textile industry transitions into an innovative, eco-friendly and low-carbon one.   This year's China Textile Printing was held concurrently with the world's largest dyeing exhibition, with the aim of creating a one-stop "shop" for the procurement of textile, printing and dyeing products, while, at the same time, serving as a wider platform for the development of the industry. Leading digital printing companies including Epson, MS, Hangzhou Honghua Digital Technology, Hangzhou Kaiyuan Computer Technology, Human Digital Technology and Newtech Textile Technology Development, ink producers including Huntsman, Everlight Chemical, Zhengzhou Hongsam Digital Science & Technology and Zhejiang Lanyu Digital Technology, as well as printing and dyeing automation technology providers including Greensign, Changshu Hongda Textile Printing and Dyeing and Wuxi Xinda Dyeing Machine Factory plan to showcase their latest products at the event, to jointly build a platform for the transformation of the textile and printing and dyeing industry from a perspective of sustainable development.Rich concurrent events provide insights into industry trendsIn 2018, the 100th anniversary of China's dyestuff industry, China Dyestuff Industry Association plans to host the launch event for the establishment of a pan-Asian dyestuffs federation. Many industry associations, including China Dyeing and Printing Association, China Cotton Textile Association, China Knitting Industrial Association, and China Dyestuff Industry Association's Organic Pigment Professional Committee, Additives Professional Committee and Masterbatch Professional Committee will host supporting forums. Zhejiang Lonsen Holding, Transfar, Dymatic Chemicals and Switzerland-based TESTEX will organize several technical seminars, presenting advanced technologies and concepts and providing professional visitors with opportunities for exchanges and cooperation.China Interdye Asia Tour will make efforts to build a platform to assist Chinese makers in their international expansion effortsIn a move to accelerate the transformation of China's dyestuff industry, and help the industry to become a much more active player on the world stage, the organizer of China Interdye plans to continue hosting the Interdye Asia Tour, a platform for exchanges. Interdye Asia Tour will be held in Vietnam once again, taking place in HoChiMinh City in November 2018. The event is expected to go a long way in creating the conditions for Chinese dyestuff and chemicals producers to go globally, build China's homegrown brands, improve after services, and bring the supplying and purchasing parties together, enabling them achieve mutual benefits and win-win cooperation.For more information, please follow:China Interdye's official website: http://www.chinainterdye.comChina Textile Printing's official website:            http://www.chinatextileprinting.comChina Interdye Asia Tour's official website:            http://www.interdyeasia.com China Interdye's QQ account: 800077290China Interdye's WeChat account: chinainterdyeChina Textile Printing's WeChat account: chinatextileprinting View original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/china-interdye-and-china-textile-printing-to-take-place-in-april-in-shanghai-300615198.htmlSOURCE Shanghai International Exhibition Service Co., LtdCONTACT: Zhao Luyi, +86-21-6279-2828Load-Date: March 17, 2018End of Document

China isn't taking Alibaba's latest rejection very wellBusiness Insider USJanuary 3, 2018 Wednesday 02:15 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 752 wordsByline: llopez@businessinsider.com,  (Linette Lopez)Highlight: OPINION: The US won't let Alibaba, China's crown jewel, to purchase a US company. This is a rocky start to an already risky few months for US-China relations.Body• The US will not allow Alibaba to purchase US money transfer company, MoneyGram, and China's not happy about it.• This spat kicks off what could be a contentious few months for US-China economic relations.• In the coming months, The White House has to make a bunch of decisions about tariffs on solar panels, washing machines and more that could make relations worse.  A mysterious US government panel has blocked the sale of the money-transfer company MoneyGram International to China's ecommerce giant,            Alibaba.And by the sounds of it, this is not sitting well with the Chinese government. A state-media editorial following the announcement accused the US of starting an already contentious year for trade on an aggressive footing, and taking a "hawkish turn" which became "ear-piercing" in December after the Trump administration made economic aggression against China a major part of its national security platform."China and the United States are about to ride a bumpy journey in trade in 2018 if the U.S. government goes it own way, and retaliatory measures by China could be on the table," state-run Xinhua warned.Indeed, this spat raises the curtain on numerous delicate negotiations and key decisions coming for US-China relations over the next few weeks. A fight over Alibaba, a company that means a lot to China's national pride, wasn't even on the table.But things have changed.CIFIUSFirst the spat at hand. To purchase MoneyGram, a US company, Alibaba had to do what dozens of companies have done before it - get approval from the Treasury Department's Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, CIFIUS.CIFIUS determines whether or not the sale of a company would have a material impact on national security or the US economy. During the Trump administration, the definition of "national security" has been expanded to include everything from semiconductors to now, money-transfer companies. Even companies belonging to China's golden business billionaire, Jack Ma.In fact, the Trump administration has been making companies reapply, and put up a bunch of hurdles for people that never expected them. One of them is former White House press secretary Anthony Scaramucci. The sale of his financial firm, SkyBridge, is still languishing in wait for approval for a sale to beleaguered Chinese conglomerate HNA.It's not looking good.At the beginning of last year,beginning of last year, China laid out a bunch of sacrosanct national security and trade issues to the Trump administration. CFIUS was not among them.Flex if you want toThe issues that were (and have been) on China's radar were more than enough to strain relations without an Alibaba insult."In the last 30 days of 2017, the U.S. government launched a Section 301 investigation into Chinese intellectual property and technology transfer, self-initiated probes into Chinese-made aluminum products, and rejected China's market economy status at the World Trade Organization," the Xinhua editorial said.Talk to anyone in Washington working on trade and they'll tell you that this stuff - resurrecting arcane, aggressive trade laws and and ignoring the World Trade Organization whenever convenient - makes Trump happy. He genuinely believes in disrupting the global trade order and punishing China. That makes what's coming over the next few weeks that much more dangerous.US Department of CommerceIn January, Trump has to decide whether or not to put up tariffs against foreign solar panels and washing machines. After that he must decide whether or not to slap tarriffs on foreign steel and aluminum, declaring any threat to US companies in those industries a threat to US national security. This won't just upset the Chinese, expect the Europeans, Brazilians and Canadians to have a lot to say about it too.Inside the White House, Axios reports, trade hawks like US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and adviser Peter Navarro have the president's heart and ear.But Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and adviser Gary Cohn are trying to tell Trump that aggressive action against China could hurt the stock market (of which Trump is so proud) and erase the gains made by the GOP's tax cut.NOW WATCH: Here's why some Hong Kong skyscrapers have gaping holesSee Also:• One of the best tech upgrades I've made to my car cost me less than $30• The Powerball and Mega Millions jackpots have broken $400 million each - here's Mark Cuban's best advice for lottery winners• Bill Ackman just took a $200 million hit to his reputationLoad-Date: February 11, 2019End of Document

Jim Cramer: Trump's Broadcom Move Really Means 'China, Stay Out!'RealMoneyMarch 13, 2018 Tuesday 7:01 PM EDTCopyright 2018 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 846 wordsByline: Jim CramerHighlight: Stopping AVGO's bid for Qualcomm and imposing steel tariffs changes everything.BodyIf you make a statement that "our intellectual property is not for sale to the Chinese," that would be a lot simpler to do than stopping an American CEO from buying the company run by another American CEO. But it doesn't matter now.President Trump made a proclamation Monday night that basically banned Singapore's Broadcom Ltd.  in its attempts to buy U.S.-headquartered Qualcomm  , arguing that he had to prevent intellectual-property theft. This sends the message that U.S. tech isn't for sale to China -- and is stunning and fatal to the Broadcom/Qualcomm saga.Except left out of the equation is the fact that Broadcom CEO Hock Tan is an American, and that Broadcom is moving back to the United States from Singapore (at Trump's own glowing urging and reception). Tan is originally from Malaysia, but has been a U.S. citizen for more than 20 years. He has worked for Pepsico  , General Motors  and the late, great Commodore -- yeah, Commodore, the first real PC company, once based outside of Philadelphia.And Broadcom's headquarters? The company is nominally based in Singapore following a 2016 merger between Avago Technologies and California-based Broadcom Corp. that created Broadcom Ltd. But the firm is really headquartered in San Jose, Calif. -- and in truth, it never left.Broadcom Ltd. has pretty much always been an American company. Even after the 2016 merger, the combined entity picked the name "Broadcom" rather than "Avago" to better reflect the company's true nature.Broadcom has been dual-headquartered in name only, like so many other companies that have moved their HQs around to avoid onerous U.S. taxes. the company was created by a so-called "inversion," one of the last that got through the shoot back in 2015.In fact, it was just on Nov. 2 that Trump praised Tan for moving Broadcom's headquarters to San Jose, where it really was anyway. The move allowed Tan to complete his acquisition of Brocade by being a U.S. company not only in name, but in reality.The fact is, though, that more than half of Broadcom's revenues come from China. Therefore, one could argue after Trump's presidential decree that if your company does a ton of business with China, it's a Chinese company. And if it's a Chinese company, then it can't buy an American one.What is this all saying? I think it's all part of a new message that began last week with Trump's new tariffs on foreign aluminum and steel. It says: "China, listen, you aren't going to dump your raw products on America any more. You aren't going to target industries and wipe out American jobs to create Chinese jobs. And you are no longer going to steal our secrets or our intellectual property, either."The problem is that the Trump administration's vehicles are so strange that their positions do nothing but frighten everyone in business. If Canada buys its steel from China, then that steel can't come here? But if it's made in Canada, then it's fine?If Broadcom had less than 50% sales in China, would a takeover of Qualcomm -- which would have been the largest tech merger ever -- have been OK? If Tan were born in America and not Asia, would the deal have gone through? Can U.S.-based Intel  buy Qualcomm? Is Qualcomm now deemed a "precious asset"? Is there even such a designation?Now, of course, one could argue that all the president was doing with his proclamation was backing up the U.S. Treasury. That department's Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States (known as "CFIUS") had already said "no" to a Broadcom/Qualcomm deal in very strongly worded terms. But somehow, that didn't register with Broadcom as being the end.The issue now for all American companies and Silicon Valley ones in particular might be very odd: "Do too much business in China and you're a Chinese company."Now, this might just be one of those situations where "hard cases make bad law," meaning that this was an extreme case and therefore makes for lousy law. But all the same, I think we've now seen the high-water mark for tech takeovers if a tech company does a lot of business in China (and most tech companies do a lot of business in China).More importantly, China is now an official pariah in both name and deed, whether it's in low tech or high. That this is somehow not rocking the world is pretty incredible, as the free flow of information between our two countries has been pretty much of a given.Back in August 2005, Chinese oil giant CNOOC tried to buy Unocal but withdrew from bidding because the U.S. congressional backlash was so great. Our natural resources were deemed too precious to allow the Chinese buy them, and some lawmakers said that such an acquisition would be a national security threat. CNOOC's withdrawal allowed Chevron  to buy Unocal for less money than the Chinese company had offered.However, Broadcom is neither owned by the Chinese government nor run by someone from China. That said, you get the message: "China, stay out of here! Stay out of here with your money and your thieving ways! The United States is for the United States!"Didn't know that? You sure do now.Load-Date: March 14, 2018End of Document

The Commission heard from Dhondup Wangchen (alternate spelling: Dondrub Wangchen), a Tibetan filmmaker and former political prisoner, and other experts who provided information about the current situation facing Tibetans in China and offered their recommendations on how to promote access, human rights, and better American diplomacy on issues concerning Tibetan autonomous areas of China within U.S.-China relations.Tibet remains one of the most sensitive issues in U.S.-China relations. Inside the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) and Tibetan autonomous areas, Chinese officials have increased restrictions on the religious and cultural life of Tibetans. At the same time, the Chinese government exports its authoritarianism abroad, pressuring foreign academic institutions who invite the Dalai Lama to speak on campus as well as businesses who mention his name or the TAR as a distinct region in China.At a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing earlier yesterday, Rubio raised concerns about the threat posed by Chinas growing influence.Rubios remarks can be watched here.

But I did know that there were people who were working, trying to work on my behalf. Oftentimes, even it was even the Chinese authorities themselves who would come and tell me why is there so much interest in your cause outside? So I want to say that from my own experience, any voice thats raised on behalf of political prisoners has a very positive impact even on their lives. I can say from my own experience that it is always good to raise voice on behalf of the political prisoners.RUBIO: What you are describing is the use of a student organization to basically oppress and hassle those who have views or point to facts that run contrary to the narrative that they seek to pursue and it is one of the things we are most interested on.

Protecting intellectual property is the top challenge of U.S. technology firms doing business internationally, according to a recent CompTIA survey. The findings of this investigation validate that research showing that American technology companies are being undermined by intellectual property theft and that such theft results in significant costs to the U.S. economy."While the Administration's investigation into China's intellectual property practices provides for tools to resolve this long-standing issue, we are very concerned that the Administration's decision to impose tariffs as a remedy will hurt American companies and the U.S. economy. The U.S. government should not punish American companies in its attempt to change Chinese behavior. We urge the Administration to engage in negotiations with the Chinese. The only way to resolve these issues is to work with our allies facing the same challenges in China."CompTIA will continue to engage with the Administration and Congress as they attempt to compel the Chinese government to be a more responsible international stakeholder."CompTIA submitted comments in response to this investigation, Federal Register notice (82 Fed.

Stocks Plunge; Facebook Fallout; Hostage Situation in France; Citi Targets Gun Sales; Shutdown Avoided; New Tariffs on ChinaMORNINGS WITH MARIA MORNINGS WITH MARIA 7:00 AM ESTMarch 23, 2018 FridayCopyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved Section: NEWS; FinancialLength: 8073 wordsByline: Maria Bartiromo, Dagen McDowell, Lauren Simonetti, Gary B. SmithGuests: Roger McNamee, Ron DeSantis, Sheila Bair, Brian Brenberg, Paul CzachorBodyMARIA BARTIROMO, FBN HOST: Good morning. Welcome back. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Thanks for joining us this Friday.It is Friday, March 23rd.Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.A sea of red and it continues -- the Dow tumbled more than 700 points yesterday amid new fears of a possible trade war after President Trump signed strict new tariffs on China.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We have a tremendous intellectual property theft situation going on, in particular with China. We're going to be doing a section 301 trade action. It could be about $60 billion.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: The Chinese government has fired back this morning. It says it plans to roll out its own retaliatory tariffs coming amid the tensions.Futures are falling once again. Although I want to point out, this is well off of the lows of the morning. We had been down close to 200 points earlier. Now we're looking at a decline on the Dow Industrials of 95 points, that's not even one-half of 1 percent. The Nasdaq, the S&P 500 are also lower but here too, they're off of their lows.Let's take a look at global markets this morning taking a cue from Wall Street's selloff yesterday.Asian markets getting hit hard. Their worst performer was Japan, down 4.5 percent. The Shanghai composite in China was down better than 3 percent as well as the Kospi index in Korea. Hang Seng and Hong Kong down 2.5 percent.European indices, similar story -- although here too, we're off of the lows. The FT 100 is down two-thirds of a percent, the CAC 40 in Paris is down 1.5 percent, as is the DAX index in Germany down 1.5 percent.We have a deal. Lawmakers avoid a government shutdown but they passed a massive $1.3 trillion spending bill early this morning. We break down the numbers as it heads now to the President's desk.McMaster is out, Bolton is in. More changes coming to the White House as President Trump announced he will replace national security advisor H.R. McMaster with former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, John Bolton.It's not the only change. Details also this morning as the President's top lawyer in the Russia probe has resigned.The first big bank targets guns -- why Citigroup is setting restrictions on firearm sales by its business partners.Plus, with things pretty chilly between Republicans and Democrat these days, Senators Jeff Flake and Corey Booker try to settle their differences with a snow ball fight -- check this out. The very latest on Capitol Hill, coming up this morning.But first, we have this breaking news that we want to get to right away. There's a hostage situation under way right now in southern France. Several people are being held at a supermarket, being held hostage. Reuters is reporting this, that the man holding the hostages claims allegiance to the Islamic state. We will bring you any more information as it becomes available.But again, we do have a hostage situation right now in southwest France with the person holding the hostages says he is working for ISIS.Investors meanwhile, lawmakers back in the United States are eyeing Facebook. The stock had a tough week.It is extending the losses this morning after Facebook officials were grilled on Capitol Hill over the company's data mining controversy. Now lawmakers are calling for CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify before Congress.The House Energy and Commerce Committee released a statement yesterday, reading in part, "We felt that many questions were left unanswered. We believe as CEO of Facebook he is the right witness to provide answers to the American people."Joining us now is the managing director and co-founder of Elevation Partners, former mentor to Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook investor, Roger McNamee. Roger -- it's good to have you on the program this morning.ROGER MCNAMEE, MANAGING DIRECTOR AND CO-FOUNDER, ELEVATION PARTNERS: Maria -- it's always great to be with you.BARTIROMO: All right. You have been a major supporter to Facebook over the years.MCNAMEE: Yes.BARTIROMO: First, let's put this in context. Where do you stand on this past week?MCNAMEE: I just think this is a tragic situation. Facebook operated the company as though it was never going to have -- take any interference from anybody. It was just going to grow as rapidly as it could. And in the process, it made some mistakes. And those mistakes have had unbelievable repercussions in terms of loss of the user profiles, 50 million of them to Cambridge Analytica; an untold number of them to other software vendors.That invasion of privacy is something people are not going to be able to get back. Facebook has to come forward, accept responsibility for that and for some of the other things that have gone on relative to the elections.And you know, in my mind for Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, this is a moment of truth. This is a moment where their character is being tested and where frankly, so far it's not going well. This has been a disastrous week for them.BARTIROMO: You don't like the way they're responding to this?MCNAMEE: No. I think they have a horrible situation. And the right answer is you reach out to your critics. You find out what the problem is and then you sincerely make an effort to address it.And what's going on instead is that they are pretending as though there's no big deal going on. So they're kind of saying nothing to see and they're basically taking this notion that no one has a right to criticize them.BARTIROMO: I mean, you know, it's interesting because this is not new, right? I mean, plenty of outside vendors have used the opportunity to get and in a sense infiltrate into Facebook's network of users. How come we're just learning about this now and reacting now?I mean, you go back to the election of Barack Obama and how, you know, people used -- politicos used mining all of this data and people's, you know, data to figure out how to get those voters.MCNAMEE: Maria -- you're absolutely correct in that this idea of data mining has been around for a very long time. There are a couple things about this one that are really different.When Obama did it there was full disclosure, people understood what was going on. That is the correct way to do it. And that has been the tradition for marketers. You provide complete disclosure. People have to give you informed consent.What's gone on with Facebook is that they consciously deceived people. They had an opportunity -- well, they signed a consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission in 2011 that basically said they would require informed consent before they shared people's data.What happened in the case of Cambridge Analytica was that Cambridge Analytica apparently sent a researcher in to pretend he was going to do academic research when he was really going to gather data for political use. And so they didn't just take it from the 270,000 people who took the survey, they took all their friends -- so 50 million people.BARTIROMO: That's incredible.MCNAMEE: And that's why people are afraid. And the problem is now we understand that wait a minute, there were literally tens of thousands of other vendors doing exactly the same thing while the consent decree was going on. And it's alleged that Facebook had no compliance staff to enforce the consent decree. That is just irresponsible.That's why people are so angry.BARTIROMO: Well, now -- go ahead finish your thought.MCNAMEE: I was going to say like the data's out there and there's no way to get it back. There's no way to undo the harm. So that's why people feel so bad about the communications this week.This is a situation where you're supposed to go oh, my God, we've done some something really horrible, how can we make it up to you. It's not like we can get the data back but there are a lot of things Facebook could be doing today to show that it's going to earn people's trust back. And that's what they failed to do this week.BARTIROMO: Well, Mark Zuckerberg did one interview, right? He did Anderson Cooper on CNN. And Sheryl Sandberg did one interview. So -- I don't know.MCNAMEE: No. Well, the problem was that Mark did several newspaper interviews and one TV interview on CNN.BARTIROMO: Right.MCNAMEE: The problem was he'd memorized the series of answers and he gave the same answers, no matter what the question for it, to everybody.BARTIROMO: Yes. It didn't seem sincere.MCNAMEE: And they basically, the people who actually did the interviews weren't the main line reporters. They were actually entertainment people.So I don't understand. When Sheryl Sandberg went on CNBC, it's like why didn't she come on this show? Why didn't she come with somebody who would give gravitas to the interview where obviously she was talking to somebody who was as well-studied in business and is well-studied in technology as she?I mean the person she interviewed with on CNBC was a fine reporter but this is not her field. This is not what she does every day. And, you know, I look at this as from Sheryl's point of view, she wants to get out there and have people understand that she sincerely wants to solve the problem and that's not what she's doing.BARTIROMO: Well, by the way, just to be clear, we did reach out to Facebook. And I sent an e-mail and they didn't get back to us. So they didn't want to talk in that context obviously.MCNAMEE: It's their loss. It's their loss. OK.BARTIROMO: Well, thank you.But let me ask you this because Facebook has also been now roped into the special council investigation, Robert Mueller's probe. Investigators are looking at the connection between President Trump's 2016 campaign and the Cambridge Analytica story.Now Roger -- you just explained it and the difference. Zuckerberg should hand over the data not just from Facebook but also from Instagram, right?MCNAMEE: Absolutely.BARTIROMO: I mean he's got a lot of data here that is now going to be analyzed by the special counsel.MCNAMEE: Facebook's problem here is that when they discovered that Cambridge Analytica had the material incorrectly, they said to them you have to destroy the stuff but they didn't go in and validate that it had been done. And then six months later, Facebook had employees working with Cambridge Analytica on the Trump campaign, working with the very stuff that was supposed to have been destroyed.That's where the problem is with the special prosecutor, because Facebook knew, the management knew that they were working with ill-gotten data and you're just not allowed to do that. The problem with Cambridge Analytica is they're not an American company. You're not -- as a non-American person without a green card you're not allowed to work on a presidential campaign. And so that is the -- that's where the issue is.BARTIROMO: So what -- then what would be the motivation? I mean if they knew, did they just not want to deal with it?MCNAMEE: I just don't think they think about that kind of stuff.BARTIROMO: OK.BARTIROMO: You know, I think they basically the view the world as we're going to grow as big as we can. They have two billion members and I think their view is we're going to four billion members and we're not letting anything get in the way and you know, regulations -- not their problem, right.BARTIROMO: Yes. Well look, it looks like the regulatory environment's going to get a lot tougher now for Facebook and others, right.MCNAMEE: And it's a tragedy. It's a tragedy. I mean when you grow big you're supposed to grow up. And, you know, I know these people. They are better than what's going on right now.And I would just love to have them sit down, just go guys, get this right. This is not that hard.BARTIROMO: From a stock perspective, what are we talking about now -- 10 percent decline this week?MCNAMEE: I've got to be honest with you -- Maria. This scares the heck out of me because this is a business based on trust and how can you trust them with the way they're behaving right now? And I think users are absolutely within their rights to change their behavior.In fact everybody needs to understand, anything you put onto Facebook could disappear. It could go to bad people and there's no way to get back. So you have to be smarter.Facebook was a place we all trusted. And I don't know how we get back to that. As an investor, that really worries me. I'm not worried about the earnings. I'm worried about the PE multiple people pay because they're not going to trust them as much. And it's going to be really hard to earn that trust back because this window, the first time they came out to talk, they blew it.BARTIROMO: Yes. So the growth story has changed. Putting earnings aside, the growth story and --MCNAMEE: The stock story has changed.BARTIROMO: Yes, the stock.MCNAMEE: I look at this. I still own the stock but I had to trim, you know, I don't do the trades myself. I had somebody else now manage it because I'm involved in this thing.BARTIROMO: Of course.MCNAMEE: And they sold some stock this week because they went "this is terrible". And I'm going "well, it's been terrible for ages, why did you pick this week?" And they said "because this is the week they lost trust".BARTIROMO: Wow. And it has everything to do with the way the leadership behaved --MCNAMEE: Exactly.BARTIROMO: -- what they did in terms of phishing off on a nation --MCNAMEE: How many times have we seen this? We both remember how Johnson & Johnson handled Tylenol.BARTIROMO: Yes. That's right.MCNAMEE: That guy went in and poisoned a few bottles of Tylenol. And Johnson & Johnson didn't put that in there but they said these are our customers. We have to take care of them.And I look at Facebook. And Facebook -- their customers are the advertisers. The users for Facebook are the product. But the truth is there are times when you have to treat the user as your customers, as your partners, as family. And they blew that.This was a chance they could have been -- they could have been a hero in this movie.BARTIROMO: Right.MCNAMEE: And I don't know what they do now. I think this is really difficult. But I hope they get it together.BARTIROMO: Well, you know that Zuckerberg is going to go testify. What kind of --MCNAMEE: I hope he goes to testify.BARTIROMO: I hope so to.MCNAMEE: He's going to fight it like crazy.BARTIROMO: I mean you said -- you're right because even when he was talking in that TV interview on CNN he basically said maybe if I'm the best guy, if not, not. So he wasn't really --MCNAMEE: No, they're going to fight it.BARTIROMO: -- he wasn't really committing to it.MCNAMEE: And it was terrible. Because he said something like I don't understand how anybody who would sign a certification that they destroyed the data wouldn't do that. I'm going dude, you signed a consent decree with the FTC. As far as I can tell, you didn't actually have any compliance for it.I mean you've got to be kidding me. He says I don't think -- we think that we don't affect elections. I'm going give me a break. You put out white papers talking about how you influence elections.BARTIROMO: You're absolutely right. Yes.MCNAMEE: I mean I look at this and I go guys, you need a new PR firm.BARTIROMO: Let me ask you this. From 30,000 feet up, Roger, on a day that we just come off with a 700*-point selloff in the Dow yesterday. Facebook's looking down again. We're expecting perhaps more regulation in the entire sector. What do you want to do here as an investor?Is this just a Facebook story for you or do you want to step away on a whole bunch of tech companies in the face of all of this?MCNAMEE: Actually, I don't think it's just tech companies. I think tech remains a leader in our economy. I worry that we're almost 10 years into a bull market, Maria. And when I was last on here we talked about this issue that we were coming towards the end of a bull market cycle.And once you get into a situation of tariffs and trade wars, you have to look at lower growth and higher inflation. That's not -- I mean I don't know whether the market's going to bounce back from this in the short run.But when you look at a bit at longer term, the outlook just isn't that good. I mean, we haven't had a serious correction, a long-term correction in 10 years. I mean it could happen any time. And I can't predict whether it's this week, or this month, whenever. But I'm personally defensively- *postured and have been for frankly for more than a year because I worry that we're going to have higher inflation and lower growth. And you and I have been around long enough to remember what stagflation is like.BARTIROMO: Right.MCNAMEE: It's a really bad thing. And I don't know that that's what's going to happen.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCNAMEE: But if you think it's even a possibility, you have to factor that in to your valuation.BARTIROMO: Yes, this on the week that the Federal Reserve raises interest rates for the first time this year.MCNAMEE: Hey, seen this movie before, right.BARTIROMO: Exactly. Exactly.Roger -- it's great to get your insights.MCNAMEE: Maria -- it's always fun to be on here with you.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. Roger McNamee there, Elevation partners.We'll take a break. When we come back -- national security advisor H.R. McMaster is out. We break down the latest White House shakeup and the main stream media's reaction to his replacement -- John Bolton.And then Citigroup taking a stance on gun control -- the Wall Street bank's new restrictions for its business partners, next.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.We have breaking news. A police officer has been shot and now there is a hostage situation in southern France. Lauren Simonetti with the headlines now -- Lauren.LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT: We're monitoring this story, Maria.A person pledging support to ISIS now holding hostages at a supermarket in southwestern France. Police have surrounded that supermarket. They're treating this as a terrorist attack.One police officer was shot about 15 minutes away from the scene. We're not sure how or if these incidents are related. The last time a jihadi gunman shot four people in a French supermarket was back in 2015.Also, Citigroup they say will no longer do business with clients who don't follow their new policies on selling firearms -- the first Wall Street bank to enter the gun control debate. Citi will require clients to stop selling guns to anyone under age 21 or who has not passed a background check. The policy also bans the sale of bump stocks and high capacity magazines.Citi is following major retailers, including Wal-Mart, who are distancing themselves from the NRA, the National Rifle Association. Let's take a look at shares of Citigroup, slightly lower, although it's down 26 cents in the premarket.Take a look at this. Two people in that intense snowball fight right there dressed down are Republican Senator Jeff Flake and Democratic Senator Corey Booker. They decided to have a snowball fight after the storm dumped heavy snow in the nation's capital yesterday.Senator Flake tweeting "With so many fights on Capitol Hill, Corey and I are going literal. Snowball duel, East lawn Capitol Hill in five minutes. Loser buys other staff pizza."So who bought the pizza? Who do you guys think won?BRIAN BRENBERG, THE KING'S COLLEGE: I think Flake won.SIMONETTI: Bingo. You got it.MCDOWELL: Snow flake.BRENBERG: It looks like they had to get on, I don't know.SIMONETTI: There you go. I don't know if Booker actually bought the pizza but he was supposed to.BARTIROMO: Cool stuff. Thank you -- Lauren.MCDOWELL: There are your tax dollars at work.GARY B. SMITH, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Right yes. Thank you.MCDOWELL: Get to work.BARTIROMO: Coming up, we will speak with Florida Congressman, House Freedom Caucus member Ron DeSantis. He's weighing in on trade war concerns, the spending bill and a lot more as we watch markets come off of the lows, down 85 points right now on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, down 38 on the Nasdaq.Plus, Atlanta falling victim to the latest cyber attack. How hackers are holding the city's computer system hostage. Back in a moment(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: The word is reciprocal. That's the word I want everyone to remember. We want reciprocal, mirror. Some people call it a mirror tariff or a mirror tax. Just use the word "reciprocal".If they charge us, we charge them the same thing. That's the way it's got to be. That's not the way it is for many, many years; for many decades, it has not been that way.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: That was President Trump yesterday reaffirming up to $60 billion on tariffs on China as a step towards reciprocal global trade.China fought back. It announced that plans to roll out its own tariffs, retaliatory tariffs of up to $3 billion on its products, U.S. products including pork and fruit going into China.Markets in the U.S. and globally reacted strongly to the news with sharp declines. This morning futures are well off of the lows. We're looking at a decline at the start of trading on top of that 700-point selloff yesterday but just down about 76 points this morning. We had been down 200 earlier.Joining us now to talk more about all of that House Freedom Caucus member, House Foreign Relations Committee member, and Florida Republican Congressman Ron DeSantis. Congressman -- it's good to see you.REP. RON DESANTIS (R), FLORIDA: Good to see you.BARTIROMO: Thanks so much for joining us. We have a lot to talk about. You did not vote for the spending bill.DESANTIS: No.BARTIROMO: But first let's talk about this trade situation. Is President Trump right to do this or are you worried about this -- this trade story?DESANTIS: I think he's right to identify the problems with China. People have been talking about that for years. Their behavior, in many ways, has gotten worse.I think the issue is how are you going to confront China on these things? And when you're using, relying primarily on tariffs, I just think the fear is that the retaliation against U.S., our farmers and other industries that we need to do well, could bear the brunt of that. And so I think that's the concern.But the focus on China rather than a broad-based action I think is a much better way to go than we had been talking about two weeks ago.BARTIROMO: I mean nobody is surprised by the retaliation, right. We were expecting China to come back with something. Does this impact the growth story -- of the economic growth story of the U.S. in your view?DESANTIS: I hope not. But I think it is true that the stock market responded negatively to this and it also responded negatively to the steel and aluminum tariffs.BARTIROMO: Right.DESANTIS: And we had really been doing well on the Trump presidency, on the tax reform. So I think we're on a great course based on what we've done in the Congress with taxes and regulations. And my fear is that this could potentially throw some sand in the gears on some of this stuff.BRENBERG: China came back with only $3 billion in retaliatory tariffs. They didn't come back with $50 billion or $60 billion, just $3 billion. Does that suggest to you --MCDOWELL: So far.BRENBERG: Yes. So far.MCDOWELL: Give them a few days.BARTIROMO: They have a $375 billion surplus with the U.S. What are they - - are they going to really -- how much are they going to do here to threaten that surplus?BRENBERG: But that is what I'm saying. This looks like they want to make a deal pretty quickly.BARTIROMO: I see.BRENBERG: Is that possible here that they really don't want a trade war?DESANTIS: Well, it's more possible with Donald Trump as president because they know that he means business on this stuff.BARTIROMO: Yes.DESANTIS: It's something he's been talking about for a long time. But I mean look at China's behavior -- intellectual property. I mean they are constantly doing things that are really corrosive to a free trade order, global order.So I hope so. I think Trump's the guy that maybe is going to deliver.SMITH: I get -- when you say trying to be doing worse in the whole trade thing over the years -- are you talking the steel or intellectual property?DESANTIS: Of course.SMITH: Well, how are -- I get the focus on that -- how are tariffs going to fix that?DESANTIS: Well, they may not. I mean that's the thing, you know. When you're doing tariffs, you do harm the target but you also harm yourself to a certain extent because of the way --BARTIROMO: And that's why they're also putting restrictions on investments because they acquire things and then transfer technology to China.Look, we've got to get to the spending bill. You're here. We've got to get your take on this. Pushed through by the House earlier Thursday, the senate passed a $1.3 trillion spending package, narrowly avoiding a government shutdown. The bill will increase military funding and domestic spending. You did not vote for it. Freedom Caucus was against this.What do you want to happen now? You want the President to veto it.(CROSSTALK)DESANTIS: I'd like to see the President to veto it. And then I think the reason is, just think about what happened. This bill was negotiated behind closed doors. You have a handful of members. The average person elected the House and Senate had zero input on it. It's unveiled at 8:00 p.m. on Wednesday and put on the house floor at 2:30 in the afternoon the next.So 2,300 pages, you have less than 24 hours -- no member read the bill, no member knows everything that's in that bill. And here's the thing. There's a lot of bad things in there. I mean, for example, they fund Schumer's project here in New York but they don't provide money for Trump's border wall. It was for bollard fencing which isn't going to -- going to work.So you're going to hear a lot of fiscal complaints about it which I think everybody -- but what does it say about representative government if that's the way we do business?That's not the way this thing is supposed to operate were five members on each side do this, they log roll and then they just jam it through.MCDOWELL: The irony is this is actually one of the reasons that we have a trade deficit with all these other nations. We are spenders and not savers. We are running up our debt, handing power to China, the largest holder of foreign U.S. treasury debt. We can't take power away from them.We're at odds. It's like, ok, we're going to now run $1 trillion annual budget deficit as far as the eye can see. We're $21 trillion in debt. The Federal Reserve is stepping away from buying some of that very debt.So now we need China to step up and keep buying it. God forbid they ever talk about selling it. But we're not fixing the problem at its root.BARTIROMO: So what were they supposed to do? What would have been the alternative?DESANTIS: They're exacerbating the problem. If you look at the past -- when Obama was president, the omnibuses were less egregious than this, I think. I mean I think it just -- the numbers I think speak for themselves.What we should have done is, you know, we have certain ideas that we want - - Defense, the President wants a border wall. You know, you have to engage in some give and take in the legislative process but to just open up the flood gates and say we're going to increase Department of Agriculture by 10 percent, we're going to increase HUD by 10 percent --BARTIROMO: Planned Parenthood.DESANTIS: -- we're going to do $200 million for democracy promotion in Europe.(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: Federal arts funding went up. Federal arts funding went up.DESANTIS: Of course it did.(CROSSTALK)SMITH: Let me ask you a pointed question because Paul Rand has identified a number of these pork products in here like $10 million for disadvantaged Egyptian students. Is there any of that in your district?DESANTIS: No.SMITH: There's none of this. Because I know this is how -- this is this whole pork barrel back --DESANTIS: Yes, yes. No, no, no.SMITH: It's how it operates.DESANTIS: No. So here's what would happen. If you actually did a normal legislative process, there'd be a single appropriations bill for whatever department that is.SMITH: OK.DESANTIS: And guys like me would be able to script it out. We'd be able to offer an amendment.SMITH: And why haven't -- why haven't we done that?DESANTIS: Because when you do the omnibus, they packed everything and it's a must-pass bill and just shove it through. There was not a single amendment that was offered to any of this stuff.BARTIROMO: So, would you have - would you have wanted less defense spending in order to not have some of this other stuff? What were they going to do, say no to Schumer, let the government shut down?DESANTIS: Well, here's the thing, if you had a good defense bill and you had reasonable on everything else but not of blowing off the doors, then it would be (inaudible) on Schumer to actually be the one standing up and (inaudible) in to a shut down. He's never been forced to do that, and he'll make the point he doesn't fill it - he really doesn't.He threatens to fill a buster, and then Republicans cave. And I think if the president would - imagine if the president vetoed this bill, get all these Senators and Congressmen on vacation-BARTIROMO: For two weeks--DESANTIS: Or anything like that, vetoes it, everyone's got to go back. And he's like I'm sorry, this is just not what the American people want. I think the public would rally behind him.BARTIROMO: And you think Marcus would rally?MCDOWELL: I think Marcus would rally because it would show some fiscal restraint.SMITH: Were in agreement on it, I think the market would go up even more.BARTIROMO: Does anybody - wait, does anybody here think that the president's going to veto this?DESANTIS: No.SMITH: No.BARTIROMO: You don't think so?DESANTIS: No.BARTIROMO: No, because it's all at the end of the day, I do believe President Trump likes spending money.DESANTIS: But there's the thing though, about the fiscal, here's his - he campaigned on the wall.BARTIROMO: Yes.DESANTIS: I think this is maybe the last opportunity he has to get it, and he didn't get it in this bill. He got $1.6 billion for see through balloted fencing, not the wall he promised.BARTIROMO: Real quick before you go, are you ever going to get documents from the FBI? I mean (inaudible), your colleague?DESANTIS: He's going to send a subpoena, yes.BARTIROMO: Now, he sent the subpoena now.DESANTIS: Yes - yes, yes.BARTIROMO: And I mean, 1.2 million documents, he's only gotten 30,000.DESANTIS: Exactly, so - well, that's one of the reason s why you need a special counsel. I'm sorry, there's no reason to stone wall like this unless you're trying to protect the bureaucracy, and that's what they're trying to do. And it's been a disgrace.BARTIROMO: We got to jump, thanks so much congressman.DESANTIS: Yes.BARTIROMO: Good to see you congressman Ron DeSantis, stay with us, back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back this Friday morning everybody, thanks so much joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Friday, March 23rd. Your top stories right now, 7:30 am on the east coast.Stocks battered on Wall Street, and the selling continues this morning. The major idiocy (inaudible) off of a growing fears of a trade war. President Trump signed his tariffs against China yesterday, that triggered more selling.TRUMP: We're doing things for this country that should have been done. For many many years, we've had this abuse by many other countries and groups of countries that were put together in order to take advantage of the United Stets, and we don't want that to happen. We're not going to let that happen.BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, China is firing back announcing its own tariffs on U.S. goods. Global markets are following the US lower this morning. European indices right now are down across the board, the FC100 down 2/3 of a percent. The (CAC in Paris, down 80 points, that's 1.5 percent. The DAX index in Germany down 207 points right now, that's one and 3/4 percent.In Asia, declines across the board sharply in Japan and China. Reports say that the Chinese state backed funds bought large cap stocks (inaudible) to sell off. Nikkei average, none the less down 4.5 percent in Japan.Looking ahead to the open here in the US, more selling but we are well off in the lows, Futures indicating a decline of the start of trading, that 80 points that is down from down to 100 earlier.Breaking news right now, there is a hostage situation happening in France as we speak. The attackers have pledged support for ISIS. Right now, all hostages expect for a police officer have been freed. We have the very latest developments happening in the south of France.Atlanta is on edge, meanwhile the city threaten by a cyber attack with hackers sending a ransom note, those details coming up.But all of that ahead, first this top story just half an hour, tariff turmoil. China is squaring off with the United States, slapping tariffs of it's own on US products, including pork and fruit. President Trump spoke out on his decision to implement the tariffs, calling the China defecate out of control.TRUMP: We have a trade defecate depending on the way you calculate of $504 billion. Now some people would say it's really $375 billion, but anyway you look at it, it is the largest defecate of any country in the history of our world. It's out of control.BARTIROMO: Markets in the US and across the world sold off on that. Take a look, now industrials yesterday at the close, down 724 points, that was almost three percent.Features this morning indicating another decline of about a third of a percent on the Dow, and a half of a percent on the Nasdaq. 36 points lower on Nasdaq.Joining us now is former FDIC chairman, and chairman of systemic risk council, Shelia Bair. Shelia, good to see you, thanks so much for joining us this morning.SHEILA BAIR, CHAIRMAN, SYSTEMIC RISK COUNCIL: Thanks for having me Maria.BARTIROMO: Your reaction on all of this.BAIR: Well, world markets don't like trade wars. And so I think we've got some rocky times ahead of us. There's clearly a problem with intellectual property, whether tariffs are the best way to deal with that's another question.I hope everybody can sit down and get this resolved. And get a good path forward fairly quickly, because the market's don't like this uncertainty.I do think that longer terms, China's interest in ours are aligned. I think China wants to grow it's middleclass, it's wants to grow it's domestic demand, it wants to reduce those trade surpluses and stimulate more demand within it's own economy.So, and they want access to our markets, we want access to their markets. So I think there's some common ground and areas of leverage to get this worked out.BARTIROMO: Yes.BAIR: So clearly there's a problem intellectual property. It's good, he's tackling it. But I just hope they can sit down and get it resolved quickly, because it's not good for the world economy.BARTIROMO: Dagen?MCDOWELL: Shelia, it's good to see you but again, it seems lie and this is the Wall Street Journal speaking as well in the editorial page.BAIR: OK.MCDOWELL: That a very half hazard, willy-nilly disorganized erratic approach, because if we need our allies to come together and lock arms with us and take on China. And there's theft or intellectual property. And them taking technology from companies that want to do business there.BAIR: Yes.MCDOWELL: We need those allies.BAIR: We do.MCDOWELL: Whether it's Japan, South Korea, and Europe. But instead, we slap on these steel and aluminum tariffs and then have to back track.BAIR: Yes.MCDOWELL: And again, it kind of throws these vary trading partners in to a tizzy if you will. So where's the logic in this approach?BAIR: Well, I don't disagree with you. I think tariffs are very blunt instruments. They're having a back track now with a lot of exceptions. There doesn't seem to be a lot of consultation with our allies.So, this and on intellectual property, which is a worldwide problem, it's not just United States problem in term s of how China deals with intellectual properties.So, clearly some more coordination could be - would be very helpful. But this is a very impatient administration, a very impatient president. He doesn't like to go through all of those processes first, so it is what it is.But he certainly got everyone's attention so let's hope people can sit down and have those kinds of discussions. And reach some kind of agreement to get us on an orderly path.BRENBERG: Shelia, China came back with only three billion dollars in tariffs. This was -t hey did load the guns and fired. This was a very small responses relative to what we expected. Do they just want to cut a deal, they want to get this down quickly, and that's why they're signaling this way?BAIR: That could be. As I say, I think longer term of our interest, there's a lot of alignment with our interest. And I've seen some -- I take a little reckless rhetoric from some of the administration about we're going to end our economic partnership with China. Which is really (inaudible) policy since the Nixon's era.So, longer term, I think we -- you know, our economies can benefit from each other. I think China recognizes that. I hope we do in the U.S., too. We've got to deal with this intellectual property problem, but I -- I did take it as a positive signal as well.MCDOWELL: I just want to point out something, though, that this -- a few billion dollars and in -- from China, and tariff -- they're targeted. If you target...BAIR: Yes they are.MCDOWELL: -- pork, they targeted the very areas that voted for President Trump. They targeted farmers, against soybeans, pork, hogs, and fruit are -- that's -- those are the very areas. So they're trying to make it hurt, politically.BAIR: That -- that's very true. That's a very core constituency for the President, so it's a calculated move. But not -- in quantitative terms, it's not overly provocative, which I still view as a good sign.SMITH: Hey Sheila, this is Gary Smith in New York. I want to ask you a more macro question...BAIR: OK.SMITH: -- because it gets to the whole tariffs things and your former job as Chairman of the FDIC. We think -- I'm more of a -- I'm a free market guy, I mean, that's my perspective. We seem to think that we get a bunch of smart people in D.C. and they can control, somehow, like the Wizard of Oz, major economic policies with, you know, the banking regulation, this whole trade -- the targeted trade tariffs.Wouldn't we be better off, do you think, in the long term just letting the free market work this out instead of relying on arguably smart people like you to try to maneuver the economy?BAIR: Well I -- yes, I like markets. I like markets allocating resources. I think, you know, this is one of the reasons why I've been such a passionate opponent of "too big to fail." I think that definitely skews markets towards very large, inefficient financial institutions. So, I do think that we need to let markets work, but it also means that we shouldn't subsidize certain types of activity.SMITH: Yes, agreed.BAIR: And the industry doesn't always like that, and there's a difference between being pro-industry and pro-market, and I think that's really the kind of dynamic you're seeing in D.C. now, where both Republicans and Democrats really -- you know, you saw it in the tax bill -- not much loophole closing on a lot of benefits to essential (ph) industries that also skew resources towards those favored classes.SMITH: Yes.BARTIROMO: Yes. Sheila, it's great to get your insights. Thank you. Thank you so much.BAIR: Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: Sheila Bair, joining us there in Washington. Coming up, Atlanta falls victim to the latest cyber attack. How hackers are holding the cities computer systems hostage. Plus, mail fit for a king; the royal wedding invitations are in the post, and we've got a sneak peak, coming up.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)NOVACK: Welcome back to another Tennis Channel "Court Report," a special presentation for Fox Business. I'm Jonathan Novack.The women took center stage Thursday, at the 2018 Miami Open, and the world number one had to fight hard to stay alive. Simona Halep was pushed all the way by lucky loser Oceane Dodin of France. After losing the opener 6- 3, the Romanian was down a break in the third before closing out the win 7- 5 in the decider. Halep moves on to play Agnieszka Radwanska in third round.And Sloane Stephens also moved on. The reigning U.S. Open champion eased past Ajla Tomljanovic in straight sets. It was a dominant display by the American, who's struggled to find any kind of form so far this season.And don't forget, Tennis Channel's live coverage of the Miami Open hits here (ph) daily at 10:30 AM Eastern. I'm Jonathan Novack.BARTIMORO: Welcome back. We have more breaking news right now on the terror (ph) situation happening in France, one police officer reportedly being held hostage. Lauren Simonetti with the details. Lauren?SIMONETTI: A person who is pledging support to ISIS is holding a lone police officer hostage at a supermarket in Southern France. That, according to mayor of the town. There are conflicting reports at this moment about the number of victims, some possibly dead, here. But we know all hostages, except that police officer, have been freed.Police have the supermarket surrounded, they're treating this are a terrorist situation. There have been reports of a police officer shot about 15 minutes away from the scene of -- the supermarket, but we don't know if those incidents are related just yet.Well, the hacker known as Guccifer 2.0 has been identified as a Russian intelligence officer. Investigators say the identity was uncovered after he accidentally left a clue online. Claiming responsibility for providing WikiLeaks with stolen Democratic National Committee emails, special counsel Robert Mueller has reportedly taken over the investigation now into Guccifer.Meanwhile, the FBI is investigating a ransomware attack that has shut down Atlanta's computer network. A ransom note reportedly demanding a Bitcoin payment to unencrypt the files; the city officials says the attack has affected some apps that people use to pay their bills. Atlanta now trying to find out how widespread the attack is, and whether any personal information has been compromised.And the hottest ticket of the year is in the mail. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have sent out their invitations to the May 19th wedding. There they are. Kensington Palace, unveiling the invitations, which were sent in the name of "His Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales." Six hundred guests have been invited. It's a service and a luncheon, which will be hosted by the queen at Windsor Castle. I can't wait to see the dress.BARTIMORO: It will be quite the affair, you know that (ph). Thanks, Lauren.SIMONETTI: Sure.BARTIMORO: Coming up, America's last keg maker voices concerns over new tariffs. We'll talk with the CEO of American Keg Company about the potential implications for his business, back in a moment, right here.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Boozers could be losers as President Trump's steel tariffs go into effect. The new trade policy is aimed at bolstering domestic industries. But America's last keg maker is expecting to get tapped out. Joining us right now is the CEO of the American Keg Company, Paul Czachor is with us. Paul, it's great to see you. Thank you so much for joining us.PAUL CZACHOR, CEO, AMERICAN KEG COMPANY: Great, thanks for having me on.BARTIROMO: So you're seeing a direct impact from these steel tariffs affecting your business. Tell us what that impact is.CZACHOR: Well, the tariffs had some unintended consequences. So, today, we manufacture all of our stainless steel kegs with domestic steel, all steel from the United States. As the tariffs were being discussed and implemented, the cost of domestic steel has continued to come up -- rise since the fourth quarter of -- of last year.But unfortunately, the imports that are coming in finished good products, mainly, say, Chinese kegs, there is no price differential on it. So our price differential between an import keg and a domestically made keg is continuing to increase, which is something I don't -- I don't where the customers -- where their breaking point is at that point.BARTIROMO: Which is why, Brian Brenberg, we like to look at this story from the consumer standpoint. They're going to see higher prices.BRENBERG: And -- and they're already paying a little bit more for your kegs anyway because it's American made, right? You're not the low cost keg maker. But, you're right. At some point, these businesses say, "I just can't make a profit if I have to pay more for your kegs." How does that affect your workforce, Paul? I mean, what does this do to employees on the ground who are at your plant trying to make a living here?CZACHOR: Yes, correct. We have a lot of patriotic customers that want to buy American made kegs. But, you know, unfortunately as the costs have been going up here in the last few months, we have to raise our sale price and we're starting to lose some business. So just recently, we had to lay off about a third of our workforce.BRENBERG: Really?CZACHOR: Yes.BARTIROMO: How much have you raised prices?CZACHOR: Our prices have probably gone up about $5 to $8 per keg.BARTIROMO: Wow, all right. So the -- the U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer testified before the Senate Finance Committee yesterday. He confirmed that certain countries will be exempt from the steel and aluminum tariffs. Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ROBERT LIGHTHIZER, U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE: What he has decided to do is to pause the imposition of the tariffs, with respect to those countries. We have the two NAFTA countries which we know where they are. We have Europe, we have Australia, we have Argentina, we have Brazil -- oh -- oh and obviously Korea, where we're negotiating the course.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: I mean, isn't this one helpful thing for you? I mean, does not -- is this not -- not affect things?CZACHOR: No. I -- I think what we would explain is that there's some unfinished business with tariffs. We need the administration to look at what we would call a holistic view. So if our raw material, our input costs are going up and countries are still able to import kegs with their low-cost steel, we need the administration to look for downstream -- downstream, at businesses such as us that use a high content of steel, and look at some sort of tariff.BRENBERG: Paul, one of the things we talk about a lot with these tariffs, even with the exemptions is that it creates a lot of uncertainty for small businesses. You don't know where prices are going. You don't know who's going to get an exemption. Maybe, in some cases, you don't even know how to petition for the exemption. How does that uncertainty affect a smaller business like yours?CZACHOR: Oh, it's very difficult, to -- to your point, we don't know what the future holds. And it's unclear where the tariffs are going. So we're very concerned.BARTIROMO: Tell us about this keg right here, your company's keg and the - - and the one that we have on set.CZACHOR: It's all stainless steel. It's domestic steel, all produced here in the United States. We market to about 6,000 to 7,000 customers out there, mainly craft brewers but there are some cideries (ph) and wineries that will buy kegs. And as you can see, we can do some marketing. We do a lot of screen printings ...BARTIROMO: Yes. Look at that, Fox Business. That's nice.CZACHOR: -- So, we did that just for you. Yes.BARTIROMO: Thank you, for that. And -- and what does this go for?CZACHOR: That -- that sells for approximately $80. It's a one-sixth keg or a sixtel, it's commonly referred to.BARTIROMO: Do you expect that you'll have to lay off more people if we see these tariffs stick?CZACHOR: If these tariffs stick and there's no help for -- for us, like as a downstream business with import or low-cost kegs coming in, yes, we'll be in some deep trouble.BARTIROMO: Wow. That's too bad. Paul, we're going to be watching this situation. Thanks very much, for sharing it with us.CZACHOR: All right, thanks for having me on.BARTIROMO: We appreciate it very much, Paul Czachor, joining us there. Still ahead, Toys"R"Us, gearing up for its liquidation sale after postponing it by a day, details on the closeout sale right here, next hour Mornings with Maria. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Friday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us. Happy Friday to you.

And good Tuesday morning -- everybody.I'm Maria Bartiromo. It is Tuesday, January 23rd in beautiful Davos, Switzerland.Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.We've got breaking news off the coast of Alaska to report -- a 7.9 magnitude earthquake triggering a tsunami warning along the entire U.S. West Coast. The new alert for residents across the coast, coming up this morning right here.And the government is back open for business -- Democrats relented yesterday agreeing to end the shutdown with a short-term funding deal, three weeks.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER: It's a shame, Mr. President that the American people and the Senate have had to endure such hand-wringing, finger-pointing, stridency to secure a guaranty that we will finally move to address this urgent issue.It is something the majority could have avoided entirely, a concern the President could have obviated if he were only willing to take yes for an answer.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, markets rallied on news of the deal to end the shutdown. The Dow, the Nasdaq, the S&P 500 all closed in record territory yesterday. Take a look -- Dow Industrials up 143 points yesterday, half a percent; Nasdaq up 72, almost 1 percent. Earnings are streaming out, Travelers just beating expectation hitting the tape right now after Johnson and Johnson did the same about ten minutes ago.Futures this morning a mix, take a look. They've reversed course. All the major indices are a mix. Dow Industrials up 36 right now so the momentum looks to be continuing there. But the Nasdaq holding on to just a two- point move on the upside. The S&P 500 has turned negative.In Europe this morning, markets are also mixed. Here too, you're seeing the major indices give up much of an earlier rally. FT 100 up 10 points, CAC 40 in Paris down 2 points and the DAX index in Germany up two-thirds of 1 percent, 78 points higher on the DAX index.In Asia, it was green across the board last night. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong best performer, up one and two-thirds percent.Putting America first, President Trump announcing a new round of tariffs on solar panels and washing machines to keep the U.S. competitive on the international stage, he says. I spoke with Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman about trade policy in the last hour of the program.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ADENA FRIEDMAN, CEO NASDAQ: We need to make sure that we are living in a competitive world and it is a global economy. And it's a global dynamic. So making sure that we have -- we open ourselves up to both trade in both directions. Trying to make it as fair as possible I think is one of the goals of the government but making it so that we do -- we don't lock ourselves way from the ability to trade. I think that definitely is a huge driver of growth in the American economy.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: We break down the impact of new tariffs on international trade this morning, coming up. We hear from Carlos Ghosn as well ahead of the NAFTA negotiations.Meanwhile there's earnings in focus on Wall Street certainly. Travelers hitting the tape moments ago -- you saw it on the screen $228 a share. That was above expectations. Revenue was also better than expectations. As you can see, the stock is up 1 percent.The king of beer is losing its crown -- Budweiser falling out of favor with Americans apparently. What knocked the classic brew out of the top three best selling beers in the U.S.? We'll tell you.And then the NFL accused of not standing up for our nation's heroes. Why the league is reportedly refusing to run an anti-protest ad during the Super Bowl. We're going to get into that, coming up.And coming up this morning, joining the conversation, the chief operating officer of PayPal is here, Bill Ready will join me momentarily. Also the CEO of Deloitte, Cathy Engelbert is here. North Ireland chairman Glenn Hutchins will join us. Co-founder of The Kitchen, Big Green and Square Roots Kimbal Musk also here. And Princeton University president, Christopher Eisgruber will join me.Stay with us. Big show ahead, jam-packed -- live from Davos.First, we want to go to our top story right here. President Trump signing a short-term deal last night to end the government shutdown, ending a three-day deadlock over spending and immigration. At the White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders painted the deal was a win for the president and a loss for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: What the President did, clearly worked. The vote just came in -- 81 to 18, I would say that those numbers are much more in the President's favor than in Senator Schumer's favor. I'm not sure what changed for him and what he gained.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining me right now from the White House to weigh in special assistant to President Trump Kelly Riddell Sadler. Kelly -- good to have you on the program, thanks so much for joining us.KELLY RIDDELL SADLER, SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO PRESIDENT TRUMP: Thanks for having me -- Maria.BARTIROMO: So this deal extends funding for three weeks. Are we going to be back in the same position on February 8th? Are we going to just live from week to week like this?SADLER: Well, you know, the President has been very clear with his immigration principles and what he wants to see out of immigration reform. And we have been making very good progress in putting together a deal and feel optimistic about it.Basically the President wants to see, you know, four things. He wants a permanent DACA fix but he also wants border security and that includes a physical border wall. He additionally wants an end to chain migration, which means, you know, an immigrant bringing in all of the brothers, sisters, relatives, extended family as well as an end to the visa diversity lottery system which basically admits 35 people a year into this country completely at random. We want to go to a merit-based solution.BARTIROMO: Well, these are all very practical ideas and I assume that the Democrats wanted that as well and yet they still staged this whole big thing and a shutdown in the government which by the way, the markets didn't even flinch about.What was it that turned? How did you actually end up coming to a deal, the congress -- how did that happen?SADLER: Well, I think that the minority leader badly miscalculated. I mean basically he prioritized -- he held hostage 327 taxpaying Americans to get an immigration deal through. And he found out quite quickly that that was not popular with the American public.A Harvard poll yesterday came out and said 58 percent of people disapproved shutting down the government to try to put -- you know, force us to negotiate immigration reform.So it was a bad miscalculation on his part and I think he realized it when he got, you know, the ten senators that he represent from states where the President won handily.BARTIROMO: Yes.SADLER: -- and you know, states like Missouri, like North Dakota, like you know, West Virginia -- that he didn't have the votes to sustain this for much further.BARTIROMO: Yes, that was -- were you referring to the population of America 327 million? Is that what you were just referring to?SADLER: Yes, yes.BARTIROMO: Ok. Kelly, let me switch gears because we want to ask you about these new tariffs on solar panels, on washing machines that the President has instituted yesterday following recommendations from the U.S. International Trade Commission.Whirlpool's chairman is applauding the move but the founder of one solar firm in Philadelphia says tariffs of up to 30 percent would be quote, "shooting ourselves in the foot". Is this a beginning of new round of tariffs coming out of the U.S.?SADLER: Well, I think you are seeing the President's, you know, America First agenda put into place here. He was very vocal on the campaign trail about he's for free and open trade but that trade needs to be fair and reciprocal.And so what you see with these trade actions was that back in June the USCR opened, you know, an investigation basically looking at the washer situation, what LG and Samsung were doing. And they determined and brought a recommendation to the President that they, indeed, were caught in antidumping clauses.They were over-manufacturing Mexico. They moved their plants to China. They now moved them to Vietnam. And this is very unfair to Whirlpool. We saw when we brought this investigation up in June that we immediately saw LG and Samsung announce they are building new plants in America, new manufacturing plants in America. And we welcome that.And we also saw with Whirlpool yesterday announcing 200 new jobs at their Ohio facility and we expect more investment from them to come. This president is pro-American and pro-American companies. He's going to do everything he can to strengthen our foot on the global stage.BARTIROMO: Yes. But, you know, people are worried that this is going to lead to bigger things in terms of a trade war. What do you want to say to people who are worried about that and where this goes next? Understanding that it's the America First strategy?SADLER: Well, this president is driven by economic success. I mean look at where he's taken and look at where his policies have taken us already.We've had the Dow cross 26000. We have unemployment at a record 17-year- low. We have got all of these companies now investing in their workers by giving them bonuses or raising their wages because of the historic tax reform that he enacted last month.All of the policies that he's enacting are revitalizing this economy and sending it to new heights. And he's very, you know, cognizant of those accomplishments and this is something that we are going to be carrying forward in the future. There's only good things to come for America.BARTIROMO: Yes. We're waiting on what we should expect from NAFTA -- when are you expecting the President to start making news there?SADLER: I think with a government shutdown, we are now -- we are negotiating and we know that the USCR Ambassador Lighthizer, you know, is looking at these discussions. I think that in the spring, in the month of May, you're going to see some real movement on that front.BARTIROMO: All right. All right. We will keep watching that.Kelly -- let me ask you this, the President is going to be coming here to Davos later this week, set to deliver remarks on Friday 2:00 p.m. here local time. What should we expect to hear from the President?SADLER: Well, I think the President is going to, you know, announce his pro-growth strategies on the world stage. Listen, you know, I've gone through the stats of like how great this economy and how great it is under the President. He's going talk about regulations and how, you know, we slashed 22 regulations for every one that we've enacted. And how that, along with tax reform and, you know, free and open but fair and reciprocal trade matter.And that we are open for business, but we -- you know, we are taking numbers and this trade deficit with China, this $300 billion trade deficit with China, you know, we are going to take action on that.BARTIROMO: Are you expecting a response from China on the tariffs on the solar panels?SADLER: You know, I don't -- I don't know. The Chinese government, I think the foreign minister has already made some remarks on that. And that is fine.I think the President -- President Xi knows exactly where this President is coming from and they have a good and open dialogue.BARTIROMO: Yes, for sure. Kelly -- it's good to have you on the program this morning. Thank you so much.SADLER: Thank you -- Maria.BARTIROMO: President Trump tweeted about the FBI story that we continue to follow and we will have the very latest on that when we come back.Also ahead Verizon reported quarterly earnings with mixed results. We break down the numbers for the telecom company ahead.Plus, the big business of beer -- why Budweiser is falling out of favor with Americans apparently. Later this hour, we'll give you the top names in that industry.Stay with us. Back in a moment.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good morning. We are coming to you live this morning from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.Breaking news this morning out of Alaska -- Cheryl Casone with the very latest on a powerful earthquake that has prompted now a tsunami warning and watches -- Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: That's right -- Maria.We're looking for the details, it's just after 3:00 a.m. in Alaska right now. A tsunami warning is in effect for the coastal areas of Alaska and British Colombia. A magnitude 7.9 earthquake, which was downgraded from 8.2 we should say, hit about 175 miles southeast of Kodiak, Alaska.Some people that are on social media right now, especially on Twitter said that the quake was felt hundreds of miles away even in Anchorage. There's a warning message from the National Weather Service sent to cell phones. It reads in part, go to higher ground or move inland.Now, the remainder of the U.S. West Coast is under a tsunami watch and also residents. The Kodiak police telling them right now, get to higher ground, 100 feet or higher above ground. So they are waiting right now in Alaska.Well, the TSA targeting six airlines based in the Middle East for tighter cargo screening, the Transportation Security Administration is now ramping up security on cargo planes that are coming to the United States on these carriers, these specific carriers due to terrorism concerns. The airlines are EgyptAir, Royal Jordanian, Saudi, Qatar Airways, Emirates and Etihad. The TSA wants to know such things as what is in the cargo, where it came from and who sent it.Well, a Facebook executive admitting that its platform may not be good for democracy. In a series of blog posts the head of civic engagement writes that Facebook can amplify both the good and the bad aspect of people. Here is a quote, "At its best it allows us to express ourselves and take action. At its worst, it allows people to spread misinformation and corrode democracy."And while Facebook attempts to fix its platform to prevent misinformation, Rupert Murdoch thinks that Facebook and Google should pay trusted content providers following a pricey (ph) model that's similar to cable television companies.The executive chairman of 21st Century Fox, Fox Business' parent company released a statement. Here is what he writes. "The publishers are obviously enhancing the value and integrity of Facebook through their news and content that are not being adequately rewarded for those services.Here is a look at Facebook shares; the stock up nearly 43 percent over the last year. 21st Century Fox shares up nearly 22 percent over that time, Maria. Mr. Murdoch making a very intriguing point here that trusted news should be paid for news.BARTIROMO: Yes. I think he makes the right point. I mean after all, what are they doing? They are reporting on content from others.CASONE: Fake news.BARTIROMO: You know, Rupert Murdoch -- well, Rupert Murdoch makes the right point and push back.Connell -- your reaction here because when you look at the distributors, they need the content.CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN HOST: Yes. I think the biggest question going forward after this move is whether other big media executives will follow the lead of Mr. Murdoch on this and whether kind of everybody teams up and says, hey listen, we are providing -- you know, to Cheryl's point -- the real news to counter your quote-unquote "fake news".It's just been boiling up for a while because Facebook in particular but other providers like Google and other technology companies have always had this kind of frenemy relationship with media companies like ours where they love to get the content but they do not like paying for it.BARTIROMO: Right.MCSHANE: So will other companies follow -- that's the big question?BARTIROMO: Yes but how -- I mean this whole idea of rating news sites -- how do we know it's not going to be political. How are we going to trust what these ratings are?CASONE: Well, that's up to Facebook -- Maria. And that's going to be the owner, this is going to be on them because --MCSHANE: Right.BARTIROMO: No.CASONE: -- look, they are under fire right now for all of this. They're under fire for Russian bots. Look at what's happened with Twitter and those fake accounts from Russia. I mean, they are losing market share.BARTIROMO: They are going to be watched closely in terms of how these ratings are developed -- Connell.MCSHANE: Yes. Yes, and I think, you know, maybe you have -- it's early but maybe you have some sort of stream on one side with quote-unquote, "trusted content" and a stream on the other side where you're getting a feed with what your friends are putting up there and what have you and they are both separated.But who the arbiter of that will be the question.BARTIROMO: Well, that's what I'm saying.MCSHANE: Yes, exactly. So that and --BARTIROMO: Right. Who is the judge of what's trusted?MCSHANE: Right. Well, the platform -- if we are only talking about Facebook, right, the platform would be Facebook, I guess. Right. I guess, do they make that decision?And then as soon as they do, if they do theoretically they're going to be hit so hard by people saying why did you pick x and not y? Is it because - - to your point, it's because you don't agree with their politics? So that's a can of worms and it's a little bit down the line, I guess. But this is --BARTIROMO: That's what I'm saying.MCSHANE: -- an interesting one to watch, you know. It's an interesting one to watch.BARTIROMO: Yes. And we will be watching it for sure.MCSHANE: Yes.BARTIROMO: Actually, I think Rupert Murdoch said we'll be watching that. I think that was his last line in that press release --MCSHANE: Yes.BARTIROMO: Guys -- thank you. Well continue this conversation.Want to take a break. When we come back -- the bitcoin rollercoaster. Who's going to take it? PayPal chief operating officer Bill Ready is weighing in on the future of the crypto currency. He'll join me next right here in Davos.And then the NFL under fire -- why the league is reportedly refusing to run this anti-protest ad during the Super Bowl.Back in a minute.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FRIEDMAN: We want to make sure that if we choose to enter into the market in terms of providing a future in the market that we number one, have client demand; and number two, that we put the right risk management protocols in place to make it so that people feel confidence in what we are providing and how that becomes an investable product.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: All right. That was the president and CEO of Nasdaq, Adena Friedman on her outlook of bitcoin -- the crypto currency sitting slightly lower this morning.Joining me right now is the chief operating officer of PayPall Bill Ready. And Bill, it's good to have you, thanks so much for weighing in here because it appears that when you're talking about mobile payments, your perfect to talk about bitcoin.READY: Well, sure.BARTIROMO: Do you like bitcoin? Is this part of your strategy?READY: Well, I mean, for me, you know, as an engineer by background, you know, the block chain technology of bitcoin sits on top of. I think, you know, it is a fundamental breakthrough in computer science and so there's tremendous long-term opportunity for the block chain technology.I think right now what you're seeing is a lot of people still thinking about it from a sort of currency perspective and maybe even speculating on that. I think it's still very early days for the commerce applications of bitcoin and crypto currencies.But you know, long term, we think there's a lot of tremendous potential there in the long-term beyond the currency aspect and what people are going to focus on right now.BARTIROMO: But we don't know which crypto currency will end up winning the day but you are a believer in block chain?READY: Absolute believer in block chain. You know, which crypto currency, I think the fact that there are a multiple of these, I think speaks to how much the underlying technology is more important than any one of the currencies necessarily. So the underlying technology of block chain which tends to sort of move across these different crypto currencies is the thing that I think most people are or many people are focused on.And the fact that there's multiple crypto currencies is evidence of the importance of the underlying technology more than any one of those currencies.BARTIROMO: And I mean I think the block chain technology is basically just telling us that you can trust the person on the other side of the transaction, right? For the most part(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: But you could use dollars with that, why do I need a crypto currency for that?READY: Well, I think that's the interesting thing that, you know, the breakthrough of block chain is really this notion of distributed trust. And I think the bigger breakthrough is going to happen when people apply block chain to use cases that could only be solved through distributed trust.Places where there's a well-functioning central brokerage of trust may not be the right first early application, you know. It takes seven minutes or so to settle on a block chain versus, you know, trading dollars, euros, you can do in milliseconds.So I think it's going to really be a bigger breakthrough if people think about the cases that could only be solved through distributed trust versus simple brokers that are well functioning today.BARTIROMO: All right. Let's switch gears and talk about business today. What are you seeing -- Bill? I mean mobile payment systems are driving business growth really across the globe. And you've been at the forefront of developing some of the most important technologies in your sector. How is business right now? What can you tell us about global commerce?READY: Well, so one of the most important things in global commerce right now is the move to mobile. So consumers have clearly chosen mobile as their primary computing device; consumers are spending more time mobile than any place else.And that's presented tremendous new opportunities. You know, we did $40 billion plus of mobile volume in Q3 alone, the last quarter that we reported. And so it's tremendous opportunity. It's where consumers are spending most of their time.At the same time the benefits of mobile have not been evenly distributed. You see it happening in the retail sector, for example, that you have some of the largest players have benefited tremendously, the broader retail segments are still trying to figure out how they go connect with consumers on mobile. And so we are really focused on saying, how do we go democratize great mobile commerce experiences for the entire retail landscape so they all can play, you know, in a world of mobile where consumers are predominantly choosing mobile as the primary place they want to go spend their time.BARTIROMO: And different generations view different ones differently. So millennials, I guess, favor what is the future hold for Venmo -- putting up some strong numbers. What does the future hold, in your view for Venmo?READY: Sure, as you know, I joined PayPal, the CEO of Braintree and Venmo. And so you know, we have always had this notion for Venmo from the beginning that Venmo will be a great way that you could pay for anything.And so what we started doing at Venmo is expand it beyond person-to-person payment. It's been a great growth vehicle for it. But recently we started making it such that Venmo users could use Venmo wherever PayPal is accepted.And so that's allowing Venmo users to go engage in a lot of new commerce activities which we saw were already happening. You could see in our public news feed that, you know, people were splitting a lot of transactions. They were purchasing a great sort of e-commerce and mobile commerce sites already. Now they're opening up for those Venmo users that purchase wherever PayPal is accepted.We have two million plus merchants now that are able to accept Venmo and really attract a great millennial consumer base and a millennial consumer base is really interested in using Venmo to make purchases wherever they shop.BARTIROMO: Yes. Good synergies there. You mentioned Braintree, the partnerships that it has with Uber, AirBNB -- these are important in terms of the partnerships. Is that what drives the growth at Braintree?READY: Well, one of the things for us, you know, with Braintree, we are one of the very first mobile payment platforms out there which is why most of the big early winners in mobile -- Uber, AirBNB, you know, and so many others -- built on the Braintree platform. And the great thing for us is that as we are one of the first in that -- one of the first movers in that space, we were able to innovate alongside those companies.And now, you see us doing that, you know, across PayPal. We struck in the last 18 months 20 plus major partnerships -- Facebook, Google, you know, and many others where what we are doing to enable mobile commerce is about not just a seamless buying experience but us connecting our 200 million plus consumers around the world to commerce wherever it's conducted. Whether it's on a mobile device in a social context, in virtual reality -- all these things and those are all at different stages of development.BARTIROMO: Certainly has gone easier.READY: Yes. But across any of those we are providing seamless acts for consumers to go engage in great new commerce experiences.BARTIROMO: Real quick before you go -- are you expecting a bigger regulatory hand from this administration on the tech sector in general?READY: Well, I mean we are 200 plus markets around the world and it's a heavily-regulated space. And so, we've, you know, worked around the world to engage constructively with governments. And we think there's a lot of, you know, great sort of, you know, upward trend in terms of what you can do to go democratize access to the digital economy.And so I think that's a common interest that most governments around the world have. And so we have found great ways to engage constructively, you know, pretty much everywhere around the world but we always work very closely with local governments to make sure --BARTIROMO: So you're not worried too much about the Trump administration putting in more regulation for tech?READY: Regulation is part and parcel of being in the financial technology industry.BARTIROMO: Sure -- and you've lived with it.READY: Yes. And regulation generally tends to go protect customers and we want to protect customers as well. So we -- that's why we work so well with governments is that we -- that's what customers know us for is to make it very safe, secure and easy for them to transact.BARTIROMO: Yes.READY: And so protecting customers is at the core of our business. Regulation tends to be in that direction to go for tech customers. We really have aligned interests with most governments --ANNOUNCER: Here again is Maria Bartiromo with a special edition of MORNINGS WITH MARIA, live from Davos, Switzerland at the World Economic Forum.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Good Tuesday morning everybody. Thanks so much for joining us live from Davos. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday January 23rd; your top stories right now, 7:30 a.m. on the East Coast.Breaking news, off the coast of Alaska to report.A 7.9 magnitude earthquake triggers a Tsunami Warning along the entire US West Coast. The new alert for Americans across the coast coming up this morning right here.The economic world descending on Davos, Switzerland this week, among the hot topics, the economic boom in the United States.President Trump along with several administration officials, Cabinet secretaries, set to travel to the conference now that the government shutdown has ended.This comes after the commander-in-chief announced a new round of tariffs on solar panels and washing machines to keep the US competitive on the international stage.I spoke with the CEO of Deutsche Post, Frank Appel about the move earlier.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FRANK APPEL, CEO, DEUTSCHE POST: I'm looking for fundamentals to work. The world needs - every country needs this productivity gains.If we don't increase productivity you will never be successful on the (INAUDIBLE) and the productivity comes from better education of the people, better infrastructure, competitive pressure that means open borders and that's the recipe.The tax reform in the US will be good short term because it creates you know, more you know, purchase power and whatsoever but it doesn't fix the fundamental problems.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Markets rallied on the news of the deal to end the shutdown; look at yesterday's market performance, the Dow, the NASDAQ, the S&P 500 all closing in record territory. Yet again Dow Industrials up 140 points, NASDAQ up 71 points.Futures this morning, not so strong; take a look, it's looking like a mixed story this morning. At the opening of trading, Dow Industrials had given up much of an earlier rally; S&P 500 has given up all of the rally and then some down now 1 3/4 points on the S&P; and the NASDAQ holding onto again but just about four points so we are looking at a market that is selling off a bit this morning.Investors are eyeing a number of earnings, several key names this morning including Dow components Johnson & Johnson, Travelers, Procter & Gamble, and Verizon, all reporting their fourth quarter earnings.P&G topped expectations, the Company is facing a viral headwind though, the latest as the CEO says that they are trying to stop dangerous Tide pods. Teens are eating these Tide pods and having it called a `challenge,' it's really bizarre but we'll get into it.In Europe markets are mixed this morning, it is P&G by the way down 1 1/4 percent, that's one of the reasons that the market turned around; in Europe markets are mixed FT 100 is up, CAC krone is down; DAX Index is up a 1/2 a percent.In Asia though green across-the-board, the Asian market set the cue from Wall Street, the Hang Seng Index the big winner up better than 1 ? percent in Hong Kong.Disobeying DACA, details of the hundreds of dreamers reportedly staying in the country despite orders to leave plus the new push to fund the border wall, we'll bring you the details on the spending bill that was approved last night, just safety (ph) until February 8th, couple of weeks.Meanwhile the King of Beers losing its crown, why Budweiser is falling out of favor with Americans.Also, ahead the NFL accused of not standing up for our nation's heroes, why the League is reportedly refusing to run an anti-protest ad during the very highly watched super bowl.And then could Gordon Bombay soon return to the ice?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MINNESOTA FICTITIOUS HOCKEY TEAM: Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, QUACK, QUACK, QUACK, QUACK -No, (INAUDIBLE).(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Yes, it could soon be a flying TV, the details as the "Mighty Ducks" look to make a comeback on the small screen.All those stories coming up this morning.But first this top story this half an hour, President Trump and his cabinet are packing their bags and heading to Davos, Switzerland.The commander-in-chief is expected to tout the booming US economy and tax cuts and urge fair trade and stress his `America First' agenda at the World Economic Forum this week.President Trump will be the first US president to attend this World Economic Forum since the year 2000, joining me right now here in Davos, is Wall Street Journal Editor-In-Chief, Gerry Baker.Gerry, great to see you?GERARD BAKER, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF WALL STREET JOURNAL: Thanks for having me Maria.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us this morning.Obviously, this is a big deal that President Trump is coming and he's got a good story to tell us, certainly as it relates to his economic agenda, yes?BAKER: Yes. I think look, this is a very unusual meeting right, this is a - this is a global elite, the global list of, elite, the people who have been responsible for the globalization, that a lot of people in America and in other countries in the world are very unhappy with and Donald Trump is coming here, right into the - into the heart of Global - the Global elite.I guess it's a little bit like Tom Brady walking into a bar full of Philadelphia Eagles fans, you can expect that kind of a reception.No, you can't actually.I mean look, you're absolutely right, he's got - she's going to come here, the big speech on Friday. He's going to tout his economic record which is strong, there's no question about that, the US economy has performed well, helped by - and probably going to be helped further by the big tax-cut, helped by deregulation and he's going to spell out the `America First' message.That is, you know, that America is tired perhaps of playing by other people's rules or see - or playing by rules and having the rest of the world not play by those rules and it's going to pursue its own interest and whether that's in Trade or whether that's in Immigration or whether that's in a broader approach to the international economy, the US is going to you know, put itself first if you like.Now a lot of people aren't very happy about that, they want US to take global leadership, they won't global responsibility to fall on the US's shoulders but Donald Trump is going to come here and I think tell them, I think in a peaceful and friendly and cooperative way, `Look, this is working for us -BARTIROMO: Yes.BAKER: - it can work for you and we want to work with you and make it work for everybody.'BARTIROMO: Gerry, what are you hearing in terms of the implications of the US tax law because I was speaking to someone earlier today and he told me that a lot of his customers in Europe, they had been expected to invest in Europe, they're changing their investing around, there now putting money into the US because of the favorable terms, because of that tax plan.Are you seeing -BAKER: (INAUDIBLE).BARTIROMO: - a shift in terms of how people allocate money and resources back into the US now?BAKER: No question.I just come from a lunch of CEOs, I was at a dinner last night with CEOs, all CEOs here, CEOs everywhere you look and whether they're American or whether they're European, they are expressing you know, a willingness to invest in the United States in particular.US tax rate has come down dramatically as a result of the corporate tax rate, it has come down as a result of the tax reform so US taxes are much lower now than much of the rest of the world, that makes US quite attractive.There's this one-time tax on repatriation for US companies, saw that with Apple last week and other companies doing the same thing so yes there's no question.Look, companies are not short of cash, they haven't been short of cash so it's not as though they are suddenly finding themselves flush with cash and they're going to invest it (INAUDIBLE) -BARTIROMO: (INAUDIBLE) -BAKER: - (INAUDIBLE) -BARTIROMO: (INAUDIBLE) -BAKER: - They have.BARTIROMO: - They have (INAUDIBLE) -BAKER: They've been leaning offshore largely because they didn't want to bring it back to the United States to - because of the high rates of tax.So, I think there's no question - and by the way I think one other thing that is helping investment, talking to some people here and around the world is you know, as Trump - as President Trump talks about you know, protecting US business and getting more favorable trade deals and some of these deals that he's - some of these trade measures that they've just taken in the last 24 hours and more still to come on that, people are looking, where are they going to invest.They - if they want to invest in North America, they don't want to take the risk of maybe being in Mexico or Canada because NAFTA may be - President Trump may finish NAFTA so they are actually looking at US and they are actually going to invest in the US.So, there's a - it's a pretty - it's a pretty good picture for the - and it's a pretty good overall economic outlook that the US has got right now.BARTIROMO: I want to ask your expectations of - on NAFTA in a moment Gerry but let me ask you about your top story in the Journal today -BAKER: Yes.BARTIROMO: - and that is, these tariffs -BAKER: Sure.BARTIROMO: - the administration gearing up to introduce an infrastructure package but before that instituting tariffs on washing machines, on solar panels, largely aimed at those Asian manufacturers, do you think this is the start of something bigger to come?BAKER: It could be.I mean so far these are relatively small.I don't expect you know, the Chinese - the Chinese have said they're going to look at what this means for their business and whether or not they will retaliate in some way, it's relatively small amounts so far and relatively small sectors.You know, I think that - and the downside of this is that US consumers will suffer because those cheap washing machines and to some extent cheap solar panels that many of them have been getting are going to get more expensive so we'll see.I think the bigger questions on Trade are still to come whether or not the president does decide to pull the United States out of NAFTA, that will be huge -BARTIROMO: That would be (INAUDIBLE) -BAKER: - that would be enormously important -BARTIROMO: - Yes.BAKER: - it would obviously affect the consumer in the US but it would probably bring more jobs into the US too.And of course, whether he's going to do more on some of these other issues, aluminum, steel, with China.So, look I think the US is getting tougher in terms of going for a fair- trade agenda and saying, `Look, you know, we have to compete on the same rules' and that is going to - that - cause the rest of the world to say, `Well, do - how much do we want business in the United States and how much are we worried about you know, the United States - about a trade war, do we retaliate or do we let it pass for now.'And we're going to have to see, we don't know yet.BARTIROMO: Well it will come to a head this year?BAKER: Yes.There's a lot - I mean, in the course of the next few months -BARTIROMO: Yes.BAKER: - whether it's steel, aluminum, NAFTA, quite soon. I mean -BARTIROMO: Yes.BAKER: - in the next few months there are several key deadlines that the president has got to decide what to do.BARTIROMO: You know, we'll see if that actually impacts markets. So far -BAKER: Yes.BARTIROMO: - financial markets are not listening to any fractures around the world -BAKER: They like the tax cuts. They like the -BARTIROMO: - they like the tax cuts, exactly (ph). . BAKER: - deregulation. I - I think one thing that is overlooked -BARTIROMO: Huge (ph).BAKER: - is how much deregulation there's been last year.They do like - it's true also the rest of the world is growing strongly; we're in Europe, Europe has been in stagnation for the last 10 years. In the last year or so it's really picked up.Japan which has -BARTIROMO: Yes.BAKER: - been in stagnation for 20 years is growing.The whole world is growing quite strong at the moment and that's driving up equity as you say (ph) -BARTIROMO: Speaking -BAKER: - in equity prices.BARTIROMO: - speaking of Europe by the way, Macron's getting a lot of positive remarks, isn't he (ph) -BAKER: He is.BARTIROMO: - this trip?Infrastructure, your thoughts, what should we expect from this plan, fulfilling the president's campaign promise?BAKER: Well we see some of it kind of leaked out overnight, I mean this is a big - look everybody - anybody who goes to an airport in the US, most airports travels on roads in the US, I mean goes through ports or whatever knows that the US infrastructure is creak - a lot of the US infrastructure is creaking, it does need that investment and the Donald Trump campaign and that -BARTIROMO: Yes.BAKER: - he's going to talk about -BARTIROMO: Compared to Singapore, Dubai -BAKER: Yes.BARTIROMO: - come on.BAKER: In Switzerland where we are here, where you know, things work incredibly smoothly even when there is 10 feet of snow as we just had, in the - in the last couple of days.But you know, it - this - there's no question the US needs investment.The question is what's done and how is it paid for and the idea I think is that the aim is to leverage public funding by getting a lot of private money involved too and so you could build some new roads, build some bridges, repair some of the airports that clearly need repairing, with a public - with a little bit of public money augmented by a significant amount of private sector money.There's profits to be made from it too I don't think you know, any sort of - and shouldn't add significantly to the deficit then -BARTIROMO: No.BAKER: - and that way because it will only be a relatively small outlay of public money and it could result in a real improvement to the core infrastructure of the US economy.BARTIROMO: Right.We will leave it there.Gerry, always a pleasure.BAKER: Thank you.BARTIROMO: I will look at your 10 points -BAKER: Thank you -BARTIROMO: - daily -BAKER: - very much.BARTIROMO: - from the Wall Street Journal, Gerry BAKER:We were right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.We are coming to you live this morning from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.We have BREAKING NEWS.The National Tsunami Center is now canceling the Tsunami Warning, after a powerful earthquake off of Alaska.Let's go right to Cheryl in New York, she's got all the details and a HEADLINE, Cheryl?CASONE: That's right Maria.We've just got the details in.They're not off the hook yet though.

CHINA STATE TV CELEBRATES NEW YEAR WITH RACISMStates News ServiceFebruary 17, 2018 SaturdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 435 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, N.Y. BodyThe following information was released by Human Rights Watch:Sophie RichardsonChina Director SophieHRWEvery Lunar New Year's Eve, hundreds of millions of people across China gather around their televisions to watch the Spring Festive Gala on CCTV, the state broadcaster. In recent years people have criticized the show for its sexism: in the 2015 gala, for instance, a sketch depicted unmarried women over 30 as unwanted second-hand goods. And a sketch in the 2017 gala extolled the virtues of women who embrace "traditional roles."Today, many Chinese viewers are outraged about a different kind of discrimination in the form of a shockingly racist sketch. That skit, intended to showcase the Chinese government's friendship with African countries and the "One Belt, One Road" development initiative, featured a Chinese actress in blackface with an exaggerated fake posterior and a basket of fruit on her head, saying things such as "China has done so much for Africa" and "I love Chinese people! I love China!" Accompanied her was an actor from Cote d'Ivoire dressed in a monkey costume."If you accidentally watched the Spring Festival Gala, please take an antidote," someone posted on WeChat, the popular Chinese social media platform. "Indignant at one's own race being discriminated against in white-dominated society while at the same time proudly discriminate against other races," wrote feminist activist Zheng Churan. Censors quickly moved to erase the condemnations.This is no aberrational slip-up by Chinese authorities. In October 2017, a charity exhibit organized by the Hubei provincial government, titled "This is Africa," displayed side-by-side photographs of Africans and animals showing similar expressions, such as a boy and a chimpanzee, each with their mouths agape.Last March, during China's annual rubber-stamp congress in Beijing, a politician presented a proposal urging the government to "strictly control Africans" living in China, claiming they "engage in drug trafficking, harassment of women, and fighting" and "have a high rate of AIDS and the Ebola virus."In 2012, amid a crackdown on "illegal foreigners," over 100 Africans in Guangzhou protested after an African man who was taken into a police station for questioning suddenly died in police custody. Some Africans living in the city described suffering discrimination and that the police seek out Africans to target.China's President Xi Jinping likes to talk about his vision for a new, just world order. It's hard to see that happening when his own state media broadcasts a vision of racism and then censors criticism of it.Load-Date: February 17, 2018End of Document

China pledged to invest $250 billion in the United States. Now what?CNNMoney.comMarch 29, 2018 Thursday 8:43 AM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: ECONOMYLength: 653 wordsByline: Julia HorowitzBodyIn November, President Trump claimed a win when he returned from his Asia tour touting $250 billion in deals with China.Now, those agreements ? which span sectors like energy, aviation and tech ? could be ammunition for Beijing as it spars with Washington over trade."The Chinese are going to see these things as bargaining chips," said Edward Chow, a global energy expert at the Center for Strategic & International Studies. "Clearly, Trump is a transactional guy."Last week, Trump told the US trade representative to levy tariffs on about $50 billion worth of Chinese imports, after a seven-month investigation into intellectual property theft. The United States also intends to impose new restrictions on Chinese investment.The moves, which follow new US tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, have sparked fears of a trade war. The Chinese government said that tariffs on about $3 billion worth of US imports will go into effect on Monday, hitting 128 products ranging from pork and fruit to steel pipes.China has yet to announce its response to the coming IP theft tariffs. But as the situation escalates, the deal package announced during Trump's state visit with President Xi Jinping could come up ? especially because it involves some big corporate names.? Goldman Sachs said it would create a $5 billion fund with China Investment Corporation, the country's sovereign wealth fund, to invest in US companies. ? Qualcomm signed $12 billion in non-binding deals to supply semiconductors to Chinese smartphone brands Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo. ?Sinopec, China's state-owned oil and gas company, said it would explore an investment of up to $43 billion in Alaska's energy sector. ? China Energy Investment Corp., which is also state-owned, signed a non-binding agreement with the state of West Virginia to invest nearly $84 billion in shale gas and chemical manufacturing projects. ? Boeing announced that it would sell about $37 billion worth of planes to a government holding company that buys jets for state-owned carriers such as Air China and China Southern Airlines.It's not clear if all of the deals were new. And there's been plenty of skepticism about whether many will come to fruition, trade fight or not."The Alaska deal, in particular, was signed because it was politically expedient rather than commercially attractive," said Hugo Brennan, senior Asia analyst at consulting firm Verisk Maplecroft. The contract gives China "plenty of room to back out down the line," he added.For its part, the Alaska group coordinating the project, the Alaska Gasline Development Corporation, said in a statement that it was not concerned that China would pull its support amid trade tensions.The details may be murky, but these deals could be currency for China as it tries to convince the United States to back down on tariffs. That's especially true because many involve state-controlled entities."Whatever trading stock you have for bargaining purposes, you keep ? whether [it's] real or phony," Chow said.That doesn't mean China won't move forward with the investments it deems strategic.For example, the plan to invest in shale gas production West Virginia could serve a real purpose. China has made reducing its reliance on coal a top priority, and it needs both the cleaner energy and the technological know-how that would come from such a project."[China is] the the largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world," said Jonathan Elkind, senior research scholar at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy. "It is an economy that is still building very, very vigorously. That represents a lot of a opportunity for US companies that have world-leading technologies."In the end, China is not going to do anything that it doesn't think is in its best interest, he added."You want to hope that after the shouting and screaming is over, some more sensible mutual accommodation will be found," Elkind said.Load-Date: April 3, 2018End of Document

China fired a prominent professor in a major win for the country's growing #MeToo movementBusiness Insider USJanuary 16, 2018 Tuesday 04:04 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 739 wordsByline: rosie.perper@businessinsider.com.au,  (Rosie Perper)Highlight: The #MeToo campaign has struggled to gain traction in China's traditional and largely conservative society, but the movement had its big break last week.BodyGuang Niu/Getty Images• A Chinese university announced it had removed a prominent professor after hearing multiple allegations of sexual misconduct against him.• The professor's firing has become a major win for China's #MeToo movement, which has struggled to gain traction in a traditional and largely conservative society.• Sexual misconduct has long been taboo subject in China, but the movement is slowly bringing the topic to the national agenda. The #MeToo movement spread like wildfire on social media            across the globe this year, with several countries creating their own version of the saying on social media.But China's version, #WoYeShi, has struggled to gain traction in a traditional and largely conservative society that still struggles to accept that sexual harassment is still an issue. But last week, the movement had a major victory. Beihang University announced late Thursday that it had removed a prominent professor after hearing multiple allegations of sexual misconduct against him, according to the Washington Post.In its investigation, the university found that Professor Chen Xiaowu "did sexually harass female students," the Post said. The university added that Chen would be fired from his post as vice president of the university and had his teaching license revoked. Luo Xixi, a Chinese academic living in the US wrote on Chinese social media that as Chen's former student many years back, the professor lured her to his sister's house home and made unwanted sexual advances, according to reports. She managed to escape in tears, according to her post, and five other students came forward with allegations after Luo went public. According to the Post, Luo called the news an "initial victory" in a statement. The movement's initial victory came out of a grassroots push for survivors of sexual misconduct to find their voice, particularly on university campuses.According to the South China Morning Post, students and alumni from dozens of Chinese universities launched online petitions in the last several weeks urging their schools to put policy into place that would prevent sexual harassment on campuses. But the movement faces many challengesSexual misconduct has long been taboo subject in China, apparent by the fact that the movement has struggled to gain its footing in the conservative country. Besides for the trauma of assault, victims are also up against the state's crackdown on activism and an inefficient legal system, according to the Post."Some women have come out ... [but] what's really striking is how few," Leta Hong Fincher, an expert in China's feminist movement told the Guardian. Fincher told the Guardian that China's Communist party censorship has facilitated a culture of censorship, making it all the more difficult for women to come forward and share their story. Hong Fincher also believes Chinese media has been told to avoid aggressive coverage of sensitive issues, leaving issues like sexual misconduct out of the public agenda."There is a history of the Chinese government being really worried about political upheaval outside its borders affecting its own population and there is no question whatsoever that the #MeToo movement is seen by the authorities as potentially posing a threat," she says.Huang Xueqin, a Freelance journalist, shared her story of sexual assault with the South China Morning Post and voiced her frustration with the movement's slow burn. "This is such a serious problem, but why is it so quiet here? It's like the #MeToo movement never created ripples in China," she said.Huang created a social media platform called Anti Sexual Harassment for victims to come forward in a safe space and gather the tools necessary to prosecute perpetrators.Despite the challenges, Huang told the Post that she is determined to catapult the movement forward."If the government asks me to stop, I will negotiate with them. But I don't want to and I want to keep going, because I am doing the right thing."NOW WATCH: A Georgetown professor explains how Martin Luther King Jr. 'has been severely whitewashed'See Also:• Steve Bannon suggests Trump's lawyer 'took care' of 'a hundred' women during the presidential campaign• Democrats are planning to bring sexual assault victims to Trump's first State of the Union address• TRUMP: I would beat Oprah but I don't think she'll runSEE ALSO: Time magazine names the #MeToo 'Silence Breakers' as its Person of the YearLoad-Date: February 11, 2019End of Document

China (Fuzhou) Pilot Free Trade Zone and eBay join hands to set up a pilot cross-border e-commerce industrial parkPR NewswireJanuary 12, 2018 Friday 2:53 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 659 wordsDateline: FUZHOU, China, Jan. 12, 2018 BodyU.S.-based on-line auction giant eBay is taking new steps into the Chinese market by setting up a filiale in China (Fuzhou) Fujian Pilot Free Trade Zone on January 11.The eBay Fujian company is eBay's first cooperation platform with the Chinese government and is eBay's second branch company in China following Shanghai.eBay on the same day also announced that it has teamed up with Linca Industrial (Fujian) Group Co., Ltd. to build a cross-border e-commerce industrial park in Fuzhou, capital of east China's Fujian Province. The park will be the first industrial park with a full industry chain of cross-border e-commerce in China. It is the outcome of a proposal signed by Fuzhou City government, the Department of Commerce of Fujian Province and eBay in April 2017.The planning area of the first stage of the park is about 30,000 square meters, comprising a logistics center, maker incubators, a talent training center as well as a payment service support center, among other services."Fujian sellers have always been active on eBay and offering a rich variety of products with quality services. The landing of the industrial park showed our firm faith in the huge potential of cross-border e-commerce in Fujian. We hope we can work together with local government to bring more companies and products from Fujian on eBay, and further on help them reach more consumers across the globe," said John Lin, chief executive officer of eBay Greater China."We hope to stimulate the potential and vitality of Fujian, which has always been a major province of export trade, and nurture a demonstrative policy environment and ecosystem for cross-border e-commerce industry in China, " said Liang Yong, deputy director of the Fujian Pilot Free Trade Zone.An eBay cross-border e-commerce institute was also established on the same day. Jointly organized by the Fujian Pilot Free Trade Zone, eBay and Fujian Business University, the institute features two majors - e-commerce and international trade, along with other optional courses. Qualified graduates will be granted a certificate from eBay and offered opportunities to work at excellent e-commerce companies in Fujian. The institute is estimated to educate 2,000 to 3,000 e-commerce professionals for Fujian every year.From March 13 - 15, 2018, the eBay-Fujian Cross-Border E-commerce Summit will be held at the Fuzhou Strait International Conference and Exhibition Center.The summit, boasting an area of 22,000 square meters and 1,000 booths in seven sections, will become an important opportunity for cross-border sellers to attract millions of possible clients in the Chinese market and enhance the influence of Chinese brands.E-commerce has become a major growth engine in China. According to a report jointly released by Alibaba and Accenture, China will become the world's largest market for buying and selling products online by 2020, with the total value of commodity sold by e-retailers to overseas consumers estimated to reach 994 billion U.S. dollars. The partnership between eBay and Fujian will no doubt be a win-win choice.Established in 1995 in California, eBay is one of the largest, most dynamic e-commerce platforms in the world. The company has been the top choice for many Chinese companies to explore overseas markets.Fujian is the second largest cross-border e-commerce exporting province in China and registered an annual growth of over 35 percent in cross-border e-commerce exports over the past three years. The capital city of Fuzhou is home to many manufacturers and e-commerce sellers. In the future,  Fuzhou plans to partner with global e-commerce titans including eBay and Amazon and wish to further strengthen its role in cross-border e-commerce. View original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/china-fuzhou-pilot-free-trade-zone-and-ebay-join-hands-to-set-up-a-pilot-cross-border-e-commerce-industrial-park-300581881.htmlSOURCE China (Fuzhou) Pilot Free Trade ZoneCONTACT: Li Shen, 609916534@qq.com , +86 13960830919Load-Date: January 13, 2018End of Document

Organizing Work of First China International Import Expo on Fast TrackPR NewswireMarch 23, 2018 Friday 2:40 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 722 wordsDateline: SHANGHAI, March 23, 2018 BodyExhibition Organizers from over 165 countries are already scheduled to participate in the first China International Import Expo (CIIE), which will take place at the National Exhibition and Convention Center in Shanghai from November 5-10, 2018. The first CIIE is also expected to attract upwards of 150,000 buyers from China and across the world.Created to serve as a platform for the promotion of global trade, more than 1,300 companies from over 120 countries and regions, including dozens of Fortune 500 companies and leading companies from all industries, have already registered for the event. So far, companies from Asia represent 35 percent of exhibitors, followed by Europe with 32 percent, the Americas with 16 percent, Oceania with 11 percent and Africa with 6 percent."The early registration numbers for the first CIIE are outstanding; we're incredibly pleased with the intense interest that we've received from the international community so far," said Sun Chenghai, Deputy Director General of the CIIE Bureau. "With the growing enthusiasm from buyers, many exhibitors have repeatedly applied to increase their booth size and upped their budgets. We are looking forward to welcoming so many outstanding foreign enterprises and working together to enhance the development of international trade."Some of the high-profile companies already conformed to attend include:Information technology giant Dell will showcase its world-leading innovations and solutions in the area of high-end, smart equipment.Microsoft will display its latest R&D result - HoloLens, which will project 3D effects with a first-person view.Global food company DANONE will introduce its infant formula milk powder, high-end mineral water, medical nutrition products and organic products to Chinese consumers to satisfy people's increasing demand for high-quality products.Official figures show that imports into China in 2017 totaled almost RMB 12.5tn (USD 1.95tn), an 18.7% increase compared to 2016. This figure is expected to rise to USD 8tn over the next five years as China, the world's second largest economy and second largest importer, continues its progression into new stages of development.Supporting the development of international trade is a top priority for the Chinese government, and CIIE is seen an important part of this strategy, with Wang Yang, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, highlighting the coming event during his remarks at this year's first annual session of the 13th National People's Congress. Zhong Shan, Minister of Commerce, used an often-used musical metaphor to stress that CIIE is not a Chinese "solo" but an international "chorus".Other governments and major international trading organizations also recognize the importance of CIIE. Japan external trade organization has reserved 10,000 square meters for exhibition, the U.S.-China Business Council has booked more than 2,500 square meters for exhibition, while Brazilian organizer FIESP will bring over 70 companies. 4 exhibition organizers from Australia have booked a total area of over 1,000 square meters. The Singapore Business Federation, the Ministry of Commerce of Thailand and the Indonesian Chinese Chamber of Commerce have all reserved an area of more than 1,000 square meters. In addition, nearly 100 companies from 25 Least Developed Countries (LDCs) have registered.The French government will send senior officials and a large corporate delegation; the Russian government has accorded great importance on CIIE and set up a special coordination committee; and the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy said that Germany will actively use CIIE's platform to showcase their products and services.The first China International Import Expo is hosted by the Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China and the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, and is supported by the World Trade Organization, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization.For more information, please visit:http://www.ciie.org/ View original content with multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/organizing-work-of-first-china-international-import-expo-on-fast-track-300618625.htmlSOURCE China International Import ExpoCONTACT: China International Import Expo Bureau, +86-21-6700-8870, info@sinoexpo.ccLoad-Date: March 24, 2018End of Document

CHINESE NEWS APP CALLS FOR COMMUNIST PARTY MEMBERS TO WORK AS CONTENT REVIEWERSStates News ServiceJanuary 4, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 748 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Online Chinese news platform Toutiao is recruiting some 2,000 editors to oversee content delivered to its smartphone app, after being sanctioned last week for alleged breaches of regulations and for spreading "pornographic and vulgar content."The app has begun recruiting content editors, whose job will be to filter out "illegal" stories from among the pool that the app sends to its users in a tailored news feed.Members of the ruling Chinese Communist Party are particularly encouraged to apply for the job, which offers full health coverage and pension benefits and paid leave, on a salary of up to 6,000 yuan per month, according to an advertisement on the recruitment platform Lagou.com.Successful candidates will be responsible for "reviewing and monitoring whether the content of the premier news platform of the day is illegal or not," the ad says.They also be charged with handling user reports and tip-offs of illegal content, it says.Applicants who are Communist Party members will be prioritized, but all applicants must be college graduates, preferably majoring in journalism, with "a passion for news and current affairs and good political sensitivity and discrimination."They must also possess "an excellent grasp of the mobile internet and internet-related laws and regulations."'Serious problems'Last Friday, Beijing's Cyberspace Administration temporarily suspended both Toutiao and Phoenix News for carrying pornographic content. Both were also accused of "having serious problems in guiding public opinion," suggesting a political aspect to the closures.Both companies promised to tighten up controls on content and management of staff after they were summoned to a meeting with internet supervision officials.Online activist Wang Fazhan said the recruitment exercise is likely a bid to limit the political risk to the app's parent company, startup Bytedance."By hiring people to screen content, they can say in the event of further issues that the content was screened by party members," Wang said. "It's a form of risk management."The ousted former editor of Baixing magazine, Huang Liangtian, said the Chinese government under President Xi Jinping is constantly reviewing its notion of what constitutes undesirable content, meaning that few in the media know exactly where the lines are drawn."Content reviewers won't necessarily be able to do the job even when they're hired," Huang said. "The problem we have right now is that ... people can cross a red line without realizing it.""What are our censorship criteria exactly? There isn't a set of standards; they are whatever those in power say they are," he said. "And their idea of those criteria keeps changing the whole time, so that we are in a constant state of transition where nobody has chance to get used to it.""I don't really believe that rank-and-file party members are going to be able to act as watchdogs and effective gatekeepers for the government," Huang said.A wider fearHong Kong political commentator Cai Yongmei said Toutiao isn't well-known for its political content, and the current clampdown on its operations is symptomatic of a wider fear that nearly 700 million people who access the internet by mobile device will get politically sensitive news of the wider world channeled to their inboxes by "gossipy" apps."The thing the authorities fear most of all right now is that overseas popular movements will spread to mainland China," Cai said. "That's why they are being more and more selective and controlling about content."Author and Independent Chinese PEN member Liang Taiping said Toutiao's recruitment drive is likely more aimed at sending a reassuring signal to the government."I think it may be attempt to refine controls of content, not make them stricter," Liang said. "Of course any dissenting content is still tightly controlled, but they will also be looking to ... create a false impression that people still have a channel for their views.""Otherwise, they may lose their audience entirely," he said.The suspension of Toutiao's service was aimed to "better promote mainstream values and the spirit of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China," according to the Global Times newspaper, a tabloid run by the mouthpiece of the ruling Chinese Communist Party, reported.Reported by Yang Fan for RFA's Mandarin Service, and by Wen Yuqing for the Cantonese Service.

Why China banned the letter 'N'CNN.comMarch 1, 2018 Thursday 9:28 AM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: ASIALength: 375 wordsByline: By Doug Criss, CNNBodyIt's kind of hard to spell China without the letter "N" (at least in English), but the Chinese had to make do without the letter for a while because it was banned.Yes, that's right: The Chinese government banned a letter.China banned "N" as part of a widespread censorship clampdown that occurred after word got out Sunday that presidential term limits might be dropped, allowing Chinese President Xi Jinping possibly to stay in power indefinitely.The pushback to this development was intense online. So was the government's pushback to the pushback. In addition to banning use of the letter "N" online, words such as "immortality" and "ascend the throne" were also deemed inappropriate to use on the internet.Victor Mair, a professor of Chinese language and literature at the University of Pennsylvania, said the government likely feared that "N" was referring to the number of terms of office, as in a mathematical equation n > 2.But the nixing of "N" was a temporary one. By Monday use of the letter online was once again permitted, according to China Digital Times.Winnie the Pooh, tooBut it wasn't just the alphabet that took a beating from Chinese censors. A beloved, fictional children's book character was banned online, too. For years memes derisively comparing Xi to the honey-loving bear Winnie the Pooh have circulated on the internet, so Pooh is periodically censored, like the character was Sunday after the term limits announcement, China Digital Times reported.The rest of the world first heard about this ban in 2013 when the Financial Times reported on it and printed a long-circulated picture showing the bear strolling with his tiger friend, Tigger, next to a photo of Xi walking with his then-US counterpart, Barack Obama, in 2013.When the image first appeared online, Chinese netizens began posting photos of Xi in, what they considered, similar poses.They juxtaposed a picture of a frosty handshake between Xi and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe with the image of Pooh and his gloomy donkey friend, Eeyore.Next to a photo that showed Xi inspecting troops from an open-top vehicle, they included Pooh standing in a tiny green car.Their sense of humor is ostensibly not shared by China's increasingly sophisticated internet czars.Load-Date: March 5, 2018End of Document

CHINESE NATIONAL SENTENCED FOR ECONOMIC ESPIONAGE AND THEFT OF A TRADE SECRET FROM U.S. COMPANYStates News ServiceJanuary 19, 2018 FridayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 1268 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the U.S. Department of Justice:Xu Jiaqiang, 31, formerly of Beijing, China, was sentenced yesterday to five years in prison, for economic espionage and theft of a trade secret in connection with Xu's theft of proprietary source code from Xu's former employer, with the intent to benefit the National Health and Family Planning Commission of the People's Republic of China. Xu previously pleaded guilty to all six counts with which he was charged.Acting Assistant Attorney General for National Security Dana J. Boente and U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman for the Southern District of New York made the announcement. The sentence was imposed by U.S. District Judge Kenneth M. Karas in White Plains, New York federal court."Xu, a Chinese national, is being held accountable for engaging in economic espionage against an American company," said Acting Assistant Attorney General Boente. "Xu not only stole high tech trade secrets from his U.S. employer a federal crime he did so both for his own profit and intending to benefit the Chinese government. Xu's sentence clearly demonstrates that the National Security Division will not hesitate to pursue and prosecute those who steal from American businesses. I thank the many people who worked hard to bring this result.""As he previously admitted in federal court, Xu Jiaqiang stole high-tech trade secrets from a U.S. employer, intending to benefit the Chinese government," said U.S. Attorney Berman. "The laws governing economic espionage and trade secrets exist, in part, to protect the sanctity of American ingenuity and property. Xu's prison sentence should be a red flag for anyone attempting to illegally peddle American expertize and intellectual property to foreign bidders."According to the allegations contained in the Complaint and the Superseding Indictment filed against Xu, as well as statements made in related court filings and proceedings:From November 2010 to May 2014, Xu worked as a developer for a particular U.S. company (the Victim Company). As a developer, Xu enjoyed access to certain proprietary software (the Proprietary Software), as well as that software's underlying source code (the Proprietary Source Code). The Proprietary Software is a clustered file system developed and marketed by the Victim Company in the United States and other countries. A clustered file system facilitates faster computer performance by coordinating work among multiple servers. The Victim Company takes significant precautions to protect the Proprietary Source Code as a trade secret. Among other things, the Proprietary Source Code is stored behind a company firewall and can be accessed only by a small subset of the Victim Company's employees. Before receiving Proprietary Source Code access, Victim Company employees must first request and receive approval from a particular Victim Company official. Victim Company employees must also agree in writing at both the outset and the conclusion of their employment that they will maintain the confidentiality of any proprietary information. The Victim Company takes these and other precautions in part because the Proprietary Software and the Proprietary Source Code are economically valuable, which value depends in part on the Proprietary Source Code's secrecy.In May 2014, Xu voluntarily resigned from the Victim Company. Xu subsequently communicated with one undercover law enforcement officer (UC-1), who posed as a financial investor aiming to start a large-data storage technology company, and another undercover law enforcement officer (UC-2), who posed as a project manager, working for UC-1. In these communications, Xu discussed his past experience with the Victim Company and indicated that he had experience with the Proprietary Software and the Proprietary Source Code. On March 6, 2015, Xu sent UC-1 and UC-2 a code, which Xu stated was a sample of Xu's prior work with the Victim Company. A Victim Company employee (Employee-1) later confirmed that the code sent by Xu included proprietary Victim Company material that related to the Proprietary Source Code.Xu subsequently informed UC-2 that Xu was willing to consider providing UC-2's company with the Proprietary Source Code as a platform for UC-2's company to facilitate the development of its own data storage system. Xu informed UC-2 that if UC-2 set up several computers as a small network, then Xu would remotely install the Proprietary Software so that UC-1 and UC-2 could test it and confirm its functionality.In or around early August 2015, the FBI arranged for a computer network to be set up, consistent with Xu's specifications. Files were then remotely uploaded to the FBI-arranged computer network (the Xu Upload). Thereafter, on or about Aug. 26, 2015, Xu and UC-2 confirmed that UC-2 had received the Xu Upload. In September 2015, the FBI made the Xu Upload available to a Victim Company employee who has expertise regarding the Proprietary Software and the Proprietary Source Code (Employee-2). Based on Employee-2's analysis of technical features of the Xu Upload, it appeared to Employee-2 that the Xu Upload contained a functioning copy of the Proprietary Software. It further appeared to Employee-2 that the Xu Upload had been built by someone with access to the Proprietary Source Code who was not working within the Victim Company or otherwise at the Victim Company's direction.On Dec. 7, 2015, Xu met with UC-2 at a hotel in White Plains, New York (the Hotel). Xu stated, in sum and substance, that Xu had used the Proprietary Source Code to make software to sell to customers, that Xu knew the Proprietary Source Code to be the product of decades of work on the part of the Victim Company, and that Xu had used the Proprietary Source Code to build a copy of the Proprietary Software, which Xu had uploaded and installed on the UC Network (i.e., the Xu Upload). Xu also indicated that Xu knew the copy of the Proprietary Software that Xu had installed on the UC Network contained information identifying the Proprietary Software as the Victim Company's property, which could reveal the fact that the Proprietary Software had been built with the Proprietary Source Code without the Victim Company's authorization. Xu told UC-2 that Xu could take steps to prevent detection of the Proprietary Software's origins i.e., that it had been built with stolen Proprietary Source Code including writing computer scripts that would modify the Proprietary Source Code to conceal its origins.Later on Dec. 7, 2015, Xu met with UC-1 and UC-2 at the Hotel. During that meeting, Xu showed UC-2 a copy of what Xu represented to be the Proprietary Source Code on Xu's laptop. Xu noted to UC-2 a portion of the code that indicated it originated with the Victim Company as well as the date on which it had been copyrighted. Xu also stated that Xu had previously modified the Proprietary Source Code's command interface to conceal the fact that the Proprietary Source Code originated with the Victim Company and identified multiple specific customers to whom Xu had previously provided the Proprietary Software using Xu's stolen copy of the Proprietary Source Code.* * *Mr. Boente and Mr. Berman praised the FBI's outstanding investigative efforts. Mr. Berman also thanked the U.S. Department of Justice's National Security Division.Assistant U.S. Attorneys Benjamin Allee and Ilan Graff of the Southern District of New York, with assistance from Trial Attorney David Aaron of the National Security Division's Counterintelligence and Export Control Section, are in charge of the prosecution.Load-Date: January 20, 2018End of Document

Files were then remotely uploaded to the FBI-arranged computer network (the "Xu Upload"). Thereafter, on or about August 26, 2015, XU and UC-2 confirmed that UC-2 had received the Xu Upload. In September 2015, the FBI made the Xu Upload available to a Victim Company employee who has expertise regarding the Proprietary Software and the Proprietary Source Code ("Employee-2"). Based on Employee-2's analysis of technical features of the Xu Upload, it appeared to Employee-2 that the Xu Upload contained a functioning copy of the Proprietary Software. It further appeared to Employee-2 that the Xu Upload had been built by someone with access to the Proprietary Source Code who was not working within the Victim Company or otherwise at the Victim Company's direction.On December 7, 2015, XU met with UC-2 at a hotel in White Plains, New York (the "Hotel"). XU stated, in sum and substance, that XU had used the Proprietary Source Code to make software to sell to customers, that XU knew the Proprietary Source Code to be the product of decades of work on the part of the Victim Company, and that XU had used the Proprietary Source Code to build a copy of the Proprietary Software, which XU had uploaded and installed on the UC Network (i.e., the Xu Upload). XU also indicated that XU knew the copy of the Proprietary Software that XU had installed on the UC Network contained information identifying the Proprietary Software as the Victim Company's property, which could reveal the fact that the Proprietary Software had been built with the Proprietary Source Code without the Victim Company's authorization. XU told UC-2 that XU could take steps to prevent detection of the Proprietary Software's origins - i.e., that it had been built with stolen Proprietary Source Code - including writing computer scripts that would modify the Proprietary Source Code to conceal its origins.Later on December 7, 2015, XU met with UC-1 and UC-2 at the Hotel. During that meeting, XU showed UC-2 a copy of what XU represented to be the Proprietary Source Code on XU's laptop. XU noted to UC-2 a portion of the code that indicated it originated with the Victim Company as well as the date on which it had been copyrighted. XU also stated that XU had previously modified the Proprietary Source Code's command interface to conceal the fact that the Proprietary Source Code originated with the Victim Company and identified multiple specific customers to whom XU had previously provided the Proprietary Software using XU's stolen copy of the Proprietary Source Code.In addition to the five-year prison term, XU, 32, formerly of Beijing, China, was ordered to pay a $100 special assessment.Mr. Berman and Mr. Boente praised the Federal Bureau of Investigation's outstanding investigative efforts. He also thanked the U.S. Department of Justice's National Security Division.The case is being handled by the Office's Terrorism and International Narcotics Unit and its White Plains Division. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Benjamin Allee and Ilan Graff, with assistance from Trial Attorney David Aaron of the National Security Division's Counterintelligence and Export Control Section, are in charge of the prosecution.

It looks like Snap has big plans for the Chinese advertising market (SNAP)Business Insider USJanuary 6, 2018 Saturday 08:30 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 585 wordsByline: aoreskovic@businessinsider.com,  (Alexei Oreskovic)Highlight: Snap's been under pressure, thanks to slowing sales and user growth and a stock price that's down in the dumps. But it may have an answer.BodyYouTube/Snapchat• Snap is planning an "ambitious" effort to expand its advertising business in China.• As part of that effort, it's hiring an international strategy manager that will be based Beijing or Shenzhen.• The effort comes as the company is under pressure from investors thanks to slowing revenue growth and a weak stock price.Under pressure to boost its slowing revenue growth and a stock price that's been in the dumps for months, Snap is turning to China.The company is planning on an "ambitious" effort to attract advertisers from China and other Asian-Pacific countries to its Snapchat app. Snap has a goal of quickly growing sales from the effort. The social app creator quietly revealed the strategy in a recently posted job listing. The company announced in the listing that it is trying to hire an international strategy manager to spearhead its advertising efforts in the Chinese market. The manager, who would be based in Shenzhen or Beijing, would be on the hook for "ambitious revenue targets for assigned markets," according to the listing. "You will be responsible for developing and implementing our commercial strategy for the Chinese advertising market," the job ad reads.Any effort to tap the Chinese ad market could help Snap get back in Wall Street's good graces. Several quarters of disappointing financial results have            weighed on its stock price.It's not clear how much advertising business Snap currently does in China or how big its staff is in the country. The Chinese government blocks citizens from accessing Snapchat, Snap's primary product, just as it tries to prevent them from using Facebook, Twitter, and most of the other American internet services Snapchat competes with. And Snap CEO Evan Spiegel has previously played down the company's involvement in the country.In December 2016, CNN reported that the company had recently opened a small research-and-development lab in Shenzhen to help with hardware products such as its Spectacles video-camera glasses. But other than the new engineers and its ties to Tencent, the Chinese internet company that invested in Snap, Snap has scant dealings in the country, Spiegel told financial analysts on a conference call in May, shortly after the company's initial public offering."In the very early days, Tencent invested in our business, and we had the chance to spend a lot of time with them. We've always been in awe, frankly, of the innovation happening over there. And that's really as far as our relationship with China has progressed today. But we've invested in building out some engineering there, and obviously it's really exciting for our business," Spiegel said.However, since then, Tencent has upped its investment in Snap, buying another 146 million non-voting shares to give it a 10% total stake. It's possible that the closer ties with Tencent could give the company the local partner it needs to expand its business in China. Snap did not immediately return requests for comment on its China plans. NOW WATCH: 7 science-backed ways for a happier and healthier 2018 - this is what you do the very first weekSee Also:• A major alcohol firm pulled all ads from Snapchat because it can't be 100% sure children weren't seeing them• Evan Spiegel personally paid Drake to perform at Snap's New Year's party - check it out• Evan Spiegel reportedly dropped $4 million on a massive New Year's Eve party for Snapchat - and Drake's going to be thereSEE ALSO: The risks and potential upsides of Snapchat's big redesignLoad-Date: February 11, 2019End of Document

Getting tough on trade, it has sparked global reaction. The world is reacting to President Trump's tough trade talk. And administration officials have been fighting back the criticism. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross addressed the potentially impact of tariff increase with me this weekend on "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES".(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WILBUR ROSS, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF COMMERCE: In terms the inflationary impact, we're talking about a total of $9 billion of tariffs. That's about one-half of one percent of the economy. So this business of the sky is falling, it's just silly.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: The trade debate rattling U.S. investors nonetheless, driving stocks lower last week. The Dow closed in the red for the fourth straight trading day on Friday. That was the longest losing streak in five months. Futures indicating that the selling will continue this morning.

Host Jimmy Kimmel and other A-listers took aim at President Trump. The double standard at the Oscars this morning. And making the most of your opportunity, a college linebacker, stuns scouts and the internet. Check this out, the inspiring story is as Shaq Griffin sets records at the NFL Combine. All those stories coming up this Monday morning and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the Wall Street Journal's Global Economics Editor, Jon Hilsenrath and pollster and the president of Maslansky and Partners, Lee Carter. Great to see you.LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS: Great to be here.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: See? Lots to talk about this morning.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: That's the feel-good story of the weekend though, Shaquem Griffin, I hope to see Hawks pick him up, his brother plays for the Seahawks, inspiring story.JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR: Also the story is he only has one hand to play, and not only did he have a great 40-yard dash, but he bench pressed 225 pounds.BARTIROMO: I know it --(CROSSTALK)HILSENRATH: I'd love to see that video.BARTIROMO: We are. We're going to show you that video, that's all coming up. And joining the conversation this morning, we've got the CEO of TIAA- CREF, Roger Ferguson, he's the CEO and President of TIAA-CREF, as well as the former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, the host of "MICHILLE MALKIN INVESTIGATES", Michelle Malkin is here. And the host of "VARNEY & COMPANY", Stuart Varney weighs in as well. Don't miss a moment of it, we got a big hour coming up right now. And we kick off now with this top story, investors are watching Washington as the President's tough trade talks rattles Wall Street and markets. Blake Burman is live at the White House this morning, he's got the very latest. Blake, good morning to you.BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Maria, good morning to you as well. And the President's top advisor says no countries will be exempt from the steel and aluminum tariffs. And this morning, President Trump us seeming to tie this to a NAFTA rework. The President tweeting out just a while ago, "we have large trade deficits with Mexico and Canada, NAFTA which is under renegotiation right now has been a bad deal for USA. Massive relocation of companies and jobs, tariffs on steel and aluminum will only come off if new and fair NAFTA agreement is signed. However, the President top trade advisory Peter Navarro said a little while ago that this really didn't have much to do with NAFTA.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PETER NAVARRO, DIRECTOR, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL TRADE COUNCIL: The purpose of the tariffs is to defend our steel and aluminum industries, make no mistake about it, and if -- I understand if we get a -- if we get a great NAFTA agreement and Ambassador Lighthizer is trying to do that, that would be a great thing for the American people. But at this point in time, 25 percent on steel, 10 percent on aluminum, no country exclusions, firm line in the sand.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURMAN: But European Union has said it would impose tariffs on Harley Davidson and Bourbon for example, that would cut right into the constituencies of Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell. And in an apparent response over the weekend, President Trump also threatened a tax on European vehicles, Republicans all across Washington are hoping the President will reconsider.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: Your solution has let China off the hook, this only going to hurt American consumers and our allies. Please reconsider your solution.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURMAN: The President tweeted out just a little while ago within the last couple minutes here, Maria. The following, "to protect our country, we must protect American steel, #AmericaFirst. As far as the timing here, Maria, Peter Navarro also contends that the President is set to sign this, at some point either later this week or at some point next week. And the administration argues that there will be no meaningful downstream costs to the consumers. That part of their argument, Maria.BARTIROMO: Yes. The deadlines are April 11th for steel and April 19th for aluminum but that tweet that you mentioned that the President posted today this morning when he said, tariffs on steel and aluminum will only come off if new and fair NAFTA agreement is signed. Is he opening the door to having some, you know, you know, carve-outs?BURMAN: One -- well, one would think that that tweet maybe opens the door for a potential bargaining position but you just heard Peter Navarro there say, this has everything to do with steel and aluminum. This is a separate issue now. With this White House we often always see the President say or tweet one thing, advisers say something else but they say this is going to be wrapped up within a few days.BARTIROMO: All right. We'll be watching. Blake, thank you. Blake Burman with the latest there at the White House. Joining us right now to talk more about that is the host of "MICHELLE MALKIN INVESTIGATES" on CRTV.com, Michelle Malkin. It's always a pleasure to see you, Michelle. Thanks for joining us.MICHELLE MALKIN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Thanks, Maria.BARTIROMO: Your thoughts on the President's trade policy here in these tariffs.MALKIN: Well, it's not a surprise, he's been signaling that this is where he was going to go since he wrote his book in 2011 advocating for these kinds of tariffs. He is making good on his promise to keep America first, and I know that roils a lot of the most orthodox of free trade conservatives. I would say that I think that there is a lot of hyperbole and undue Chicken Little alarmism. I would note that I'm here in Colorado and one of the companies that has been sounding the alarm, as a company Ball Corporation, maker of aluminum goods. And although their stock fell about 1-1/2 percent last week, overall, their up five percent and I think I will trust the markets' judgment on this more than a lot of the alarmist pundits on whatever side they are on. I mean, the market had fallen 10 or 20 percent, may be that kind of chicken littlism would be -- would be justified. But I think that I think that -- I think the devil is in details. And as you point out, it looks like the president is -- if not Peter Navarro anyway, is opening the door to these kinds of carve-outs. And the final language isn't out yet, so we'll have to see.MCDOWELL: Michelle, it's Dagen McDowell, but it's not just people kind of pundit sounding alarms, it's some of the individuals who advised President Trump on his pro-growth, pro-U.S. parts of his agenda. And over the weekend it was Art Laffer and Steve Moore and Larry Kudlow just saying to the President, tariffs historically don't work, this could damage a lot more jobs than had actually helps. And it seems like - and to boil it down, it's that you are -- you jeopardize harming many, meaning Americans to save the few.MALKIN: Right, I understand that. And of course, as someone who is generally a free trade conservative, I completely understand where Steve Moore and Art Laffer are coming from. On the other hand because I have been a vocal advocate of the sovereignty agenda of this President, I think it's important to understand historically that there have been numerous Republican presidents over the years particularly in the post Civil War era who were for tariffs and there is -- there is mixed evidence and there is a lot of internal debate on the right about the effect of tariffs particularly on job creation and prices.BARTIROMO: Yes.MALKIN: I think that the argument among Trump's economic supporters who do support this is that you'll see it the wall Street Journal even today, that overall that this is a drop in the bucket in overall economy.BARTIROMO: Yes. But look, you said earlier, Lee Carter, he is answering to the people who voted for him. I mean, the President is going to go to Pennsylvania on Saturday, March 10th for political rally in advance of the March 13th house special election, they're going to be cheering on this.MALKIN: There's no question about that. I mean, we were just talking earlier, there's an -- there's an article about this in the Wall Street Journal on page three about how Pennsylvania voters are feeling about the tariffs and how this is really appealing to them. I think that the President is one who is talking to the people, he's not talking to influencers, he's not talking to --BARTIROMO: Certainly not the elites, the global elites.(CROSSTALK)MALKIN: He is talking --HILSENRATH: To the people exactly who voted for him, look at the steel states.BARTIROMO: Who are worried about their jobs --(CROSSTALK)HILSENRATH: -- Ohio, this -- I was at an event that he spoke at on Saturday. And the President thinks very often and very carefully about the states that went for him, he was going on and on about --BARTIROMO: Ohio, Pennsylvania, exactly, Michigan.(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: But the people who live in those states who don't work for steel producers, who work for steel-consuming industries.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: They're going to get -- they're going to get --MCDOWELL: Look at Michigan, you have a guy quoted in the Journal today, he's a supplier of metal stampings and he said he -- I'm worried about a repeat of 2002, again, Bush's still tariffs destroyed 200,000 jobs because of those tariffs. That was more the entire employment of the steel industry back then and he's worried about auto companies, they go to other sources --(CROSSTALK)CARTER: Let's not forget that Trump and his -- when Trump was campaigning, he promised to make better trade deals, he's going to bring back jobs, they were going to -- he was going to do all of these things and so people hear that he is making this move and that means jobs to them, better economics, security, and that's not -- well, might not necessarily be evidence-based, that's what people believe.BARTIROMO: Final word on this, we've got to get to this illegal immigration story but go ahead, Michelle.MALKIN: Yes. I think this is Mr. Art of the deal and we'll see in the end that if he gets what he wants, fairer trade deals that these are not going to be interminable tariffs and in fact it may follow the path of George W. Bush which -- I mean, after a year he got rid of them. If you look at the solar panel and dishwasher tariffs as well which were an extension of Obama, those were phased out too. So this isn't going to last forever.BARTIROMO: All right. Let's move to this other stunning story which -- we got to get your take on an illegal immigrant in California has pled guilty to stealing a U.S. citizen's identity for 37 years. And more than $300,000 in taxpayer money. Prosecutors say that he traveled freely between the U.S. and Mexico, he avoided prosecution for dozens of crimes. He was deported twice all because he got his hands on somebody's birth certificate and was able to get a driver's license and all this stuff, also to become eligible for these U.S. benefits, $200,000. What do you make of this, Michelle?MALKIN: It's outrageous, it's been happening for decades. And I think it certainly gives lie to the idea that this kind of the identity theft by illegal aliens and some kind of harmless crime. I mean, I've reported so many times over the last quarter century since I was a columnist at the Los Angeles Daily News about how this victimizes people and they have to deal with it for the rest of their lives. It's stunning if you look at the amount of theft and the length of this particular individual, but it's way overdue for these kind of cases to be prosecuted. And I haven't seen this kind of prosecution happened like I said over the last 25 years, I've been doing this. I think it also points to the fact that idea that identity theft is seen as some sort of harmless misdemeanor and that it would be forgiven by mass amnesties, it's why people are so angry that for example DACA is a priority over fixing these kinds of so-called misdemeanors and building a wall.BARTIROMO: Yes. And by the way, the DACA deadline was supposed to be today, March 5th, but, you know, ICE agents say that they caught 232 illegal immigrants during that raid in Northern California. Of those captured, 180 were convicted criminals, Michelle. They'd either been ordered to leave the U.S. or had been deported before. 115 of those were felons, so ICE is claiming it could have arrested up to 800 more if the Oakland mayor, Oakland mayor, Libby Schaaf did not sent out a public warning beforehand. So are these the kinds of people that mayor of Oakland is protecting?MALKIN: Yes. That's right. It is a safe space for all kinds of felons including violent criminal felons. It is a felony by the way to aid and abet illegal immigration and that mayor should be prosecuted. She is a criminal, not in a sanctuary city but in an outlaw city as she should be behind bars.BARTIROMO: All right, Michelle. We'll leave it there. Great to have you on the program. Today. Thank you, Michelle. And congratulations on winning several Hollywood international independent documentary awards last week for your program, "MICHELLE MALKIN INVESTIGATES", great job, Michelle.MALKIN: Thank you.BARTIROMO: We'll see you soon. We'll be right back. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Big news today, the government orders Qualcomm to delay its shareholder meeting to give it more time to reviewer the Broadcom proposed takeover of Qualcomm. Lauren Simonetti with the details. That meeting supposed to be this week.LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER: Yes. Tomorrow in fact, so this is a very unusual move by the treasury department committee on foreign investment in the U.S. Basically national security panel. And it comes just a day before Qualcomm shareholders were preparing to vote on whether to replace six of its directors with candidates put forward by Broadcom because so far Qualcomm has rejected Broadcom's takeover over, forcing them to go hostile in their $117-billion pursuit. Broadcom now accusing Qualcomm of encouraging the government to intervene on national security grounds, taking a look at both chipmakers this morning, they're both down, Qualcomm shares are down 1.8 percent.All right. A less controversial deal in the works, France's Axa buying the insurer XL Group for $15.3 billion. Axa wants to cut its exposure in financial markets to focus more on insurance products. They are on a sensitive to volatile swings. The deal to buy XL creates one of the world's biggest property and casualty insurers. And taking a look at shares of XL Group sharply higher right now in the premarket by better than 30 percent.Politics taking center stage once again at the 90th Annual Academy Awards. Jimmy Kimmel returned to host for a second year cracking jokes about, well, everything, including Vice President Mike Pence.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JIMMY KIMMEL, AMERICAN TELEVISION HOST: We don't make films like Call Me By Your Name for money, we make them to upset Mike Pence.(END VIDEO CLIP)SIMONETTI: And Frances McDormand who won best actress for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri invited all female Oscar nominees to stand during her speech.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FRANCES MCDORMAND, AMERICAN ACTRESS: If I may be so honored to have all the female nominees in every category stand with me in this room tonight. The actors, Meryl, if you do it, everybody else will, come on. The filmmakers, the producers, the directors, look around everybody, look around ladies and gentlemen. Because we all have stories to tell and projects we need financed.(END VIDEO CLIP)SIMONETTI: And reactions from the audience to the Oscars military tribute made some very angry. One Twitter user said this, hey, you guys notice how no one in auditorium gave a standing ovation for our military and veterans during their dedicated montage? Yet they stand for almost every celebrity and they wonder why everyone thinks they're out of touch, #Oscars. Yes.BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, I get it. Thank you.SIMONETTI: Well said.BARTIROMO: Yes. Thank you, Lauren. And that was the feeling going into the awards show that Hollywood is out of touch.MCDOWELL: I just thought it was so predictable that you -- the jokes weren't funny and the political backlash was so predictable, it tell me something I don't know. That was part of the problem.HILSENRATH: And we were talking offset earlier that the movies they're celebrating are very good this --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Make better movies.HILSENRATH: Yes. And maybe more people will watch.CARTER: Fair enough, fair enough. I do think of -- to the point about it being predictable, I think it was somewhat predictable but I think they did try to make some efforts to make it little bit more inclusive. I mean, having a montage to the military I thought that was a good --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: That was a surprise.CARTER: It was a surprise to me. I think that Jimmy Kimmel made an effort to connect with the average Americans out there. He also talked about -- made fun of how they're out of touch and elites than don't necessarily know how to -- how to relate. So I think state, they made some efforts but overall I think it missed.BARTIROMO: All right. We'll take a break. When we come back, Netflix is teasing the final season of House of Cards without Kevin Spacey. Taking a look at that new trailer, next.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ROBIN WRIGHT, AMERICAN ACTRESS: We're just getting started.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: A hill from the chief. That was the new trailer for the final season of House of Cards without Kevin Spacey. Netflix aired the teaser during the Oscars last night where the streaming company won the award for best documentary feature. Nicole Petallides on floor of The New York Stock Exchange watching stocks, Netflix included. Nic, good, good morning to you.NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: And Netflix included, and Netflix likely the head of new all-time high at the opening bell this morning. At this level of 304 that would be new all-time high here for Netflix. Of course, we did see that preliminary trailer of the season that's coming up. You mentioned obviously Kevin Spacey who is out now because of sexual harassment allegations. He was in the Oval Office as Frank Underwood and you had Robin Wright, his wife, the character, Claire Underwood who sits in the chair in the Oval Office and says, we're just getting started. So this will be the 6th and final season. And of course, the Icarus feature, the best documentary feature that was all about doping in professional sports, so they won that.And then moving on to Amazon this morning. Amazon looking to the upside at around 1503 this morning but are you ready for Amazon-branded checking accounts? It's been reported by the Wall Street Journal and sources saying that they are now working with J.P. Morgan and some of the big banks about having their own branded bank account type checking account. And may not come to fruition, but it could reduce fees for Amazon but for the people who look closely at the details of this one, Maria, saying that its own banking arm would subjected to some capital rules and other regulations that likely would limit its aggressive expansion. In this particular areas, I'm sure the banks are saying, hey when are they coming on to our turf? Well, now, the time is now because we know that Amazon that is extending to about -- just about everything. Back to you.BARTIROMO: Amazon checking accounts now. All right, Nicole. Thank you. We'll be watching that. We are expecting a lower opening. I want to circle back to what was for a time our favorite Netflix show, Dagen. You and I love House of Cards, watched every second of it. Are you going to watch it?MCDOWELL: Absolutely.BARTIROMO: Me too.MCDOWELL: It is about -- because my favorite was Robin Wright, my favorite was Michael Kelly who you interviewed on this program.BARTIROMO: He's been on the show. Yes.MCDOWELL: Who plays Doug Stamper, such a nice guy, such an incredible actor and quite frankly, Kevin Spacey in recent seasons has been chewing the scenery and sounding like Foghorn Leghorn, as Frank Underwood. So he was being a southerner when somebody tries to do to a southern accent and does it that badly, it irritates me. So, I'm glad he is gone.BARTIROMO: And I -- and I like the fact that she is kicking off new season, as president.MCDOWELL: She deserves every accolade that she gets for playing that.BARTIROMO: She's great. All right. We will come back, Netflix, we will come back, the House of Cards. We have breaking news I want to get to right away. President Trump just tweeted this, why did Obama administration start an investigation into the Trump campaign with zero proof of wrongdoing long before the election in November? Wanted to discredit so crooked H. Hillary would win, unprecented, bigger than Watergate. Plus Obama did nothing about Russian meddling. Question that's been asked before, President thinking about this once again and all leads you back to the question about the FISA abuses. We' ll keep watching that. Coming up. I will speak with the CEO and president TIAA-CREF and former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, Roger Ferguson here in the studio, he will weigh in on President Trump's tariff pledge. The Federal Reserve outlook and 100 years of TIAA-CREF. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Monday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us this morning. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday, March 5th. Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.

Down 50 points on Dow Industrials average just two points lower on the NASDAQ, 10 points lower on the S&P. This after Friday's decline. The Dow was down 70 points Friday, but that was well off the lows of nearly 400 points earlier in the session. As you can see, on Friday, the S&P and the NASDAQ closed higher.In Europe this morning, markets are higher across the board. We're reacting to votes in Germany and Italy -- no clear winner yet in merging in Italy. And Angela Merkel secured her fourth term as German Chancellor. The German Dax Index is up three-quarters of one percent right now. In Asia overnight, mixed performances, mostly lower. As you can see, the worst performer was Hong Kong; Hang Seng Index down two and a quarter percent.From the hardwood, to silver screen, to the Oscar Gold, NBA Star, Kobe Bryant, takes on statue last night and raises some eyebrows in the era of the #metoo movement. Overcoming the odds, one linebacker stuns the scouts with his performance at the NFL combine and goes viral. More on Shaq Griffin's inspirational story coming up this morning.But first topping our news this half an hour, investors on edge after shaking off a rough start to the year. The government's tough new talk on trade, and steel, and aluminum tariffs has investors rattled. Joining me right now is the CEO and President of TIAA-CREF, Roger Ferguson. Roger, it's good to see you.ROGER FERGUSON, CEO AND PRESIDENT, TIAA-CREF: Maria, nice to be here. Thank you very much.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. We have so much to talk to you because you are the former vice chairman Federal Reserve, you have been running TIAA-CREF now for --FERGUSON: About a decade.BARTIROMO: About a decade, and the firm is celebrating 100 years.FERGUSON: Yes.BARTIROMO: Really great stuff.FERGUSON: Lot of great things.BARTIROMO: Let me get your take on this tariff story and on economic conditions right now? Your thoughts on these steel tariffs and aluminum tariffs.FERGUSON: Look, I think it's unusual, frankly, the general combine of American economic policy in the last 70 years, we've been trying to push towards free trade. And so, many in economic profession. And I think, obviously, some in the business community are waiting to see exactly how this unfolds.BARTIROMO: Markets, obviously, have been nervous about it, you know. They're worried that they're going to see retaliation from other countries, but there's also other nervousness. We're not really sure what's going on with the Federal Reserve right now. As a former vice chairman of the Fed, what's your insights in terms of the broad macro picture right now? And this job that the fed has ahead of itself of unwinding a 4-1/2 trillion- dollar balance sheet.FERGUSON: Well, look, the broad macro picture, I'd say, is constructive positive. For the first time, in a long time, we have growth in almost all of the major jurisdictions, the U.S., Europe, China et cetera --BARTIROMO: That's a big deal.FERGUSON: -- which is a very big deal. Corporate earnings still look strong. The Fed, I think, is the process of gradually unwinding the stimulus -- but I put the emphasis on gradual. Inflation at this stage, though, there are still some concerns, has not broken out to upside. In fact, the most recent readings were slightly below. The Fed target of around two percent or so. And so, I'd say, you know, things look reasonably good, in the broad macroeconomy, but the backdrop of some policy uncertainty.BARTIROMO: We're going to get the next wage number next week, when we get the jobs number. But we know that in the last employment, in our report, wages were up 2.9 percent. So, do you see that wages are moving higher, creating a tighter labor force than we've seen in some time?FERGUSON: I think it's actually going to other way, which is that --BARTIROMO: Really?FERGUSON: -- well, let me be clear, the labor force is tightening or the labor market is tightening. We have unemployment down around four percent or so, which many think maybe full employment. And as a result of that, we're starting to see a gradual uptick in wages, which we have not seen in a long, long time.BARTIROMO: So, do you think that's a good thing or should we be worried about that? I mean, we've been asking for, you know, higher wages for a long time. We finally got a better growth story; we get them. And then, the market freaks out.FERGUSON: Look, I think it's a net positive thing to see wages increasing. It means, more money in the pockets of the American consumer, it's the result of a gradually tightening labor market. The question becomes whether or not the market is tight in such a stage that inflation is really going to break out on the upside; no sign that have just yet.BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, here we are watching something that's also unprecedented, and that is for the Fed to unwind 4-1/2 trillion-dollar balance sheet. How tough is that going to be? They've choreographed $50 billion a month at some point but wouldn't that create disruption.FERGUSON: Look, I think as you pointing out, you used the word "choreographed", and I think that's really the most important thing.BARTIROMO: They've got to be transparent.FERGUSON: They've got to be transparent, which they have been. The markets, I think, recognize what's coming. So, I see no particular reason why the unwinding of balance sheet need immediately to lead to any kind of disruption can be done smoothly and seamlessly assuming transparency.BARTIROMO: And you liked the way the backdrop feels right now in the U.S.FERGUSON: I think feels very constructive now in the U.S.BARTIROMO: Now, you look at the U.S. versus a story like China. China is out with its 2018 economic targets. They're looking at economic growth of 6-1/2 percent. You know they'll get there. I mean, it is down from the growth rate of last year which was 6.9 percent, but your thoughts on China's incredible rapid growth.FERGUSON: Look, the Chinese growth, I think, has been as you say, incredible in some ways, rapid certainly, but a recognition of bringing that Chinese labor force one from the country side into the cities, and frankly, bringing into the global markets. And so, given where they started, one would expect to see a long period of relatively rapid growth, and that is exactly what they've managed to engineer.BARTIROMO: Tell me what you're doing at TIAA-CREF. Let me switch gears, because you really are a leader on helping Americans save and invest comfortably for retirement. I know you have a white paper on this right now, when we want to get to, but what have you seen at TIAA-CREF this last decade?FERGUSON: What I've seen this last decade, after the crisis, obviously, is a gradual intake in savings, but people are also uncertain about the future. And so, while we are, in our company, recognizing retirement comfort, I think broadly speaking in America, there's a lot of discomfort and uncertainty about the retirement outcome.BARTIROMO: Which is why you say there are three big gaps right now: the convergent, the coverage gap -- not enough Americans have access to a savings plan like a 401(k). The savings gap, people are not saving enough money. And the guarantee gap, managing saving after retirement to avoid out living your money. So, what do you want lawmakers to do about this?FERGUSON: Well, look, confront all three. And so, first, lawmakers and the private sector have to get more people involved in savings. Individuals have to save more, and then in the last one, the guarantee gap, which the new thing that we've talked about, lawmakers and companies need to take advantage of tools that are out there, such as annuities -- which can, in fact, close down the guarantee gap.BARTIROMO: Your -- client, members however you call the investors, are long term thinkers.FERGUSON: Absolutely.BARTIROMO: So, are they getting nervous about these wide swings? This return of volatility?FERGUSON: No, what we've seen among our participants, as we call them, in fact, is a degree of comfort, because they are long term investors and because they recognize that we as a company have a great track record. You may know that we've won the Lipper Award for sixth year in a row unprecedented. And that is a reflection of risk adjusted returns over three-year time period that's been very, very strong. And so, our participants are relatively calm in face of market volatility and uncertainty.BARTIROMO: So, they're not doing anything right now?FERGUSON: They're not doing anything dramatic.BARTIROMO: Keeping their money safe.FERGUSON: Keeping money safe, not making dramatic moves. And we always say, because they are long term investors, do not attempt to time the market, do not overreact to temporary volatility.BARTIROMO: You were also just out with a white paper on infrastructure.FERGUSON: Yes.BARTIROMO: And paying for it. The paper details how insurance companies, including yours, are interested in participating in financing. How do you participate in financing? How do you get involved?FERGUSON: Well, look at our general account. We have a general account -- that's the insurance pool that we invest over about $250 billion. About eight percent of that is invested in real assets. If we look across the industry, there are billions and billions of dollars that either are invested or waiting to be invested in real assets. There are some technical fixes that have to be done particularly at the state level to open up that pool of money. But as the president is talking about public/private partnerships, the private end of that may well be insurance companies that are big, long term investors, appropriate for an infrastructure kind of investment programs.BARTIROMO: Well, there's got to be a big opportunity for financial services companies to get involved and get a piece of this infrastructure plan, talking about what 1$.5 trillion dollars --FERGUSON: Absolutely.BARTIROMO: $200 billion of federal money.FERGUSON: Absolutely. There's no doubt that this is what needs to be done and has been done around the world. In many places, you see major infrastructure ports, airports, roads, et cetera, bridges. All of those have some private funding as well as public funding, and it can be done safely but we do need to get all our regulators lined up around doing this --BARTIROMO: How worried are you and much do you think about the budget issues? I mean, here we are talking about more spending on the heels of this, you know, big spending plan announced by Republicans a week and a half ago. How do you pay for all this? The debt now 20, $20 trillion above, 21 trillion almost.FERGUSON: Right. So, I think all of us have to focus on that, because we have an up-coming challenge around paying for all the retirement, for all of us aging baby boomers, so social security, Medicaid, et cetera, all of those things, we have to focus in on.BARTIROMO: Yes, in terms of where people are, and whether or not they have those safety nets that's something that you do every day to try to sure that they do.FERGUSON: Absolutely right. And all that's going to lead, potentially, to bigger draw on the budget in the near-term, and so we have to be very mindful.BARTIROMO: So, TIAA-CREF turning 100 years old. I like the way you're celebrating financial services company giving away a million dollars to celebrate? Tell us about it.FERGUSON: Absolutely. So, what we're looking for is what were called difference makers. We're going to identify 100 people in the not for profit sector who are making a difference in local communities regionally or even nationally or globally. And for those 100 activities, we're going to give 10,000 each to those charities, so a million dollars supporting people who are trying to make a difference in the world.BARTIROMO: That's terrific, Roger, congratulations on that.FERGUSON: Thank you very much.BARTIROMO: Your time running TIAA-CREF, how did it differ than your time at the Federal Reserve, and what you've done in terms of big economic issues for the country?FERGUSON: You know what, in many ways, it's very similar. So, the Fed is very focused on, sustainable growth, keeping inflation low, maximum sustainable employment. We were very focused on financial security for millions of Americans and focused on the big social problem of the day which is retirement among other things. And so, I look at my decade, thus far TIAA-CREF, at TIAA is being very, very much a public policy issue as well as a private sector issue.BARTIROMO: Do you miss the fed, Roger? There's some talk that they want you at the New York Fed. Lots of changes going on at the Federal Reserve - - Jay Powell running things now -- would you accept that job?FERGUSON: You know what, I love the job that I'm doing. It's most important that I can imagine doing right now. There are many interesting names being floated for jobs in Washington and here in New York, and I wish all those folks very, very good luck.BARTIROMO: What can you tell us about Jay Powell, and the way he will approach leadership at the Fed, versus Janet Yellen?FERGUSON: Look, I've known, Chair Powell since 19812, 1982. Very stable pair of hands, very thoughtful, collegial. I think you saw his early testimony -- smooth, professional, unruffled.BARTIROMO: Seems very comfortable in the job.FERGUSON: Very comfortable in the job. Good selection and off to a good start.BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. Roger, it's great to see you. Thanks for all that you're doing for retirement and health of this country.FERGUSON: Maria, thank you very much. It was a pleasure talking with you.BARTIROMO: Join Roger, he's going to be my special guest later on this for "WALL STREET".First of all, let's take a break. Futures are indicating a lower opening for the broader averages. We are off of the lows but nonetheless expecting a decline of 60 points after Dow closed in the red for the fourth day in a row on Friday. Plus, there's this Shaq Griffin has a need for speed. The Central Florida linebacker stunning 40-yard dash at the NFL scouting combine, next.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The rollback in regulations continues: later this week, senators are expected to vote on a bipartisan plan to loosen up the Dodd-Frank rules for banks. Joining us now, host of "VARNEY & COMPANY," Stuart Varney to weigh in on that. Stu, this is going to be a big deal for the financial services sector.STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: I love it.BARTIROMO: Yes.VARNEY: I absolutely love it. The boot is going to be taken off the neck of large regional and local banks, and that's a very good thing. The boot was put on their neck by the Dodd-Frank regulations 10 years ago. It wasn't the local and community banks and the regional banks, they didn't create the financial crisis but they paid the price for it with these new regulations. So, some of these regulations are coming off, freeing up community and regional banks. I think that's a wonderful thing. And what's great about it is that I think it's about a dozen Democrats in the Senate will say yes, let's loosen up this particular area of financial regulation. They all voted for it 10 years ago, but now they're seeing the damage done, and so they're going to say yes, do it. Elizabeth Warren, that is an entirely separate issue. She is permanently outraged, permanently angry, she is apoplectic about this removal of some regulations from some banks, she's having none of it, but that points out the essential split in the Democrat Party. It's open and available for all to see.BARTIROMO: You're right. And you know, Stuart, I always laugh when I -- we talk about proprietary trading, that is vocal rule. Because I think the vocal rule is going to be one of the early ones to go.VARNEY: Yes.BARTIROMO: The bottom line is you -- they can't even write it, what the vocal rule is. How are they going to enforce something that they can't even write? You know, the difference of trading for your own account, proprietary trading versus trading on behalf of the customer, how are lawmaker going to tell the difference if you can't actually write what prop trading is, then you're not going to be able to enforce it anyway.VARNEY: No, you have had 10 years to write it properly. It hasn't been a success. You got to step back and take a totally different look at what's going on here. What is a financial institution, who are they? I mean, is Apple a financial institution with $260 odd billion cash? How about Microsoft? How about Amazon?BARTIROMO: Amazon wants to start checking.VARNEY: They want to get into checking accounts. So, who's a bank, who's a financial institution, and how do you regulate them? You got to take a fresh look at this. I'm real pleased to see some of those rules coming out.BARTIROMO: I know that the next couple of months are going to be a good -- a good time for the banks, and the years to come, because they're about to see great things around their registry, rollback in regulations, higher interest rates that helps margins, and a better economy.VARNEY: Should be.BARTIROMO: So, we'll look at financial services. Stu, thank you, we'll see you in 10 minutes.VARNEY: You will. Thanks!BARTIROMO: "VARNEY & COMPANY" begins top of the hour, 9:00 a.m. Eastern, right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA, join Stuart. Coming up, a successful race to the finish line. Why Shaq Griffin is earning praise from top athletes at the NFL scouting combine, that's next.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. So, NBA legend Kobe Bryant taking home an Oscar last night but also raising some eyebrows in the era of the Me Too Movement. Jared Max with all the details. Jared?JARED MAX, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SPORTSCASTER: Oh, the irony. You know, folks remember that in 2003, Kobe Bryant was accused of raping a 19-year- old woman. Timing of Kobe's Academy award for his animated short film, "Dear Basketball" drew praise from basketball greats like LeBron James and Magic Johnson. Kobe's film adapted from the poem he wrote in 2015 to announce his retirement but many raised eyebrows that night themed by Times Up and Me Too Movements. Many on social media are pondering the big picture like New York City Radio Host, Monk, who wrote: "Define irony? Kobe Bryant wins an Oscar during the year of the #MeToo Movement #Oscars."By the way, "Icarus" which exposed Russia's state-run doping program for athletes won an Oscar for best documentary. Somebody could have made a sports doc about Phil Mickelson in the near five years he played golf without winning a single golf tournament. Lefty though scored his first title since 2013 British Open, despite 2-putting for par on the playoff only beat out Justin Thomas at the WGC Mexico Championship. 112 events for Mickelson between his last win and this.All of last year, Kevin Harvick won two NASCAR races, yesterday, Harvick picked up his second win of 2018. His second win in as many races, Harvick's first-place finish at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, the 100th victory of his career, spanning three national NASCAR series.A man born with a non-fully formed left hand, amputated at age 4, not invited to the NFL combine, who one day after bench pressing 20 reps of 225 pounds with a prosthetic hand, fastest linebacker since 2003 to run the 40- yard dash at the NFL combine, 4.38 seconds, he's trying to become the first one-handed player drafted in the modern era. NFL all-pro J.J. Watt tweeted about Shaquem Griffin: "Shaquem Griffin killing it." Seahawks star Richard Sherman wrote, "If Shaquem Griffin doesn't get drafted in the first two days, the system is broken. Productive and performed well at the combine, played well against high level competition." Hey, check this one out, the NFL points out Shaquem and his twin brother, Shaquill, who plays for the Seahawks, he's been in the league one year. Shaquill and Shaquem Griffin, not only identical twins but identical times in the 40-yard dash.BARTIROMO: Oh, my God.MAX: 4.38 seconds. Isn't that amaze -- sometimes you wonder, you know, if you're not somebody who's a twin or has an identical twin, it's -- there's something fascinating --BARTIROMO: That is.MAX: 4.38 seconds, they both did it.BARTIROMO: That's incredible. But more incredible is the fact that he bench-pressed all that weight with, what --MAX: With a prosthetic hand.BARTIROMO: -- with a prosthetic hand.MCDOWELL: This is all any of my buddies could talk about all weekend. And to Dave, a friend of mine who works in the restaurant next door, David Barham Nouvo (ph), he's the number one Seahawks fan. They really -- the Seahawks fans really want these two brothers, these twin brothers. His brother is a cornerback, I think.MAX: Yes, the brother is a cornerback, he's a line -- they both went to Central Florida.MCDOWELL: And they've really -- but now, it makes it more expensive, given that -- given Shaquem's performance at the combine. That will make it more expensive for the Seahawks to add him to the roster.HILSENRATH: Do you think he does end up getting drafted in the first few days?MAX: Yes. Not for nothing --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: How can he not get drafted after that?MAX: What a smart business move. And if it doesn't work out, it's still a win.MCDOWELL: Yes, totally.BARTIROMO: It sure it.MCDOWELL: The NFL needs --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Yes, good point.MCDOWELL: This is it, the NFL needs this. Make it happen, people.BARTIROMO: We're rooting for you. Jared, thank you, Jared Max. Catch Jared's sports reports on Fox News Headlines 24/7 or check him out on radio, Sirius Radio XM 115. Coming up, final thoughts from this all-star panel. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Final thoughts from this all-star panel. Lee Carter?CARTER: I'm fascinated how this whole trade tariff issue is going to play out. And those that oppose the tariff, I just want to say, come up with solution, don't just criticize the plan. Otherwise, you're not going to win this one.BARTIROMO: Yes, I want to see if this is poker or not. What do you t hink?HILSENRATH: I'm puzzled by the President's tweet today who's tying to steel tariffs to NAFTA Canada and Mexico when the source or the root of the steel and aluminum problem is China. It's not Canada and Mexico.BARTIROMO: Maybe that's the point, he's telling China watch out. I mean business.HILSENRATH: But I don't know what that has to do with Canada and Mexico.BARTIROMO: Right, right. Oh, that's true, yes.HILSENRATH: I don't know what that has to do with the NAFTA negotiation.BARTIROMO: Inserting it into the NAFTA negotiations. Dagen?MCDOWELL: Well, Lee, to your point, all the people who are worried about the impact of the tariffs on the economy, all they have to do is step back and let it happen and watch this country crater. People keep tweeting at me, what if we only use and consume what we make in this country? OK. All of a sudden that's called the great depression.BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, we'll watch the implications. The big outcry. Thank you, everybody. Have a great day. Let's get right to "VARNEY & COMPANY" and Stuart. Take it away, Stuart.VARNEY: Maria, thank you very much indeed and welcome to a brandnew week. Let's get right at it. Good Monday morning.Load-Date: March 5, 2018End of Document

Chinese Scholar Will Take Memories of Liberty to Her HomelandTargeted News ServiceMarch 9, 2018 Friday 7:12 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 587 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: LYNCHBURG, Virginia BodyLiberty University issued the following news release:Following a full calendar year of heavy research and studying under the mentorship of Liberty University professors and faculty, international scholar and literary professor Mallory Miao is set to return to her home in northeastern China next week.Miao has spent the past year researching and writing her doctoral dissertation on the differences and relationships in ethical thought processes across various cultures and countries. She focused on family, marriage, and religious ethics."I was able to make a lot of progress this past year while writing my dissertation, and studying here broadened the scope of my research more than it would have in China," Miao said.Miao is an English professor at Harbin Noral University in Harbin, China, where she has taught for more than 18 years. A Ph.D. candidate in comparative and world literature, Miao received a grant from the Chinese Scholars Program last year to travel to America.Her desire to travel abroad, specifically to Liberty, came after speaking with a friend who is a Liberty alumnus. She said she was intrigued when hearing about the university's growth and its overall academic rigor and was hooked when she went online and viewed photos of campus and learned more about the programs Liberty offers."The first thing I thought when I looked up Liberty on the internet was how beautiful the scenery and campus is," Miao said. "And once I actually got here, I found out how friendly all the people are here and how amazing of a university it really is."After her application to become a travelling scholar was approved by the Chinese government, Miao was introduced to Dr. Roger Schultz, dean of Liberty's College of Arts & Sciences, who served as her university supervisor.Miao said Schultz helped supply her with academic resources and an office space to effectively conduct her research and write her doctoral dissertation. Being able to experience American culture while researching on a cross-cultural exchange was extremely insightful, she said.Miao observed a number of English classes that she said helped shape her research. She also became a guest lecturer in history and Chinese language classes, where she taught on Chinese language, culture and customs."I was excited to see that the students were excited and eager to learn about the great history and culture of China," Miao said. "They were always so nice to me and interested in what I had to say."Miao said she was pleased that her visit has also helped to establish a line of communication between Liberty and Harbin Normal University. Miao and Schultz both said they hope that the relationship will allow for more study abroad opportunities between the two universities in the future."For Mallory, it was really a dream come true of hers to be able to come here, and we have absolutely loved having her," Schultz said. "We have done something like this before -- a British scholar came over with funding from the British government -- but it is still a relatively new thing for us, and we would like to provide more opportunities like this."Miao said she is sad to leave Liberty behind but looks forward to sharing the knowledge she gained from her experience."It will be nice to go back and start teaching again," Miao said. "I am very excited for that, but I will miss the professors and students I met here. When I look back, I realize that it was a blessing being able to study here."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6199728 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: March 10, 2018End of Document

But, with her political future uncertain and questions increasingly raised about Britain's international influence as it heads towards Brexit, May's trip to China this week will put her claims to the test.Since President Xi Jinping assumed China's presidency in 2013, there has been an alarming deterioration in human rights conditions across the country, with hundreds of human rights defenders, lawyers, and activists arbitrarily arrested and imprisoned. Many have been tortured. The charges against those arrested are invariably preposterous - for example, when they are accused of "inciting subversion" for simply advocating political reform.The Chinese government has intensified its assault on free expression. China has moved beyond mere internet censorship via the so-called Great Firewall to build a national surveillance system that would make George Orwell proud - taking DNA from whole populations in ethnic minority regions and building "big data" platforms for police. The government severely restricts religious freedom, has stepped up repression against the Uyghurs and Tibetans, and is interfering politically in Hong Kong, despite commitments by China to respect its autonomy.Yet Britain's response to China's growing repression has been weak and pusillanimous.

All Rights ReservedLength: 307 wordsByline: grapier@businessinsider.com,  (Graham Rapier)Highlight: Shares of Alibaba are up more than 3% Thursday thanks to strong sales data from the Chinese governmentBodyThomson Reuters• Shares of Alibaba are up more than 3% Thursday thanks to strong sales data from the Chinese government.• E-commerce is skyrocketing in China, the country's National Bureau of Statistics said Thursday, and Alibaba is reaping the rewards.Online retail sales in the country grew 37% in the first two months of 2018, NBS reported, up from 32% growth the prior month. Meanwhile, traditional retail sales grew just 9.7% - falling just short of the expected 9.8%."Taking into consideration normal seasonality pattern, this gives us a higher level of comfort in our Alibaba's FY18 GMV growth estimate of c.30% with potential upside," Jefferies analyst Karen Chan said in a note to clients Thursday, reiterating her buy rating and $325 price target.Jefferies is one of the Alibaba's biggest bulls, with a price target 41% above the Wall Street consensus of $230 per share. "We believe the strong online retail sales in spite of weak seasonality could be attributed to: 1) a longer-than-usual shopping window prior to Chinese New Year holiday; 2) increased rural consumption spending over CNY from post-80s with smart home electronics and imported fresh goods showing fast growth; 3) step-up in online-offline promotional efforts, e.g. red packets, Taobao-RTmart (SunArt) promotion; 4) enhanced logistics service for fresh goods, e.g. Hema," Chan said.Shares of Alibaba are up 4% in early trading Thursday and 85% in the past year.NOW WATCH: Elon Musk explains the one thing that went wrong with SpaceX's Falcon Heavy flightSee Also:• China just locked in its position as a dominant player in electric vehicle production• Sentiment towards Chinese steel demand has taken a big hit, but not everyone is concerned• Trump's trade war is heating up - here are 11 stocks UBS says to avoidSEE ALSO: Alibaba wants to dominate food delivery in ChinaLoad-Date: February 11, 2019End of Document

Hong Kong cardinal warns against Vatican-China dealAssociated Press InternationalFebruary 9, 2018 Friday 4:41 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 541 wordsByline: By KELVIN CHAN, Associated PressDateline: HONG KONG BodyHONG KONG (AP) - Hong Kong's retired archbishop warned Friday that a deal between the Vatican and China that cedes too much power to Beijing would place the country's Catholic followers in a big "birdcage."Cardinal Joseph Zen said the Holy See should abandon talks with China over contentious bishop nominations if it would have to compromise too much to please the country's Communist rulers.Zen compared China's "underground" Catholics to birds and said Beijing wants "the Vatican to help them to get all those birds into the cage."Zen's comments come as tensions rise over a possible deal between the Vatican and Beijing.The Roman Catholic Church is pushing for a historic breakthrough in relations with China but negotiations have touched off a bitter dispute inside the church.Zen, 86, said there's no reason at the moment to believe in any goodwill from Beijing on working toward a reasonable compromise.The feisty and outspoken Zen, who retired in 2009, has been a longtime critic of China. In recent blog posts, he has slammed the talks as a catastrophe and described making a desperate journey to Rome in a personal effort to prevent a legitimate underground bishop from being replaced by an excommunicated one favored by Beijing."The Communist government just wants the church to surrender, because they want complete control, not only of the Catholic church but all the religions," Zen told reporters at the hillside Salesian monastery where he lives. "If that's true then there's no hope of getting a good agreement and ... at a certain moment you must say we cannot solve the problem, the problems are there so we go home, when we have anything new we come again."China broke off relations with the Holy See in 1951, after the officially atheist Communist Party took power and established its own church.The Vatican, particularly under Pope Francis, is has been eager to reach a deal with the Chinese government and unite the churches. A sticking point in the secret negotiations is whether Rome or Beijing has the final say over bishop appointments.Unconfirmed reports say the Vatican is close to a compromise with China, which has an estimated 12 million Catholics. About half worship in underground churches that recognize only Rome as their highest authority while the rest belong to state-authorized churches with clergy named by Beijing.Though the Vatican has claimed bishop ordination as its right, both sides had an unwritten agreement allowing Beijing to pick candidates that the Holy See would consider and then tacitly endorse. Though the deal wasn't always adhered to, it generally prevented Beijing from appointing bishops that the Vatican would consider flawed for personal or doctrinal reasons.Zen weighed in on recent news reports suggesting that such an arrangement would be formalized, effectively giving the pope veto power over future bishop candidates."Sounds wonderful, but it's fake," Zen said, adding that if the pope uses his veto too often, "the Chinese government will say: tell the whole world the pope is not reasonable."He added that he would prefer giving the pope the power of appointment and letting China veto.___This version corrects the short headline that Zen is a cardinal but retired as archbishop.Load-Date: February 10, 2018End of Document

Chengdu Hi-tech Zone of China Accelerates to Integrate into the Global Innovation NetworkPR NewswireJanuary 15, 2018 Monday 3:21 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 964 wordsDateline: CHENGDU, China, Jan. 15, 2018 BodyOn January 10th, 2018, during the period of French President Emmanuel Macron's first visit to China, Chengdu Hi-tech Zone of China announced to join hands with French telecare company SeniorAdom and Sigfox, the world's leading IoT connectivity service, to develop the project of "Sino-French Cooperation·Chengdu International Intelligent Aging Service Demonstration Community". Just a day earlier, Brunel University London and National Physical Laboratory of Britain (NPL) also cooperated with local Chinese enterprises to officially set up the "China-UK Institute of Innovative Quality Engineering and Smart Technology" in Chengdu Hi-tech Zone Pilot Free Trade Zone. This institute will form an alliance of international top scientists by closely cooperating with world first-class scientific research institutions and colleges.This cooperation form of setting up "alliance" with international scientific research institutions and science parks is by no means unique. Located in the inland of western China, Chengdu Hi-tech Zone Pilot Free Trade Zone is now showing its strong intention of open-up and cooperation.This year is the 40th anniversary of China to launch the reform and opening-up. Two months ago, Chinese government proposed to endow greater autonomy and right of reform to pilot free trade zone so as to form an " opening-up pattern of linking inside and outside while bilaterally benefiting east and west". In 2017, China set up 7 new inland pilot free trade zones including Sichuan, the homeland of well-known giant pandas, after Shanghai, Guangdong, Tianjin, and Fujian.Last April 1st, Sichuan (Chengdu) Hi-tech Pilot Free Trade Zone was officially set up and then in May, they launched a global top science park partnership program (TSPPP), expecting to set up an exchange and cooperation mechanism connecting global famous science parks and enterprises in terms of technology, capital, and industrial chain. 22 science parks including Sophia Antipolis of France, Barcelona Innovative Industrial Park of Spain, and Amsterdam Science Park of Netherland co-set up "World First Class S&T Parks Champions' League" in Chengdu Hi-tech Zone and the concept of "community with a shared future for Science Park" has been widely recognized. Last October, Sophia Antipolis of France and Chengdu Hi-tech Zone signed an agreement on mutual establishment of innovation centers; last November, Chengdu Hi-tech Zone and New Jersey Association of Trade & investment Promotion of United State signed a Memorandum of Understanding on jointly setting up liaison offices to promote the cooperation between Chinese and American enterprises. By the end of 2017, Chengdu Hi-tech Zone had already set up 18 off-shore innovation bases abroad.The Business & Innovation Centre for China-Europe Cooperation, which the China-UK Institute of Innovative Quality Engineering and Smart Technology is about to settle in, is a new window for western China to comprehensively open to and cooperate with Europe. Since launched in last May, it has already signed settlement agreement with 17 European institutions such as European Business & Innovation Center Network (EBN), European Teach Tour Investment Agency Union, The Austrian Economic Chambers, Economic Development Agency of the German State of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), The Mediterranean Region of Montpellier of France, Sicily Region of Italy, Czech Technical Center, China-UK Development Center, and The Russian Union of Innovation and Technology Centre (RUITC).In addition to vigorous development of international cooperation, Chengdu Hi-tech Zone Pilot Free Trade Zone is trying to change the stereotyped impression of the world to government departments in inland China to strengthen innovation in terms of management method. At present, it has basically formulated an investment management mechanism by taking Negative List as the core and the handling time of foreign-investment enterprise establishment and change shortens from over 20 working days to within 3 working days.Innovation is also reflected in the field of finance. Chinese third internet bank -- XW Bank has been set up in Chengdu Hi-tech Zone Pilot Free Trade Zone. Even though it has neither fixed banking outlets nor operation counters, 24-hour financing service would be provided to customers online. So far, Sichuan XW Bank has already applied for 25 patents in terms of evaluation of credit risk, and financial open platform, and achieved automated approval process. Now, it only costs tens of seconds of handling each debt.Compared to pilot free trade zones in coastal region, transportation logistics is a great obstacle for inland free trade zones. However, Chengdu has already found the key to solve it. In 2017, Chengdu-Europe international train has already connected 14 overseas node cities, and comprehensively set up international logistics channel of Y-shape to the heart of Europe at the west, to Russia at the north, and to Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) at the south. As for aviation, Chengdu has opened 104 international flights. In 2017, its inbound and outbound passengers surpassed 5 million, ranking first in western China. Now, the second international airport of Chengdu is under construction, which will make Chengdu become the third city in China that owns two airports after Shanghai and Beijing. Owing to its time-honored history and profound traditional culture, Chengdu is now standing out from all cities in western China. It will be basically built as an international hub in 2020 facing to Europe westward and to Asia southward. View original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chengdu-hi-tech-zone-of-china-accelerates-to-integrate-into-the-global-innovation-network-300582428.htmlSOURCE Chengdu High-tech ZoneCONTACT: Yin Xiuwan, +86-13096359612Load-Date: January 16, 2018End of Document

It will reportedly aim to attract companies working on big data, biometric identification, deep learning, and cloud computing. The AI race could cause tensionsRussian president Vladimir Putin believes that in the future, the country that leads in AI could dominate the world, while tech billionaire            Elon Musk thinks AI will be the most likely cause of WWIII (although his comments should be taken with a pinch of salt).Tweet Embed:https://twitter.com/mims/statuses/904638455761612800?ref_src=twsrc%5EtfwChina, Russia, soon all countries w strong computer science. Competition for AI superiority at national level most likely cause of WW3 imo.Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google parent company Alphabet, warned in November that China is poised to overtake the US in the field of AI if the US government doesn't act soon.Speaking at the Artificial Intelligence and Global Security Summit, the former Google CEO said: "Trust me, these Chinese people are good."He added: "They are going to use this technology for both commercial as well as military objectives with all sorts of implications."China published its AI strategy in July and said that it wanted to be the world leader in AI by 2025."It's pretty simple," said Schmidt, who claims to have read the report. "By 2020 they will have caught up. By 2025 they will be better than us. And by 2030 they will dominate the industries of AI. Just stop for a sec.

INTERVIEW: YOUNG CHINESE DEVELOPER DROPS CIRCUMVENTION PROJECT OVER 'DOXING' THREATStates News ServiceJanuary 31, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 469 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:For months, Chinese journalist Song Xiaowei has been investigating a case in which a young Chinese developer with the online nickname "Broken Doll" was forced to abandon a project that would help people circumvent the "Great Firewall" of government internet censorship after a 'doxing' threat to release her personal details by an anonymous group of researchers. He spoke to RFA's Mandarin Service about what he found:RFA: Firstly, who is Broken Doll, and who was threatening her with doxing?Song Xiaowei: Broken Doll developed a piece of software that could scale the Great Firewall. But then she was pursued by a group calling themselves Vulgar TV, who crowd-sourced a search on her. Vulgar TV then threatened Broken Doll, saying they would make public all of her personal details, her ID card and profile on [auction site] Taobao and so on, revealing her true identity, if she continued to work on this project.RFA: What did you find when you investigated the matter?Song Xiaowei: I finally found the real culprits. They too were working to get around the Great Firewall, and yet they still did a thing like that. I suspect that the [ruling Chinese] Communist Party has now even infiltrated the younger generation. If I'm honest, I was pretty shocked, actually.RFA: What basis do you have for these suspicions?Song Xiaowei: One of the biggest questions here is how they got access to police ID card databases. Also, to get her Taobao details would require a request from the police. It's not as if any old person can just access that information. I suspect that someone in power was behind this.RFA: How long did the investigation take?Song Xiaowei: It took me four months, and I found that the sorts of young people who are working to circumvent the Great Firewall are instead being used by the Communist Party. A lot of young people have access to technology nowadays, and they are very easily swayed by the Communist Party's words, to the extent that they are now working for them. This is a very serious situation, which I think the Chinese government is very happy about.RFA: How do you see the situation developing? Will young people in China continue to try to get around the Great Firewall?Song Xiaowei: I would like to see overseas dissidents and groups like that paying more attention to developers back home, because without the software that they write, nobody back home in China would find out about their activities. The more they are able to cut off these channels of communication, the greater will be the rift between ordinary people in China and dissenting voices. I think overseas dissidents should do more to help these technologically minded people.Reported by C.K. for RFA's Mandarin Service.

GREAT NEWS FOR SHOREBIRDS! CHINA TO HALT COASTAL LAND RECLAMATIONStates News ServiceJanuary 23, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 1011 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: CAMBRIDGE, UK BodyThe following information was released by the BirdLife International:The Chinese government has announced that it will halt all 'business-related' land reclamation along its coast. This is a massive boost to the tens of millions of migratory shorebirds along the East Asian-Australasian Flyway that depend on the east coast's intertidal mudflats, including the Spoon-billed Sandpiper (Critically Endangered).By Terry TownshendThis article originally appeared on Terry Townshend's blog Birding Beijing.Two English-language articles reporting the change in policy were published in the Chinese media this week one on Xinhua, China's largest news agency, and one in The China Daily. Significantly, the latter was posted on the website of the State Council, China's 'Cabinet', indicating the high level of support for the new policy.The news articles reported on a 17th January 2018 press conference hosted by the State Oceanic Administration (SOA), during which Lin Shanqing, Deputy Director of SOA, outlined several important elements of the new policy.First, the government would "nationalise reclaimed land with no structures built on it, and will halt reclamation projects that have yet to be opened and are against national policies."Second, all structures built on illegally reclaimed land and that have "seriously damaged the marine environment" will be demolished.Subscribe to Our Newsletter!Third, "the central government will stop approving property development plans based on land reclamation, and will prohibit all reclamation activities unless they pertain to national key infrastructure, public welfare or national defence".And fourth, perhaps most significantly in terms of the future of China's east coast, "local authorities will no longer have the power to approve reclamation projects".Gu Wu, head of SOA's National Marine Inspection Office, said that:"In the past, land reclamation, to a certain extent, helped to boost economic development by mitigating the land shortage in coastal regions and providing space for public infrastructure and industry parks. However, illegal and irregular reclamation activities caused a number of problems to marine ecosystems and lawful businesses," and that "those effects have become a major public concern, so the administration decided that reclamation would be closely looked at in its annual inspection last year."Aquaculture and ship-building had been allowed to take place in a national nature reserveThe press conference on 17th January was preceded by two media articles criticising coastal provinces for their mismanagement of land reclamation projects, revealed by SOA's 2017 inspections. Hebei Province (home to Beidaihe, Nanpu and Happy Island) was admonished in this article which revealed, among other violations, that "Tourism, aquaculture and ship-building had all been allowed in a national nature reserve in Changli County."And Jiangsu (home to Rudong and Taozini) and Liaoning (home to Dandong and Dalian) were subject to finger-pointing in this article.In Jiangsu Province:"a total of 14 projects, involving 81.29 hectares of reclaimed land", had been wrongly approved since 2012;A large amount of reclaimed land remain deserted, with only 21.28 percent of reclaimed land actually developed;Developers of 184 land reclamation projects had not obtained government approval before they started building their projects; andThe province was failing to effectively protect nature reserves. Fish farming had been operating in about 9,955 hectares of sea waters around a national wetland reserve in Jiangsu, where such commercial operations should have been banned.And in Liaoning Province, the SOA found that:The provincial government was failing to effectively supervise land reclamation projects and control pollutants from being discharged into the sea;Although the provincial government fined polluters and violators of reclamation regulations, more than half of the fines had not been collected;Among 211 waste water drains into the sea registered by the provincial environment authorities, 68 were not approved through legal procedure and some of the drains have not been carefully monitored.SOA's announcement of the new policy on land reclamation came as something of a surprise (albeit a very welcome one) to the conservation community. However, those with experience of working in China will know that policy development often works in this way. The process of policy formulation is opaque, and when a new policy is announced it is not uncommon for the announcement to be the first information to emerge from the government that a policy review is taking place.Nicola Crockford, Principal Policy Officer for BirdLife International and the RSPB (BirdLife in the UK), sees the potential for great things with this new legislation. "This exceptionally good news brings the best hope yet that the extinctions of waterbird species, such as spoon-billed sandpiper and great knot, that were beginning to seem inevitable, can actually be averted."Now the hard work beginsOf course, announcing a new policy is one thing; implementation is another, as can be seen from the above list of violations of existing regulations outlined by SOA's inspections. It remains to be seen whether this policy will be enforced with the rigour required to ensure the integrity of the remaining intertidal mudflats.What's more, halting reclamation is a necessary but not sufficient step to slow the decline in populations of shorebirds of the East Asian Australasian Flyway. The priority now is to ensure protection for, and effective management of, the key sites for migratory shorebirds - and that's what conservation organisations will be focusing on over the next months and years.Nevertheless, at this stage, there is no reason to think that implementation will not happen in fact, I am optimistic; the new policy is consistent with the high-level rhetoric of President Xi and the recent strengthening of environmental regulations. At this stage, it would be churlish to say anything other than "Well done, China".Load-Date: January 24, 2018End of Document

China vows to defend its interests against US trade actionsAssociated Press InternationalMarch 22, 2018 Thursday 3:22 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 473 wordsByline: By GILLIAN WONG, Associated PressDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - The Chinese government vowed Thursday to take "all necessary measures" to defend the country's interests if President Donald Trump targets it for allegedly stealing American technology or pressuring U.S. companies to hand it over."China will not sit idly to see its legitimate rights damaged and must take all necessary measures to resolutely defend its legitimate rights," the Commerce Ministry in Beijing said in a statement on its website.The Trump administration is expected later Thursday to impose trade sanctions on China, perhaps including restrictions on Chinese investment and tariffs on as much as $60 billion worth of Chinese products.Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters that Beijing hoped the U.S. would "refrain from taking actions that are detrimental to both sides."Dozens of industry groups sent a letter last weekend to Trump warning that "the imposition of sweeping tariffs would trigger a chain reaction of negative consequences for the U.S. economy, provoking retaliation; stifling U.S. agriculture, goods, and services exports; and raising costs for businesses and consumers."U.S. business groups mostly agree that something needs to be done about China's aggressive push in technology - but they worry that China will retaliate by targeting U.S. exports of aircraft, soybeans and other products and start a tit-for-tat trade war of escalating sanctions between the world's two biggest economies.The announcement will mark the end of a seven-month U.S. investigation into the hardball tactics China has used to challenge U.S. supremacy in technology, including dispatching hackers to steal commercial secrets and demanding that U.S. companies hand over trade secrets in exchange for access to the Chinese market. The administration argues that years of negotiations with China have failed to produce results.On Tuesday, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang appealed to Washington to "act rationally" and avoid disrupting trade over steel, technology and other disputes. He promised Beijing will "open even wider" to imports and investment."No one will emerge a winner from a trade war," said Li, the No. 2 Chinese leader, at an annual news conference held during the meeting of China's ceremonial legislature.The move against China comes just as the United States prepares to impose tariffs of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminum - sanctions that are meant to hit China for flooding the world with cheap steel and aluminum but will likely fall hardest on U.S. allies like South Korea and Brazil because they ship more of the metals to the United States.Trump campaigned on promises to bring down America's massive trade deficit - $566 billion last year - by rewriting trade agreements and cracking down on what he called abusive commercial practices by U.S. trading partners.Load-Date: March 23, 2018End of Document

CHINESE BUSINESSWOMAN ALLIED TO FORMER PREMIER WEN JIABAO DETAINED: REPORTStates News ServiceFebruary 9, 2018 FridayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 747 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Chinese authorities have detained a wealthy businesswoman with strong financial ties to the country's former premier, Wen Jiabao, The New York Times reported, with political analysts saying her detention, if confirmed, could be the next move in a power struggle among the ruling Chinese Communist Party's elite families.Previous reports have indicated that Duan Weihong, who uses the English name Whitney Duan, is a key figure in the finances of the Wen family, with The New York Times reporting in 2012 that his relatives controlled assets worth at least U.S.$2.7 billion.The paper cited business associates of Duan's as saying that she was detained by unknown agencies ahead of the 19th Party Congress last October."It is not clear who detained her, why and whether she is still being held," the paper said.An employee who answered the phone at the Huadu Hotel in Beijing, one of Duan's businesses, said she wasn't there.Meanwhile a member of staff who answered the phone at her Beijing Taihong Holdings Co. said she wasn't there, either."I haven't seen her for really quite a while now," the second employee said, suggesting that she may have "left the country."Beijing-based constitutional scholar and political commentator Zhang Lifan said Duan, as an entrepreneur with close ties to the ruling party elite, could bear the brunt of any corruption probe if Wen's family becomes a target of President Xi Jinping's anti-corruption drive."Wen [Jiabao] put a lot of effort into the fall of Bo Xilai, and it's hard to say whether or not he is now being investigated," Zhang said. "Unless it's a power struggle. These sorts of detentions are often a way of threatening an opponent with evidence, as leverage.""Duan Hongwei is sure to be in possession of huge amounts of evidence, and that fact that they have brought her in will be enough to intimidate the people she is acting for," he said."These 'arms length' entrepreneurs are in a pretty vulnerable position, because they can be bandied around as a bargaining chip in a power struggle at any time."Politics and business intertwinedAccording to Bao Tong, former aide to China's late, ousted premier Zhao Ziyang, China's richest business-people are inextricably entwined with the country's ruling political class."These entrepreneurs have an extremely close relationship with the Chinese government, or officials within it," Bao told RFA. "The entrepreneurs are basically the government's sidekicks.""We can see the links in the chain, and so the companies must do what the leaders say; then they will last for as long as the leaders do," he said."They could be a billionaire today and a prisoner tomorrow , a conspirator, a criminal," he said.Pin Ho, editor of New York-based Chinese news magazine Mingjing News, said Wen's family may have been given an easier time by graft investigators in return for their close cooperation on the case of former Chongqing party secretary Bo Xilai."Wen Jiabao put a lot of effort into the cases against Bo Xilai and [former security czar] Zhou Yongkang, and so the corruption case against Wen's family was shelved," Ho told RFA. "Crisis was averted, because Wen's son was at the helm of Ping An Insurance.""Wen's family made several billion U.S. dollars out of Ping An Insurance during Wen Jiabao's term as premier," he said.Xia Ming, a political science professor at the The City University of New York, said Duan is also a link between the more recently fallen former Chongqing party chief Sun Zhengcai, who is under investigation for corruption, and Wen's family."After Beijing won the bid for the 2008 Olympic Games, Sun Zhengcai was the most powerful man in Shunyi county, Beijing," Xia said. "He controlled all of the rights to the land near Beijing International Airport.""Duan Weihong and her ex-husband Shen Dong were running a business that acquired the land nearby that was needed for the widening of the airport expressway," he said. "A lot of the shares in Duan's property company were held by members of Wen's family.""The investigation into Sun Zhengcai has become a massive case, although it's as yet unclear how much of an impact this will have on Wen Jiabao personally," he said. "But his two grown children are deeply involved, and they will definitely feel the impact."Reported by Ng Yik-tung and Sing Man for RFA's Cantonese Service, and by Gao Shan for the Mandarin Service.

U.S. intel agencies warn against using Chinese brand smartphonesUPIFebruary 14, 2018 Wednesday 9:59 PM ESTCopyright 2018 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 406 wordsByline: RAY DOWNSDateline: Feb. 14 BodyU.S. intelligence officials advised Americans on Wednesday not to use smartphones made by Chinese companies Huawei or ZTE.Although American brands like Apple manufacture their smartphones in China, U.S. intelligence officials from the NSA, FBI and CIA said they believe smartphones sold by Chinese-based companies pose a security risk."We're deeply concerned about the risks of allowing any company or entity that is beholden to foreign governments that don't share our values," FBI Director Christopher Wray said in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee.Wray said smartphones and other communication technology could be compromised "to gain positions of power inside our telecommunication networks that provides the capacity to exert pressure or control over our telecommunications infrastructure."Wray also said the phones could be used to "maliciously modify or steal information" and "to conduct undetected espionage."Both Huawei and ZTE pushed back against the accusations that their products posed a national security risk to the United States."Huawei is trusted by governments and customers in 170 countries worldwide and poses no greater cybersecurity risk than any ICT vendor, sharing as we do common global supply chains and production capabilities," a spokesperson for Huawei said in a statement, according to CNN.ZTE said some of its product components are manufactured in the United States."As a publicly traded company, we are committed to adhering to all applicable laws and regulations of the United States, work with carriers to pass strict testing protocols, and adhere to the highest business standards," the company said.At one point during the Senate Intelligence Committee panel, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., asked the heads of the FBI, NSA and CIA to raise their hands if they would recommend Americans use products by Huawei or ZTE. Nobody raised their hands.Wray's warning comes only days after Cotton introduced a bill that would prohibit U.S. government agencies from contracting with Huawei or ZTE."Huawei is effectively an arm of the Chinese government, and it's more than capable of stealing information from U.S. officials by hacking its devices," Cotton said in a statement.Although the FBI, NSA and CIA warned against the use of phones made by Chinese companies,  revealed last year that U.S. intelligence agencies have the capability to hack into  and Apple phones, as well as laptops and televisions.Load-Date: February 15, 2018End of Document

This report covers in-depth the mobile operator perspective on the global M2M/IoT communications market. Get up to date with the latest trends from all main regions and vertical markets with this unique 170 page report.The report estimates that the global number of cellular IoT subscribers increased by 56 percent during 2017 to reach 647.5 million. The accelerating growth is expected to take the global installed base to almost 1 billion at the end of 2018. By 2022, the researcher now projects that there will be 2.7 billion IoT devices connected to cellular networks worldwide. "China is playing a key role in accelerating and transforming the global cellular IoT market", said Tobias Ryberg, senior analyst and author of the report.The Chinese government has set a goal to connect 600 million devices to NB-IoT networks by 2020. NB-IoT will essentially replace 2G technology, which accounted for the bulk of the 150 million new cellular IoT connections added in the country in 2017. In the process, the cost of 4G-based cellular IoT chipsets and modules will fall dramatically, paving the way for a similar transition worldwide.The report concludes that the developments will ultimately make 2G networks obsolete as different flavours of 4G will meet all cellular IoT use cases at lower cost and better performance. The next wave of cellular IoT adoption is focused on new vertical segments like smart cities and infrastructure, smart industrial supply chains and connected consumer products. The researcher believes the new wave will start in China, where government authorities and manufacturing companies will be first in the world to deploy connected devices using NB-IOT technology on a massive scale.In the same way, embedded cellular IoT connectivity will be added to a wide number of consumer product categories. "The remarkable rise of the bike sharing industry illustrates how fast new technology can scale in the Chinese consumer market. In less than a year, tens of millions of connected bikes were launched into the streets of major cities", said Mr Ryberg. "The aftermath of the bike sharing frenzy does however underline an equally important point: IoT technology adds no value without a proper business case. The long-term winners in IoT will be those who combine scale and economic benefitKey Topics Covered:Executive summary1.

As US gets tough with China, Wall Street gets weak-kneedAssociated Press InternationalMarch 23, 2018 Friday 12:59 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 526 wordsByline: By PAUL WISEMAN and MARLEY JAYDateline: NEW YORK BodyNEW YORK (AP) - The prospect of a full-blown trade war between the world's two biggest economies rattled investors Thursday, sending stocks to their biggest loss in six weeks.The Dow Jones industrial average plunged more than 700 points, as President Donald Trump announced plans to slap tariffs on Chinese imports. The Chinese government vowed to defend itself.Investors worried that if the dispute escalated, China will counterpunch with restrictions of its own, hurting American exports of airplanes, construction equipment and other goods.It didn't take long for China to threaten to hit back. The Commerce Ministry announced a list of U.S. goods, including pork and aluminum pipe, that could be slapped with higher tariffs in response to the U.S. move. It called for a negotiated settlement to the dispute.Many big U.S. companies have built complicated supply chains that stretch across the Pacific Ocean. A trade war could disrupt the back-and-forth flow of parts, forcing factories to slow or halt production.U.S. companies with substantial sales to China were clobbered in the crossfire Thursday.Construction equipment maker Caterpillar lost 5.7 percent of its value - its worst loss since mid-2016. Aerospace company Boeing slid 5.2 percent. Chipmaker Micron Technology fell 3.5 percent.Caterpillar gets about 5 percent of its revenue from China, Boeing 12 percent and Micron nearly 50 percent, according to the research firm FactSet.The broader S&P 500 index lost 2.5 percent and is now down slightly for the year."We don't want a trade war ... but we are not afraid of it," said China's ambassador to the U.S., Cui Tiankai. "If somebody tries to impose a trade war on us ... we will certainly fight back and retaliate. If people want to play tough, we will play tough with them and see who will last longer."Trump said the U.S. would impose the tariffs, as well as restrict Chinese investment, to punish Beijing for stealing American technology. The action came two weeks after the president announced major tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, a move that unsettled markets already nervous about rising interest rates and the prospect of inflation.Administration officials said Thursday they were targeting 1,300 Chinese product lines worth about $50 billion a year in imports. Trump put the figure at $60 billion, causing some confusion over the actual extent of the sanctions. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative has 15 days to publish a list of products subject to the tariffs. The administration said it would target imports from Chinese makers of machinery and aerospace and communications equipment.The tariffs themselves are only equal to about 10 percent of China's annual goods imports to the United States.But Trump's move raises longer-term uncertainty about the world's most important economic relationship."This is throwing down the gauntlet to the Chinese," Scott Kennedy, a China specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "The relationship on the commercial front has moved into new territory today from where it has been for the last 40 years ... We really don't know where this is going to go."Load-Date: March 23, 2018End of Document

China's Huawei has promised to spend £3 billion sourcing tech and services from the UK post-BrexitBusiness Insider USFebruary 6, 2018 Tuesday 06:15 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 630 wordsByline: sghosh@businessinsider.com,  (Shona Ghosh)Highlight: The deal looks important to a post-Brexit Britain.BodyDan Kitwood/Getty Images• Chinese mobile giant Huawei will spend £3 billion over the next five years on procurement in the UK.• This means the firm will spend money on anything from chipset IP to financial services from British-based companies.• The deal looks good for a post-Brexit UK that needs to prove it's an important trading partner to the rest of the world.Huawei, the Chinese smartphone and telecoms giant, has promised to spend £3 billion over the next five years on buying technology, intellectual property, and services from the UK.Huawei has described the promised cash as a procurement commitment, meaning it will source anything from chipset IP to financial services from UK companies, both for its UK business and for the group more widely.The announcement comes after Huawei's chairwoman, Sun Yafang, met with UK Prime Minister Theresa May in Beijing at the end of January.Huawei isn't revealing much detail on where it plans to spend the money at this point. It's likely the cash will go towards buying licences from UK-based and Japanese-owned chipmaker ARM for HiSilicon, Huawei's chipmaking subsidiary based in China's Shenzen. It might also involve procuring services for Huawei's global financial risk centre, which is located in London.Business Insider understands that Huawei will make a separate announcement around investing more money into more staff and offices in the UK.The investment will be a welcome sign of confidence in post-Brexit UK, and positive news for tech firms looking to get their products into China. It's also a good sign for Theresa May, who headed to China shortly after becoming prime minister last year to push for better trade relations.Huawei has been operating in the UK for 17 years, a spokesman said, and has established partnerships with BT, a research centre in Ipswich, and the "Cell" security centre in Banbury. Huawei employs more than 1,500 people in the UK across 15 offices. The news comes even as foreign governments become increasingly suspicious of Huawei, and any possible connections to the Chinese government.The launch of Huawei's latest flagship, the Mate 10 Pro, was scuppered in the US after a carrier deal with AT&T fell through, apparently after political pressure. The US Senate and House intelligence committees reportedly sent letters to the Federal Communications Commission arguing that Huawei was a security threat.The UK's Intelligence and Security Committee expressed similar fears in a paper in 2013, but Huawei has allayed any worries around security somewhat with the Cell, where Huawei staff check the firm's equipment for security bugs. The unit is overseen by UK government and security officials.Huawei chairwoman Sun Yafang said: "Huawei values long-term partnership.  The UK was one of the first international markets we entered, when we opened our first office there in 2001."We have now been working with our major customers in the UK for more than twelve years, helping to build a better connected UK. Over the coming years we look forward to continuing to collaborate with our customers and partners to help keep the UK at the very forefront of the digital age."Theresa May said: "Thanks to the drive and innovation of UK business, backed by this Government, trade between the UK and China is already at record levels. This visit is an opportunity to further showcase the best of British and boost jobs and prosperity throughout the UK."NOW WATCH: People are obsessed with this Google app that finds your fine art doppelgängerSee Also:• Nintendo has officially announced a 'Super Mario' movie• Nintendo has sold more Switch consoles in 10 months than it did Wii Us in 5 years• Verizon reportedly follows AT&T's lead and cancels plans to sell Huawei's latest phone amid fears of Chinese spyingLoad-Date: February 11, 2019End of Document

Trump announces punishment of 60,000 million dollars to Chinese importsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 22, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 320 wordsBody The drums of a commercial war sound strong. This Thursday, the president of the United States, Donald Trump, announced trade measures against China on the grounds that the trade deficit with that country - about 504 billion dollars - was "out of control" and that there was a "robbery situation" of intellectual property. "  "It's the biggest deficit of any country in the history of the world, it's out of control," Trump said before signing a memo. "We have a tremendous situation of intellectual property theft, which adds hundreds of billions of dollars," he added.  Trump signed a resolution called 301 that allows him to impose tariffs on Chinese products for almost 60,000 million dollars.  Lee: Trump will impose trade measures on China for "theft" of intellectual property.  At the conference, Robert Lightizer, the US Trade Representative, said the president will impose sanctions on technology investment in China.  "They buy technology economically in the United States and in some way is a cyber theft," he said.  The Chinese government has previously alerted Washington about the need to avoid acting "emotionally".  This same Wednesday, the president of the Federal Reserve (the Central Bank), Jerome Powell, admitted that "the most prominent risk" for the US economy is precisely the beginning of a generalized trade war.  Lee: Trump wants to impose tariffs on China for 60 billion dollars.  However, Robert Lighthizer recently proposed to the president the adoption of tariffs on Chinese products for some 30,000 million dollars.  Trump had insistently promised in his election campaign that he would act to eliminate what he considers distortions in trade, which he blames for the loss of jobs in the United States.  Washington accuses China of forcing US companies to review trade information and intellectual property in order to operate in the Chinese market.  With information from Reuters and EFE Load-Date: March 22, 2018End of Document

DEMOCRACY THAT DELIVERS #111: JESSICA BATKE ON THE FUTURE OF FOREIGN NGOS IN CHINAStates News ServiceMarch 27, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 149 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Center for International Private Enterprise (CIPE):Prior to 2017, China expert Jessica Batke describes the workings of foreign NGOs in China as the "Wild West," with vague regulations that were not enforced.This changed in January 2017, when China passed the Foreign NGO Law (FNGO). The legislation allows the Chinese government to have more oversight and supervision of foreign NGOs in China.Batke, senior editor of ChinaFile, explains that although the new legislation will provide a better framework for NGOs operating in China, it could have dire effects on those organizations promoting advocacy or NGOs whose objectives do not align with those of the Chinese government.Want to hear more?

A copy of the directive was leaked online and reposted by the China Digital Times.It said: "Urgent notice: all media personnel are prohibited from discussing the Two Sessions blue-clothed reporter incident on social media. Anything already posted must be deleted. Without exception, websites must not hype the episode."Hu Xijin, the editor-in-chief of state newspaper Global Times, also published a video on Tuesday arguing there was "nothing to see" in Liang's eye-roll, and bristled at the fact that the clip "managed to upstage the day's online reports on the State Council's institutional reform plan." China goes to great lengths to make sure everything goes their way. As the National People's Congress, China's annual legislative conference, takes place this month, Beijing authorities has ordered cafes and bars to serve no more than 10 foreigners at a time.Shortly after the country proposed to ban presidential term limits last month, it also temporarily banned the letter N from the internet after it became associated with anti-government protest.And if you were interested, this was the "fawning question" that earned the eye-roll, which was translated by The New York Times:"The transformation of the responsibility of supervision for state assets is a topic of universal concern. Therefore, as the director of the State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council, what new moves will you make in 2018?"This year marks the 40th anniversary of the Reform and Opening-up Policy, and our country is going to further extend its openness to foreign countries."With General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Xi proposing the One Belt One Road Initiative, state-owned enterprises have increased investment to countries along the route of One Belt One Road, so how can the overseas assets of state-owned enterprises be effectively supervised to prevent loss of assets?"What mechanisms have we introduced so far, and what's the result of our supervision?"Please summarise for us, thank you."NOW WATCH: The racist origins of marijuana prohibitionSee Also:• Factional warring and failed 'coups' may be the reason Xi Jinping wants to rule China forever• Trump doubles down on executing drug dealers• Trade wars 'harm the initiator': China's foreign minister just fired a warning shot at the US over Trump's tariffsLoad-Date: February 11, 2019End of Document

The best performer was Hong Kong once again. Hang Seng up almost two percent.Protecting our kids. The White House unveiling a plan to help end gun violence in schools. This proposal is calling for Federal money to arm and train teachers. It does not include any change in the -- in the age to buy a weapon.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R), CALIFORNIA: I think from a perspective not force teachers to be armed, but more importantly what I want to see, I want to see if someone is giving the tip that they're able to see it. I want to see that we prevent people that aren't supposed to have guns from getting them.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: We are breaking down the President's mission to improve school safety coming up. Tragedy on the water to report. Five people are dead this morning, after a helicopter crashed into New York's East River last night. The latest on investigation, coming up.

And joining me to break it all down, The Hill Contributor and author of How Do I Tax Thee, Kristin Tate here, PwC Partner, Mitch Roschelle is here and former CIA Operative, co-founder of Diligence LLC, Mike Baker joining us this morning. Great to see you.MIKE BAKER, COFOUNDER, DILIGENCE LLC: Sparkle beer. That's what we all been waiting for.(CROSSTALK)KRISTIN TATE, CONTRIBUTOR, THE HILL: I hate beer.(CROSSTALK)MITCH ROSCHELLE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR: You hate beer?TATE: I don't -- I don't understand it.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: You've been really focused on the Pennsylvania special election happening on Tuesday, that's a big deal.TATE: Oh, yes.BARTIROMO: Is there going to be a proxy for the midterm elections in your view?TATE: It could be. I mean, the Democrat Conor Lamb running in this race. He's a very different kind of Democrat, he has distanced himself from the extremely leadership in D.C. He's even called for Nancy Pelosi to step down, so if he pull off a victory here it does send a message to the GOP but it also sends a message to Nancy Pelosi and it signals that her leadership may be toxic and hurting more than it's helping.BARTIROMO: One of the things that Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy mentioned yesterday is this redistricting, that has gone on in Pennsylvania and it's -- it favors the Democrats.TATE: Oh, it would be devastating to Republicans, Republicans are trying to challenge this in court right now. But -- yes, if this goes through and this happens, it's going to be big for the Democrats.BARTIROMO: All right. We'll talk more about this coming up. Meanwhile, a top story this hour, the Trump administration tackles school gun violence more than three weeks after Parkland School massacre White House is rolling out its school safety proposal, not included, raising age limit for buying a gun to 21. Something the President had called fort. Blake Burman is covering the story. He's at the White House right now with the very latest. Blake, good morning to you.BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Maria, good morning to you as well. President Trump response to the Stoneman Douglas shooting, include some of the more controversial ideas that he floated in the immediate aftermath of the shooting, but also one of those still remains TBD. President Trump does call for a hardening of schools as he likes to phrase it as grants from Departments of Justice will help states with funding, to train armed personnel within schools. It also calls on states to pass risk protection orders allowing for the temporary removal of a gun from someone deemed a threat. It also calls on Congress to pass an expanded background check bill, and a full audit of the FBI tip line. However, it does not advocate for the immediate raising of the age of some gun purchases to 21 years old instead -- in his listening session rather with lawmakers in which the President was open to the idea as you remember, he suggested that lawmakers would not touch the idea because they were afraid of the NRA.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I'm a big fan of the NRA. They want to do it. These are great people, these are great patriots. They love our country but that doesn't mean we have to agree on everything. It doesn't make sense that I have to wait until I'm 21 to get a handgun but I can get this weapon at 18. I don't know. So I was just curious as to what you did in your bill?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You know, we didn't address it, Mr. President but I think --TRUMP: You know what, because you're afraid of the NRA, right?(END VIDEO CLIP)BURMAN: Instead, a commission led by the education secretary Betsy DeVos will study that idea.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BETSY DEVOS, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF EDUCATION: Well, everything is on the table and part of the job of this commission will be to study that, and see if that is advanced ultimately as a recommendations in next steps. The points being there are many steps to be taken now and additional steps that will be taken down the road as we do the work of the commission.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURMAN: However Maria, in his speech over the weekend in Pennsylvania when talking about a different committee, a different commission or at least the idea of a commission or a committee, the President said, all they do is "talk, talk, talk." Maria, back to you.BARTIROMO: Yes. All right, Blake. Thank you. Blake Burman with the latest there. I want to turn abroad now, China is warning a trade war would be "a disaster for the U.S. and the world after President Trump set tariffs on steel and aluminum imports last week. Joining us right now to weigh in is the author of the Coming Collapse of China, Gordon Chang. Gordon, it's good to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR, THE COMING COLLAPSE OF CHINA: Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Your reaction to this reaction from China.CHANG: Well, last year, 88.8 percent of China's overall merchandise trade surplus related to sales from United States, that's up from still astounding 68.0 percent in the year before. You know, we have all high cards and the only thing we don't have is political will. So, I don't think the Chinese are in any position to really maintain an extended trade war with the United States largely because we know that in trade wars, trade deficit countries do very well and trades surplus countries do very poorly. We know that because in the last great trade war which was the great depression, we were trade surplus country in the world. We're the one who got hurt the most.BARTIROMO: Yes. Now, the U.S. is asking China apparently to lower the deficit which is now $375 billion with China lower that by $100 billion dollars. Not going to happen, right?CHANG: Well, it's not going to happen that way by Trump getting on the phone with Xi Jinping and saying, give me $100 billion of trade. I think the problem here is that the Chinese economy under Xi Jinping has been closing itself off. You see this with the Made in China 2025 trade initiative which is basically to dominate 10 critical sectors. We see this with discriminatory prosecution of U.S. companies and all of this National Security laws and regulations that are applied disproportionally against foreign companies. So, there are some issues there and then on top of that, you now have, of course the 301 investigation if the China has theft of intellectual property. That's probably concludes this year, that's going to be a major item dwarfing these tariffs.BARTIROMO: Yes. You're right. Now, look, I've got this report here which I find so fascinating. China's Technology Transfer Strategy and basically, they're participating in venture backed start-ups at a record level, seven to 10 percent of all venture deals done in 2016. I believe is the last -- the last five years actually. So what should this administration be doing to push back at China stealing our intellectual property, trying to acquire technology and then compete with us in those industries?CHANG: Well, you know, with regard to the 301 investigation, I think that essentially the tariffs or the prohibitions on trade with certain enterprises, that they've got to be stiff because we lose somewhere between three and $600 billion a year in intellectual property theft to the Chinese. That means, the punishments have to be big. You know, with regard to Chinese taking technology by buying it, well, we know that CFIUS, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States has really taken a very tough attitude from about the last year of the Obama administration all the way through now. And we see this for instance, with the CFIUS stomping the Qualcomm-Broadcom deal which technically is in China but China was going to be the beneficiary because this is a race for 5G, the only U.S. company that can win is Qualcomm is Broadcom buys it. It's probably going to break it apart and make it difficult for us to compete against Huawei, the Chinese company for 5G.BARTIROMO: Yes. Because Broadcom is based in Singapore. (CROSSTALK)CHANG: it's based in Singapore, it's going to be re-domesticated if the shareholders vote that way on May 6. But it's not so much that Broadcom is foreign, it's a -- Broadcom has a business model of buying, breaking up, realizing the shareholder value in the parts. Qualcomm will not be able to compete in 5G if Broadcom buys it and splits it up.BARTIROMO: Wow. That's a big -- that's a big deal.CHANG: It's enormous because 5G is going to connect everything in your home, in your workplace --BARTIROMO: And so it goes Qualcomm acquires Broadcom, you do not think that they're going to be able to effectively compete with China?CHANG: If Broadcom acquires Qualcomm, yes.BARTIROMO: Right, right.CHANG: Yes. I think that's pretty clear because Huawei is getting support from the Chinese government. It's nominally in private company but it's so connected with the people's liberation army. It is in effect to state enterprise. And so therefore, this is not a fair fight especially if Qualcomm gets taken apart.BAKER: You said that normally a private company with straight face I give you a lot of credit for that, that was very good.CHANG: My wife really sort of coaches me on that because I would get upset but she says, no, you can't get upset.BAKER: This is a little bit off the China trade topic, but still in the area, what's your take on the removal of term limits in China?CHANG: Well, this is Xi Jinping, you know, people say he wants to be Mao, it's even worse than that because in recent years he's been talking like the Chinese emperors of the two millennia of imperial rule. You know, he's now talking about - and then he's hinting that China is the only sovereign in the world. I mean, this is breathtaking, this is ludicrous but this is what guy is saying which basically he means, he thinks weird tributes of the Chinese. This is exceedingly, exceedingly dangerous, and this poses not only, you know, that we call China a rival on the National Security strategy. It's actually more than just a rival.TATE: If Trump try to pull a feint like this, of course the world would implode but how does specifically affect China-U.S. relations if at all? I mean --CHANG: Well --TATE: How does this impact us?CHANG: I think it impacts us in a couple of ways because, first of all, Xi Jinping has been one responsible for closing up the Chinese economy. He gets more power, he is going to be more effective and doing that, he's had a very belligerent external policy, so he challenges not only China's neighbors to the south and the east, he's trying to close off a global commons. That puts him into conflict with us because if we've any consistent foreign policy over the course of 2-1/2 centuries, it's been defending freedom of navigation, all sorts of things occurred there. The Chinese military becoming so much powerful because they support Xi Jinping, they are very hostile. This really looks hostile, this really looks bad for everybody.BARTIROMO: I think -- yes, go ahead.ROSCHELLE: Gordon, you mentioned that China holds all the high cards. I think that's what you said. Did you say that or we should be held --CHANG: Oh, no, no. We hold high cards.ROSCHELLE: We hold high cards. OK. Here is a high card that they do hold which is the $1.2 trillion worth of treasury is that a -- is that a --(CROSSTALK)CHANG: No, no. Not at all. They've been selling treasury since the middle of 2014 to defend the Renminbi which is really fragile. You know, they are foreign exchange reserves, they say it come down 800 billion probably a lot more. So, you know, I think that it -- this is not really going to be a hold on them only because we think that it is and, you know, you have these Chinese generals every once in a while saying, oh, we should drop U.S. debt in order to hurt us. Or f you think about the way the global markets work. That doesn't work because if the Chinese sell U.S. debt, they get back dollars. They get back dollars, they go to into other occurrences, that means those other currencies go up in value, that means London, Brussels, Tokyo go out of global the markets top rebalance their currencies and the only way they can do that is to pick up dollars.BARTIROMO: Yes. And what you said is really stunning that you don't think Qualcomm will be able to effectively compete with China if Broadcom acquires them. Now, we see that Intel has revealed that it's also considering acquiring Broadcom. So, from a U.S. perspective, if Intel acquires Broadcom, that would be more -- a better competition you believe than Qualcomm-Broadcom.CHANG: Yes. It's really just a question of what Intel plans to do with Qualcomm I mean, if they were wanting to break it up --BARTIROMO: Well, Intel wants to buy Broadcom.CHANG: Yes, I know. Btu -- and then Broadcom buys -- it's one fish smaller than the other.BARTIROMO: I see.CHANG: I mean, it really just depends on what Intel intends to do. You know, this is maybe not a CFIUS matter if Intel is the only company and Broadcom is completely out of the picture. But, you know, it's just a question we make -- have to make sure that we have a company that can actually win 5G. You win 5G, you win wireless communications for at least a decade, you connect everything in your home, you do not want your toaster talking to you in Chinese.BARTIROMO: Right. The thing is this, I mean, this -- when I look at this tariff story and all of the pushback that this administration has gotten and then recognize what has gone on with China the way they're acquiring technology and, you know, important things and important industries like A.I. Robotics, you recognize that this tariff story is much more than just aluminum and steel.CHANG: Oh, absolutely.BARTIROMO: It's about NAFTA and it's about China.CHANG: It's absolutely more important because the way the Chinese economy is going. You know, you talk about A.I., you know, Chinese are now the leaders in quantum communications, quantum computing, you -- they're putting a lot of state money into A.I. You put A.I. and quantum together and who knows what's going to happen. So, you know, we don't have that project of let's go to the moon, you know, John Kennedy, we may need one of those projects for A.I. and quantum because they control those, you control a lot in tomorrow's world.BARTIROMO: Yes. Gordon, it's great to get your insights. Thank you.CHANG: Thanks, Maria.BARTIROMO: Gordon Change with the latest there. Coming up. A leadership shakeup.

But there's a lot of buzz on social media about it, it's actually pretty good.BARTIROMO: You're right.

Here's what House Majority Leader, Kevin McCarthy, told me about that yesterday on "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES".(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER: This is a little unique situation because in Pennsylvania, what Democrats did -- this really Barack Obama and others -- they've gone and politically redrew the lines. So, whoever turns out and wins in tomorrow's election -- this is a very tight race going in. And the number one question should be: do you want another person added to Congress, that's going to be another vote for Nancy Pelosi to become speaker? Because that is what she's doing around the country.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: We are looking at what's at stake in tomorrow's race, coming up this morning. Meanwhile, tough talk on trade.

The fast food chain launching a skittle-flavored slushy.All those stories coming up this morning. But first topic and our news this half-an-hour, high stakes for balance of power in Washington: the fight for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district looks to be a fight to the finish on Tuesday. The President visited Moon Township this weekend to stomp for Republicans Rick Saccone. Joining me right now to talk more about that and a lot of things is House Freedom Caucus Member, Florida Congressman, Ron Desantis. Congressman, good to see you, sir. Thanks so much for joining us.REP. RON DESANTIS (R-FL), HOUSE FREEDOM CAUCUS MEMBER: Good morning. Good to be here.BARTIROMO: How important is this special election? Do you view Pennsylvania, 18th congressional district, as a proxy for the midterms?DESANTIS: I think these things are typically are over analyzed. Obviously, you want to win, and if we don't win that race, then people are going to say Dems on march. If we win, and we'll say, hey, people said Texas was going to be a blue wave, it wasn't, and then we're holding on to this district in an area where the Democrats are really energized. So, hopefully, we'll bring it home. I think the President really drew out a lot of people, and I think if the Republican do win, then I think Donald Trump will be the big reason why.BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, we'll see about that. How important is it in terms of what it means if the Democrats do get a win? How worried are you about the House losing the majority in November?DESANTIS: I think that's going to be a dogfight, there's no doubt about it. But here's the issue with the special elections: when you have an opposition party that is energized, you have the left wing of the Democratic Party, they hate the President, they want to come out and vote, that energy is going to be magnified in a special election. In a regularly scheduled election, the energy does matter, there's no doubt about it, but you tend to get more regular voters. And so, so I think it does matter, but I think the key for Republicans is take the message to the folks, make the case about why we're better off than we were two years ago -- the tax bill being a big part of that -- and then drive your core voters to the polls. I think if we do that in midterms, I think we'll gain Senate seats, and I think we'll have a good chance of holding the House.BARTIROMO: Congressman, let me switch gears and ask you about gun safety, White House is detailing its plan to reduce gun violence at schools that includes money to train school staffers to a carry a weapon, but it does not raise the age limit for buying guns. I spoke with House Majority Leader, Kevin McCarthy, yesterday, and really, he talked about what's happening in Congress. I want to get your take on it. Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MCCARTHY: We need to start enforcing what we have. But more importantly, we need to make sure the background checks are updated and that's the bill we passed in December, and now we're adding to it to stop school violence. And bill we're passing this week, the Sandy Hook promise, they endorsed this bill as well.BARTIROMO: Do you want to see teachers armed?MCCARTHY: I think, from a perspective, not force teachers to be armed. But if somebody has the concealed carry permit and others, and trained? I want to see it.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: What's your take, congressman?DESANTIS: Well, I think White House approached this. Well, if you read the proposal, it doesn't mandate federal solutions, it's providing support for school districts across the country to be able to protect their students in the way that makes most sense for school districts. And so, they are offering training for personnel. So, in a place like Florida, I think, if you are a concealed carry permit, I don't think should be a gun- free zone where you're not allowed to exercise that right, and I think it does serve as a deterrent to people if you beef up school security, visible security, if you harden the schools.And then, if you may have one or two faculty members that are trained, licensed, and could potentially be concealed carrying, that makes the school a much less attractive target for some of these guys. I mean, right now, we've left the security laps to the point where these guys can go and that's soft target. That is changing right now, we need to do. But I would say the other thing that's important, from the federal perspective, is accountability. And we had FBI in this case, in Parkland, Florida, they got two tips about this shooter -- not only that he was dangerous, not only that he was crazy, but that he was actually contemplating a school shooting. And when that tip came in in January of 2018, you're not going to get a better tip, that lady that called it in, she was on the money with everything. They actually --BARTIROMO: I don't understand how they missed that.DESANTIS: -- not only that, though, they actually connected the 2018 phone call to the Mississippi tip from 2017. So, they searched the database, Nikolas Cruz pinged in database. And then what decision did they make? Not to do anything more on the FBI, in terms of federal, but they didn't even report it to the local authorities in South Florida.BARTIROMO: And why do you think that is?DESANTIS: So, my point on this is: people need to lose their jobs over this, Maria. You can't just have an ineffectual bureaucracy time and time again and then there's no accountability. We got briefed last week by the deputy FBI director, and I can tell you, this is the biggest example of government dropping the ball -- when look at locals down in South Florida and the FBI that I've seen since I've been in government, and we need people to be accountable for their failures!BARTIROMO: There's a lot going on at the FBI. I know that you're looking at right now. You just -- it is a head scratcher, why? What are they focused on and to miss incredible obviousness signal? Let me move on to the President's tariff plans, sir, because U.S. Trade Representative, Robert Lighthizer, will meet with his E.U. and Japanese counterparts to talk about the new steel and aluminum tariffs, because they want to be excluded -- this comes as China is threatening retaliation against the new policy. I spoke with White House National Trade Council Director, Peter Navarro, yesterday, here's what he said and why he thinks these threats might be ringing hallow.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PETER NAVARRO, DIRECTOR, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL TRADE COUNCIL: We've been uncle-sucker. I mean, we have these large trade deficits, simply because we're an open market. All we're looking for is fair and reciprocal trade. And I think our allies at the end of the day, will understand that all we're doing here is defending two key industries so that we can come and help with their defense, when they need us.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: So, congressman, some GOPers are considering legislation to block the tariffs and to thwart these metal tariffs, would you be in on that?DESANTIS: Well, my concern with the tariff -- if it's being used as temporary leverage to open markets, that could end up being good for the economy in long term, that could lead to more trade and more open trade. My concern at the -- right now is like in Florida, for example, we've got about 100 jobs who use aluminum and steel downstream as inputs for every one job that's directly manufacturing aluminum and steel. And so, I don't want to increase prices for those other businesses, and then potentially cost jobs. So, I think that -- and we still need to know the details about how broad these things are going to apply, who's it going to apply to, who's it not going to apply? The President issued kind of a broad proclamation, but I think the details are really going to matter here.BARTIROMO: So, then, you would be in favor of having as many exceptions as possible than it sounds like?DESANTIS: For our positive trading allies, and particularly with eye towards not damaging any of those downstream businesses who are using aluminum and steel as inputs in products or businesses, I think we have to look out for them, as well as just the people who are directly involved in producing those products.BARTIROMO: Right. So, do you think this is about NAFTA, about China? Or because it was all of these exception, I mean, you have to ask yourself why do it? Is it just a negotiating tactic?DESANTIS: I think that's part of it. And I think China -- and the President has been tough on China, and I think it's been well-documented, some of their practices. And I think those need to be addressed whether tariffs are the best way or not -- I mean, we can debate that. In terms of NAFTA, there may be some ways where renegotiations would be beneficial to the United States, I do think they are using this to spur that along, and if they can get an agreement, that will open up, markets for us, I think that will be a win. And so, this is something that the President is very much engaging, he cares a lot about it, and I think his goal is to get better deals for United States, and I think most people agree that that would be a good thing.BARTIROMO: Let me ask you about the stiff sanctions, now the plan talks in North Korea, there's a long road to a face-to-face meeting between the President and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. But the President said that he hopes to do what others haven't. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: We've had a problem for years with North Korea. In fact, President Obama said it was a biggest problem we had. This should've been he handle, by the way, over the last 30 years, not now. That's --(CROWD CHEERING)TRUMP: They should've handled it -- this should've been handled, and everybody will say it too. But that's OK, because that is what we do -- we handle things.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: So, congressman, as a member of Foreign Relations Committee, your thoughts on this unprecedented move by the White House to agree to a meeting.DESANTIS: The President is right. His predecessors have basically left the problem fester. President Obama did next to nothing, and they basically just hoped that the problem would go away, that's not going to work. And to this President's credit, he's come in and said: Obama is telling me this is biggest problem. Trump has been talking about this for 20 years. He's like, I'm going to confront this, and we're going to actually change the equation here -- and I think he's already done that. Now, whether there's going to be a meeting and whether this is real, I don't know, but I think the fact that North Korea is even engaging in this, is because this is an unprecedented level of pressure that's been brought to bear on them.I think there's going to be -- need to be more to be done to make sure that we can potentially get anywhere. But the question is, is what the President's insistence on facing this problem directly, what he's done to bring pressure on the regime? Is Kim now thinking that maybe those nukes are causing his regime to be a little bit more unstable than stable? I mean, I think, historically, that has been his ticket to remain in power, and he probably still believers that. But if he starts to change that calculation a little bit, that's the opening for us actually to solve the problem.BARTIROMO: Congressman, let me move to the FISA controversy, do you think we need a second special counsel to investigate what has gone on at it FBI, the top of the FBI?DESANTIS: Yes, for a couple reasons of. One is, you can't have FBI investigate itself or the DOJ, so you need someone outside the swamp in Washington who's going to look at this with the fresh set of eyes and is not going to owe anybody. You know, I don't want somebody who is buddies with Comey or McCabe or any of that; I want a fresh set of eyes in here. And the second reason is, the inspector general who Sessions initially identified as the person who's going to look into this, cannot bring criminal charges; he can't impanel a grand jury, he can't even subpoena people who are outside the Department of Justice.So, that's clearly inadequate given how many of the key people -- McCabe, Comey -- are no longer inside government. So, yes, we do need it, I think we need it now, and I do think -- look, we talked about Trump-Russia collusion, you have a special counsel there, since this thing has been going on, the evidence, I think, of wrongdoing has been more on the side of those who were pursuing this narrative in 2016, and I think it goes beyond just the FISA, you're really looking at from time Hillary's investigation started all the way through the special counsel, how did these people conduct themselves?BARTIROMO: Yes, I think it's incredible that we're looking for Russia collusion, meanwhile, we know that the Democrats paid for the dossier. Here's your Russian collusion. It's pretty incredible. Ron Desantis, good to see you, sir, thank you.DESANTIS: Thank you.BARTIROMO: We'll see you soon, congressman. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Tesla confirming its suspended Model 3 production for a week last month. Nicole Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange watching that.

Elon Musk's baby getting these electronic vehicles, the Model 3, the car for the masses, the $35,000 vehicle starts at that amount. Remember it was a manufacturing hell, we'll they've had a lot of issues. They're still on target for 2500 production rate a week for the end -- until the of -- then in June, they go to 5,000, but the big picture is they paused here, they had suspended the production over in their San Jose manufacturing plant there, in order to improve automation, increase the production plant. They also were taking a pause at a Giga factory as well. Basically, trying to ramp it up to get them out.Then how about this, over at Taco Bell, the parent is Yum!

So now, get ready for your Skittles Freeze -- Skittles Strawberry Freeze, Maria.BARTIROMO: All right. A whole bunch of sugar there. Nicole, thank you. We are all watching the special Congressional election in Pennsylvania, which has turned into a referendum of sorts on Donald Trump's Presidential style and his policies. Joining me now, the host of "VARNEY & COMPANY," Stuart Varney. Stu, good morning to you.STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria. I think it's going to be a very, very big week in politics. I think a very confident President Trump is getting out and about, and taking his political attack if I can put it like that, straight to his political opponents. As you said, tomorrow's election in Pennsylvania, I think it's become a referendum on President Trump himself. He gave a rousing speech there in Pennsylvania on Saturday night, brought out 5,000 people, several hundred couldn't get in. Campaign-style Trump goes right at his political opponents taking the message to them. Then he goes to California, talk about going to the belly of the beast, well, that's where he's going.BARTIROMO: Yes.VARNEY: I mean, California is the headquarters of the Trump resistance movement, and he's going to meet it head on, then he goes to Missouri. I think he's going right at Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat, vulnerable in Trump company -- country, I should say. I think it's a big week for the President, and he looks increasingly confident.BARTIROMO: Yes, he looks confident. We'll see what happens there and whether or not it is a referendum on November. Stuart, I know you'll have a lot more in 10 minutes.VARNEY: I will.BARTIROMO: We'll see you then. "VARNEY & COMPANY" begins top of the hour, right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA at 9:00 a.m. Coming up, reaching the Red Planet, SpaceX founder, Elon Musk, revealing his plan to test flights to Mars and colonize the planet during a surprise talk at South by Southwest, that conference. We are headed to Austin, Texas for the latest. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Now this, Elon Musk says that we could start testing the shuttles that will fly us to Mars next year. Hillary Vaughn is live at the South by Southwest Festival in Austin, Texas this morning with the story. Hillary, good morning to you.HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Hey, good morning, Maria. Well, an unfiltered Elon Musk held an impromptu Q&A facing a room of his peers, critics, and fellow space fanatics at South by Southwest. The tech and space pioneer confessing to the crowd that he doesn't use a business plan because he thinks they're wrong anyways and also saying that his timelines aren't always realistic but Musk telling the crowd yesterday, his company, SpaceX, will be ready to launch its first vehicle to Mars early next year.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ELON MUSK, CEO, SPACEX: We are moving the first ship, the first Mars -- oh, it's a planetary ship right now. And I think we'll probably be able to do short flights, short sort of up and down flights probably sometime in the first-half of next year.(END VIDEO CLIP)VAUGHN: SpaceX's BFR rocket system will be equipped for interplanetary travel and totally reusable, one flight will cost under $6 million, that's cheaper than the early Falcon 1 flights, but Musk warns that early space travel is not a luxury escape hatch for the rich and famous, saying there is a good chance that early travellers will die. Musk says getting feet on the ground is just the first step.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MUSK: It's (INAUDIBLE) putting the first elementary infrastructure, just a base, to create propellants, a power station, glass domes in which to grow crops, and then, really, there's going to be an explosion of entrepreneurial opportunity.VAUGHN: Musk says he started SpaceX to make NASA's budget bigger, and he says once he proves space travel is possible and profitable, he hopes that more companies get in the game. Maria?BARTIROMO: All right, Hillary, thanks very much. Who wants to go to Mars?MIKE BAKER, PRESIDENT, DILIGENCE LLC: Early travelers could die so we'll give you a discount. $6 million. I can't get a refundable ticket on United to get --(LAUGHTER)BAKER: So, that's a good deal. I'll go. I'm -- I'll put my money --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: You don't want to go. You have no interest?TATE: I have no interest in this. So, you go ahead and take the $6 million.BARTIROMO: Mitch, what do you think, where are you on this?ROSCHELLE: No. No, no, no. I'm flying to London tonight. That's just enough for me.BARTIROMO: All right. Well, listen, this is innovation and you made a really good point during the commercial break. Look what has happened while we try to get to Mars.BAKER: It's the technologies that come out of this sort of things and it's also the aspirations. It's the desire to do something important, and I think that's critical for this nation.BARTIROMO: Final thoughts from this all-star panel, next. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Final thoughts, Mike Baker.BAKER: Yes, I was just on Washington D.C. I was at Arlington national cemetery. I've said this before but if you're looking for something to do with the kids, spring or summer, you're your kids to Arlington. Let them see what this national is built on. It is the most inspiring place in the country.BARTIROMO: That's beautiful. Mitch?ROSCHELLE: Big week for data. We got CPI, we've got retail sales, we've got producer price index and consumer sentiment, housing starts. Big week for data.BARTIROMO: Yes, it's going to be important. Especially that CPI on Tuesday.ROSCHELLE: CPI tomorrow. It could move the market.BARTIROMO: Kristin?TATE: Conor Lamb, the democrat running in the Pennsylvania special election who's doing better than expected, made the bold move of calling for Nancy Pelosi to resign. This shows that the left were in the same (INAUDIBLE) from 2016. If you want to win elections today, you buck the establishment.BARTIROMO: Thanks, everybody. Great to see you. See you tomorrow.

Risen Energy Deepens Expansion in Europe; The Chinese solar panel maker provides Spanish PV power station with 6 MW of modulesPR NewswireJanuary 31, 2018 Wednesday 10:00 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 365 wordsDateline: NINGBO, China, Jan. 31, 2018 BodyRisen Energy Co., Ltd., a leading China-based PV solutions provider that's traded as an A-share on China's Shenzhen Stock Exchange, recently announced that a 12MW ground PV power station in Requena, Spain has been connected to the grid, with Risen Energy having contributed 50% of the required high-efficiency solar modules to the project. This is a clear testament that the Chinese PV leader has received recognition outside of its home market, thanks to the excellent reputation that the firm has gained worldwide, most notably in Europe, and the strong and continuous growth in shipments going back many years.The 12MW power station, developed by a Chile-based firm, is backed by an investment of approximately 100 million euros, including loans worth 7.68 million euros from Banco Santander. Risen Energy, one of the world's leading PV power solutions providers, supplied 6MW of the necessary 325W high-efficiency modules to the project.The Chinese provider embarked on its globalization strategy several years ago and become an active participant of the Chinese government's One Belt, One Road initiative. The firm has leveraged its strengths in power expertise, project development and after-sales services to provide best-of-class professional PV power solutions, by taking part in the development of thousands of power station projects in Italy, Germany, India and Australia as well as in several African countries.Risen Energy president Wang Hong said: "In terms of PV development, compared with emerging Asian and African PV markets, Europe has reached a high level of maturity that includes government policies supporting the industry and project financing. To enhance the proportion of renewable energy-based power generation, European markets including Spain have rolled out a series of incentives. Given the rosy prospects for European markets, we plan to continue deepening our cooperation on the development of power station projects with European firms and to provide partners with high-efficacy products and outstanding services." View original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/risen-energy-deepens-expansion-in-europe-300590879.htmlSOURCE Risen Energy Co., LtdCONTACT: Tina Feng, +86-137-3619-2549, tina@risenenergy.comLoad-Date: February 1, 2018End of Document

Cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck's hack causes $400 million lossThe Ticker: Baruch CollegeFebruary 5, 2018 MondayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 1Length: 824 wordsBodyCoincheck, one of Japan's biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, recently disclosed that it had lost at least $400 million worth of NEM coins to hackers.The exchange's network was hacked on Jan. 25, and the attack went unnoticed for eight hours, according to Engadget.This gave hackers enough time to transfer around 500 million NEM coins, one of the lesser-known cryptocurrencies, illicitly off of the exchange from a "hot wallet," a type of storage that allows easy spending of cryptocurrency via the internet.Due to the unpredictable fluctuation in cryptocurrency value, the exact amount of money stolen is not precisely known or constant, but Coincheck and outside sources have estimated it to be above $400 million.Following the hack, the popular cryptocurrency exchange suspended trading in all tokens besides Bitcoin, suspended all withdrawals and stopped deposits into NEM coins, according to Bloomberg.Coincheck has promised to partially refund the 260,000 cryptocurrency investors affected by the theft, using its own capital, at a rate of 82 U.S. cents for each coin.The Coincheck hack is the largest cryptocurrency theft on record, surpassing the $400 million in bitcoin stolen from the Mt. Gox exchange in 2014.Many cryptocurrency exchanges operate with little to no regulation, and many have neglected essential practices that are standard in a professional financial services firm, such as cybersecurity.As a result, these exchanges have suffered numerous outages and hacks as Bitcoin and its ilk have risen in both value and prominence.The exponential growth of these coins has seemed to pique the interest of thieves, as the frequency of hacks against cryptocurrency exchanges has increased in recent years.According to CNN, last month, South Korean bitcoin exchange Youbit filed for bankruptcy after being targeted by cybercriminals twice within a few months. Hackers also stole $70 million worth of bitcoin from NiceHash, a digital currency trading platform based in Slovenia.Yvonne Zhang, who recently spoke on a panel on the future of cryptocurrencies at an Association of Futures Markets conference in Bangkok, claimed that the buyer alone is responsible for checking the quality and sustainability of goods before purchase, according to Bloomberg.If they fail to perform due diligence and understand exactly what it is that they are trading in, or fail to concern themselves with the risks involved, then, in light of this recent hack, they can only blame themselves.However, national governments do not seem to agree with this idea. They believe protecting the consumer is best, as they attempt to figure out how to regulate this cutting-edge industry. Each country is taking a different approach to the problem.China is home to the world's largest community of Bitcoin miners, but the country is trying to halt cryptocurrency activity.Last year, the government banned ICOs, initial coin offerings, which are the equivalent of initial public offerings for new cryptocurrencies.It called on Chinese-based exchanges to stop trading in cryptocurrencies, and laid out various proposals to discourage bitcoin mining, an energy intensive process integral to bitcoin, according to Bloomberg. Chinese companies abroad are also subject to the country's domestic ICO ban.Now, the Chinese government wants to target online platforms and mobile apps that allow centralized trading of cryptocurrency. China is not against cryptocurrency; the People's Bank has run trials of its own prototype coin, according to Bloomberg. Bitcoin and its peers, however, present both risk in the financial markets and another means of moving money out of China, which the government wants to prevent.The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, the country's largest regulator, has warned investors that if they invest in bitcoin, they should be prepared to lose their entire stake.In contrast, last year, Japan's government officially recognized bitcoin as a form of currency, and began to license cryptocurrency exchanges, according to CNN.  Japan is one of the world's biggest markets for cryptocurrencies, and policymakers have created a licensing system to increase oversight of local exchanges as a result.By introducing licenses, they are trying to avoid the Mt. Gox exchange collapse that affected cryptocurrency markets worldwide in 2014. The company went bankrupt, and its users still have not been compensated. Mt. Gox was based in Japan.According to Bloomberg, Coincheck was "four months past its deadline for receiving a license necessary to operate, as part of Japan's new legislature to vet and audit cryptocurrency exchanges. It was allowed to continue operating while awaiting a decision from the Financial Services Agency."The agency is getting ready to penalize Coincheck in relation to the hack. Japan is one of the more pro-cryptocurrency countries among the G-20, so it will be interesting to see how regulators act in response to this hack.Load-Date: February 5, 2018End of Document

Telecom experts scoff at leaked memo on 5G; Wireless industry blasts news that Trump officials may build networkUSA TODAYJanuary 30, 2018 TuesdayFINAL EDITIONCopyright 2018 Gannett Company, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: MONEY; Pg. 1BLength: 1049 wordsByline: Mike Snider, and David Jackson, USA TODAYBodyThe telecom industry wants this lightning-speed message to get to the U.S. government: We should build the nation's first 5G network, not you.Monday's response from the telecom industry to a leaked memo that revealed the U.S. administration was considering building its own 5G network to bring super-fast Internet to consumers and businesses -- a government effort designed to thwart what the administration and some lawmakers say is potential Chinese espionage -- was fast and pointed.The Republican-appointed head of the Federal Communications Commission, AT&T and an influential wireless trade group said the government should keep out of what's already a fast and furious effort to build the next generation of Internet, which promises Internet connections 10 to 100 times faster than current networks."The wireless industry agrees that winning the race to 5G is a national priority," Meredith Attwell Baker, president and CEO of CTIA, a group that counts AT&T, Verizon, Sprint and T-Mobile as members, said in a statement. "The government should pursue the free-market policies that enabled the U.S. wireless industry to win the race to 4G."5G wireless networks are expected to improve connectivity for smartphones and tablets and home broadband networks, as well as self-driving cars and an endless lineup of other  devices. They're one of the key ways carriers expect to differentiate themselves in the tight race to gain subscribers.Verizon and AT&T already have 5G trials operating, with initial deployment beginning this year and continuing in the months ahead.FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said that he opposed any federal proposal to run a national 5G network, instead recommending that the government support  ongoing industry projects."The main lesson to draw from the wireless sector's development over the past three decades -- including American leadership in 4G -- is that the market, not government, is best positioned to drive innovation and investment," he said. "Any federal effort to construct a nationalized 5G network would be a costly and counterproductive distraction from the policies we need to help the United States win the 5G future."The protests followed a report, first obtained and reported on by news site Axios, that the Trump administration is considering such a nationwide initiative, in part to prevent infiltration by China. The Trump national security team is in the early stages of deciding whether  to build and operate it, said a senior administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the person wasn't authorized to discuss internal deliberations on a national security issue.A presentation was recently made on the topic by a senior National Security Council official to senior administration officials, Axios said. A centralized, secure national 5G network could be built within three years and represent "the 21st century equivalent of the Eisenhower National Highway System," according to the memo acquired by Axios.The senior administration official told USA TODAY that the reported memo is an old one, but its stated strategy is correct. The goal is no secret, the official said, citing a line in the recently released national security strategy: "We will improve America's digital infrastructure by deploying a secure 5G Internet capability nationwide. These improvements will increase national competitiveness, benefit the environment and improve our quality of life."Another goal, the official said, is to thwart Chinese cyber espionage and beat them to the punch on 5G technology.Chinese tech companies seeking to do business in the U.S. increasingly have faced resistance from the Trump administration and some lawmakers, who have cited concerns about the potential for Chinese technology deployed in the U.S. to monitor and spy on the American public.Participants in an October 2017 workshop held by the Council on Foreign Relations suggested that Chinese access to U.S. networks and digital technology could strengthen that country's own cyber defenses while "sharpening its cyberattack potential" against U.S. infrastructure.This month, AT&T had been expected to announce it would make available Chinese-based phone maker Huawei's flagship Mate 10 Pro smartphone on its network in the U.S., but the plan was scrapped, reportedly because of U.S. pressure on AT&T to cut ties. As far back as October 2012, a congressional investigation voiced concerns that Huawei and ZTE, a Chinese telecommunications hardware maker, if allowed to provide equipment for U.S. infrastructure, could "undermine core U.S. national-security interests."This month, U.S. Rep. Mike Conaway, R-Texas, introduced legislation to prohibit the U.S. government from purchasing or leasing telecommunications equipment and/or services from Huawei and another Chinese firm ZTE.Conway told USA TODAY the legislation was meant to fend off Chinese government infiltration into U.S. networks."They're smart, they're aggressive, and they're not to be underestimated," he said. "I think all of us need to be concerned about the influences of the Chinese government on all those businesses."Also this month, the $1.2 billion sale of money-transfer service Moneygram to Ant Financial, an affiliate of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, was blocked by the U.S. committee that reviews foreign acquisitions of U.S. companies.China has denied that its companies are trying to install spyware."I don't think it's the intention of Chinese companies to sell their products in the USA for espionage," China's Ambassador Cui Tiankai told USA TODAY last week. "In terms of technology, the U.S. is still the most powerful, the most advanced country in the world. I don't think anybody can do anything that you cannot discover. At the same time, the U.S. is in position to do many things that we are not aware of."The U.S. administration official speaking on anonymity said it will be at least six to eight months before a recommendation reaches the president's  desk.FCC commissioners of both parties criticized the proposal. Commissioner Brendan Carr, a Republican, called the suggestion "a non-starter." And Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, agreed that the U.S. is in a race with other nations to deploy 5G, "but the remedy proposed here really misses the mark." Graphic photo LAURENT GILLIERON/EPA-EFELoad-Date: January 30, 2018End of Document

Contact.  The vice minister of the Chinese Cyberspace Administration, Zhuang Rongwen, today highlighted in the presentation of the summit the importance of this event in the development of a digital economy in China, one of the firm commitments of the Chinese president, Xi Jinping.  The deep integration of "big data" and artificial intelligence is already a reality in the daily life of Chinese citizens, in sectors such as education, administration or transport, he added.  More than 160 companies have already shown their interest in participating in this meeting, such as the Chinese technological giant Tencent or the main Chinese manufacturer of telecommunications equipment Huawei, although at the moment the organization has not confirmed the list of participants.  It is expected that this first digital summit in Fujian will become a platform for the exchange of knowledge between experts after the success of other meetings such as the World Summit on the Internet, whose fourth edition was held last December in the city of Wuzhen (east).  From the organization, they highlighted the enormous potential offered by "big data" services, especially in the development of a digital economy, which in China reached 30.3% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) in 2016. A Chinese government plan announced at the end of last year aims to turn the country into a leader in artificial intelligence by 2030 by applying these technologies to industry, urban planning, agriculture or defense.  In recent months the news on artificial intelligence has multiplied in China, as the use of smart glasses equipped with facial recognition by the Police with which you can access personal data and even police files of the people you see. Load-Date: March 22, 2018End of Document

'UNOFFICIAL' TIBETAN LANGUAGE SUMMIT DRAWS HUNDREDS OF ADVOCATES IN CHINA'S QINGHAIStates News ServiceJanuary 26, 2018 FridayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 581 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Hundreds of Tibetan language advocates from three provinces in China attended a conference on the Tibetan language and modern terminology on Thursday in a further bid by members of the minority group to protect their culture, a source from Tibet said.The "unofficial" conference, whose organizers did not seek permission for the event from Chinese authorities, was held at the Jonang sect of the Tashi Choeling Monastery in Chigdril (in Chinese, Jiuzhi) county, Golog (Guoluo) Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in northwest China's Qinghai province, said the source who declined to be named."Lay Tibetan men and women who took part in this Tibetan language conclave ranged in age from seven to 60 years," he told RFA's Tibetan Service."Particularly at this literary event, representatives from many Tibetan language associations that have sprung up voluntarily to promote Tibetan language in the past years also attended the gathering," he said.Language rights have become a particular focus for Tibetan efforts to assert national identity in recent years, with informally organized language courses typically deemed "illegal associations" and teachers subject to detention and arrest, sources say."Through the efforts of such grassroots language associations, many Tibetans have become literate through the help of volunteer teachers," said the source, adding that the instructors spend hours proving lessons on social media platform WeChat.Conference organizers also held competitions testing the memorization and usage proficiency of newly coined Tibetan terms listed in Tibetan encyclopedias, as well as competency in the everyday use of the language and phraseology, including new science and technology words, the source said. Awards were handed out to the winners.The language summit also featured scored Tibetan conversation and language competency competitions for which winners were given prizes, he said."The participants of this language conclave had frank and meaningful exchanges on the merits of continuing to advocate for Tibetan language literacy skills among the Tibetan community," he said. "They also explored ways to further improve their mission of promoting the Tibetan mother tongue in the future."There was a consensus among language advocates at the conference to end the use of a mixed language of Tibetan and Chinese in various Tibetan communities, because is it seen as diluting and undermining the standard Tibetan, the source said.Advocates for greater Tibetan cultural rights have been pressing Chinese government officials for wider use of the Tibetan language in schools in Tibetan-populated regions of China, though several have been jailed for their activities.Earlier this month, authorities in Qinghai's Yulshul (Yushu) Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture prosecuted Tibetan shopkeeper and language activist Tashi Wangchuk on charges of "inciting separatism" for his efforts to preserve and promote the use of his native language. He faces a possible 15-year prison term when the court reads its verdict at a later date.Writers, singers, and artists promoting Tibetan national identity and culture have frequently been detained by Chinese authorities, with many handed long jail terms, following region-wide protests against Chinese rule that swept Tibetan areas of China in 2008.Reported by Kunsang Tenzin for RFA's Tibetan Service.

After Years of Stealing American Trade Secrets and Jobs, China Must Face ConsequencesTargeted News ServiceMarch 22, 2018 Thursday 6:11 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 433 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Alliance for American Manufacturing issued the following news release:In response to China's lengthy record of intellectual property rights (IPR) violations, President Trump initiated actions on Thursday that are designed to hold Beijing accountable. The actions include proposed tariffs, a case at the World Trade Organization, and an investigation into Chinese investments in the United States.The announcement comes after an August order Trump signed that directed the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) to investigate China under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. A recent USTR report found that "the protection and enforcement of trade secrets in China is a serious problem" and highlighted concerns with the Chinese government and military infiltrating American computer systems "for the purpose of providing commercial advantages to Chinese enterprises."Violations of IPR by Beijing cost American jobs. American companies are restricted from exporting to China. The alignment of innovation, design, and production of advanced technology products becomes grossly distorted, and U.S.-based companies lose market share.A new Alliance for American Manufacturing (AAM) resource outlines the need for action due to years of China's forced technology transfer, discriminatory licensing restrictions, state-coordinated technology acquisition, and cyber-theft.Said AAM President Scott Paul:* "There's no disagreement that China cheats. The only question is, do we continue to ignore China's cheating or do we finally act decisively to stop it? The same experts who assured us China would reform when it entered the world trade system are now saying tariffs won't work.* "Companies that have benefited from shipping jobs to China are screaming the loudest. We shouldn't listen to any of these bogus complaints against tariffs. If China doesn't play by the rules, it should lose some access to the U.S. market, which it values the most.* "Manufacturers of everything from computers to metals have been forced to compete against the very products they spent years and significant financial resources to develop after Chinese companies illegally lifted proprietary knowledge.* "We have a large trade deficit in advanced technology products and an enormous goods trade deficit with China. We've lost millions of good jobs to China. The administration's proposed actions will help to restore some balance with China, as well as to recreate an ecosystem to innovate, design, and make products here that we can sell abroad."[Category: Manufacturing]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6215841 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: March 23, 2018End of Document

Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Tuesday, March 13th.Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the east coast.Trade concerns -- investor worries over tariffs weighed on big blue chip names yesterday like Boeing and Caterpillar. That dragged the Dow down better than 150 points, the Nasdaq still closed at a record level. That is the 15th straight record high for the Nasdaq, yesterday up a third of a percent.This morning, futures are indicating a higher opening for the broader averages. Dow Industrials set to be up about 50 points at the start of trading -- that's a quarter of a percent higher, as is the S&P 500 up a quarter of a percent. The Nasdaq also positive.We are waiting on the inflation data of the day. The February Consumer Price Index is out in an hour-and-a-half. And it's expected to show a gain of two-tenths of 1 percent. We will see what that tells us about the Fed and interest rate hikes the next Fed meeting on March 21.In Europe this morning markets are edging higher with the FT 100 up 2 points, the CAC 40 up half of a percent, 23 points higher, and the DAX index also higher by 18.In Asia overnight markets were mixed. The Shanghai and Hang Seng were lower but the Nikkei and the Kospi were higher.Battleground Pennsylvania today -- voters are headed to the polls in a key congressional district in yet another primary test for President Trump. Where things stand as voters head to the polls, right now polls are opening.Deal blocked -- President Trump orders Broadcom to end, cease its $117 billion hostile bid for rival Qualcomm. The President is citing national security concerns. We're breaking down the shocking move coming up.And earnings are in focus -- Dick's Sporting Goods set to hit the tape later this hour. We will bring you the numbers and any comments the company makes on its decision to raise the age to buy a firearm at all of its stores.Then has artificial intelligence figured out the location of Amazon's second headquarters. Here's a hint. It is not Chicago which the computer things will come in a close second. I'll tell you what the computer said.And then as one quarterback reportedly finds a new team, another proves yet again that he is the greatest of all time. We have a look at Case Keenan's mega deal and Tom Brady's chugging skills, coming up this morning.All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning. And joining me to break it all down Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, "The Wall Street Journal's" global economics editor Jon Hilsenrath and Kairos founder Ankur Jain is with us this morning. Good to see you.ANKUR JAIN, FOUNDER, KAIROS: Good morning.BARTIROMO: Good morning, everybody.JAIN: It's good to be here.BARTIROMO: So much news to discuss. Pennsylvania, Qualcomm deal blocked, Larry Kudlow is probably going to get the job, leading contender now for Gary Cohn's position. What is important to you?DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST: And Hillary Clinton in India reminding the American people who voted for Donald Trump why that happened in part. The "deplorables" comment, she clearly meant it. She essentially telling American women who did not vote for her that they were simply following what their husbands and their sons and their boyfriends telling them what to do.BARTIROMO: I don't understand. She's in India with Huma Abedin and she speaks to a group and just trashes what America just voted for while in India.MCDOWELL: She needs to go to anger management. Why she is not in anger management and still on the road, collecting fees, I don't know.BARTIROMO: Yes. She's still figuring out what happened?MCDOWELL: Donna Brazile needs to get on the horn and have a talk with her because she can damage the reputation of the Democratic Party even more than she has. This is not helpful.BARTIROMO: Yes.JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL": I'm going to be the dull guy at the table and say look at the CPI data that are coming in. At 8:30, the market's really focused on what's happening with inflation.Hillary Clinton aside, although she's very interesting.BARTIROMO: Yes. That's also a headliner. By the way, JP Morgan cutting the target price on General Electric to $11. Ouch that hurts. Bob Nardelli is not happy about that. He's one of our regulars. We're going to get his take.We're talking about all of that this morning.Coming up, joining the conversation, we have an exclusive interview this morning with the founder and chairman of Charles Schwab Corporation. He is Charles Schwab in the studio this morning. Plus the CEO of Discovery is here. David Zaslav is joining us as well. Kentucky Congressman Andy Barr is here. And the host of "HANNITY" -- Sean Hannity calling in as well. We're going to talk about that House Intel Committee saying there is no collusion, we are ending this probe.All that coming up.But first, voters are headed to the polls in Pennsylvania this morning in a special election that could provide some clues about the midterm season coming up.Connell McShane is on the ground. He is in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, south of Pittsburgh this morning where he's talking to some voters at Suzie B's Diner.Connell -- good morning to you.CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning to you -- Maria.Yes, it's a fascinating race for so many reasons which is why it's receiving so much national attention. If you know nothing else about the Pennsylvania 18th congressional district, remember that Donald Trump, the President, won in this district by nearly 20 points the last go-round.However the 33-year-old Democrat who's running against the Republican Rick Saccone on this special election has done a good job, according people close to his campaign of connecting with many of the union members, rank and file union members who went over and supported the President last time around. So the question here is going to be about turnout and who turns out to vote for who.So as you say we're out here talking to the people here ahead of the election. I have Clem having his breakfast and kind enough to take a bit of the wait from him. He's down to the coffee and sticking around to talk to us.You're for Saccone, right? Tell us why.CLEM, CANONSBURG VOTER: First of all, I'm a Trump fan, you know, because of the economy, because of things he stands for, but I'm a Democrat but I'm supporting the conservative movement.MCSHANE: It's an important thing to remember, Maria. The Democrats have a registration advantage here. They always have. It's largely driven by the unions. But you voted for Republicans. Have you done it for many years?CLEM: For a while, yes, for a while I've been voting Republican, yes.MCSHANE: And final thing, what do you think of the tariffs. These guys are talking about them all the time, the steel and aluminum tariffs and is that having an effect on the race to you think?CLEM: Well, it's going to have an effect. But it's a great thing. It's a long coming. It started back in the 40s. We gave it away.MCSHANE: All right. Clem -- thanks a lot. We appreciate it.CLEM: All right.MCSHANE: That's a good insight here from how people see this race. And if you poll the tariffs out here in this part of the country, Maria, they poll very, very well. They're quite popular.The President was here talking up those tariffs on Saturday night. We'll see what impact that has. But again, the Lamb campaign insists it has the momentum largely because it's been able to take some people like Clem and bring them over to their side.We'll see what happens. It should be an interesting race and the polls are now officially open.BARTIROMO: All right. We will check back. Connell -- thank you. Connell McShane in Pennsylvania this morning.Let's get back to our top story.President Trump issues an order blocking Broadcom's $117 billion take over of chip maker Qualcomm. The order says the takeover of the U.S.-based Qualcomm by the Singapore-based Broadcom could result in, quote, "action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States."I want to bring in national security advisor under former President George W. Bush, Stephen Hadley. Sir -- good to have you on the program this morning. Thanks very much for joining us.STEPHEN HADLEY, FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR: Nice to be here.BARTIROMO: How do you view this? Is there a national security risk, in your view?HADLEY: You know, the concern about this is that Qualcomm is at the corridor of the chip business that is going to link and enable, you know, a whole family of devices to talk to one another. It's critical technology.And I think it may be less about the Broadcom takeover and more ensuring that Qualcomm is able to make the investments so they can keep up with Huawei which is a Chinese-based competitor, which is a formidable competitor and the United States needs to have a strong American entry in this business.BARTIROMO: Yes. This is the point that Gordon Chang brought up a few minutes ago when he joined me at the top o the show saying that the idea was that Broadcom would acquire Qualcomm and break it up. And if it were to break it up, it can't possibly compete effectively with Huawei in China.HADLEY: Exactly. I think this is more about Huawei in some sense than it is about Qualcomm being a Singapore-based company.BARTIROMO: Having said that, you know, we all want free markets and there is some concern when you see the government blocking a deal and then you see the tariffs coming on. Do you worry about protectionism and the signs of nationalistic tendencies here in the U.S.?HADLEY: Of course we do. And everybody should. You know, the problem -- the fundamental problem is that there is an asymmetry between the U.S. market and the Chinese market. The Chinese market is increasingly closed, throwing up barriers to U.S. companies. And of course, the American market is quite open to Chinese investment.That asymmetry cannot go forward. Whether it was Hillary Clinton elected president or Donald Trump, it was going to have to be addressed.And so the trick here is to get the Chinese to open their markets so we can move in the directions of open markets with some protections of national security on both sides, rather than having both markets close down. That's the trick here.BARTIROMO: Well, I mean that's a big trick and I don't know that it's going to happen. The Chinese won't even allow a Ford Motor to go open a plant in China to sell to the Chinese without saying first give us all the technology in your car. First give us all the, you know, infrastructure and the secrets, if you will.Got a report here that says China's participation in venture deals, financing early stage technology companies to assess how large the overall investment is, they have contributed to a record level 7 percent to 10 percent of all venture deals done.So what should the President be doing now to slow down the aggressiveness of China in terms of acquiring our intellectual property in some of the most important industries of tomorrow, right -- AI, robotics, et cetera?HADLEY: Absolutely. He should do two things. One, what he is doing -- put this issue firmly on the table. Document the kind of practices by China that are a problem. Make sure this is clearly on the table.Secondly, challenge China to do something about it. China is going to announce soon March or April a new wave of reform and opening up. Hopefully that reform and opening up, which involves opening up to international companies like American companies, will involve some measures that will address these things.But we've got to get this issue resolved. We've got to put these issues on the table -- these Chinese practices on the table and then China needs to respond.BARTIROMO: All right. So before I leave this subject, you -- it sounds like you agree. This was the right move to block the Broadcom deal.HADLEY: I don't know all the details of it. One of the things that is a little troubling is that the CFIUS process, this interagency process headed by Treasury that looks at these deals had not yet completed its report. The President apparently, press reports say decided to act anyway.I'm a little concerned at the process here, you know, these are important transactions and I think there needs to be a deliberateness of this process so people understand that it's done on the merits, not for political reasons.BARTIROMO: Yes. Very good point.HADLEY: It's the one thing that bothers me a bit.BARTIROMO: All right. Well, we're going to check out that CFIUS process and why it wasn't standard.Let me turn to the wall -- building the wall. President Trump is headed to California today. First trip to California while he's president, he wants to personally assess eight prototypes for the border wall. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SARAH SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: I think that this is an important thing that the President has talked about, the safety and security of the country and strongly feels that the wall is a big part of that. And he's going to look at those prototypes.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: What's your take on the border wall at this point -- Stephen?HADLEY: Well, I don't know the details of the border wall. The President sometimes has said it's going to be a wall, sometimes he said it's going to be a combination of fencing and high tech things. But look --BARTIROMO: right. Depending on where it is -- that's right.HADLEY: The key thing is we've got to take control of our borders. You know, everybody has known really since President Bush tried to get immigration reform that it's got to start with securing the border, getting a handle on illegal immigration.Once you satisfy the American people that we've got a handle on that, you can begin to address the broader issues of immigration reform.But if we can't lock down the border, then we're not going to get there. We're going to be struggling with this issue for a long time to come. So, people are going to have to work out whether it's a wall, whether it's a fence, how we're going to pay for it. But the point is, we've got to get control of the border, got to get control of illegal immigration before we can address these broader issues.BARTIROMO: Stephen -- let me move on to the White House and this meeting. It announced it fully expects the unprecedented face-to-face meeting with North Korea leader Kim Jong-un and President Trump will happen. Pyongyang has yet to comment on it. What do you anticipate from these talks? How significant is this?HADLEY: Well, it's very significant. Look, I've been saying that I thought the Trump administration was doing a good job of setting the table for negotiations. What do I mean by that? Making it very clear that North Korea's nuclear program and ballistic missile program is a problem. Making it clear to China that it needs to be addressed, the status quo is not acceptable. Making it clear to North Korea that this is a problem and needs to be addressed. He's done that.The North Koreans have now paused their program. They say there will be no more testing of missiles or nuclear weapons pending these conversations. It's an opportunity now to begin a process.But I think, you know, one shouldn't put too much weight on this initial meeting that the President will have with Kim Jong-un. I think it will probably be a conversation, not a negotiation. They'll probably talk about a couple of principles.And I think what the President will do is make clear that there is good things there for North Korea in terms of normalization and maybe negotiating an end to the Korean War and potentially relations with the United States. Good things available to North Korea but only if it denuclearizes.BARTIROMO: Yes.HADLEY: I think that will probably be the theme. And If the President can make that point, then it's a meeting worth having.BARTIROMO: Yes, but are they really going to denuclearize?HADLEY: Well, that is a question. A lot of people think that at this point they won't. But they've put so much effort into it. And one doesn't know. What we have to do is test the proposition.BARTIROMO: Well, it certainly feels like the sanctions have been effective so far.Stephen Hadley -- good to see you, sir. Thank you very much.HADLEY: Nice to be with you. Thank you.BARTIROMO: And to you.Still ahead, the next chapter for Apple -- how the technology titan could transform the publication industry with the Netflix of magazines -- right here.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.An expert is casting doubt on the pilot's claim in Sunday's deadly helicopter crash in New York City.Cheryl Casone -- with all the details now -- Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes -- Maria.The pilot had told investigators he believed that a loose tether on one of the passenger's harnesses cut off the fuel switch and that also he chose to land in the East River instead of Central Park where he might have had a chance.But one expert says his theory about that tether is highly unlikely since the lever's on the floor next to the pilot's seat and it is normally fixed with a safety wire.The crash in the East River killed all five passengers aboard. This video shows the victims before the crash on Sunday. The victims included Texas firefighter, an Argentine woman and a video journalist.Well, President Trump hinting another tax cut bill could be on the way. The President speaking to Representative Kevin Brady of Texas yesterday in front of the cameras about that possibility as the Houston Astros visited the White House to celebrate their World Series victory.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Kevin -- are we going for an additional tax cut, I understand? Huh? He's the king of those tax cuts, yes.We're going to do a phase two. I'm hearing that. You hear that -- John and Ted? Phase two. We're actually very serious about that -- Kevin. So it's good.But Kevin Brady is a spectacular person and did a really incredible job with the tax cuts.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Ok. So that's the President. Brady we should say, did help write the GOP tax cut bill which slashed the corporate tax rate to 21 percent. We don't really know if there's plans right now for the Republicans to do a tax bill but you never know.All right. Apple is buying into the magazine business; not as a publisher, but as a distributor. It says it's buying the digital subscription app, Texture. This gives access to about 200 magazine subscriptions.Apple is ramping up their services business which already includes Apple music and of course the app store. Apple services business, by the way, grew more than 20 percent last year. Shares of Apple higher in the premarket just fractionally.And then finally this, a landmark victory for a lottery winner who wanted to remain an anonymous. A New Hampshire woman calling herself Jane Doe filed a lawsuit against the lottery commission there after she won nearly $560 million. She didn't want her name to be made public. Well, the judge ruling that the amount of unwanted attention and harassment she would receive vastly outweighed the public's need to know her identity.The anonymous winner reportedly jumping with excitement, happy that she can live her life normally. And also experts say if you do win that $100 or $500 million prize, Maria, sign it not with your name but establish a trust first, then sign it, and then you won't have to go to court and just walk away with your $500 million.BARTIROMO: Wow. Well, yes. Listen I'm glad that she has the privacy that she wanted. What do you guys think?HILSENRATH: I'm not sure a person who wins the lottery is going to know how to establish a trust before you sign it.BARTIROMO: Yes, I know. That's true. They get so excited. You just want to get the money.(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: That's a segment. We'll be doing --JAIN: That's right.HILSENRATH: You should start a company to advise people who win the lottery.JAIN: We've got a huge market size right there.BARTIROMO: Right.MCDOWELL: Tell no one and watch Fox Business. We'll be doing segments in the coming weeks on how to establish a trust if you win the lottery.JAIN: Maria Bartiromo, chief lottery winner advisor --BARTIROMO: Oh, ok.All right. Coming up, Yahoo in the legal cross hairs -- why a judge is allowing lawsuits to go forward over the company's massive data breach that left three billion users exposed.And did artificial intelligence find Amazon a new home? The prime real estate for the company's second headquarters -- next.BARTIROMO: So where will Amazon choose its next headquarters. Wells Fargo's artificial intelligence system has its guess.Lauren Simonetti with all the details now -- Lauren.LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes. So the sweepstakes for Amazon's second headquarters and the $5 billion investment and 50,000 high-paying jobs that come with it continues.The predicted winner is Boston -- yes, that's according to a robot.So this is the story.Wells Fargo, an analyst there, helped develop an AI system that he calls Aiera that could essentially replace him by doing research and analysis. The AI uses algorithms. It reads articles. It scans social media to understand what moves a stock.And Amazon is one of the stocks that Aiera analyzes. So it thinks, and here you go, Boston will score Amazon's new headquarters, Chicago in second place, Atlanta in third place.But here's the new concern about Atlanta. Delta, major airline there, decided to stop the NRA discounts and Georgia's threat to eliminate the jet fuel sales tax exemption could make Amazon walk away.Either way, let's go back to Boston, the top pick here. Amazon executives were actually visiting Boston last week. The city totally pitching themselves as an old city with new ways of doing things, great transportation, tons of universities, and really a top city for fostering innovation and entrepreneurial growth.The robot, Aiera, tried to make science out of all of this but the more unscientific studies indicate that Washington, D.C., which of course is home to Jeff Bezos who is Amazon's CEO, "The Washington Post" that D.C. is the favorite to win. We'll get a decision sometime this year.I don't know. What do you guys think?BARTIROMO: I thought it was going to be Washington because of that. Because of Jeff Bezos.SIMONETTI: That's what most people say.BARTIROMO: But Dagen -- you make a good point, expensive real estate.MCDOWELL: I don't understand why a CEO would subject all of those employees to the ridiculous real estate prices and the horrific commute that would probably be involved in putting it somewhere outside of the Washington, D.C. area. I think it will be Virginia.D.C. now starts at Richmond. That's how big the suburbs of Washington are.HILSENRATH: So what matters more to Jeff Bezos is his own home value? And his own conveniences?(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: You know what?BARTIROMO: I don't so. No. I don't think that's going to be --(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: If you're one of the richest man in the world --JAIN: The richest man in the world.MCDOWELL: -- and work in multiple --BARTIROMO: Yes. The richest, you're right.MCDOWELL: Right. So you're not going to worry about the value of your house.HILSENRATH: I don't mean he values his own but --MCDOWELL: I mean he could literally not insure it and set it on fire and burn it to the ground and it wouldn't matter.HILSENRATH: Right. Yes. I mean the political value he gets of having an Amazon headquarters' there when Amazon is facing potentially anti-trust issues --JAIN: Yes. I mean think about the other side though. I mean you get I think more political value creating that many jobs in a red state right now where everything that Amazon's focused on -- I mean Washington, Seattle where I'm from is obviously a blue state. Boston is a very, you know, Massachusetts is a very blue state. So I think despite the NRA issue, I actually think you'll see Amazon ending up in Atlanta.MCDOWELL: Well, I though it was going to be -- the research triangle of North Carolina which is again kind of a purple state at this point or Orlando.JAIN: Right now, I'm just -- I'm pushing for Atlanta here. But these guys -- Atlanta also has all the logistics expertise. You've got Pepsi. You've got UPS. You've got Delta. You know, Amazon --(CROSSTALK)JAIN: Yes. I mean just for these guys, I think you've got an opportunity to create jobs in a red state, be on the opposite coast and have the talent from both the technology side and the logistics side. So we'll see.HILSENRATH: Well I mean this comes down to what's in this program. How does the program decide?BARTIROMO: Yes. What are the --SIMONETTI: It's very complicated.(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: The program is a Patriots fan.SIMONETTI: It uses algorithms but there's much beyond that. It also looks at how media bias, you know, so this publication mentioned this a million times and it moved the stock. So it kind of analyzes all of that together.JAIN: It thinks that it's (INAUDIBLE) and the stock will go up most.SIMONETTI: Kind of.BARTIROMO: Lauren -- thank you. Thank you so much.Coming up, a multibillion dollar bet that content is king. Discovery wraps up its acquisition of Scripps Network, bringing HGTV and Food Network under the Discovery roof, under one roof.I will talk with Discovery CEO and president David Zaslav on how the new powerhouse plans to take on the competition in companies like Netflix.And then chuck like a champion.

Good Tuesday morning everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, March 13th, your top stories right now, 7:30 a.m. on the East Coast.Investors are watching and waiting on inflation numbers, Futures indicating a gain at the start of trading this morning with the Dow Industrials up 50 points the NASDAQ up about 10 points.We are waiting on the Consumer Price Index it is out in one hour from now it's expected to show a gain month-over-month of two tenths of one percent. This comes after a mixed performance yesterday for the market, the Dow and the S&P 500 edged lower, take a look at the Dow down a hundred and fifty- seven yesterday but the NASDAQ closed at an all-time high, again the 15th all-time high this year for the NASDAQ.In Europe this morning a bit of a bid under the market, take a look FT 100 is lower but the CAC krone in Paris is up a third of a percent and the DAX Index is up a fraction; stocks edging lower in London.In Asia overnight mix performances with the Japanese market and the Korean market higher so Chinese and Hong Kong markets lower.The `Property Brothers' have a new home, "Discovery" has completed its acquisition of "Scripps Network Interactive" in a deal valued at $14.6 billion including the assumption of debt, the merger creates a programming powerhouse with shows like "Shark Week" and "Chopped" now under the same roof. The combined company will now simply be known as "Discovery Inc."Joining me right now in this exclusive is CEO and President of "Discovery Inc.," David Zaslav.(BEGIN AUDIOTAPE)David, it's great to see you.DAVID ZASLAV, PRESIDENT & CEO & PRESIDENT DISCOVERY INC.: Hi Maria, good morning.BARTIROMO: Congratulations.ZASLAV: Oh, thanks so much.BARTIROMO: This is a really big deal it gives you all of the real time - lifetime channels out there, tell me about the opportunity?ZASLAV: So, for us we think that there is a real chance for us to be a major player around the world in real life entertainment or nonfiction so you have scripted and movies on one side and then you have news and sports and in the middle is us between "Food," "HG," "Oprah," "Discovery," "Animal Planet," we now have 18 channels about 20 percent of viewership on TV and these are channels people love.So, if you, you know, if you love science, we have a "Science Channel," if you love "Oprah," you love "Food," we have "Cooking," or "Food," "HG" so we kind of bring together most of the quality brands in America but from our perspective may be more importantly we own all that content everywhere in the world.And so, as a global IP company you know, with companies like Apple, and Amazon, looking at the world and Facebook and Google more globally we know now brands and content all over the world that people love.BARTIROMO: Yes. You're right and you know, it's a couple of things you said there. First of all, the shows really do represent like your best friend. I mean you - this is sort of you know, destination television whether it's the "Food Channel" or for you know, the - "Home and Garden," "HG" so it's - it's seeing across the world.I want to ask you about "International" because that's - that's one thing that has been a big driver of "Discovery" success?ZASLAV: Sixty percent of our company right now, 65 percent of our revenues is outside the U.S. and so, one of the big opportunities with "Scripps" they have really great brands and really great content but they haven't taken it around the world and so - and they - and they own all their content so the first thing we'll do is we'll take all that "Food," "HG," cooking content around the world.But maybe more importantly the big play for all of us in media is who is going to get on the devices and the mobile screens, there are 2 billion mobile screens, there's 5 billion devices and who is going to get on those and we think that instead of people watching "Homeland" or "The Crown" on their phone they're going to want to find - they're going to want to watch content that they love that's also kind of functional so content around food, around home, around science, inspirational content from "Oprah," we think that content can work very well on mobile devices.And that's - that's' the real territorial grab, who is going to be able to make that transition.BARTIROMO: Do you still have to do it in sort of short snippets? I mean the last time we spoke you were saying that people do watch things on their phone but it's a smaller screen and it means that it's got to be shorter so do you look at this in terms of long-form content or shorter you could break up some of the content in shorter snippets for the mobile phone?ZASLAV: No. It's both.BARTIROMO: Yes.ZASLAV: But you know, last time we were here I was talking about this company, we bought a few companies and put it together as "Group Nine," where we do about 8 billion views a month at short form content for Facebook."Scripps" within the "Food" category is the leader in short form and so we really have a menu. If you love food we have - we have "Food," we have "Cooking," we have "Leader" in short form and part of our ambition is you know, not can we own the TV set in the "Food" category but could we own the kitchen, could we own it with Amazon where you would walk-in and you'd say to Alexa, `here's what I want for dinner' and you could see it long-form from the best cooks, maybe short-form, you'd get a recipe, it could get delivered from Whole Foods; could we own it with Samsung?BARTIROMO: Yes.ZASLAV: You know, the - it's - we have real functional IP and we're very different than everyone else. Most media companies are in their openings, their red carpet, they have the big stars you know, that's over to the right and it's very, very competitive.You know, if you look at Netflix and Amazon, they're competing it's one of the reasons why Rupert with - and James and Lachlan -BARTIROMO: Right.ZASLAV: - with "21ST CENTURY FOX" say you know what, that's a very competitive environment, scripted TV and scripted movies and it's really getting disintermediated by Amazon and Netflix.So, we're very happy that, that environment is extremely competitive and be - and disrupted.BARTIROMO: Getting more competitive, yes.ZASLAV: And we think that our area of owning global IP in - with - and brands people love in - and with a real experience and taking that content in 45, 48 languages around the world -BARTIROMO: Wow.ZASLAV: - you know, could - we could really be a differentiated play. We could even be a play direct-to-consumer.BARTIROMO: So how does that work, direct-to-consumer, how would you do that and talk to us a little bit about what's going on in terms of the Amazon element here? You know, Netflix an Amazon willing to pay upwards of 8, $10 billion for new content, your content is going to be content that people want, they are originating their own content -ZASLAV: Right.BARTIROMO: - now.ZASLAV: Well look, the - when I talk about disruption in this area of scripted movies and scripted TV that's always been the coolest, sexiest area of media and that's where most of the big media companies are but now you look at Amazon paying 6 billion a year in content and Netflix eight, that could easily be 10 and 10, 10 and 12, the way that those companies are valued is much different than traditional media.Traditional media is a multiple free cash flow EBITDA, the multiple that Netflix or Amazon gets is huge and so they could spend anything and they are, they're buying talent, they're buying producers, they're over bidding for movies and it's one of the reasons why you see on that side of the ledger a lot of a challenge.The thing for us is right now if you pay $10.00 you can get Netflix, if you get Amazon, you get Amazon prime, $15.00 HBO but all those services look very similar, they're movies and scripted content. We could take all of our content together, "Discovery," "Food," "Amazon"- "Discovery," "Food," "HG," "Animal Planet," "Oprah," "Science," "Cooking"-BARTIROMO: Incredible brands.ZASLAV: - we could put that altogether and we could make - we can make a global offering for $6.00, $7.00 and you know, it - we would be different. If people want movies and scripted, you've got these five players.BARTIROMO: Right.ZASLAV: If you want something different that you love - and people come home, they put "HG" on, they watch it all day -BARTIROMO: Right.ZASLAV: - or "Food," or "Discovery" so we like - we like our hand, we think that we have real ownership, of differentiated global content and now we have to figure out if we can get that on to the devices or if we can get it direct-to-consumer.BARTIROMO: And the telecom companies are still there trying to fight for their place and distribution. You've got AT&T trying to acquire Time Warner, what's your take on that and how that fits into how things are changing?ZASLAV: Well I think it's - it says that IP, the content, is really important -BARTIROMO: Right.ZASLAV: - and you're right about the mobile players around the world because on top of the big - the big four, you've got Google and Facebook and Apple and Amazon as big distributors of content but then under them are the big mobile and cable players.This AT&T is very important because AT&T is looking to buy content, not only does it reinforce the value of what we have but it's a real fight between the big companies, the Amazons and the Netflixs (ph), that right now in Google that are playing kind of unrestricted around the world and here's AT&T, are they going to be able to buy content to compete.And so, I'm rooting for them -BARTIROMO: Yes.ZASLAV: - I think that in the end consolidation of content is important or the whole - the whole industry could get disrupted by these big four companies that have so much global scale, I mean in my lifetime -BARTIROMO: Yes.ZASLAV: - we've never seen a company like an Amazon -BARTIROMO: Right.ZASLAV: - we've never seen companies aggregate like Facebook, 2 billion, that could be a very good thing, those are great companies but we - you know, we need to make sure -BARTIROMO: Yes.ZASLAV: - that there's some stability and I think any government regulation creates challenges to the environment.BARTIROMO: Well which is why you're seeing this administration get tougher on Tech. You know, we've got the trial next week on AT&T Time Warner but you've also got whispers of you know, these companies are more powerful than they've ever been before, they know everything about us and maybe they deserve a higher regulatory scrutiny. Do you think that's where this is going?ZASLAV: Well I certainly think that they've gotten this `we're the sexiest, coolest guy, at the dance and so everything we do is great.'BARTIROMO: Yes.ZASLAV: And you know, under the radar, they've now emerged, these companies as so massive but first starting to understand what that scale means -BARTIROMO: Right.ZASLAV: - you know, so I'm - from my perspective I just think it's important if we - if over the next couple of years we felt we needed to get bigger or if the big cable guys felt like they needed to need own more content or they needed to own more scale to compete, all of that is good because on top of them are these massive companies that are moving chips around the - around the world with scale that we've never seen before.BARTIROMO: It's incredible actually so what's your take on today's news that President Trump has blocked the Singapore-based Broadcom, proposed takeover of Qualcomm. The president is citing national security concerns and it's ending what was touted as `\technology is - industry - `the Tech industry's biggest deal ever,' what's your take?ZASLAV: You know, Technology is not my thing but we have been in business in China for 15 years and it's a massive opportunity but it's the one country that were in business with and we're in business in 220 countries where we can't launch our own channels.So, we're one of the largest providers of content to the - to the public broadcasters in China but when our content airs you see our content but you don't see our brand and so -BARTIROMO: Hm.ZASLAV: - it is a - it's a big opportunity, it's also market that's very careful and very restricted so I think that's something that - that's important to look at because if China becomes a - an open market, it will be a big opportunity for media and a lot of companies.On the other hand, you know, there's a lot of closure of that market to outside companies particularly U.S. companies -BARTIROMO: Right.ZASLAV: - right now.BARTIROMO: Because like a Ford wants to open a plant you've got to first give your technology to the Chinese government but you've operated there, it's been fine for you but it is a tight situation?ZASLAV: It's a challenge -BARTIROMO: Yes.ZASLAV: - and it's not that different. In a sense they're using our IP but we don't get to build our assets and our brands in China and it's something that we are working on -BARTIROMO: Yes.ZASLAV: - the thing that's helping us in China now is this - the new technologies over the top, being able to reach people directly -BARTIROMO: Yes.ZASLAV: - but it's still a market that is very carefully monitored by the Chinese government.BARTIROMO: Real quick before you go, do you expect the advertisers are going to like what they see here, what kind of - what can you tell us about the environment right now in terms of advertising, what you're expecting from these new brands that you can offer now?ZASLAV: Well - you know, we go to our upfront, we'll go as one company but when you put "HG" and "Food" and "ID" and "TLC" and "Animal Planet" and "Oprah" all together we have six or seven of the top 10 or 11 channels and we have four of the top five channels so if you add those all up on a given night, we can deliver you know, what a broadcast network and sometimes twice what a broadcast network can deliver with great demographics and passionate viewers for each of those brands.So, we think we have a great story and we're going to hit the upfront in May and June and I think we're going to do quite well.BARTIROMO: That's a great growth story. David, thanks so much for coming in.ZASLAV: OK, thanks Maria.BARTIROMO: Congratulations to you on the closing of the deal.David Zaslav.We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Another `Primary' test for President Trump and the Republican Party. Polls are now open in Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District. Joining me right now is the Republican Candidate, Rick Saccone.Good to see you sir. Thanks very much for joining us.RICK SACCONE (R), PENNSYLVANIA STATE REPRESENTATIVE, AIR FORCE VETERAN & NOMINEE FOR U.S. HOUSE: Thanks Maria. A pleasure to be on with you.BARTIROMO: A big day for you, we're watching the developments and it is important to not just for you and the 18th District but for Congress and this president. How are you feeling?SACCONE: Feeling great. It's all about getting out the vote and hey, I'm telling you viewers, "Everybody get out and vote today, wake up, come on people." We've got to turn out our people, if they turn out we win.BARTIROMO: All right let me ask you to make the sales pitch here Rick because a lot of people are wandering really what the reason is in terms of your policies what you're going to do. Tell me why you believe you're the guy?SACCONE: Well I've - I was elected on the same agenda that President Trump was elected on, cutting taxes, cutting spending, rolling back regulations that are strangling our businesses, repealing or replacing Obamacare, rebuilding our military, taking care of our veterans, protecting our Second Amendment rights, protecting our unborn children, securing the border, supporting our law enforcement, all those things are things that have been working on in the state legislature for eight years.President Trump has nationalized those and I want to - she needs some help down here, he's getting beat up in Washington as you see from the media and from the bureaucracy and from Hollywood and he needs a good wing-man, as an old Air Force guy, I want to go down there and protect his `six' and help him implement that very agenda.BARTIROMO: Well what's at stake? I mean people are wandering what this means for them in terms of job creation, how are you actually going to move the needle in terms of economic growth in your district?SACCONE: Oh, come on now. Look at the - the needle has already been moved, the president - we have the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years, the - you know, record job growth, it's amazing what's going on and we're just getting started so there's a lot more to come.I think as a president moves forward with his agenda you're going to see the economy - the economy is roaring, look at your 401(k), mine's doing pretty well, I imagine yours is too so the people are seeing the improvements, the bonuses, the great tax-cut program, the - bill that was passed, small businesses are expanding, they are hiring more people, they are giving bonuses and raises to their - to their employees -BARTIROMO: Right.SACCONE: - they're adding to their 401(k)s I mean so much good is happening and we've just got to keep that up.BARTIROMO: But you've got to do more than what the president has done. I mean Connor Lamb has gotten the memo of what's important to people as well and he's trying to sell a similar story and trying to sell this idea that he is for the Second Amendment, he is for job creation, he's going to help economic streets - families out there so how do you differentiate yourself? Because we know what the president has done.SACCONE: Well Conor the chameleon has tried to be both sides of every issue but we've outed him and we've - he tried to be for the Second Amendment but we know he's not and I am the A+ rated NRA, Life-Benefactor Member.He started off saying he was pro-life but we know he's not and now he's come out and said he's pro-choice and so on every issue just going down the - issue-by-issue, we've seen that he really when - if you were to get there he would vote with Nancy Pelosi and the Democratic Party along with everybody else.Remember not one Democrat voted for that tax-cut bill and Conor Lamb would've been right with them on that, he said so, so we've outed him and I think people are waking up and they're seeing that he's trying to disguise himself as a moderate but he's as far left, we've got Steady Hoyer (ph) out there, Mike Doyle -BARTIROMO: Right.SACCONE: - Martin O'Malley, all the liberals have been out to help him, our Governor, Tom Wolf, the most liberal governor in America, they're all supporting -BARTIROMO: Right.SACCONE: - him so people have seen that.BARTIROMO: What can you tell us about the re-districting that has taken place and how that changes the makeup of the state?SACCONE: Yes. You know, the Supreme Court, our state Supreme Court has gerrymandered the district more than it was - more than what they were complaining about, it's unbelievable and -BARTIROMO: Yes.Saccone a: - they immediately gerrymandered me out of my district by a mile so this is - it's - it's throwing a monkey-wrench into the system but -BARTIROMO: Sure.SACCONE: - you know, we'll get through it, we're - we're still fighting that.BARTIROMO: Congressman, we'll be watching, we know how important it is.Thanks so much for joining us this morning.SACCONE: Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Congressman Rick Saccone, joining us there.We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Well come back.Brackets revealed for the Women's NCAA Tournament, no surprise who the number one overall seed is, Jared Max with the story, Jared?JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTSCASTER: Maria, good morning.The University of Connecticut is the only team in the NCAA Tournament that did not lose a game this season, perfect 32-0 so the 11-time national champs, coached by Geno Auriemma are the top seed in this year's tournament, UConn going for a fifth title in six years; other top seeds, Notre Dame, Louisville, and Mississippi State.First four tips off tonight, freebie games in the men's bracket, winner of LIU Brooklyn-Radford plays Villanova next, while the Florida Gators await the winner of UCLA and St. Bonaventure.Four months since the Houston Astros won their first World Series at a most welcomed time in the wake of hurricane Harvey, the team was honored with a trip to the White House yesterday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: All of the players and staff, congratulations on your incredible victory.

China's ZTE: We must do more to reassure US officialsCNN WireFebruary 26, 2018 Monday 1:04 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 546 wordsByline: By Sherisse PhamDateline: HONG KONG (CNNMoney) BodyHONG KONG (CNNMoney) --  One of China's biggest tech companies says it needs to step up efforts to win over US intelligence agencies. ZTE, which makes smartphones and builds mobile networks, must make "more effort to build the trust among the people in Washington," said Lixin Cheng, CEO of the company's mobile devices business. "We need to do more." Top officials from the FBI, CIA and NSA testified before Congress this month that ZTE and Huawei, another Chinese smartphone maker, pose a security threat to American customers. "We understand the concerns, and respect the concerns of different agencies of the United States government," Cheng said in an interview with CNN's Kristie Lu Stout at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. "We promise we are going to work very openly, as we did before, [and] transparently to address their needs and their concerns." Those concerns include the risk of letting companies "beholden to foreign governments" inside the US telecommunications infrastructure, FBI Director Chris Wray testified. ZTE and Huawei's alleged ties to the Chinese government were the subject of a US House Intelligence Committee report in 2012 that focused on the equipment they make for telecommunications networks. The report said the companies "cannot be trusted to be free of foreign state influence and thus pose a security threat to the United States and to our systems." The Chinese companies strongly disputed the report's findings.Despite being largely shut out of the US market for telecommunications equipment, ZTE has managed to build a steady following for its smartphones among American consumers.With budget devices priced between about $100 and $250, ZTE had 11% of the US smartphone market in the fourth quarter of 2017, according to the latest data from market research firm Counterpoint Technology. That makes ZTE the fourth biggest smartphone supplier in the US.Cheng said ZTE earned that market share by spending years building trust with the US telecom industry. The company first started investing in the US market in 1998.Unlike Huawei, ZTE has managed to sell its phones through the four major wireless carriers -- AT&T, Verizon, Sprint and T-Mobile -- which is key to making inroads in the US.Those relationships only developed over the past two years, according to Cheng."We have been working very hard to earn their trust," including by meeting their requirements in terms of cybersecurity and privacy, he said. Losing the trust of those carriers would be a huge blow to ZTE's smartphone business. Huawei has been trying to crack the market for years. It almost clinched a deal with AT&T in January, but talks "fizzled out at the last minute," a person familiar with the matter told CNN at the time. Lacking that crucial carrier support has cost Huawei: it has less than 1% of the US smartphone market, according to research firm Kantar Worldpanel.Despite the current political headwinds, ZTE remains bullish on its future in the world's largest economy. He cited Chinese basketball icon Yao Ming as an example ZTE would like to follow -- competing on the global stage, earning the respect of competitors and winning the hearts of local communities.TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

The company first started investing in the US market in 1998.Unlike Huawei, ZTE has managed to sell its phones through the four major wireless carriers -- AT&T, Verizon, Sprint and T-Mobile -- which is key to making inroads in the US.Those relationships only developed over the past two years, according to Cheng."We have been working very hard to earn their trust," including by meeting their requirements in terms of cybersecurity and privacy, he said.Losing the trust of those carriers would be a huge blow to ZTE's smartphone business.Huawei has been trying to crack the market for years. It almost clinched a deal with AT&T in January, but talks "fizzled out at the last minute," a person familiar with the matter told CNN at the time.Lacking that crucial carrier support has cost Huawei: it has less than 1% of the US smartphone market, according to research firm Kantar Worldpanel.Despite the current political headwinds, ZTE remains bullish on its future in the world's largest economy.He cited Chinese basketball icon Yao Ming as an example ZTE would like to follow -- competing on the global stage, earning the respect of competitors and winning the hearts of local communities.Load-Date: February 27, 2018End of Document

China Infrastructure "Magician" StackData Set a New World Record for IDC IndustryPR NewswireJanuary 8, 2018 Monday 10:08 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 803 wordsDateline: BEIJING, Jan. 8, 2018 BodyRecently, Chinese Infrastructure "Magician" StackData Co.

China Market Report Suite for Patient Monitoring Equipment 2017 - ResearchAndMarkets.comBusiness WireFebruary 1, 2018 Thursday 8:26 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Business Wire, Inc.Distribution: Business EditorsLength: 566 wordsDateline: DUBLIN BodyThe "China Market Report Suite for Patient Monitoring Equipment 2017 - MedSuite" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.As the patient monitoring device and equipment market evolves to become more efficient, less costly and more comfortable for patients and healthcare professionals alike, a shift from old equipment and technologies to new technologies is essential. Moreover, as patients are shifted out of hospitals and into alternate care sites to save costs, patient monitoring devices will accompany them. Patient monitoring is also increasingly becoming more mobile and prevalent in the home because of various forces that are driving cost-saving measures and the adherence to more preventative and re-admission-averse care models.The Chinese market is still undergoing frequent and drastic changes in terms of regulations, shaped by efforts to contain the growing healthcare budget and increase market transparency. Specifically, in some markets, the prices are being directly reduced by the government. For example, it was announced that pricing for surgical devices is aimed to be reduced by 15% to 25%. Furthermore, the Chinese healthcare tender system is also directly controlled by the government, and changes every two to four years. Therefore, if the Chinese government suddenly decides to give more tenders to a local low-cost producer, then the ASP of the entire market segment will decline accordingly.The high-end healthcare market will extend into lower-tier cities, while main customer groups, on which key specialties focus, will shift from middle- to high-end customers. At the same time, services that integrate medical services with tourism are also expected to grow. Meanwhile, with hospital reform, particularly with increased medical professional mobility, private hospitals will be able to enter the premium healthcare segment that previously held high technical barriers.Report Contents• Market Analyses include: Unit Sales, ASPs, Market Value & Growth Trends• Market Drivers & Limiters for each chapter segment• Competitive Analysis for each chapter segment• Section on recent mergers & acquisitionsCompanies Mentioned• Mindray• Philips Healthcare• CONTEC Medical• GE Healthcare• Omron Healthcare• Edan• A&D Medical• Medtronic• NCC Medical• COMEN• Masimo• St.Jude Medical• A&D Medical• Alliance Technology• Ambu• AMD Global Telemedicine• Bionet• Biotronik• Bistos• CONTEC Medical• Fukuda Denshi• Guangdong Biolight Meditech• Healicom• HUATO Systems• Joymed Tech• King Pigeon• Leyte Electronic• Maya Medical• Medsinglong• Mediana• MT Medical• Sejoy Electronics• Sunbright• Welch Allyn• Zencro IndustrialKey Topics Covered:1.

Under Trump, the US government gives many foreign deals a closer lookCNN WireMarch 16, 2018 Friday 4:11 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 855 wordsByline: By Julia HorowitzDateline: NEW YORK (CNNMoney) BodyNEW YORK (CNNMoney) --  President Donald Trump shocked the business world this week when he shut down a major technology deal because of national security concerns.It was an unusual move. But it also fit an emerging pattern.The US government is looking much more closely at corporate tie-ups that could give foreign companies access to sensitive technology, or the personal data of Americans. That's evident from information coming out of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS. The secretive inter-agency panel vets certain deals that could give a foreign investor control of a US business."They are reviewing more deals than ever before," said Anne Salladin, an attorney at Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, and a former Treasury Department counsel who advised on CFIUS matters. "No question."CFIUS, which is chaired by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, doesn't publicly list all the cases it places under a national security review, and is usually tight-lipped about its considerations.But people who track CFIUS activity note that it's paying extra attention to two types of deals: Those that involve certain tech products, like semiconductors, and those that involve Chinese investors.The government increasingly views the high tech space as a place where the US needs to stay ahead in order to protect against bad foreign actors. And the United States recently identified China one of the country's biggest threats.A record number of Chinese deals were delayed or abandoned in 2017 as parties failed to receive approval from CFIUS, according to a January report by Rhodium Group, a New York-based research firm.The report said that CFIUS "seems to have broadened its approach for reviewing Chinese deals," and is taking state efforts to obtain certain technologies and data protection concerns into greater account.Such concerns came up when CFIUS appraised Broadcom's $117 billion bid for Qualcomm. The panel expressed worry that if the two chip makers merged, the United States would fall behind the Chinese in the development of 5G, the next generation of wireless technology that will be integral to the rollout of self-driving cars and smart cities.Regulators said they had reason to believe that the company, which reincorporated in Singapore a few years ago, would prioritize short-term profits over long-term investment in 5G research."Given well-known U.S. national security concerns about Huawei and other Chinese telecommunications companies, a shift to Chinese dominance in 5G would have substantial national security consequences for the United States," a Treasury Department official wrote in a letter to both companies last week.On Monday, Trump issued an order blocking the deal, claiming to have "credible evidence" that Broadcom and its affiliates "might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States."The intervention by CFIUS was "very, very unusual," said Brian Fleming, an attorney at Miller & Chevalier who worked in the Justice Department's national security division under both Trump and former President Barack Obama.The body does not normally interfere in deals that haven't been finalized by the companies themselves. Qualcomm rejected Broadcom's initial offer, but had warmed to the takeover, and was preparing to decide whether to move forward with the acquisition when the government put the process on hold.CFIUS' involvement shows that "potentially losing ground to the Chinese in that area is viewed as a pretty significant and high-priority concern," Fleming said.Broadcom-Qualcomm isn't the only high-profile deal to be scuttled this year as a result of CFIUS scrutiny. In January, Moneygram called off its merger with Ant Financial, an affiliate of Jack Ma's Alibaba, after the money transfer service failed to get a green light from CFIUS.Deals with Chinese backers haven't been cut off entirely.When Trump visited China in November, he announced more than $250 billion in deals with Chinese President Xi Jinping. One was an $84 billion plan from state-owned China Energy Investment Corp. to invest in shale gas and chemical manufacturing projects in West Virginia. Another project would invest as much as $43 billion in Alaska's energy sector.In general, though, foreign companies - both with and without Chinese ties - now view a CFIUS review with greater apprehension than they did several years ago, Fleming said. And CFIUS is poised to get even more powerful. A bill in Congress that would expand the authority of CFIUS has bipartisan support and the backing of top Trump administration officials (though it faces tough lobbying from businesses, according to one of its sponsors).Daniel Rosen, a partner at Rhodium Group, said the US government needs to communicate its changing expectations so as not to chill foreign investment."The burden is on Washington now to redraw those lines so the commercial sector knows what the rules are," he said.

China: Two Journalists Lose People's Congress Accreditation Over 'Eye Roll'Targeted News ServiceMarch 19, 2018 Monday 1:17 PM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 396 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: BRUSSELS, Belgium BodyThe International Federation of Journalists issued the following news release:On March 13, Zhang Huijun, the operating director of LA-based American Multimedia Television USA put several questions to Xiao Yaqinge, the Director of the State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission during a press conference. During the questions, Liang Xiangyi, a journalist with Yicai financial news outlet from Shanghai was filmed rolling her eyes and making several facial expressions. The footage was captured by CCTV and immediately broadcast, including online. The footage sparked debate online, with some accusing Liang of not respecting the event, while other welcomed her expressions.Social media was flooded with posts and memes of the eye-rolling footage, but the Chinese 'censors' quickly sprang the action, and according to several reports the authorities had warned Chinese journalists to 'close their eyes to the eye roll'. In a directive issued to the media, it said: "Urgent notice: all media personnel are prohibited from discussing the Two Sessions blue-clothed reporter incident on social media. Anything already posted must be deleted. Without exception, websites must not hype the episode."Many social media users also highlighted the link between Zhang's employer American Multimedia Television USA and the Chinese state broadcaster. Also highlighted was the boss of American Multimedia Television, Jason Quin, who also lists himself as the President of the Confucius Institute of Education. The links were pointed out, as media outlets with ties to the Chinese government are often the ones chosen to ask questions at the National People's Congress.The following day, the office organising the National Congress issued a notice that it was revoking the press accreditation to both Zhang and Liang to enter the City Hall.The IFJ Asia Pacific Office said: "The actions by the organising committee to revoke the press accreditation of two journalists due to a response on social media, is a complete overreaction and shows the excessive measures that the government will go to maintain its orchestrated message and control over information."The IFJ calls on the All China Journalists Association to investigate the circumstances around the revoked accreditation, and fight for the rights of journalists.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6209807 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: March 19, 2018End of Document

CHINA LAUNCHES NEW ENTERPRISE STANDARD LAWStates News ServiceJanuary 26, 2018 FridayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 389 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: MILWAUKEE, WI BodyThe following information was released by the Association of Equipment Manufacturers:The Chinese government adopted a new, streamlined standards process that is aimed to make it easier for OEMs who manufacture in or sell into China to navigate regulations.The Peoples Congress approved a draft of revised Chinese Standardization Law that included new revised requirements on enterprise standards that will enact market-oriented reforms. The new, revised law which took effect on Jan. 1, 2018 does away with a complex system of overlapping national, regional and industrial standards. Instead, manufacturers must now comply only with mandatory national standards.Enterprise standards are standards that a company or enterprise in China implements for its own use, mainly for organizing its manufacturing process.Companies were required to develop their own enterprise standards if no existing national or industrial standards cover the product of the company under past regulations and these enterprise standards were required to be reported and archived by local government agencies; those enterprise standards are now optional, with a few key requirements.Companies that do develop enterprise standards must publicize its number and title, as well as the functional parameters of that standard. Companies must also publicize the national, industry or regional standards they comply with.Companies can publicize the standard by uploading a PDF of the whole text of its enterprise standard OR to input functional and performance parameters as required by the enterprise standard at the following Chinese-language portal: http://www.cpbz.gov.cnCompanies that dont adequately publicize their compliance activities will face a deadline defined by related authority by which they must do so. Failure to comply with the deadline results in a violation that will be publicized on the national standards information platform.The website of SAC (Standardization Administration of China), www.sac.gov.cn, provides comprehensive information on all national standards both mandatory and voluntary to search for information, and read the text of almost all mandatory national standards and many voluntary national standards.For more information on Chinas new enterprise standards rules, please contact AEMs Amy Wang in the associations Beijing office.Load-Date: January 26, 2018End of Document

Trump prevented the Broadcom-Qualcomm merger due to technological fear for ChinaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 14, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 730 wordsBody The unusual decision of President Donald Trump to block the sale of US chipmaker Qualcomm to Broadcom, based in Singapore, shows the fear of China's growing technological competition.  Trump decreed Monday the prohibition of that acquisition for 117,000 million dollars because it considers that "it harms the national security of the United States".  That merger would have been the largest ever in the technology sector.  Trump's decision did not mention China, but a previous letter from the Treasury Department warned that the merger would damage the United States' leadership in 5G, the ultrafast fifth generation of wireless networks being deployed, and would consequently put at risk the National security.  "It's a real threat," said James Lewis, a former national security official with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.  Lee: Trump prevents the Qualcomm technology from being bought  "Since 2002, each administration considered that we would be vulnerable to Chinese espionage if they control the infrastructure, Qualcomm and to a certain extent Cisco are the last ones that keep the United States in the game when it comes to telecommunications and we do not want to lose them," he said.  The merger was investigated by the Foreign Investment Committee of the United States, which usually works in secret.  The Treasury letter last week said that the purchase of Qualcomm could take away from the United States influence on the standards of 5G and open the way for the domination of Chinese companies such as Huawei.  "Maybe Huawei is the only company that offers a full range of 5G products," said Lewis. "It is positioning itself as a supplier of 5G equipment," he added.  Broadcom said it has "strong disagreement" with the alliance raising national security concerns. The company promised to invest to ensure US leadership in 5G; a vital technology in terms of robotics, cars connected to the web and other smart devices.  Lewis considered possible that the intelligence services of the United States have found worrisome elements even though Broadcom intended to settle in the United States on April 3.  "Maybe it's the money, maybe it's control, maybe it's something we do not know what justified this extreme action" of Trump, Lewis said.  We recommend: The EU fines Qualcomm for paying Apple to use its chips  Fear of Huawei  Paul Rosenzweig, a former US Department of Homeland Security official, urged caution.  "No one knows for sure, but there is a suspicion that the ultimate goal of Broadcom is to help Huawei and that move is an attempt to sink the US development of 5G," Rosenzweig wrote in his blog on security.  "Qualcomm is an essential partner of the United States government and has permits to access highly classified information." "If it were bought by a foreign company that status would be at risk," he added.  Trump's decision highlights the growing concern over Huawei, the world's third-largest smartphone maker and one of the leaders in telecommunications infrastructure.  Earlier this year, Huawei lost the opportunity to access a larger swath of the US smartphone market when AT & T and Verizon canceled deals after US lawyers expressed concern over the company's ties to the Chinese government.  The problem 5G  Lewis said that a controversial proposal that would have nationalized the US 5G network surfaced a few months ago and indicated thatIt showed the government's concern for espionage in telecommunication networks.  Lee: Deco, the device to be the master of Wi-Fi  "This administration woke up to the 5G problem," Lewis said.  The president of the Technalysis Research firm Bob O & # 39; Donnell said that Broadcom has a reputation for cost reduction while Qualcomm - which manufactures most of the microprocessors for smartphones used in the world - has focused on innovation.  "Without the kind of breakthroughs that Qualcomm's culture has created, the telecommunications industry would not have advanced as far as today," O & # 39; Donnell said in a blog post.  The blockade of the merger "should be seen as a very positive element not only for Qualcomm but for the entire market," said Stuart Carlaw of ABI Research.  "The new entity would have had a dangerously dominant position in some key markets such as location technologies, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and semiconductors for cars," Carlaw said. Load-Date: March 14, 2018End of Document

US-based Uighur journalist says China detained 20 relativesAssociated Press InternationalMarch 1, 2018 Thursday 12:00 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 520 wordsDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - A U.S.-based Uighur journalist is accusing the Chinese authorities of seizing about 20 of her relatives in Xinjiang, apparently to pressure her to cease her critical reporting about the turbulent northwestern region.Gulchehra Hoja, who has worked for U.S. government-funded Radio Free Asia in Washington for 17 years, said on Facebook that her mother, father, brother and other relatives were imprisoned because of her work as a reporter. Amnesty International said Thursday at least eight of Hoja's cousins are being held due to their relation to the journalist.Hoja's decision to take her allegation public is a rare move at a time when many overseas Uighurs fear speaking openly or using their real names in discussing the situation in Xinjiang. That's because of the very high likelihood of government retribution against their relatives still in China.Her disclosure comes amid rising concerns over the Chinese government's campaign to send tens of thousands of Uighurs to a network of extrajudicial detention camps in the name of national security.China suspects radicals among the Turkic Muslim ethnic group of plotting a violent campaign for independence from Beijing and characterizes the detentions as prolonged study sessions where they study patriotism and the dangers of Islamic extremism.But rights groups and foreign academics say the shadowy system is ethnically discriminatory, rife with abuse and has resulted in a significant portion of the Uighur population locked up. A 2017 Associated Press report found that Xinjiang's Uighurs live under intense physical and digital surveillance and are sometimes whisked away for ostensible crimes such as speaking to overseas relatives.Calls to the press offices for Xinjiang's police and propaganda departments went unanswered.China maintains strict control over information in Xinjiang, which it has flooded with security forces over the past decade. Foreign reporters who travel there are followed and harassed by the authorities and usually expelled after a short time, making it extremely difficult to obtain accurate information about the situation on the ground.This week, Human Rights Watch reported it had found new evidence that authorities in Xinjiang are electronically sweeping up citizens' personal information, including their travel history, prayer habits, the number of books in their possession, and banking and health records.That information has led to people being detained and sent to political indoctrination centers, the group said.Even before then, China's 10 million Uighurs had already faced a raft of restrictions not imposed on people of the Han ethnicity, who are the overwhelming majority in China.Uighurs face multiple hurdles in procuring passports and those who have them are required to leave them with the police. Hotels are required to register their presence with local authorities, and frequently turn them away to avoid the hassle. Frequent road blocks and checkpoints across the vast Xinjiang region enable authorities to stop people and check their mobile phones for content that might be deemed suspicious.Load-Date: March 2, 2018End of Document

Marx Monument in Trier - Episcopal City Stabs Persecuted Christians in China in the BackTargeted News ServiceFebruary 2, 2018 Friday 7:54 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 492 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: GOTTINGEN, Germany BodyThe Society for Threatened Peoples issued the following news release:The Society for Threatened Peoples (STP) criticizes the planned inauguration of an oversized Marx monument in Trier. "If the German episcopal city decides to put this gift of the People's Republic on display, this is to be seen as a slap in the face for the persecuted Christians in China. In the name of Karl Marx, the Chinese Communist Party (CP) is currently stepping up its measures of persecution against the Christians, who don't feel represented by the state-controlled churches in China. New regulations will come into force today, and unofficial churches and their members will be forced into illegality," criticized Ulrich Delius, the STP's director and Asia expert, in Gottingen."In the name of the CP and its sole claim to power, other fundamental rights will be undermined as well," the human rights advocate stated. "It would be neither be caring nor wise to ignore the catastrophic situation of China's Christians, human rights activists, and critical lawyers - or to set up a monument for a man whose name is misused to justify human rights violations, which is what the gift from the Chinese government is actually all about." There are plans to inaugurate a 5.50-meter-high China-made statue of Karl Marx in Trier, the city in which he was born, on May 5, 2018, on occasion of his 200th birthday.Delius stated that he is astonished how little attention is given to the difficult situation of the Christians and other persecuted minorities in China in connection with the debate about the controversial monument in the episcopal and pilgrimage town of Trier. "It is unacceptable to disrespect basic Christian and democratic values like this, only to further local tourism and overnight stays of Chinese guests," he criticized.Under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, there are more and more restrictions to the rights of freedom of religion, freedom of the press, freedom of opinion and an open Internet in the Peoples' Republic - a systematic sinification of religion and the Internet, to ensure that the Communist Party will gain absolute control of all sectors of society. As a justification, the CP refers to the works of Marx and Xi Jinping, as well as to the well-known Mao principle according to which the party is always right.The new regulations in the scope of the Chinese religious laws are imprecise, allowing for arbitrarily high fines - or serving as a legal basis to confiscate church property due to supposedly illegal religious activities. In addition, there are attempts to obstruct and criminalize contacts with Christians abroad. Further, there are new restrictions regarding Christian youth work, and all priests and pastors were requested to register officially to allow for comprehensive monitoring.Contact: Ulrich Delius, director of STP and Asia Expert, asien@gfbv.de, presse@gfbv.deCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6151383 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: February 3, 2018End of Document

New Hampshire naturalist featured in 'Pandas' filmAssociated Press State & LocalFebruary 5, 2018 Monday 9:13 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: STATE AND REGIONAL; Member ExchangeLength: 639 wordsByline: By LEAH WILLINGHAM, Concord MonitorDateline: LYME, N.H. BodyLYME, N.H. (AP) - In his 20 years of intimate research on New Hampshire black bears, Ben Kilham has made ground-breaking discoveries on the species' family structure and psychology.Kilham's observations have been so influential that scientists in China asked if he would travel to the country to see if his research and rehabilitation methods could apply to the country's vulnerable panda population.After several trips to China, Kilham said he hopes that researchers in Asia will develop similar relationships with pandas to his with North American black bears."For generations, these panda cubs have lived in cages," Kilham said. "It's amazing to see how when they're finally released, they blossom."The result of his work was captured on the 3D film "Pandas" which will debut at the Simons IMAX Theatre at the New England Aquarium in Boston this April."Pandas" will showcase Kilham's work with China's Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding over the course of three years. It will be shown around the world.The film documents Kilham's initial meeting with Chinese researchers in 2012, when they came to see the enclosure he created at his home in Lyme for black bear cubs.Kilham said he had met the researchers from China's Chengdu Research Base years before at a conference in China. They had been interested in his work, but wanted to see it in person, he said.Kilham has rehabilitated more than 150 orphaned North American black bear cubs in the span of 20 years, acting as a surrogate mother to the bears until they are ready to be fully sufficient, wild animals.During their first 18 months of life, Kilham bottle feeds the cubs, and spends days accompanying them on long walks in his enclosure, where the bears are free to wander without tethering.Kilham is one of the first and only researchers to take such an intimate approach to rehabilitation, and to great success.One of Kilham's first cubs, Squirty, is now 22 and has mothered 11 litters of her own. But despite being a fully grown, wild black bear, Squirty is still friendly with Kilham.She lets him approach her and adjust her GPS tracking collars when need be, Kilham said."That's something we will be able to do with the pandas, too," he said.Kilham began traveling to China to work with the pandas - eight times in recent years, for up to two weeks at a time. Two post-doctorate research fellows from the United States followed him to live in China full-time working with the cubs, Kilham said.Kilham said he helped researchers create a spacious enclosure modeled after his black bear enclosure in Lyme on Chinese government-provided land. China is currently home to 1,800 wild pandas that live on 62 acres of natural reserves.Up until this point, wild pandas have been under-researched in China, Kilham said. Data collected on pandas has mostly been on pandas living in zoos.But this new panda rehabilitation program will change that, Kilham said. Like his black bears, the pandas will be tracked via GPS locators. Kilham said he hopes that researchers in China will be able to learn from the rehabilitated pandas like he has learned from bears like Squirty.Kilham said he's been in contact with producers from IMAX for years, since they caught wind of his intimate work with New Hampshire black bears. The IMAX producers first hoped to feature Kilham on a film focusing on orangutans, elephants and black bears, but they ended up cutting the black bears idea later on in production.Since then, "they've been coming every year since 2008 and buying me dinner," Kilham said.When Kilham told IMAX producers about his panda project in China, they were thrilled, he said."They said it would be a great idea for a film," he said. "They couldn't wait to get to work."___Online: http://bit.ly/2GQF8G9___Information from: Concord Monitor, http://www.concordmonitor.comLoad-Date: February 6, 2018End of Document

Bloomberg To Add China To The Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate IndicesPR NewswireMarch 23, 2018 Friday 8:00 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 778 wordsDateline: BEIJING, March 23, 2018 BodyBloomberg today announced that it will add Chinese RMB-denominated government and policy bank securities to the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index, once several planned operational enhancements are implemented by the People's Bank of China (PBoC) and Ministry of Finance.  The addition of these securities will be phased in over a 20-month period starting April 2019.When fully accounted for in the Global Aggregate Index, local currency Chinese bonds will be the fourth largest currency component following the US dollar, euro and Japanese yen.  Using data as of January 31, 2018, the index would include 386 Chinese securities and represent 5.49% of a $53.73 trillion index."Today's announcement recognizes China's continued efforts over recent years to enhance access to the world's third-largest bond market," said Michael Bloomberg, founder of Bloomberg LP and Chair of the Working Group on U.S. RMB Trading and Clearing. "It is a testament to China's firm commitment to financial reforms and the pace of change taking place in its bond market, and another important step for China's integration with global financial markets."In order to be considered for inclusion in the Global Aggregate Index, a local currency debt market must be classified as investment grade and its currency must be freely tradable, convertible, hedgeable, and free of capital controls.  Ongoing enhancements from the PBoC have resulted in RMB-denominated securities meeting these absolute index rules. Additional enhancements are required prior to the planned inclusion date to increase investor confidence and to improve market accessibility.  Among these are: the implementation of delivery vs. payment settlement, ability to allocate block trades across portfolios, and clarification on tax collection policies.  Should progress on these enhancements be delayed, China's inclusion in the Global Aggregate Index and other Bloomberg Barclays Indices may also be delayed."Bloomberg's inclusion of RMB-denominated bonds in the most widely-used fixed income benchmarks represents a pivotal development for investors around the world," said Henry M. Paulson, Co-Chair of The Working Group on U.S. RMB Trading and Clearing. "China's new position in international bond portfolios will pave the way for robust market activity and support continued financial reforms.""The Chinese interbank bond markets continue to evolve, and Bloomberg will reflect the maturation of this asset class in our global benchmarks," said Steve Berkley, Global Head of Bloomberg Indices. "Following our introduction of the China Aggregate index in 2004 and the +China indices in 2017, the official inclusion of RMB-denominated securities in the Global Aggregate Index reflects the next natural step expected by global investors." In addition to the Global Aggregate Index, Chinese RMB-denominated debt will be eligible for inclusion in the Global Treasury and EM Local Currency Government Indices starting April 2019. The planned inclusion of the Chinese market in the Global Aggregate, Global Treasury, and EM Local Currency Government Indices will be phased in over a 20-month period, starting in April 2019 with a scaling factor of 5% and increasing in 5% increments each month. Bloomberg will review the speed of implementation on an annual basis, per the company's governance process.Bloomberg will create ex-China versions of the Global Aggregate, Global Treasury and EM Local Currency Government Indices for index users who wish to track benchmarks that exclude China.  Bloomberg will also offer to create customized capped versions of the indices for investors looking to limit exposure to China.Bloomberg provides an independent, transparent approach to indexing for customers across the globe.

Asian shares slump on fears of trade war between US, ChinaAssociated Press InternationalMarch 23, 2018 Friday 3:02 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; Financial MarketsLength: 744 wordsByline: By KELVIN CHAN, AP Business WriterDateline: HONG KONG BodyHONG KONG (AP) - Asian stock markets slumped Friday after Beijing responded to the Trump administration's tariff hikes by saying it may order higher import duties on a range of U.S. goods, ratcheting up fears of a trade war.Stocks plunged Thursday on Wall Street after U.S. President Donald Trump imposed sanctions on goods and investment from China. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped more than 700 points as investors feared that trade tensions between the world's largest economies would escalate.The planned sanctions include tariffs on $48 billion worth of Chinese imports as well as restrictions on Chinese investments. Trump said he was taking those steps in response to theft of American technology.The U.S. Trade Representative identified 1,300 product lines as potential targets, including aerospace, information and communication technology, and machinery. A more complete list is due soon, to be followed by a 30-day comment period.The Chinese government said it will defend itself, and investors are worried that trade tensions will wreak havoc on the world economy.On Thursday they fled stocks and bought bonds, which sent bond prices higher and yields lower. With interest rates falling, banks took some of the worst losses. Technology and industrial companies, basic materials makers and health care companies also fell sharply.The fear rippled into Asia, where shares tumbled in early trading. By late morning in Japan, the benchmark Nikkei 225 index was down 3.5 percent at 20,827.92. South Korea's Kospi tumbled 2.3 percent to 2,438.03. Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 3.2 percent to 30,090.32 and the Shanghai Composite in mainland China sank 2.7 percent to 3,169.19. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 skidded 1.9 percent to 5,824.50.In response to President Donald Trump's tariff hike on steel and aluminum, China unveiled a list of U.S. goods including pork, apples and steel pipe that it may hit with higher import duties.The Commerce Ministry in Beijing urged Washington to negotiate a settlement, saying tariffs undermine the global trading system."Markets are looking immensely fragile today. Strap in as a tit-for-tat tariff tiff is about to start," Stephen Innes, head of Asian trading at OANDA, said in a commentary.On Thursday, markets sank. The S&P 500 index skidded 2.5 percent to 2,643.69. The Dow Jones industrial average sank 2.9 percent to 23,957.89. The Nasdaq composite gave up 2.4 percent to 7,166.68.Investors also sold some of the market's biggest recent winners. Among technology companies, Microsoft fell $2.69, or 2.9 percent, to $89.79 and Alphabet, Google's parent company, fell $40.85, or 3.7 percent, to $1,053.15. Online retailer Amazon slid $36.94, or 2.3 percent, to $1,544.92.The reaction to the moves in Washington and Beijing was somewhat muted, with Asian markets regaining some lost ground after early sell-offs.Peter Donisanu, an investment strategy analyst for the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said the risk of a damaging trade war is still low because the Trump administration is targeting specific goods that aren't central to China's economy. That could change if it puts tariffs on products like electronics or appliances imported from China."If the Trump administration really wanted to hurt China and start a trade war, then they would go after those larger sectors," he said.Earlier this month the Trump administration ordered tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, and stocks dropped as investors worried about the possibility of tougher restrictions on international trade and smaller profits for corporations.Their fears eased when the administration said some countries will be exempt from the tariffs. That continued Thursday, after U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said the tariffs won't apply to the European Union, Canada, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil and Australia.The jitters over trade tensions sent investors toward traditional "safe havens" like the Japanese yen, which strengthened against the U.S. dollar.The dollar fell to 104.87 yen from 105.28 yen in late trading Thursday. The euro rose to $1.2337 from $1.2302.Oil futures rallied. Benchmark U.S. crude rose 95 cents to $65.27 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract shed 87 cents, or 1.3 percent, to close at $64.30 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose 92 cents to $69.30 a barrel in London.___AP Markets Writer Marley Jay contributed to this report.Load-Date: March 23, 2018End of Document

US will impose more tariffs on China todayCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 22, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 412 wordsBody US President Donald Trump on Thursday announced tariffs on imports of goods originating in China worth 50 billion dollars a year as compensation for alleged theft of technology and trade secrets, according to sources quoted by The New York Times. .  It would impose sanctions on the Asian country in at least 100 categories of products such as clothing, shoes and electronics, as well as penalties on Chinese investments in the United States.  According to the newspaper, Trump will instruct the Treasury Department to apply restrictions on certain types of investments by China to counteract the industrial policy of that country, which aims to dominate sectors such as artificial intelligence and mobile technology.  On August 18, the White House Business Representation (USTR) began a case of Section 301 against China, the first use of that resource since 2010.  Ultimately, it could be the most significant trade case launched by the Commercial Representation, given the magnitude of commercial losses derived from the theft of intellectual property rights in China.  Trump's announcement would come a day before the United States enforces global tariffs of 25% on steel imports and 10% on aluminum imports, with possible exceptions, including Mexico and Canada, citing national security reasons .  The USTR has determined that it loses at least 30 billion dollars a year for the alleged forced transfers of technology from China and other unfair practices. The administration weighed a tariff package equivalent to that amount of Chinese imports or more, even up to 60,000 million, according to leaks to other media.  The research will focus on the actions, policies and practices of the Chinese government in four main areas: market access barriers such as opaque regulations and joint venture requirements; imposition of non-market terms in licenses and contracts related to technology; state investment or facilitated by the state in, or acquisition of, companies and assets of the United States, and commercial cyber espionage.  The USTR could establish, if necessary, the development of an action plan for President Trump.  From the beginning, the Ministry of Commerce of China criticized the announcement quickly affirming that "China expresses a great dissatisfaction with the unilateral protectionist action of the United States", while urging it to respect "the facts, (...) the multilateral principles and act with prudence.

China censors 'Fatty the Third' Internet search as North Koreans visitUPIMarch 27, 2018 Tuesday 9:05 AM ESTCopyright 2018 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 350 wordsByline: ELIZABETH SHIMDateline: March 27 BodyNews of a North Korean visit to Beijing has been followed by censorship on the Chinese Internet, according to multiple reports.On Sina Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter, the word "fatty" has become unsearchable, when used in the context of the North Korean visit, South Korean news service News 1 reported.Search terms like, "Fatty has arrived in Beijing," or "He has arrived" did not turn up results on the social media platform.The derogatory nickname "Fatty the Third" is commonly used in China to refer to North Korean leader , who represents the third phase of succession in the relatively isolated regime.By late Tuesday the visiting North Korea delegation was not identified, but speculation swirled the visitor was Kim Jong Un, and not his sister  or , the president of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly of North Korea.The ban on the search terms contrasts with the situation Tuesday morning -- simply typing in "Korea" would turn up photographs of the visit, according to News 1.South Korean newspaper Kukmin Ilbo reported Tuesday "Fatty the Third" also could not be searched on Baidu, China's largest Internet portal.All articles referring to a possible "Kim Jong Un visit" were not searchable, the report stated.The Chinese government has not released information on the mysterious visit that has been met with heightened security in central Beijing and near the North Korean Embassy."Because the Chinese authorities are reluctant to disclose their activities, they are controlling the state media and the Internet," a Beijing-based source told the Kukmin on Tuesday.The North Korean delegation arrived in an armored train late Monday then was accompanied by personnel traveling in 10 black sedans, three vans, three minibuses and an ambulance, according to South Korean newspaper Segye Ilbo.The last visit to China from members of North Korea's top leadership, excluding ministry and Workers' Party personnel, took place in August 2012, when Kim Jong Un's uncle-in-law Jang Song Taek visited Beijing.Jang was sentenced to death in 2013 for alleged treason and corruption.Load-Date: March 28, 2018End of Document

Thanks for joining us. I am Maria Bartiromo, and good morning to you.It is Tuesday, March 13th. Your top stories right now: 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast. Deal blocked; President Trump orders Broadcom to end in its $117 billion hostile bid for rival Qualcomm, citing national security concerns. We are breaking down the big move coming up this morning.The news coming after trade concerns weighed on stocks yet again yesterday. The Dow Industrials closing down better than 150 points, dragged down by industrials like Boeing and Caterpillar. The Nasdaq closed at another record high meanwhile. This is the 15th record high this year for the Nasdaq.Let's check futures right now, tell you what's going on this morning, where the momentum is, and it is on the upside. Dow industrial expected to be up 60 points, one quarter of one percent higher this morning. The S&P and the Nasdaq also in positive territory.Investors are waiting on the inflation data out today - the February Consumer Price Index Report expected to be up by two tenths of 1 percent. A lot of focus on inflation - that number becomes more important. We will focus on it as well.In Europe, markets are edging higher this morning. Take a look at performance: FT 100 up a fraction. CAC Quarante up one half of 1 percent, and the Dax index up 22 points higher in Germany.In Asia overnight, markets performed mix. The Shanghai Composite was down, as was the Hang Seng in Hong Kong, but the Nikkei Average in Japan up two thirds of 1 percent. The Kospi also higher.Battleground day Pennsylvania. Voters head to the polls in a very key congressional district today, in yet another primary test for President Trump, where things just stand just an hour before the polls open. We're going to take you to Pennsylvania.Austin on alert, a series of deadly package explosions this month leaves two people dead, more injured.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: There was just a loud, loud boom.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Glass went everywhere into her body, into the frame of the house, it just went shooting out.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: The very latest from the scene and the warning for residents coming up this morning.Plus, another storm is slamming the East Coast as we speak, the details as more than 100 -- 1,500 flights have already been cancelled. We're going to give the update on the next nor'easter right now.And then empty pockets, why GE failed to give top executives cash bonuses for the first time in the company's history, stock is now below $15.00, down one and a half percent this morning at $14.87.All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning and joining me to talk about it, FOX Business Network's Dagen McDowell. ""The Wall Street Journal's" Global Economic Editor, Jon Hilsenrath. And Kairos Founder, Ankur Jain is with us this morning. Ankur, it's good to see you.ANKUR JAIN, FOUNDER, KAIROS: Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: Thanks for joining us. Good morning.JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning. Lot to talk about today.BARTIROMO: So much going on this morning, I don't know what is most important to you.HILSENRATH: I think for the -- Ankur and I were talking in agreement about the Broadcom Qualcomm deal being busted up. I think that's a huge deal breakup for markets and for Washington, D.C.BARTIROMO: And this would have been a huge deal, yes.JAIN: Well I mean, it's particularly scary because this is the first time we're seeing the government blocking a deal not because it's tied to a Chinese government, because they don't agree with the business strategy that they believe they're going to take when they acquire Qualcomm.BARTIROMO: Yes. But I think it's a lot more about China because yesterday we had Gordon Chang who we're going to speak with momentarily and he said if Broadcom acquires -- he said this on the air yesterday, if Broadcom acquires Qualcomm, Qualcomm will not be able to effectively compete with China.JAIN: See, but that -- but my challenge for that is that there's two companies right now, Huawei and Qualcomm that have five new technology spectrum. Broadcom made a commitment investing in the 5G network and this is kind of the first time the government stepped in with their own interpretation what they believe the acquiring company will do with that once its purchased, right?So that sets a dangerous precedent for us in the tech space. I mean, a lot of the money coming in right now in the tech world is from -- I mean, the Softbank obviously Japan but Chinese money as well. And so --BARTIROMO: A lot of Chinese money.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Well the power of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States was expanded to allow the president of the United States to do this back in the 1980s when the threat seemed to be from Japan.And, again, once you allow this deal to go through, that the U.S. government in terms of national security has no control over what Broadcom would do with it. So, again, it's a big deal that they're stepping in before this deal was finalized, nevertheless there are legitimate reasons why the roadblocks --HILSENRATH: I think to Ankur's point is what -- one of the things that's unique and special about this is China isn't directly in the middle of this deal, they're on the sidelines and we're -- the United States government is blocking it because of a threat of Chinese competition as opposed to China coming in and buying American technology and trying to bring up (INAUDIBLE)BARTIROMO: I've got this report, China's technology transfer strategy and it basically says that China is executing a multi-decade plan to transfer technology by investing in American companies and they have participated in seven percent of all venture deals in the last five years.So they are quietly acquiring our technology and I think that's really the worry here. We're going to talk about it, a lot to talk about this morning.MCDOWELL: And also Hillary Clinton, bless her heart.BARTIROMO: Oh my God. It just doesn't stop.MCDOWELL: Anybody from the south (INAUDIBLE)BARTIROMO: It doesn't stop. Yes, I know. I know, I've learned. I've learned. We're going to talk about Hillary Clinton who was in India this week but man, did she have a lot to say, that's all coming up this morning.And joining the conversation this morning, we have a special exclusive interview coming up with the Founder, Chairman and former CEO of Charles Schwab Corporation, Charles Schwab himself is here this morning. The CEO of Discovery and President, David Zaslav is joining us to talk media and his recent deal that just closed with Scripps.Kentucky Congressman Andy Barr, Missouri Congressman, Blain Luetkemeyer is here. And the Host of "Hannity," Sean Hannity is going to join us as well. Lots to talk about this morning ahead of that Pennsylvania election.Let's kick it off right here with our top story and that is the president is blocking what would have been the biggest deal in technology in history. The president is blocking Broadcom's $117 billion hostile bid for Qualcomm saying that it pose a threat to national security. The move comes after the panel that vets foreign deals voice concern over the Singapore-based Broadcom acquiring the U.S.-based chip maker Qualcomm saying that it could hamper efforts to develop 5G wireless networks and other emerging technologies in the United States.Here's what the president's Top Trade Advisor, Peter Navarro told me this weekend about China's efforts to cultivate U.S. technology.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PETER NAVARRO, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL TRADE COUNCIL DIRECTOR: China should not be stealing our intellectual property and technology forcing their transfer and when we run the deficits with them they go to places like Silicon Valley flush with American dollars and they buy up those startup companies that are on the cutting edge of artificial intelligence, robotics, and everything we're going to need. If we don't have the industries of the future, we don't have a future.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Broadcom now says it is reviewing President Trump's order. Joining us now to talk more about it is the Author of, "The Coming Collapse of China" Gordon Chang. And Gordon, it's good to have you back because yesterday you were so adamant about this.In fact, I tweeted out when you said it that you said that if Broadcom were allowed to acquire Qualcomm and Qualcomm would not be able to compete effectively with China. Walk us through that, what is your reaction to the president's move and what do you think the reasoning is behind this?GORDON CHANG, "THE COMING COLLAPSE OF CHINA," AUTHOR: Yes. The president was very clear and I think it was the right thing to do. He decided that Broadcom pose a threat. And the reason is, you can look at Broadcom's business model, they do this consistently.They buy a company, they break it up, and they realize the shareholder value. But that's great if you want shareholder value. But it also meant that Qualcomm would have been taken apart and this is not some theoretical concern because Broadcom had been talking about what it was going to do with Qualcomm and many people were concerned especially because there was the view that Broadcom was going to sell off some of those patents which is really the core of Qualcomm's business.So here, we didn't have a second chance. It's either Qualcomm or it's Huawei, the Chinese company which is nominally private but really connected to the people's liberation army and the ministry of state security. So if Qualcomm was not able to compete despite what Broadcom said because they are a serial fender in this regard, it was just the end of this for the United States and says -- Peter Navarro says you've got to have a future.BARTIROMO: But I don't understand why you think this is a national security risk and that's certainly what the president is saying, why you think that Broadcom, Qualcomm combination would be less effective in terms of competing with China should they get together, why? I mean, Broadcom is Singapore-based, explain your reasoning why Qualcomm would not be able to compete with China should that deal take place?CHANG: Well theoretically if Broadcom kept Qualcomm in one piece, yes, Qualcomm could compete. But there was real concerns inside Qualcomm that if this merger just dragged on that the company would just sort of wind away.And so, it's -- I think it's important. This is why the defense department was concerned because they're looking at wireless communication, 5G which will connect virtually everything in your home, in your office. So it's important from that perspective that we did not have the Chinese into the backbone of the United States, it's as simple as that.BARTIROMO: Yes. Ankur, what do you say about that?JAIN: Yes. I mean, I think part of the challenge here is the White House stepping in to block the acquisition is different than setting a regulatory precedent from what the U.S. needs. And so, there are lots of ways that could have incentivized Broadcom, Qualcomm to continue leading the charge on the 5G development. And I think it's just a little concerning to start seeing blocks based on perceived fears of business models on this type of acquisition.BARTIROMO: Dagen?MCDOWELL: But to Gordon -- Gordon, to your point that one of the things that Broadcom did say that piqued the interest of the members of the (INAUDIBLE) committee was that it would take a private equity-style approach if it bought Qualcomm leading them to think that they would spend less on long-term research and development and more on, well, short-term matters to your point.CHANG: Yes, this is what they do all the time. So they've done it before and they'll do it again and we just did not have the opportunity to say, "Oh, let's just experiment and see if they're going to change their business model." It was clear what they were going to do because they told us what they were going to do, they've done it so many times in the past.BARTIROMO: Yes.HILSENRATH: Gordon, I want to turn the lens to China and where China is going with artificial intelligence and 5G technology. China is a surveillance state, you could argue a police state, it's not a completely open economy. Can a country like that that's running such a top down economy really leapfrog the United States and other free and open societies in high technology?I mean, they've made all their inroads in basically low end manufacturing, can they become a leading edge economy while running a surveillance state and a police state?CHANG: That is the critical question and the answer is yes, they can do it at least for a short period of time. We've got one president and that is that the Soviet Union was able to take -- go into space first, they were able to put a satellite there, got the first man in space, that's because the states like Soviet Union and China devote a lot of state energy into specific goals.HILSENRATH: But Gordon, that's kind of my point, the Soviet Union never got to the moon and its economy collapsed. So do we really think that the Chinese are going to be able to make the kind of threat that we're saying they are?CHANG: Well long-term we can discuss that. But short-term, definitely they can. And in quantum computing, quantum communications they're well ahead of us, two to three years at least.You put AI together with quantum and God knows what's going to occur there. And so that's really the concern because we know that Chinese state is putting a lot of effort into AI with state money and state engineers all working together closely.BARTIROMO: Yes. They're actually at a record level in terms of their participation in venture deals, seven to ten percent of all venture deals China has participated in in the last five years. Do you think this is partly why the president instituted those tariffs on steel and aluminum, Gordon, because there's a bigger story here surrounding China?CHANG: Yes. The big story here is industrial-base. Those tariffs on steel and aluminum, if you look at it as a trade issue, it's indefensible. But if you look at it as a national security issue, it's very different.Those tariffs were set at levels that the commerce department thought would make steel and aluminum self-sustaining so that we would be able to build weapons of war. And this is not just a theoretical concern because there's a lot of steel and aluminum that goes into destroyers and tanks and planes that we do not in fact make in this country.BARTIROMO: Yes. It's interesting because the "Journal" has an Op--Ed this morning Dagen, the title, "The National Security Tariff Ruse."MCDOWELL: Right. Because I'll point to Gordon referencing the commerce departments reports earlier this year on the national security threat of not having a, in their words, vibrant steel industry but Defense Secretary Mattis responded, the Trump commerce department use the 232.But in -- but the Department of Defense was worried about the negative impact on our key allies and the Department of Defense does not believe that the findings and the reports impact the ability of Defense Department programs to acquire the steel or aluminum necessary to meet national defense requirement.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: So, again, the national security threat according to the -- our very -- like the press department, it is a hoax quite frankly.BARTIROMO: And the "Journal" Op-Ed page today, Gordon is pushing back on that. Real quick, your comment there.CHANG: Yes. If you have a short-term issue, yes, I'm sure the DOD is correct. But if we're in a long-term struggle with China and a war like World War II, we need to be able to make our own steel and aluminum. That just seems to me to be elemental.MCDOWELL: We also need allies like Canada rather than alienating them. So, again, that goes to the Defense Department. They're worried about the impact on our allies like south Korea as well.BARTIROMO: Gordon, good to see you sir, thank you so much. Gordon Chang.CHANG: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Before we take a break let me just say I can confirm last night I was here and Larry Kudlow is the leading candidate right now in terms of Gary Cohn's job. The president seems to be telling people, he told people last night that he is leaning toward Larry Kudlow. Jon Hilsenrath, your thoughts on Larry Kudlow getting the NEC job.HILSENRATH: It would be -- he's a free trader. Gary Cohn left because he was a free trader and didn't like the tariff decision. So it would be a confirmation that Trump wants disagreement and dissension within his own ranks. And he -- they are on the same page on things like taxes and regulation but they're not going to see eye-to-eye on trade.BARTIROMO: In fact, he wrote an Op-Ed on it as well.MCDOWELL: That's right, I got it right here.BARTIROMO: Yes. Who's afraid of higher wages?MCDOWELL: And by the way, I think it's an accident but Larry Kudlow blocks me on Twitter for some reason. So Mr. Kudlow, if you get the job, could you unblock me?BARTIROMO: What?MCDOWELL: I'm not joking.BARTIROMO: You can't block Dagen McDowell. All right. We're going to take a break. When we come back, Austin, Texas is on edge this morning. A teenager is dead, at least two women are seriously hurt after explosions at two homes lead police to believe they may be looking for serial bomber, next.BARTIROMO: Welcome back the Northeast is bracing for another winter storm. Cheryl Casone with the details. This is incredible. Winter does not want to leave.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Winter is never ever ending Maria, with the breaking news. Last week storm barely a memory now the Northeast bracing for its third Nor'easter just 11 days. Parts of New England actually could get up to two feet of snow. Winds of up to 65 miles per hour. Major airlines already waiving rescheduling fees not more than a dozen airports from Pennsylvania all the way to New England. American, United, JetBlue and Delta just some of the airlines giving you guys a break if you don't want to deal with this. Airports covered by the waivers varied by airlines but they include all the major guys. Boston Logan Airport, JFK, LaGuardia, Newark and Philadelphia. As now, more than 1600 flights have been cancelled and more than 100 flights delayed. Airlines are encouraging travellers to check for updates throughout the day today.All right, a crucial election in western Pennsylvania that's happening today. Voters heading to the polls to choose their next representative, a tight race expected between Republican Rick Saccone and Democrat Conor Lamb. It's a special course Congressional Election. Democrats want to steal a house seat away from the Republicans in a district that President Trump carried by nearly 20 points holding to re-open from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. tonight.Well, Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee closing their investigation into the Trump campaign alleged dealings with Russia. President Trump tweeted the GOP findings in capital letters. "THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE HAS, AFTER A 14 MONTH LONG IN-DEPTH INVESTIGATION, FOUND NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION OR COORDINATION BETWEEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND RUSSIA TO INFLUENCE THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION."(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. CHRIS STEWART (R), UTAH: We've been accusing people of conspiracy and treason, and at the end of the day, these people are innocent. Aren't these -- aren't these others who oppose what the Republicans have said. Aren't they willing to come forward and just say, you know what, maybe we got this wrong. It's not fair to these individuals to keep this cloud over them when it -- there just isn't evidence to support that.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Well we should add on this, the Democrats are criticizing the report they say that they've not been given a copy.Meanwhile, mainstream media down playing the entire thing. ABC and CBS getting it less than one minute combined. NBC totally ignoring the story.And then finally there's this, Hillary Clinton she's back. Going halfway around the world to criticize President Trump. She was on a trip to India and she said that the United States didn't deserve Trump.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE: His whole campaign, 'Make America Great Again,' was looking backwards. You didn't like black people getting rights, you don't like women, you know, getting jobs. You don't want it, you know, see that Indian-American succeeding more than you are. Whatever your problem is, I'm going to solve it.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: From India. Clinton also calling the 2016 presidential race the first reality T.V. campaign. Maria. So, was Clinton's comment good for --BARTIROMO: I am perplexed. You don't like blacks getting rights? I'm (INAUDIBLE) -- what is she talking about?MCDOWELL: Well remember the deplorables comment?BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: She meant it.BARTIROMO: Right.MCDOWELL: It was straight from the heart. If you are white and live in rural America, you're a racist pig. If you're a woman who voted for Donald Trump, you can't think for yourself. That you are -- that you are allowing your husband or your boyfriend to think for you. She literally, I mean, that was the way that I walk -- I came away from that comment.BARTIROMO: You're right. She will not give up.MCDOWELL: And by the way, this is Sean Davis from the Federalist who tweeted this. 'According to Hillary, the following states, all of which voted for Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump are full of backwards racists who hate women and black people. Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Iowa, Pennsylvania, and Florida. Boy it's a real mystery why she lost.' And the Democratic Party they need to get away from this woman. Maybe that's why she's overseas.BARTIROMO: I don't understand why she's saying this in India. India, actually Trump is popular in there.HILSENRATH: And I don't get why she's talking about overseas negatively about our country.BARTIROMO: It's pretty incredible. All right, we'll take a break. We've got more on that.Plus more G.E. was (INAUDIBLE) the first time G.E.'s 125 year history. The company doesn't pay any bonuses to top executives. That's next.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, economic data in focus, European markets open mix this morning as investors overseas are waiting on some key inflation data to come out, the CPI comes out at 8:30 a.m. Eastern. So, we'll get back to you in about two hours.Joining us right now to get the Irish perspective, as KBI Global Investors CEO, Sean Hawkshaw and KBI Global Investors CIO, Noel O'Halloran. Good to see you sir. Thank you so much for joining us gentlemen.SEAN HAWKSHAW, CEO, KBI GLOBAL INVESTORS: Good morning, Maria. Thanks for the opportunity to be in the show.BARTIROMO: Good to have you here. Well we appreciate you joining us. Characterize the world for us, you're invested across the world. Where do you see growth?NOEL O'HALLORAN, CIO, KBI GLOBAL INVESTORS: Yes. We're pretty confident in terms of the world -- where the world is at right now, we see the U.S. as a main local motion for world growth. But Europe has been picking up very strongly. So, over the last 12 months, I think, the big surprise has been strength to the European economy and then the emerging markets have finally begun to grow again over the last two years and particularly for the earnings point of view.BARTIROMO: Yes that's something Dagen and I talked about a lot. That for the first time in a long time we're seeing synchronized global growth.MCDOWELL: Right. The first time in a decade. Is there anything going on right now? Because we started the show about the United States blocking Broadcom verus of Qualcomm. That you throw in the steel tariffs, is that a concern for you enough that you would change how you've allocated your portfolio, where you invest, how you invest?O'HALLORAN: I think there's point since I know, I mean we're -- we just see the fundamentals are strong enough to maintain our current positioning. Above where this things have escalate and absolutely, I mean, ultimately if we escalated to, you know, more than a tit-for-tat tight war and we had serious inflationary concerns and I think that would be concerning not just for equities but also for bonds.HILSENRATH: When everything look so rosy, you have to worry where the -- where are the blind spots? What are you worried about right now in terms of the global outlook and what country -- where do you see risk building?O'HALLORAN: I mean, from our perspective, risk is from a fundamental point of view, I mean the first thing to do is that as we evolve from goldilocks maybe into next year. Due, does inflation certainly become an issue? I don't think it's an issue for 2018. I think it's probably 2019 issue. And then, on the politics side, I think, that's where we would see risks.BARTIROMO: Speaking of that, what about the U.K.? Sean, tell us about Brexit situation. How's that impacting, how you approach investing?HAWKSHAW: I think -- I think Brexit is a serious concern. I think it's the time for fledging is open Brexit at this stage. I think we need to see some decisions be made at the moment if they look for the prospective of our industry. Still a huge amount of uncertainty in terms of passporting of U.K. funds into Europe. And you've got a seven trillion sterling asset management business in the U.K. 20 percent of those assets are managed for European investors and at the moment we don't know whether those are going to be able to sold into the U.K. or not. I think from an asset management perspective it means there's, you know, a lot of U.K. for managers are already looking at the option on the of increasing their operations and foot print in locations such as Dublin, which is good for us because that's where we're located. Also, (INAUDIBLE) and Paris and I think we are going to see a lot more of that until we got some uncertain, some uncertainty around Brexits.HILSENRATH: How does the U.S. tax cut change the global landscape especially for a country like Ireland, which, you know, has kind of benefited from very low corporate tax rates?HAWKSHAW: I think that's a good question.BARTIROMO: A great question.HAWKSHAW: Ireland is a small open economy that's the first thing we all learn when we to college. We're very dependent on global trade and any form of protectionism. Whether it's through Brexit or through U.S. policies, you know, potentially have a negative impact on the Irish economy. I think you got to look at it two ways, there's a real economy in terms of jobs and employment and as low as the good reasons for multinationals, not just the U.S. have located in Ireland. And then there's just kind of there's a -- there's a virtual economy where you've got intellectual property and loyalties and all of that's kind of stuff moving around.Other than there is no doubt that, you know, a lot of large multinationals have been able to arbitrage the tax situations and the territorial base for tax versus the domestic base for tax. Whenever and they've got huge advantages about that. I think that's been closed down from two perspective, I think, the Irish authorities took initiatives a year or two ago to close down (INAUDIBLE) this double Irish idea. I mean you've got the recent (INAUDIBLE) and I think, a lot of that has going to be closed down.BARTIROMO: This is why this is the big story of the moment.

It's a country with its own people, on their own security forces, and (INAUDIBLE) law enforcement, and any threats and, basically, using their own security forces, certainly, with international support some years to come.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: More on his trip, coming up this morning. Meanwhile, a first for General Electric, the struggling company foregoes cash bonuses for executives last year. And today, J.P.

And then there's this, Lyft, driving to success. The company says its revenue is growing three times faster than Uber. We've got the numbers and the growth story, coming up.But first, this top story this half an hour and that is, Austin is on alert this morning after a series of deadly package explosions. Fox News Correspondent Lauren Blanchard is live in the Texas capital with the very latest, Lauren, good morning to you.LAUREN BLANCHARD, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria. Well, police are urging people to remain cautious after three packages exploded, killing two people. Authorities already have their hands full with the South by Southwest festival as the state capital.Here plays host thousands of attendees over the last 10 days. The three packages killed a teenager, a 39-year-old man and seriously injured a 75- year-old woman. And each case, the box was sitting outside the victim's house, then exploded when it was picked up or opened.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It was just a loud, loud boom. Total shock, because I couldn't -- the next thing I knew, I saw ambulance with my neighbor on it.BLANCHARD: It wasn't until the two latest explosions yesterday, that police began investigating a connection, along with the FBI and the ATF. None of the packages were delivered through a mail service. The recipients are either black or Hispanic. And police say the devices are sophisticated, so it's likely whoever is making them, is no amateur.And now, Texas Governor Greg Abbott is offering a $15,000 reward for any information leading to an arrest in South by Southwest, is one of the city's biggest money makers. And while police say they don't think there's any, sort of, risk to the attendees, they still do not have a motive for the attacks. Maria?BARTIROMO: All right, Lauren, thank you very much, Lauren Blanchard with the latest there. We will come back as news develops. Joining us right now is the Austin Police Chief Brian Manley, Chief Manley, good to see you, thanks for joining us. Do you have any new developments in this investigation?CHIEF BRIAN MANLEY, POLICE CHIEF, AUSTIN, TEXAS: You know, where we are right now, the investigators worked through the night on processing the scene itself. As you can imagine, the debris fields from an explosion like this, is quite significant and we have to do a post blast investigation along with our federal partners.And then the big work that we're doing is trying to see if there is a link between the victims in these three incidents so that we can identify if there is a specific ideology or victimology behind these attacks.MCDOWELL: Chief Manley, it's Dagen McDowell, in terms of the -- someone gaining bomb-making know-how, used to be the first indicator would be with someone who served in the military, but nowadays, you can actually learn these skills easily on the internet. How does that complicate your investigation?MANLEY: Well, I do think that it affords, obviously, a lot of other people, but the know-how of how to build some of these devices, but as you all just said, the person that is constructing these devices does have a certain level of skill because they are successfully building these devices and then delivering them to their target locations without having them either explode during construction or delivery.So, we are dealing with someone who has a certain level of know-how, and again, our focus is to see if there's any connection between the three- victim locations that we have so far or those that were victimized by this person, so we can see if there's a specific ideology or if these are, in fact, random attacks.JAIN: Chief Manley --MANLEY: Go ahead.JAIN: Chief Manley, this is Ankur, I'm just curious, when you have these types of attacks which are now conducted by individuals instead of organized crime, I mean, what tools do you guys need as a police department to help identify these types of threats beforehand that we can -- we can try to work on?MANLEY: You know, really, the best thing that we have is the cooperation of the community. Letting us know if things look suspicious, letting us know if someone that they are friends with or associate with or that they follow, is turning to extreme views or making threats, and this is relevant whether it'd be attacks on our schools or what we are dealing with here in Austin, right now, this individual that's, you know, placing bomb explosive packages on people's front porch.BARTIROMO: Chief Manley, we will check in again as news develops. We so appreciate you joining us this morning, thank you.MANLEY: Great, thank you.BARTIROMO: Chief Brian Manley, joining us there. We are also watching Pennsylvania this morning, voting begins for the Congressional Special Election. Eric Shawn is in Mount Lebanon in Pennsylvania this morning. He's got the latest there, Eric, good morning to you.ERIC SHAWN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria, how are you? Less than 20 minutes or so, this polling place behind me will open and the voting will begin. You know, the big question here in this district, will the white working-class voters who abandoned Hillary Clinton, will they return to the Democratic Party or will they stick with the GOP here in Trump country? That is the question, and the nation is watching.This race in the 18th Congressional District, of course, pits Conor Lamb, he's 33 years old, an Ivy Leaguer, former marine, former federal prosecutor, against 4th term State Representative Rick Saccone, and they both are going after the blue collar workers, the so-called Reagan Democrats who support President Trump.Lamb, he's no progressive, he is a moderate, supports the second amendment, is against banning assault weapons and he wants to dump Nancy Pelosi. As for Saccone, he says he was Trump, before Trump was Trump. Last night, he really went after liberal saying they, "have a hatred for our country" and in his words, a hatred for God. This is a very heavily unionized area, of course, of coal miners and the steelworkers, which means both are going after the union vote.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CONOR LAMB, DEMOCRATIC GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE, PENNSYLVANIA: This is a time in our country where many of our most important promises seemed to be up for grabs. It's not just the minors. It's all organized labor. It's the pensions of many of our labor unions and it's also things like Social Security and Medicare that applied to every American.RICK SACCONE, REPUBLICAN GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE, PENNSYLVANIA: Union leadership has put out that misinformation over and over. Remember, this is the same union leadership that supported President Obama who's trying to kill the coal miners, the coal industry and supported Hillary Clinton.(END VIDEO CLIP)SHAWN: Saccone is going after economic issues, yesterday, toward a candy factory with Donald Trump Jr., and they wore those kinds of hairnets because you can't get to have the hair going in the Easter Bunnies (INAUDIBLE) Easter Bunnies. So, they were trying to focus on the economic issues. And while National (INAUDIBLE) say this is a referendum on President Trump, Donald Trump Jr., the President's son, said he does not think that is true.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP JR., ELDEST SON OF PRESIDENT TRUMP: Just because D.J.T. isn't on this ticket, just because it's a special election, doesn't mean it doesn't matter. If you have a turnover in 2018, you're going to have years of just obstructionist policies. All these great stuff with tax reform, all the jobs, it can go like that.(END VIDEO CLIP)SHAWN: And what will go like that happens to be this district, ironically, Maria, because of redistricting, the district will disappear in November. So, whoever wins tonight, will likely have to run in another district next time, so we will see what happens. Polls close at 8:00 p.m., back to you in New York.BARTIROMO: And Eric -- yes, we'll be watching an important race there. Eric Shawn, thank you. Coming up, Goldman Sachs, apparent and abrupt decision seems to be paving the way for the big bank's next CEO, taking over, after Lloyd Blankfein's planned departure. We will explain. And then, billion-dollar brand, the ride-sharing company, Lyft, is racing past a big milestone, growing faster than Uber, back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Defense Secretary James Mattis, making an unannounced trip to Afghanistan, overnight. Cheryl Casone with the details. Cheryl.CASONE: He did, Maria. Secretary Mattis is in Kabul at this hour, hoping to revise peace talks with the Taliban. He says that driving the Taliban to the negotiating table is key to winning the complex. Mattis believes victory is still possible, saying both sides are tired of fighting.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MATTIS: Working to achieve a reconciliation, a political reconciliation, not a military victory. A victory will be a political reconciliation.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Mattis is going to be meeting with the president of Afghanistan and top U.S. commanders in that area.Well, General Electric did not pay a cash bonus to its top executives last year for the first time in the company's history. This comes after the company's poor result in 2017. The only exception was head of G.E. Aviation, David Joyce, he received a cash bonus of 1.4 million last year. Meanwhile, JPMorgan has lowered, Maria, as you reported a few moments ago, its target price on G.E. to $11.00 from $14 a share. All right. So, the stock closed at 15-10 last night in the premarket, it's 14.78 right now, pressure down two percent on G.E. in the premarket.And then Goldman Sachs clearing the way for a successor to its longtime CEO, Lloyd Blankfein. He is David Solomon, who incidentally, also moonlight as a D.J. Here he is on his Instagram page mixing some electronic dance music at night clubs as D.J. D-Sol. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: A pleasure to see you. Solomon became next in line to replace Lloyd Blankfein after his rival for the top job, Harvey Schwartz, abruptly announced that he's going to be retiring next month. So, we shall see. Lloyd Blankfein, of course, is still in the chief's chair right now. Shares of Goldman Sachs are up six percent so far this year.Finally, this, right-hailing app, Lyft, says it made over $1 billion in revenue last year. Lyft is now growing at three times the rate of Uber. Lyft says that it's now doing more than 10 million rides per week, Maria.BARTIROMO: Great story.CASONE: Uber's had a lot of problems. And I think Lyft is benefitting.BARTIROMO: That Lyft is the one that the Saudi's invested in, Ankur?ANKUR JAIN, FOUNDER, KAIROS: I got say, what's incredible about this is Lyft saw the opportunity when Uber started flipping and took advantage of it. Many founders would have let that opportunity go and these guys have done an incredible job of that come back.BARTIROMO: (INAUDIBLE) was one of the early investors. Obviously, the Softbank went the other way and went to big on Uber.JAIN: And then made a big bet on Didi, which Lyft's international partner. And so, to see Lyft continue to grow despite those setbacks is pretty exciting.BARTIROMO: All right. We'll take -- yes?MCDOWELL: A brand name is only as good as the product, Kodak, for example.BARTIROMO: Good analysis. We will take a break. When we come back, putting down the phone and picking up a passport, a new travel company is trying to get smartphone addicts to break the habit, at least for a little while. Back in a minute.JESSICA VILCHIS, TENNIS CHANNEL REPORTER: Welcome back to another Tennis Channel COURT REPORT, a special presentation for Fox Business, I'm Jessica Vilchis. Well, day six of the fifth of major, both defending champions in action but only one made it to the round of 16. Roger Federal has looked calm and confident all week in the desert and the Swiss start ease Filip Krajinovic to advance. Six aces and five breaks for Federer in a straight sets victory.Angelique Kerber enjoyed a return to form in 2018, and the German had just too much for Elena Vesnina, the number 10 seen sending the reigning women's champion packing after an hour and 39 minutes on court.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ELENA VESNINA, RUSSIAN TENNIS PLAYER: I think the match was on the really high level from both of us. You know, of course, the first set was really important and also first two games in the second set. So, yes, it's good to be in next round.(END VIDEO CLIP)VILCHIS: And don't forget Tennis Channel's live coverage from Indian Wells continues Tuesday at 1:00 p.m. Easter. I'm Jessica Vilchis.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Focusing on fun, not phones. One company taking travel to a whole new level, by not allowing customers to bring their cellphones on vacation. Joining us now is Zach Beattie, he's Off The Grid Founder and CEO. Zach, good to see you.ZACH BEATTIE, CEO AND FOUNDER, OFF THE GRID: Thank you. Great to be here.BARTIROMO: I have my phone.BEATTIE: Yes, everyone had them during the break. It's so weird.BARTIROMO: Yes, I know.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: So, where did you get inspiration for this idea, for this company?BEATTIE: Yes. I come from the world of V.C.-fueled, Silicon Valley-based tech companies, and I was the guy who used to sleep with my phone in our arm's reach, you know, sometimes under my pillow.BARTIROMO: Oh, God!BEATTIE: And I think it just started to take a toll, like, emotionally and physically, my posture, my eyes. And I'm an avid traveler and I thought the best memories I had were when, you know, I didn't have wi-fi when I was abroad and I could just completely unplug for a couple days.BARTIROMO: It's hard to unplug. Is it working? Are you seeing people put down their phone and pick up a passport?BEATTIE: Yes, it's working. So, people are one excited to have a reason to unplug. Because I think it's kind of hard to do on your own. So, you can say I'm going to try to get away from my phone but when you're with a group of people who are doing the same thing it becomes much easier.HILSENRATH: As a parent of teens, I'm looking for some advice here, what's the key in teenagers to unplug their phones?BEATTIE: We have to get the parents off first. We got to get the parents off the phones first. I think the key is just being really intentional about setting boundaries for yourself, so for instance, when you wake up making sure the phone is not in your bedroom, making sure it's not the first thing you see before you try to fall asleep or the last thing you see at night. So, setting boundaries and then saying, you know, once a year or twice a year I'm going to completely unplug for, you know, maybe four or five days even. It can be really healthy because it proves that you can do it, and then you bring that back into the rest of your life.JAIN: So, are you following this trend of deleting Instagram, deleting Facebook? Have you cut yourself off?BEATTIE: No, I actually love my phone. So, I love my phone, but I just wish that I treated it more like a car, where --BARTIROMO: And not like your best friend.BEATTIE: Not like my best friend, not like an extra limb, right? I want to use it when I need it, and like park it when I don't. And it's OK to own one and have one and to have social media but realize it's not always healthy to be on it six or seven hours a day.MCDOWELL: Like, if you walk around Miami early in the morning, you literally will see dozens of women on the beach with their friends taking photographs just for Instagram. They've get up before the sun came up and put makeup on and put body makeup all over their legs, and literally -- I'm like, who are these people? But again, that's where --BARTIROMO: Their selfies.MCDOWELL: Their entire sense of purpose is derived from how many people like a photo.BEATTIE: It's actually proven that when you take photos of experiences or plugged in the whole time, your memory of those experiences is worse. So, being really present without your device can actually help you remember those experiences.BARTIROMO: OK. But what if I have an emergency and I don't have my phone? Those idea that you call me to do, and an emergency, I need to make a phone call.BEATTIE: We swap the smart phone for dumb phones. So, you actually get an old brick phone in any case you need to make phone calls.BARTIROMO: OK.MCDOWELL: Where are you sending people in terms of vacation?BEATTIE: All over. So, we pick cities that were walkable and safe, and places that I personally just found would be tons of fun.HILSENRATH: So, why can't a person do this on their own? Say, I'm going to go to Lisbon.BEATTIE: I think you could. I 've tried. I've tried to that. That's really difficult. So, I think when you're with a group, you kind of have that group pressure to stay unplugged. I mean, you're setting an intention you can tell your employer, I'm going on off the grid. I'm unplugging intentionally for a week. That's the whole purpose of the trip.MCDOWELL: Well, the biggest problem is you need somebody in the group who can read a map. And if you don't have the automatic directions, you need somebody -- I'm good at very few things, but I can read some maps. And that's true, though, because you get lost -- you go to Venice, you'll be stuck at the end of an alley for five days.BARTIROMO: And this makes it so easy. Just go to Google Map.MCDOWELL: Yes, exactly.BEATTIE: We have a photographer and a guide on every trip. So, hopefully, that helps people to get them back and totally let go.BARTIROMO: I love it. Zach, great to see you.BEATTIE: Thank you so much.BARTIROMO: Thanks very much for joining us. Zach Beattie there. Still ahead, a new discovery, the home of shark week is now also the home of Chip and Joanna Gaines. I'm talking to Discovery CEO, David Zaslav, about the new powerhouse entertainment brand that's changing the way we watch televisions, next hour, right here MORNINGS WITH MARIA.

CHINA SETS UP 'BIG DATA' SYSTEM FOR PREVENTIVE POLICING IN XINJIANG: REPORTStates News ServiceFebruary 27, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 497 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Reported by Richard FinneyAuthorities in northwest China's volatile Xinjiang region are expanding their monitoring of the region's mostly Muslim Uyghurs, moving beyond surveillance cameras and facial-recognition systems to implement a "big data" system designed to predict offenses, an international rights group said in a report released Tuesday.The system draws information from multiple sourcesincluding police reports, vehicle checkpoints, banking and health-care records, and technological collection systemsinto a single program for police reference, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said in its report, titled "China: Big Data Fuels Crackdown in Minority Region."This "big data" program, called the Integrated Joint Operations Platform (IJOP), then aggregates the collected information and flags individuals considered a potential threat to Chinese control, HRW said."For the first time, we are able to demonstrate that the Chinese government's use of big data and predictive policing not only blatantly violates privacy rights, but also enables officials to arbitrarily detain people," Maya Wang, senior China researcher at HRW, said in its report."People in Xinjiang can't resist or challenge the increasingly intrusive scrutiny of their daily lives because most don't even know about this 'black box' program or how it works," Wang said.Already monitored in their daily lives by a vast network of cameras, Uyghur residents are now also subject to frequent visits at their homes by police, who note down signs of "unusual" activity or "untrustworthy" political or cultural views, including indications of "religious extremism," HRW said."One interviewee said that possession of many books, for example, would be reported to IJOP, if there is no ready explanation, such as having teaching as one's profession," the rights group said in its report.Electricity and phone use are also checked, together with purchasing habits, HRW said, adding that some of those flagged by IJOP are detained and sent to political re-education centers, where they are held indefinitely "without charge or trial."Sources interviewed by HRW said they had once observed the IJOP computer "generate lists of individuals to be rounded up by the police," the rights group said."One heard police saying that some of those on the list would be detained and/or sent to political education centers," HRW said.Around 120,000 ethnic Uyghurs are currently being held in political re-education camps in Xinjiang's Kashgar (in Chinese, Kashi) prefecture alone, a security official with knowledge of the situation told RFA in January.Xinjiangwhere Uyghurs complain of pervasive discrimination, religious repression, and cultural suppression under Chinese rulehas become one of the world's most heavily policed places and a testing ground for increasingly restrictive policies since the region's party chief Chen Quanguo was appointed to his post in August 2016.Load-Date: February 28, 2018End of Document

U.S. telecom companies may be caught in Trump’s brewing trade war with ChinaFierceWirelessMarch 14, 2018 Wednesday 12:24 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Questex Media Group LLC All Rights ReservedSection: ARTICLELength: 400 wordsByline: Mike DanoBodyAccording to a new Reuters report citing unnamed sources, President Trump is considering imposing tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese imports, specifically targeting the technology and telecommunications sectors.It’s unclear exactly how the possible action – which appears to still be in the planning stages and might not happen – could affect U.S. telecom companies. However, if Trump does impose tariffs on telecom equipment from China, the action likely would raise the price of that telecom equipment for U.S. companies. Further, the action could spark a response from China – the world’s largest wireless market.Already, Trump has imposed tariffs on aluminum and steel from China, though the Reuters article noted those tariffs aren’t as big as the ones that are currently being considered targeting telecom and technology.But Trump has clearly signaled his willingness to wade directly into the inner workings of the U.S. telecom industry. This week he issued a presidential order barring Broadcom from pursuing a purchase of Qualcomm, with his administration arguing such a transaction would impede the nation’s security and the United States’ role in the development of 5G technology – and specifically that it would allow China to take the lead in 5G.In response, Broadcom this morning said it would withdraw its offer for Qualcomm due to the order. “Although we are disappointed with this outcome, Broadcom will comply,” the company said in a statement.As The Wall Street Journal notes, Qualcomm raised the prospect of Broadcom’s threat to national security in a January letter to the U.S. Treasury Department’s Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS). Qualcomm’s concerns were shared by members of the CFIUS as well as by members of Congress, including Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn.Much of the discussion around China centers not only on a trade imbalance – Reuters noted China runs a $375 billion trade surplus with the United States – but also on China’s approach to intellectual property. Many argue that the Chinese government takes an unfair stance on IP from overseas companies and overly favors domestic suppliers.Importantly, Trump’s potential tariffs against China targeting telecom come amid dramatic upheavals in his administration.

Origin Sets New Strategic DirectionsPR NewswireMarch 8, 2018 Thursday 10:37 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1342 wordsDateline: BEIJING, March 8, 2018 Body Origin Agritech Ltd. (NASDAQ: SEED) ("the Company" or "Origin") an agricultural biotechnology trait and corn seed provider, today announced the newly appointed Chief Executive Officer Dr. Z. James Chen has set and discussed new strategic directions for the Company."With over 20 years of serving the agricultural industry in China, Origin has always been exploring the technology and market frontiers and has accumulated various leading technologies for the agricultural farmland in China. Although the delay in GMO technology commercialization as well as the weak corn seed market have delayed the financial realization of our key agribiotech and germplasm technologies, we are confident that our efforts over the last 20 years have already built the foundation for future growth despite the weak market conditions," discussed Dr. James Chen, "while we will continue to develop the agribiotech technologies as we wait for the final commercialization approval from the Chinese government, we will focus our effort on the e-commerce for the vast farmland in China applying blockchain technologies and foundation seed technologies, we believe our strategic advantages and past technology development will give us opportunities to be successful in these business areas."Below are three key strategic directions Dr. James Chen and new management team has set and discussed:1. E-commerce development for the vast farmland in ChinaAs a leading agriculture seed supplier over the last 20 years, Origin Agritech has built a strong brand name in the vast farmland across China and has involved in the e-commerce to provide seed products and services to the farmers. In addition to the typical advantages e-commerce can provide compared to the traditional distribution system, one of the key advantage e-commerce has for the seed business is the better ability to track the source of seed supply. With the new blockchain technologies, there is a potential that the detail original source of seed products can be tracked and documented. This could resolve the intellectual property pirating problems the Chinese farmers and seed providers face over the years. Under the new strategic cooperation with Elastos Foundation announced earlier, we will start our e-commerce business development facing the vast Chinese farmland with the products including but not limited to the agricultural inputs.2. Foundation corn seed technology business developmentSince the beginning, Origin has been working on the development of germplasm and hybrid corn seed varieties. The company has built a large collection of diverse corn seed germplasm, which we believe is the largest among the Chinese corn seed companies. Also, we have established a database system with the characterization of these germplasms in our collection. We believe our unique elite lines will enable us to create competitive hybrid corn seed products for the Chinese seed market and possibly for the global corn seed market.Since most local seed companies have no or limited R&D capability, they will rely on the seed technology developed by a company with foundation seed technologies. Origin is in the unique position to become a foundation corn seed company, similar to the success of foundation seed companies in the U.S., since Origin is one of very few companies in China with not only large diverse germplasm collection but also the most advanced breeding technologies, including the largest Doubled Haploid program in China. As the new strategic direction, we will increase our business development effort for our foundation corn seed technologies and become the first and only foundation seed company in China.3. Further development of our biotech and genome editing seed technologiesOrigin has been the leading biotech seed technology company in China and has successfully developed three leading GM traits. While we are waiting for the final commercialization approval from the Chinese government, we cooperate with the government agencies in implementing the previously announced commercialization plan for GM corn seed technologies outlined in the 13th Five-Year Plan, which ends in 2020. In addition, recent advancement in genome editing technology opens up tremendous new opportunities in the seed industry. We are uniquely positioned to capture this opportunity to expand our scope of technology offerings. Our leading technology platform established for biotech development, including DNA and protein engineering, efficient commercial scale plant transformation and versatile trait-efficacy testing capabilities, can be seamlessly utilized for genome editing, and has already enabled us to jump start the project."We believe the new strategic directions set by the new management team represents the key technology and market advantages built over the last two decades and we trust we can build new businesses while waiting for the final commercialization approval of agribiotech technology in China," said Dr. Gengchen Han, Chairman of Origin Agritech, "the new management team's new strategic directions have full support from our board and we look forward to new Origin post commercial seed business divestiture"About Origin Agritech LimitedOrigin Agritech Limited, founded in 1997 and headquartered in Zhong-Guan-Cun (ZGC) Life Science Park in Beijing, is China's leading agricultural biotechnology company, specializing in crop seed breeding and genetic improvement. Leading the development of crop seed biotechnologies, Origin Agritech's phytase corn was the first transgenic corn to receive the Bio-Safety Certificate from China's Ministry of Agriculture. Over the years, Origin has established a robust biotechnology seed pipeline including products with glyphosate tolerance and pest resistance (Bt) traits. Origin operates breeding stations nationwide located in key crop-planting regions. Product lines are vertically integrated for corn.

Marco Rubio, R-Florida, issued the following news release:U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), Chairman of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, will hold a hearing tomorrow titled "Tibet 'From All Angles': Protecting Human Rights, Defending Strategic Access, and Challenging China's Export of Censorship Globally." The Commission will hear from Dhondup Wangchen (alternate spelling: Dondrub Wangchen), a Tibetan filmmaker and former political prisoner, and other experts who will provide information about the current situation facing Tibetans in China and offer their recommendations on how to promote access, human rights, and better American diplomacy on issues concerning Tibetan autonomous areas of China within U.S.-China relations.Tibet remains one of the most sensitive issues in U.S.-China relations. Inside the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) and Tibetan autonomous areas, Chinese officials have increased restrictions on the religious and cultural life of Tibetans. At the same time, the Chinese government exports its authoritarianism abroad, pressuring foreign academic institutions who invite the Dalai Lama to speak on campus as well as businesses who mention his name or the TAR as a distinct region in China.There are more than 500 records of Tibetan political or religious prisoners currently in detention who are in the CECC's Political Prisoner Database--a staggering figure that is far from exhaustive.These issues--along with the future question of the Dalai Lama's succession, restricted access to the TAR and Tibet autonomous regions for diplomats and journalists, and China's efforts to control water resources and expand its military presence on the Tibetan plateau--complicate U.S. strategic options and human rights diplomacy.At a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing earlier today, Rubio raised concerns about the threat posed by China's growing influence.The hearing will be livestreamed via the CECC's YouTube Channel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRAT_7MIzUolORlJhYBTzHA).Hearing Details:Tibet "From All Angles": Protecting Human Rights, Defending Strategic Access, and Challenging China's Export of Censorship GloballyWednesday, February 14301 Russell Senate Office Building10 a.m. - 12 p.m.Witnesses:Dhondup Wangchen: Tibetan filmmaker and recently escaped political prisonerTenzin Dorjee: Commissioner, U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) and Associate Professor, California State University, FullertonMichael J.

Still, concerns about the country's debt levels have only deepened. "In the short-run, growth, as defined by changes in gross domestic product (GDP), can be increased by more lending and investing," write Benn Steil and Benjamin Della Rocca of the Council of Foreign Relations in a new blogpost.             "In the longer-term, however, lending and investing can't boost GDP if it results in bad debt that is properly written down. The big question is how much bad debt China currently has, and how much more it will be producing in the years ahead."By some estimates, they add, China's true growth rate, after taking the bad debt into account, is barely half the reported 6.9% clip. The country's total non-financial sector debt, which includes household, corporate and government debt, will surge to nearly 300% of GDP by 2022, up from 242% in 2016.Steil and Della Rocca examine recipients of the recent wave of lending to "gauge whether China has been creating good debt-debt that will produce positive returns-or bad."They find that profits at private-sector firms rose 18% between 2011 and 2016, while profits at state-owned enterprises that are far less efficient plunged 33%. At the same time, the share of corporate liability growth accounted for by the state sector soared from 59% in 2010 to 80% by 2016, as the chart below shows, a terrible omen for productivity."Given the evidence that President Xi Jinping has abandoned any pretense of concern with NPLs, and our evidence that China is shoveling new loans to companies with the least ability to pay them back, we think China is heading towards a debt crisis," Steil and Della Rocca warn.Council on Foreign RelationsNOW WATCH: Bitcoin can be a bubble and still change the worldSee Also:• America's student debt crisis is worse than we thought• Fed officials are scrambling to figure out how to fight the next recession• A top Fed official says a policy shift once seen as radical is 'not nearly as scary as you might think'SEE ALSO: A report coauthored by a People's Bank of China researcher says China's economy is about to hit a wallLoad-Date: February 11, 2019End of Document

AT HOMELAND SECURITY HEARING, PORTMAN PRESSES DHS ON CYBERSECURITY, PSI REPORT ON DRUG TRAFFICKERS SHIPPING FENTANYL THROUGH THE MAILStates News ServiceFebruary 7, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 1928 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Ohio Senator Rob Portman:U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH), during todays Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC) roundtable on Reauthorizing DHS: Positioning DHS to Address New and Emerging Threats to the Homeland, questioned Department of Homeland Security leadership on ways in which they are working to improve the departments ability to respond to new and emerging threats, such as cybersecurity vulnerabilities and the shipment of deadly drugs like fentanyl through the United States Postal Service. Last month, Portman released a shocking bipartisan report that details how drug traffickers exploit vulnerabilities in our international mail system to easily ship synthetic drugs like fentanyl from China into the United States. His legislation, the STOP Act, is designed to help save lives by keeping these deadly drugs out of our communities. DHS Deputy Secretary Elaine Duke confirmed again that the department supports Portmans legislation.Transcript of his questioning can be found below, and a video can be found here.Senator Portman : Id like to piggyback on the cyber issue because one of the questions I wanted to ask was about workforce. As you know, back in 2014, we wrote bipartisan legislationthis committee strongly supported itto upgrade your abilities in cyberspace. Im very concerned about the lack of retention and also being able to attract top-flight talent. That was three years ago. We asked that GAO do a report three years out. Im pleased to say, Mr. Scott, that we got the report just a few days ago, which is great. I saw it for the first time last night. Your report basically says that the DHS has missed all kinds of deadlines. I understand the need to help state and local. I understand the need to help our own, but if we dont have the personnel to do it, it makes it incredibly challenging. So quickly, Mr. Scott, tell us what are your specific recommendations right now as to how we get DHS back on track and begin to attract this workforce we need.Mr. Scott : Thank you, Senator Portman. As you mentioned, just yesterday we issued a report really highlighting the urgent need for the department to take additional steps to identify its cybersecurity positions and critical skill requirements. In summary, the department has made some progress categorizing and signing certain codes to some of its cybersecurity positions. There are also some concerns about the accuracy about the information they provided. For example, I think they estimated about 95 percent of their positions were identified. We came in and did an analysis and found that its really around 79 percent because the department basically excluded some of the vacant positions. They didnt count those in the math. We made six recommendations including for DHS to enhance the procedures around identifying these vacant positions, improving their workforce data, and developing specific plans to identify and report on critical cyber needs. The department concurred with all six recommendations, so our expectations within the next two years or so is that they should be further along in addressing some of these critical cyber workforce needs.Senator Portman : Secretary Duke, one of your recommendations was to have accountability. In other words, have someone responsible for every component, and I think thats something that you two should focus on given your management responsibilities. Second, I was involved in 2002 with the legislation that created the department, as some of you know. I have wondered sometimes since then whether we have created a behemoth, something that is just too difficult to manage, but having said that, the risks that we face in an increasingly dangerous and volatile world I think require us to have one agency to focus on keeping us safe. At the time, we did try to align the committee structure with the department, unsuccessfully. Again, in the 9/11 report, this was talked about, but I agree with what the Chairman and my other colleagues have said about that, [which] is that it is difficult for you. And the Chairman talked about the number of testimonies you have had to give over the last year and the inability for you all to focus on your core function because you are dealing with so many different committees and subcommittees. So I do think it is a good idea, Mr. Chairman, and the first step in it is to have an authorization from this committee because we have the bulk of the jurisdiction, and if we arent taking that jurisdiction seriously and ensuring that we do have authorizations, were going to continue to have even more erosion of that responsibility. So, this is good. We tried this back in 2011. Susan Collins and Joe Lieberman tried it. We were able to get it out of committee. We were never able to get it across the floor. So, Im glad you are doing this, and this authorization, as I understand, is going to be a little narrower to try to avoid issues. I hope we can do this in a bipartisan basis as kind of a first step towards a much broader issue here, which is: how do you manage this department that has so many different silos, as Mr. Kelly said earlier, and make it work better as a single entity? This will help.On oversight, Ive got to raise, as Chairman of the PSI Committeethe Permanent Subcommittee on Investigationsyou all have not been responsive on a few of our requests and we push, we push, and we write letters, but let me just give you three quickly. One is, way back in April of 2017, we asked some questions about the management of the Chief Information Office. Im not going to go into the details because we dont make these investigations public typically until we report, but we need that information. We have been given a minimal amount of documents, most of which are not at all responsive to the request, so we need help there. Second is, back in December, we asked about your privately-run immigration detention facilities. Again, not to get into the details but we need that information, and you guys have not been responsive. You have not produced any documents. We have made phone calls, sent emails, status updates. We need that informationthat was back on December 6th. Then finally, January of this year. Just a couple of weeks ago, we asked you guys for information on the procedures to protect unaccompanied alien children. You remember we had this hearing and a report on this topic and have deep concern about the lack of accountability. This was Senator McCaskill and myself. We are simply looking for what we were told at the time you were doing, which was a memorandum of agreement that you were going to have between HHS and DHS. We were told it would be done a year ago almost, February 22, 2017. You still havent done it. So, we need to figure out a way to get that information to us, figure out why you havent accomplished it, and what we can do to push DHS and HHS to get that memorandum of understanding to protect these kids. So on all these issues, can I get a commitment from you all today? I want to ask for two weeks, but I will be much more generous. I will ask for four weeks. But we need to have a response.Elaine Duke : My apologies, Senator. I was not personally aware of that and I do commit that to you. I will give this committee an update next week on all three in that timeline for giving you that information.Senator Portman : Finally, Mr. Chairman this will be my last point, with regard to the hearing and the report from last week on the fact that dangerous chemicals, synthetic opioids, are coming into our country through our own U.S. mail system and your Customs and Border Protection: people are not able to stop it because they do not have the information. We need to pass the STOP Act. My colleagues for the most part here are cosponsors of that and I think would agree with me, but we also ask for some other things in that report which is that DHS work better with the Chinese government to shut down these labs, to stop the shippers, to deal with it in China. And I know you were, along with Attorney General Sessions, at a session on this broader issue of securities issues with China last year. Can you tell us has that happened with regard to China and their willingness to help us to stop this poison from coming into our communities by stopping it at the source?Elaine Duke : We have made progress with China. The biggest thing is that the percentage of packages that we can track, which is key to shutting it down, has over doubled and we are making more progress. We need to be able to track all of them but the Chinese government has been very cooperative in that they do notSenator Portman : Has not been very cooperative?Elaine Duke : They have been very cooperative in being able to track packages.Senator Portman : How are they being cooperative?Elaine Duke : They are helping us institute a tracking system with the mail service. We do not have a mail service tracking system in the United States and there isnt an international one, so we have very good tracking of DHS, DHL, UPS, and FedEx.Senator Portman : You have 100 percent tracking there because you require them to do it, and we should require the Post Office to do the same thing, but only half of the packages coming in of that increased volume, admittedly from China, have that kind of advanced electronic data on them. So they are not there yet, just so you know, and my goal is not just to have that tracking information, which is very important and that is what the STOP Act focuses on, but how do we actually get China to do what they say they want to do, because after our hearing in this committee room a Chinese government official spokespeople said, yes, we want to cooperate more with the United States. To me, that seems like that was an extension of some kind of olive branch to you all to get with them and to begin to crackdown. Not just to have the codes and to have the information, but to actually stop these labs. There are thousands of them in China. We know that. They are creating this poison that is coming into our community and beginning to prosecute some of these people who are involved. We have two indictments. They have yet to arrest these individuals that we have indicted over here who are Chinese nationals. My question is what more can we do on that front and what have you done?Elaine Duke : We have been working them regularly, principally through the Department of State, in terms of working with China. But it isnt a China problem. We have an opioid conference going on now in Miami that I leave for tonight to look at how we can do enforcement. As you know, it is hard to discuss everything in this environment, but the transit to some countries south of us, we are looking at that and stopping it not only in China but the transit. And then also the presidents council on trying to do the deterrence for opioids. We support the STOP Act. We are hitting it from many angles. It is a challenging problem.Senator Portman: We could go on and on, but I would just say, your own people tell us that primarily through our own mail system and primarily from China right nowand understandably there is a lot of transshipment going on right now and maybe even some new routes being developedbut we know we have got a huge issue right here. It is the number one killer in my home state of Ohio. Now, 60 percent of overdose deaths this last year were from fentanyl and carfentanil. Thank you for pushing the Chinese more on helping to stop this at the source.###Load-Date: February 7, 2018End of Document| About LexisNexis | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions | Copyright © 2021 LexisNexis Page 26 of 331China has found a new way to block banned words  Page 28 of 331China criticizes US moves on intellectual property, telecoms  Page 30 of 331China criticizes US moves on intellectual property, telecoms  Page 32 of 331Vietnam Stands to See Modest Wins if China, U.S. Start Trade War  Page 35 of 331The global number of cellular IoT subscribers reached 648 million at the end of 2017  Page 37 of 331Germany urges release of detained China human rights lawyer  Page 40 of 331FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION UNDER THREAT  Page 42 of 331China's president had 2 books about artificial intelligence on his shelf in his New Year speech  Page 45 of 331Gridsum Co-Organizes Judicial Session of Tsinghua University's RONG Series Big Data Forum  Page 48 of 331China Interdye and China Textile Printing to Take Place in April in Shanghai; The event will focus on the twin themes of Science and Technological Innovation an....  Page 51 of 331China isn't taking Alibaba's latest rejection very well  Page 53 of 331Jim Cramer: Trump's Broadcom Move Really Means 'China, Stay Out!'  Page 55 of 331RUBIO CHAIRS HEARING ON PROTECTING HUMAN RIGHTS IN TIBET, CHALLENGING CHINA'S EXPORT OF CENSORSHIP GLOBALLY  Page 57 of 331Sen.
