World's biggest IPO in 2 years shows China's 5G ambitionsCNN WireAugust 8, 2018 Wednesday 8:47 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 400 wordsByline: By Daniel ShaneDateline: HONG KONG (CNNMoney) BodyHONG KONG (CNNMoney) --  China's latest blockbuster IPO is set to help the country become a 5G powerhouse.Telecom company China Tower's Hong Kong debut on Wednesday is the world's biggest stock listing since Postal Savings Bank of China nearly two years ago. China Tower raised $6.9 billion from investors, valuing it at nearly $28 billion. The state-owned firm is central to China's ambitions to become a global leader in 5G technology, which will eventually be used to run self-driving cars, virtual reality and smart cities. China Tower is the world's biggest developer of cell-phone tower sites. The company was formed out of the networks of China's three big, state-owned wireless carriers and has a near monopoly in the country. "Its role in rolling-out 5G-capable infrastructure is very important," said Kenny Liew, a telecommunications analyst at research firm Fitch Solutions. By placing responsibility for building these networks into the hands of one company, the Chinese government is hoping that 5G can be rolled out more quickly and efficiently, Liew added. A study released by Deloitte this week found that China has a strong track record of rapidly building telecommunications networks.5G will need thousands of new wireless sites, many of which must be put on lamp posts and utility poles in densely populated areas.China Tower built roughly 460 cell sites a day last year, according to Deloitte. Whereas the United States today has fewer than five cell sites per 10,000 people, China has more than 14.China Tower says it plans to use about 60% of its IPO proceeds to build out and improve network infrastructure. The Chinese government wants 5G deployed on a large commercial scale by 2020, and China's major carriers have all promised to meet that goal.Despite the buzz around 5G, China Tower is the latest big tech listing to get a lukewarm reaction from investors in Hong Kong. The company's shares were priced at the bottom end of its IPO range. And on their trading debut in Hong Kong on Wednesday, they traded flat. Last month, Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi went public with a lower-than-expected valuation of about $54 billion. The shares sank as much as 5.9% on their first day of trading after also earlier pricing at the bottom of their range. -- Julia Horowitz contributed to this report. TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Bluster aside, US and China vulnerable to pain from tariffsAssociated Press InternationalJuly 5, 2018 Thursday 7:09 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: WASHINGTON DATELINELength: 1196 wordsByline: By PAUL WISEMAN and CHRISTOPHER RUGABER, AP Economics WritersDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) - The U.S. and Chinese governments have been flashing a lot of bravado just before firing the first shots in a conflict that risks erupting into a mutually damaging trade war."China will not bow in the face of threats and blackmail, nor will it be shaken in its resolve to defend global free trade," a spokesman for Beijing's Commerce Ministry declared Thursday, one day before the two sides were to subject billions of dollars of each other's goods to punishing tariffs.President Donald Trump, who ran for the White House on a vow to force China and other nations to reform their policies, has insisted that a trade war would be easy to win.Yet among the people and business in both countries that are suddenly under threat from higher costs, closed-off markets and deep uncertainties, there's far less confidence. A trade war between the world's two biggest economies will leave casualties - from makers of musical instruments to farmers in America's Midwest to a manufacturer of soldering irons south of Shanghai.In some areas and industries, pain is already being felt."There's going to be an awful lot of battles lost on the way," said Tim Velde, a fourth-generation farmer in western Minnesota's Yellow Medicine County who is bracing for China's tariffs on American soybeans. "I don't see anybody winning."Tong Feibing, general manager of China's Ningbo Top East Technology Co., which makes soldering irons and had been exporting 30 percent of its output to the United States - before sales plunged in advance of tariffs - is worried."There is a chance the company will lose money and might bankrupt," Tong warned. "I will do whatever I can, including layoffs."At 12:01 a.m. Eastern time Friday, the United States was set to slap tariffs on $34 billion in Chinese products. And Beijing was ready to respond in kind. From there, the hostilities could escalate quickly and drastically. Trump has threatened to slap tariffs on up to $450 billion in Chinese imports - nearly 90 percent of all goods China sent the U.S. last year - if Beijing continues to retaliate and doesn't yield to Trump's demands.The Trump administration wants China to drop what it calls its predatory drive to supplant American technological dominance, through tactics that include forcing U.S. companies to reveal trade secrets in return for access to the Chinese market and committing cyber-theft.Trade wars can draw blood in several ways. Exporters face taxes on what they ship across the Pacific. This makes their products more expensive and less competitive.And importers must pay more for the foreign machinery and components they buy - and then decide whether they can afford to pass along those higher costs to their customers.In choosing the Chinese goods to tax, the Trump administration tried to limit the impact on American consumers. It aimed instead mainly at industrial products. Yet those tariffs will hurt American companies that rely on Chinese-made components and machinery.Most Americans wouldn't recognize the vast majority of the Chinese imports that the Trump administration is targeting. But they would recognize the companies that use them.PetSmart, for example, says the administration's tariffs will inflate the cost of imported water filters for home aquariums. Jacuzzi has said its hot tubs and bathtubs will be affected by higher U.S. tariffs on pumps. Newell Brands, which owns Rubbermaid, says Americans may face higher costs for its imported FoodSaver vacuum sealer products, which are used to store and preserve food.Moog Music Inc. in Asheville, North Carolina, known for synthesizers used by the likes of David Bowie and Michael Jackson, warns that the tariffs on imported Chinese circuit boards and other parts will "immediately and drastically" increase the cost of its instruments and might require layoffs. In a worst-case scenario, Moog said, it might have to move some manufacturing overseas. It's urging employees to call their congressional representatives to protest the tariffs.In southern China, a company that makes LED-lighting is scrambling to find alternatives to the U.S. market, which used to buy 30 percent of its output. The company's salespeople have looked instead for buyers from Europe, Southeast Asia and the Middle East, according to company manager Yang Zhuangnin. He said the company, based near Hong Kong, will try to make improvements to draw American buyers despite higher prices."Another method we have been thinking about is to send almost-finished products to another country, and then do the simple production there and re-export to the United States," Yang said. "Clients may have other ways and suggestions. We'll see."In selecting American products for retaliatory tariffs, Beijing chose many that would inflict political as well as economic pain. Its target list is heavy on American farm exports - a shot at Trump supporters in the nation's heartland. Farmers are also well-represented by lobbyists and powerful members of Congress who might be able to influence the Trump administration.Don Bloss, who grows corn, soybeans, sorghum and what on 3,5000 acres of rolling land in southeastern Nebraska, says the tariff threat has already driven down crop prices."Right now," Bloss said, "it's a matter of how much money you're going to lose, not how much money you're going to make."Automakers could endure pain, too, once China applies higher tariffs to vehicles from the United States. Beijing already imposes a 25 percent tariff on imported autos. Retaliatory tariffs would likely double that tax, said Kristen Dziczek of the Center for Automotive Research, an industry think tank. That could mean trouble for BMW, Mercedes, Tesla and Ford, the largest exporters of vehicles from the U.S. to China.All would likely raise prices, which would slow sales and could force production cuts. A result could be layoffs, Dziczek said, especially at a BMW SUV factory near Spartanburg, South Carolina, and a Mercedes SUV plant near Tuscaloosa, Alabama. In addition, the SUVs those plants make include parts from overseas that would be subject to increased U.S. tariffs, further raising prices, she said.Trump's trade team insists that the United States wields a decisive edge over China in a trade war: China sells much more to America ($524 billion last year) than Americans sell China ($188 billion) and so is more vulnerable to tariffs.But trade analysts are skeptical that Beijing will blink first. The question, said Philip Levy of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, is which side has more political tolerance for pain."From China's perspective, this is an unacceptable foreign assault that they will resist at all costs," said Levy, who was a trade adviser in President George W. Bush's White House. "From the perspective of U.S. businesses and farms, this is a self-inflicted wound. That will lead to mounting pressure on members of Congress, which does retain the power to do something about it."___Associated Press Writers Steve Karnowski in Minneapolis; David Pitt in Des Moines, Iowa; Tom Krisher in Detroit; Christopher Bodeen and Joe McDonald and AP researcher Fu Ting in Beijing contributed to this report.Load-Date: July 6, 2018End of Document

World leaders from across the globe gathered at Chateau de la Muette to address the significant role the international community is playing in shaping policy and regulatory frameworks for the financial technologies of blockchain and distributed ledger technology (DLT). Some of the featured guests included OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurría, Prime Minister of Mauritius, Mr. Pravind Kumar Jugnauth, the Prime Minister of Serbia, Ms. Ana Brnabic, the Premier of Bermuda, Mr. E. David Burt and Slovenia's State Secretary, Mr.Tadej Slapnik. Around 400 senior decision-makers from the public and private sectors attended this event and discussed how blockchain can impact government activities and the world economy in various sectors such as finance, healthcare, energies, agriculture, cyber security, and corporate and social governance. As an honored guest speaker, Gingkoo's CEO Mr. William Zuo, was invited to give a keynote speech at this high-level forum.Prime ministers and member states jointly and openly discussed the potentials for blockchain to support and benefit government activities and industry. In particular, Serbia's prime minister, Ms. Ana Brnabic, shared the story of how digitalization has transformed her country from a state suffering from financial insolvency to a nation of flourishing businesses, rapid economic growth, and a Balkan start-up hub.In Mr. Zuo's speech starting the session on "Blockchain and the financial services", he talked about the blockchain technology industry's achievements in China and the Chinese government's regulatory actions and policy regarding crypto assets and the underlying DLT technology. As an industry leader in China's blockchain space, Gingkoo has designed and deployed various use cases of blockchain in the real world economy, applying permission chain solutions to cross-border payment solutions, Smart Tax, supply chain finance, blockchain-based ABS, Regtech in the financial business sector, etc. Gingkoo has also been a distinguished MIIT member, promoting innovation to support SME enterprises.Mr. Zuo introduced blockchain in these financial sector business scenarios, establishing a track record for serving the real economy. In a country where food safety and the provenance of products are important issues, Gingkoo became the first company in China to successfully deploy a user case combining blockchain and IOT technologies for food traceability in rice production and distribution. Gingkoo's rice traceability solution is leading global efforts to create safer and more transparent supply chains. The company is also working with the local government of Zhejiang province to develop smart city solution for garbage classification.During his speech, Mr. Zuo used the Gartner Hype Cycle approach to illustrate the life cycle of technology adoption. He believes blockchain technology is still at an early stage:Peak of Inflated Expectations. In order to survive and reachPlateau of Productivity,government agencies, enterprises and academic institutions will have to collaborate on creating a fair and orderly environment for new innovations to develop.Gingkoo's vision is to establish a fast decentralized infrastructure for trustable value exchange that can expand the application of blockchain technology to serve the real economy. Mr. Zuo believes that blockchain can be disruptive and inclusive at the same time, and that we need to better leverage its feature of interoperability to be a connector for different businesses.As a matter of fact, Mr. Angel Gurría OECD Secretary-General, has expressed the same opinion when talking about blockchain's role in the transformational digital economy. He cited global efforts to prove blockchain's capacity to improve transparency, accountability and efficiency in public services." Georgia, Honduras and Kenya are focusing on a blockchain-based registry to bring integrity to land registers, while Sweden is conducting trials which could help bring the time it takes to buy property from several months down to a few hours. At the same time, the City of Zug in Switzerland, is developing a blockchain-based identity management solution," said Mr. Gurría.He encouraged the civil society, organized labor, international organizations, and entrepreneurs to keep pushing the technological boundaries, saying, "These efforts are all in their early stages, but the potential is clear. Blockchain is part of a wider digital economic transformation. Governments need to make sure they understand the technology and keep up to date with developments."Among other prestigious speakers, Ms. Arunma Oteh, Head of Treasury at the World Bank, discussed their issuance of the world's first blockchain bonds of 110 million Australian dollars (about 68 million euros), on a digital platform supported by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia in August this year."At the World Bank, we are constantly looking for new ways to make markets more efficient and to take advantage, cautiously, of new technologies," said Oteh. "The blockchain has a lot of potential. It's up to us to make sure we use it to do good."China is leading global efforts in high-tech innovation in finance, technology, communication and many other business fields. Chinese are delighted to see world leaders come together to recognize the potential of blockchain to increase global productivity, and bring about new ways of doing business across a range of sectors. As Gurria said, "The discussions, ideas and lessons learnt from this event will guide our efforts going forward, so that together we can continue to design, develop and deliver better policies for better lives."   View original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/gingkoo-fintech-joins-policy-discussion-at-oecd-blockchain-policy-forum-september-2018-and-ceo-william-zuo-gives-a-keynote-speech-300719106.htmlSOURCE GingkooCONTACT: Molly Ma, Gingkoo, +86-159-0171-2545, ling.ma@gingkoo.comLoad-Date: September 27, 2018End of Document

If you use batteries or refrigerators or eat at Chick-fil-A, you could eventually feel the pain of Trump's tariffs on ChinaBusiness Insider USJuly 6, 2018 Friday 03:04 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 802 wordsByline: bbryan@businessinsider.com,  (Bob Bryan)Highlight: US President Donald Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods will eventually raise prices for US consumers, industry groups say. Batteries, tool sets, and even Chick-fil-A sandwiches could cost more because of the tariffs.BodySkye Gould/Business Insider• President Donald Trump on Friday imposed a 25% tariff on $34 billion worth of Chinese exports to the US.• The tariffs apply mostly to machinery and industrial goods.• But industry groups warn that American consumers will still pay the price because US manufacturers will pass on increased costs to customers. President Donald Trump argues that new tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods are designed to protect US businesses and force China to change its economic policy. But many industry groups say American consumers are likely to bear the brunt of the trade fight.While less than 1% of the goods subject to the tariffs are consumer goods, the list of products targeted includes machinery that does everything from cutting metal to measuring electrical currents to incubating chickens. US businesses rely on these products to make their goods, which are eventually sold to US consumers.More expensive equipment and parts means US businesses will see costs rise. In turn, they can pass on the increased costs to consumers or shrink costs in other areas - for instance, by laying off workers. Most experts say businesses are likely to use some combination of these two options.So while the 25% tariffs, imposed Friday, may not result in an immediate price hike at the checkout line, many industry groups warn that Americans will still see changes:• National Retail Federation: "With tariffs against China taking effect, American consumers are one step closer to feeling the full effects of a trade war," Matthew Shay, the federation's president and CEO, said in a statement Thursday. "These tariffs will do nothing to protect US jobs, but they will undermine the benefits of tax reform and drive up prices for a wide range of products as diverse as tool sets, batteries, remote controls, flash drives and thermostats."• Consumer Technology Association: "While President Trump says his trade policy is meant to punish China, the numbers show that, in reality, US businesses, workers and consumers will pay the price under this policy," said Sage Chandler, the group's vice president for international trade. "Of the original $50 billion in tariffs on China, items including lithium batteries, navigation devices, disk drives and circuit board components will be affected - hitting $15.2 billion worth of Chinese imports."• North American Food Equipment Manufacturers: The tariffs could even trickle down to the cost of fast food, Charlie Souhrada, a vice president of the group, told The Associated Press. While Trump's duties do not apply to food products, Souhrada said the NAFEM member Henny Penny expected the tariffs to increase the price of its pressure cookers, which are in turn used by chains like Chick-fil-A to make food.• National Association for Manufacturers: "Tariffs will bring retaliation and possibly more tariffs," said Jay Timmons, the association's president and CEO. "No one wins in a trade war, and it is America's manufacturing workers and working families who will bear the brunt of continued tariffs. Manufacturers in the United States succeed when the rules are clear and fair and markets are open."While Friday's tariffs are likely to hit US consumers eventually, Trump's threat to impose tariffs on another $200 billion worth of Chinese exports to the US could result in more direct pain for them.Not just consumers facing painUS consumers may eventually see higher prices on shelves, but there's a second negative trickle-down effect. Many businesses count China as a major export destination, and the retaliatory tariffs imposed by the Chinese government on US products could similarly increase prices in China and hurt sales.For instance, China's 25% retaliatory duty on whiskey could harm US producers, according to the Distilled Spirits Council."Imposing 25 percent tariffs on US whiskeys could put the brakes on an American export success story," Christine LoCascio, a senior vice president for international trade at the council, said in a statement. "American spirits exports to China have grown by almost 1,200 percent, from $959,000 in 2001 to $12.8 million in 2017."Distillers are worried that retaliatory tariffs - not only from China, but from Europe and Canada as well - could stunt their sales and slow expansion and hiring plans.NOW WATCH: North Korean defector: Kim Jong Un 'is a terrorist'See Also:• Trump just slapped tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods - here's the full list of products that will get hit• China says Trump's tariffs 'launched the largest trade war in economic history,' vows to strike back• IT'S ON: Trump's trade war kicks off with tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goodsSEE ALSO: Trump just hit China with massive tariffs, kicking off a trade war - here's what tariffs are, and how they could affect youLoad-Date: February 11, 2019End of Document

Work on the project has been accelerated after Google's CEO Sundar Pichai had a meeting with a top Chinese government official, Intercept report says, citing internal Google documents and people familiar with the plans. Google engineers have created a custom Android app, different versions of which have been named "Maotai" and "Longfei." The app, which has been demonstrated to the Chinese government, could be launched in the next six to nine months, subject to approval from Chinese officials. If approved and launched, it will be for the first time in almost a decade that Google has operated its search engine in China. According to the Intercept, roughly 200 employees at Google are working on the new censored search engine. Most are based at Google's headquarters in Mountain View, while others are spread out across the US.  Google's Android smartphone platform already boasts of having the largest market share of any operating system in China. It currently enjoys roughly 51 percent share all smartphones. However, Google's search engine as well as other services, including Gmail and YouTube, cannot currently be accessed by users in China as officials have blocked these services using its Great Firewall. Recently, Google has repeatedly shown signs of preparing for its return to the Chinese market. In December last year, Google said it would open its first artificial intelligence research center in Beijing.

Chinese Auto Finance Market to 2022: Driving Forces & Market Opportunities - ResearchAndMarkets.comBusiness WireJuly 31, 2018 Tuesday 2:35 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Business Wire, Inc.Distribution: Business EditorsLength: 437 wordsDateline: DUBLIN BodyThe "Research Report on China's Auto Finance Industry - 2018-2022" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.It is expected that the market size of auto finance in China will exceed CNY 1,500 billion in 2022.Since China joined the WTO, the auto production, sales and reserves have been growing with China's economic development. At the end of 2017, China's auto reserves were about 156 per thousand people, far less than that in developed countries. Therefore, there is a huge growth potential.The auto consumer finance industry has begun to develop in China with the increase of residents' income and the policy support of the government. In mature markets, auto finance accounts for 20%-25% profits of the auto value chain while in China the proportion is less than 10%. The market size of China's auto finance industry reached about CNY 900 billion in 2017. Despite the small market size and low profitability, there is a lot of room for growth in the future.Current policies are favorable to China's auto finance industry. The Chinese government encourages innovation in consumer finance, which opens more channels for auto finance. In addition, new-round auto demand arises as auto consumption gradually shifts from the first and second tier cities to the third and fourth tier cities and rural areas, which brings about more market opportunities to the auto finance industry.Other driving forces include the development of auto consumer finance market, huge investment, frequent financing activities, business efficiency increased by Internet and financial technologies, and the rapid growth of new energy vehicle market.Topics Covered• Development environment of China's auto finance industry• Supply and demand in China's auto finance industry• Market competition of auto finance• Analysis on major auto finance enterprises in China• Driving forces and market opportunities for China's auto finance industry• Forecast on development of China's auto finance industry, 2018-2022Companies Featured• SAIC-GMAC Automotive Finance Co.

US airlines give in to China's demands over TaiwanCNN WireJuly 25, 2018 Wednesday 4:40 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 657 wordsByline: By Daniel ShaneDateline: HONG KONG (CNNMoney) BodyHONG KONG (CNNMoney) --  US airlines have changed their websites to keep China happy, hours before a deadline for them to do so expired. Beijing had demanded that American Airlines, Delta and United change how they refer to Taiwan by Wednesday, or risk sanctions in one of the world's biggest markets for air travel. American Airlines and Delta updated their websites on Wednesday to show they fly to Taipei, with no mention of Taiwan. A few hours earlier, both websites offered flights to "Taipei, Taiwan." United also removed references to "TW" - short for Taiwan - from its website, dropping country designations for all cities in Taiwan and China. China and Taiwan have been governed separately since 1949 following the Communist victory on the mainland after a civil war, although a shared cultural and linguistic heritage mostly endures.But China considers Taiwan to be an integral part of its territory, and comes down hard on any suggestions to the contrary. "Like other carriers, American is implementing changes to address China's request. Air travel is global business, and we abide by the rules in countries where we operate," American spokeswoman Shannon Gilson told CNN. United did not respond to a request for comment. Delta declined to comment and referred questions to Airlines for America (A4A), which represents the US airline industry. "The US airline industry is a global business that must contend with a host of regulations and requirements," the association said in a statement on Tuesday. "A4A and the affected US airlines appreciate the engagement and counsel we have received from the administration as carriers begin to implement a solution," it added. The instructions from China provoked a strong reaction from the United States earlier in the year.

US airlines give in to China's demands over TaiwanCNNMoney.comJuly 24, 2018 Tuesday 12:40 AM ESTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: COMPANY NEWSLength: 637 wordsByline: Daniel ShaneBodyUS airlines have changed their websites to keep China happy, hours before a deadline for them to do so expired.Beijing had demanded that American Airlines, Delta and United change how they refer to Taiwan by Wednesday, or risk sanctions in one of the world's biggest markets for air travel.American Airlines and Delta updated their websites on Wednesday to show they fly to Taipei, with no mention of Taiwan. A few hours earlier, both websites offered flights to "Taipei, Taiwan."United also removed references to "TW" ? short for Taiwan ? from its website, dropping country designations for all cities in Taiwan and China.China and Taiwan have been governed separately since 1949 following the Communist victory on the mainland after a civil war, although a shared cultural and linguistic heritage mostly endures.But China considers Taiwan to be an integral part of its territory, and comes down hard on any suggestions to the contrary."Like other carriers, American is implementing changes to address China's request. Air travel is global business, and we abide by the rules in countries where we operate," American spokeswoman Shannon Gilson told CNN.United did not respond to a request for comment. Delta declined to comment and referred questions to Airlines for America (A4A), which represents the US airline industry."The US airline industry is a global business that must contend with a host of regulations and requirements," the association said in a statement on Tuesday."A4A and the affected US airlines appreciate the engagement and counsel we have received from the administration as carriers begin to implement a solution," it added.The instructions from China provoked a strong reaction from the United States earlier in the year. The White House slammed the demands as "Orwellian nonsense," describing them as "part of a growing trend by the Chinese Communist Party to impose its political views on American citizens and private companies."But international airlines and other global brands are caught in a bind.

CHINA'S STATE MEDIA PUBLISH 'CONFESSIONS' OF DETAINED JOURNALIST CHEN JIERENStates News ServiceAugust 16, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 766 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:China's state-run media have launched a blistering attack on prominent freelance journalist Chen Jieren, who was detained last month on suspicion of "fraud" and running an "illegal business."State news agency Xinhua accused Chen of using officials' fear of his reporting to extort money from them, and quoted him as "confessing" to losing his moral fiber after leaving his job in the ruling Chinese Communist Party-backed media behind."I abused my own influence and the trust of my social media followers," the agency quoted Chen as saying. "I used wording that evoked fairness and justice to cheat my readers; to deceive the people," his "confession" said."I am a classic example of a fake guy on the internet," the agency quoted Chen as saying.It accused Chen of profiting from the fear he engendered in officials, as a freelance journalist, warning that "ordinary citizens can only use legal channels to exercise their right to criticize [the government] ... and as whistle blowers."Chen's detention came after he filed a complaint against Shaoyang municipal party secretary Deng Guangya on June 25 , calling for him to be removed from office.A few days later, a number of Chinese journalists received verbal notification from government propaganda teams that they shouldn't do any independent reporting on the case, but reprint only approved copy instead.No access to lawyerNeither Chen nor his family and associates have been allowed access to a lawyer, a source close to the case told RFA."He has been locked up for more than 40 days now, and he hasn't been allowed to see a lawyer this whole time," the source said. "None of the lawyers hired by his family members or anyone else have been allowed meet with their clients.""This is utterly out of keeping with the principle of the rule of law."The source said no statements made in such circumstances by Chen or anyone else under investigation can be taken at face value."In a situation where people are locked up, can't see their lawyers, and in which there are no guarantees that their rights will be respected, no confesion they write is reliable," the source said."It's highly likely that these are all fake quotes."According to the source, the Xinhua article is likely to have been approved at a high level in the Chinese government."This is approved, syndicated copy, not some kind of initiative on the part of the media," the source said. "These articles have no byline, which is very unusual indeed."State supervisory commissionA total of six people have been detained so far in the investigation by President Xi Jinping's new state supervisory commission, set up last March to monitor the conduct of staff in the ruling Chinese Communist Party, People's Congresses, government departments, judicial agencies, state-owned enterprises, and government-backed institutions, including state schools and higher education.The new system massively expands the number of people who can be investigated for corruption and other abuses of official power, and includes contractors working for state and party organizations in its scope of inquiry.It also holds the power to detain suspects for up to six months "at a designated location" with the approval of higher-ranking commissions, and to prevent people from leaving China.Activist Wu Bin, known by his online nickname Xiucai Jianghu, said Chen is being subjected to a trial by media."In a society run by persons [as opposed to by law], we typically see illegal actions such as trial by media," Wu told RFA. "Chen Jieren hasn't been sentenced yet, and this article ... shows that the media are taking on a political role here.""The imperial court has turned against him, and they want to suppress him," Wu said, in a common satirical reference to the "dynastic" rule of the Chinese Communist Party leadership."These official mouthpieces, as well as law enforcement and the courts, all serve a single master; they are all in cahoots," he said.London-based rights group Amnesty International has warned that the state supervisory commission is a "systemic threat" to human rights.Under the new system, supervisory bodies can detain and interrogate virtually anyone working directly or indirectly for the government, including judges, academics, and employees of state-owned companies.At the national level, the Supervisory Commission is ranked higher than the Supreme People's Court and the top prosecutor's office.Reported by Yang Fan for RFA's Mandarin Service, and by the Cantonese Service.

China, Russia take their turn at the UNStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeSeptember 28, 2018 FridayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: MARKETS; Pg. 1Length: 661 wordsByline: Jean GarciaBodyAsked about a USA bomber flight over the contested South China Sea this week, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told reporters on Wednesday the flights were routine."Regrettably, we found that China has been attempting to interfere in our upcoming 2018 election - coming up in November - against my administration", Trump said.China's foreign minister issued a statement disputing Trump, saying, "We do not and will not interfere".China is the latest in a long line of countries being accused of meddling in US elections.Trump on Wednesday accused China of seeking to interfere in the November 6 USA congressional elections, saying that Beijing did not want him or his Republican Party to do well because of his pugnacious stance on trade.While Chinese leader Xi Jinping was on an inspection tour of factories in the northeastern city of Qiqihar, Heilongjiang Province, on September 26, he hinted that the trade war has forced the country to seek a path of self-reliance toward becoming a more high-tech economy, state media reported.The new duties would add to tariffs the USA has already imposed on $50bn in Chinese goods as part of that dispute, as well as tariffs that China levied on $50bn in USA goods in retaliation.The new tariffs covered products such as food seasonings, baseball gloves, network routers and industrial machinery parts.Geng, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, defended the use of the paid insert in the Des Moines Register, saying it didn't break any United States laws."China has all along followed the principle of non-interference", Wang said in the same session that was chaired by the U.S. president."Anyone who knows anything about China could have told Donald Trump that China would look for ways to retaliate", said Paul Haenle, a former China adviser to Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama.Hillary Clinton jokes about email in 'Murphy Brown' return to TVThe classic sitcom Murphy Brown made its return to television this week and its season premiere included a special appearance. Now the question is whether the show will reach across the aisle for future ones.A senior Trump administration official said China uses political, economic, commercial, military and information tools to influence USA public opinion and promote the interests of the Chinese government and Communist Party."I like two-state solution", Mr Trump said in his most clear endorsement of the plan as he met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Unilateralism and trade protectionism are on the rise, forcing us to adopt a self-reliant approach.US PresidentDonald Trump participates in a United Nations Security Council briefing on counterproliferation at the United Nations General Assembly.Trump was asked later during a press conference about evidence of Chinese election meddling and said cryptically: "We have evidence, we have evidence-it'll come out".Trump's recent condemnation of China has been sharper in tone than many of his statements toward Russian Federation about election interference. "They've actually admitted that they're going after farmers", he added, suggesting that retaliatory tariffs targeting his political base constituted election interference.Also this week, US B-52 bombers flew over the disputed South China Sea and East China Sea andBeijing slammed United States plans to sell military parts to self-governing Taiwan."The U.S. needs to present the evidence", he said."I've seen zero evidence in our own monitoring work that China is doing anything like that", said Jake Williams, president of Rendition Infosec, a Georgia cybersecurity firm, "and none of the people in industry I share threat intelligence with have had a whisper of that".Beijing has also denied a request for a US warship to visit Hong Kong, the USA consulate in the Chinese city said on Tuesday.In theory the same goods can receive a lower basic tariff and still have extra duties piled on by the response to PresidentDonald Trump's measures.Load-Date: September 29, 2018End of Document

Starbucks Plans a Big Digital Future in China, with Alibaba's HelpRealMoneyAugust 23, 2018 Thursday 12:59 PM EDTCopyright 2018 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 525 wordsByline: Kevin CurranHighlight: Starbucks and Alibaba don't see trade war as an obstacle to digital growth in China.BodyAs high-level trade relations between U.S. and China remain uncertain, American coffee leader Starbucks Corporation  is moving aggressively to expand its digital and delivery capabilities in China alongside Alibaba Group Holding Ltd  .Announced  , the Chinese Internet giant and the U.S. coffee retailer will "transform Starbucks China into a digital operation," Alibaba CEO Daniel Zhang said in the company's earnings this morning.The partnership underscores how many U.S. companies view China as a significant market for future growth, despite high-level politics and trade war headlines in recent months.In China, Starbucks controls 58.6% of the overall coffee market in China , accounting for $1.3 billion, in revenues for the coffee purveyor in the second quarter."As demonstrated by our partnership with Starbucks, we are working constructively with American brands to better serve Chinese consumers," said Joseph Tsai, co-founder and executive vice chairman of Alibaba, on a call on Thursday.The cross-platform collaboration will include "digital stores in Alibaba consumer Apps, coffee delivery for online orders, and the loyalty program collaboration," the company said. Starbucks' growth story in the country so traditionally tea-crazy that  has been a remarkable one for Starbucks. In only 20 years, the Seattle-based chain has now opened 3,400 stores,  , making it ideal for the scale that Alibaba is seeking to prove its platform at."The strategic partnership with Starbucks is proof of our New Retail model at scale and showcases how Alibaba can help our brand partners more deeply and innovatively engage with their customers in China," an Alibaba press release this morning explained.Jefferies Financial Group Inc  equity analyst Andy Barish also saw the opportunity as a boon for the coffee company. "Delivery is now a 'lifestyle' for Chinese consumers, so the absence of a [third party delivery] offering had a detrimental impact on sales," he wrote in a research note on August 2. "BABA sets SBUX up to capture this opportunity, and extend its quality-assured, premium retail experience beyond its four walls."Good Synergies with Alibaba  , the transition to the "new retail" model is a hallmark of a "digital lifestyle" promoted by Alibaba.He suggested that Alibaba has room to grow even to $250 per share based on this lifestyle.On the other hand, while the program seems to be a "dream team" partnership on paper, the complexities of a Chinese-American partnership in today's climate is certainly precarious given  .A collaboration with an upmarket foreign brand like Starbucks poses challenges should the Chinese economy continue to deteriorate and "look terrible", as US economic advisor Larry Kudlow puts it, and Chinese consumers no longer wish to purchase expensive frappuccinos.It could also pose risk if the Chinese government decides to introduce measure to punish U.S. companies operating in China.The partnership, which should help Starbucks hold off Chinese rivals, offers Alibaba a testing ground for its ele.me delivery project and will certainly be one to watch as both expand aggressively into digital delivery space.Load-Date: August 27, 2018End of Document

Warning Against Threat China's ZTE Poses, Rubio Votes No on NDAATargeted News ServiceAugust 1, 2018 Wednesday 6:42 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1582 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe office of Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, issued the following news release:U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) championed and secured important provisions for Florida and the nation in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA); however, he voted against the NDAA Conference Report earlier today because the bipartisan provision reinstating crippling penalties against ZTE was stripped out of the NDAA FY 2019 Conference Report last month. Rubio previously said he was "shocked that some of my colleagues decided to let ZTE continue to do business" and that Congress "can't continue to let this happen."The NDAA includes the following key Florida-specific provisions for which Rubio advocated:- $200 million in military construction for Florida including:o Littoral Combat Ship facilities for Naval Station Mayporto Air Traffic Control Tower for Naval Air Station Whiting Fieldo F-35 facilities for Eglin Air Force Baseo A Main Gate for Patrick Air Force Baseo KC-135 Flight Simulators for MacDill Air Force Base- Authorizes continued development of the B-21 bomber, work being done in Melbourne, Florida.- Supports for the Gulf Range Complex that extends from Eglin AFB over the Gulf of Mexico, the largest military range in the continental United States.- Additional F-35 Joint Strike Fighters- Increased funding for the Navy's major shipbuilding programs- A 2.6% military pay raise for our troopsA rough and partial transcript of Rubio's remarks is below:We are halfway through my eighth year in the United States Senate and in my time here, I have never once spoken against, voted against, or opposed in any way any of the National Defense Authorization Acts that have come before the Senate. And the reason being that despite whatever flaws one might find on most occasions in any piece of legislation, the defense of our country is the fundamental obligation of our federal government. It comes before everything else....And so I have never opposed an NDAA, and I have supported every single one of them, despite the fact that they didn't have everything I wanted or everything I liked--until today.There is a lot of good in this legislation, and it makes it difficult to be an opponent of it. For Florida it's authorized over $200 million dollars for Military construction in the state. Littoral Combat Ship facilities at Naval Station Mayport, Air Traffic Control Towers at Whiting Field, F-35 facilities that are important at Eglin Air Force Base, KC-135 flight simulators at MacDill Air Force Base, it authorizes the Secretary of the Air Force to build a cyberspace test facility at Eglin. It authorizes the conveyance of land to the Air Force Enlisted Village, which is a nonprofit corporation, consisting of approximately 80 acres next to Eglin for independent living and apartments. It authorizes the continued development of the B-21 bomber, work that's being done in Melbourne, Florida. It fully supports the Gulf Range complex, a true treasure for our country and it's the largest military range in the continental United States.As for the country, it also has all sorts of other very important things. An over 2.6% military pay raise, it increases the active duty workforce by an increase in the active duty force of 15,600 personnel bringing the total to over 1.3 million. It tries to address the pilot shortage. It authorizes $10.7 billion dollars to buy 77 more F-35 joint strike fighters, $193 million in research and development funding for new software and improvements to be incorporated in future years in that program. It authorizes new missile defense, including $175 million intended to integrate the THAAD and Patriot systems in South Korea. It authorizes $23.7 billion for Navy shipbuilding, an increase of close to $2 billion dollars over what the President requested. We could go on and on, it does many important things in rebuilding our military strength in this country.But it failed on one important front, and that is what I believe to be a very significant and serious threat to our National Security and the future of this country, one that we are only beginning to wake up to.For the first time since the end of the Cold War, the United States is engaged in a geopolitical competition with a near peer adversary. Since 1991 there's been no other nation on Earth that could project power anywhere close to what the United States could do, until now. Unlike our country, China is a nation with an ancient history, one that leaves them with a long-standing sense of victimhood, but also one that leaves them to believe that they have a preordained destiny to once again be the most powerful nation on Earth.This is what they mean when they constantly use a phrase, you'll see they use, it's called historical determinism. In summary what they are saying is they are predestined to be the world's most powerful country and therefore they believe they are predestined to surpass the United States, and by mean surpass I mean surpass us geo-politically, economically and militarily. This is not a new ambition, by the way. But for two decades they have followed a strategy called hiding their power and biding their time. But all of that changed last year, in October at their party congress, their President for life, Xi, he laid out a vision for china and he did it in very clear nationalist terms. Here is what he said, backed by the invincible force of more than 1.3 billion people we have an infinitely vast stage of our era a historical heritage of unmatched depth and incomparable resolve.We have arrived at a new era where China is now in a leading position in terms of technological strength, defense capabilities and composite national strength and with a military which can fight and win. And you see evidence of these beliefs. You see is it in their impressive and massive military buildup and quantum leaps in technological advances. You see how they're working to destroy the current world order that was built by America and our allies and now seek to replace it with one that they build and one that will be led by them. That's how they offer loans, not just to get their companies more business, but to give them leverage and footholds in countries and they do so with no questions asked about democracy or human rights....The problem is those two measures will do nothing to constrain the threat that ZTE poses to the United States and our national security. Nothing. A fine when you're backed by the Chinese government, a multibillion-dollar fine is nothing. And you can put all the business people you want on their board. It is not the business people we should be concerned about. It is the technical people in these companies. The ones that can get ZTE routers embedded in American telecommunications, create backdoor access to our universities, so they can steal our research, communications systems so they can intercept our communications in military affairs and economic affairs, conduct cyber espionage, commercial espionage and potentially denial of our command-and-control in the military one day, if left unaddressed.Think about embedding these Trojan horses inside of our telecommunications systems and networks in America, any company that poses that threat should not be allowed to operate, much less remain in business, and ZTE is one such company. Even if ZTE tells the Chinese government, we don't want to do this, they have no choice, or they will cease to exist or their leaders will be in jail and somebody new will replace them that will do it. And so this is why this is so critical. And why in the bill that was passed by the Senate we reimposed these penalties, and it was taken out in conference and the threat posed by China and by its telecommunications companies are so severe and significant that it regrettably brings me to the point where I cannot support a bill I have always supported in my time here. We need to wake up to the threat that china poses to this country because we are running out of time to do so....ZTE is a big danger. They are small compared to Huawei which is a company even bigger than ZTE, that poses an even greater systemic risk. And if we can't even take on ZTE because they lobby and because of American companies coming here, how are we ever going to take on Huawei or any other dangers they pose to us?It's time we open our eyes. We are engaged in in a geopolitical competition not with some poor agrarian country trying to catch up, but with a global superpower who is quickly nipping at our heels and doing so unfairly, with the intent of replacing us in the world as the most powerful country militarily, economically, geopolitically and technologically.The history of America is short in comparison to the great empires of history and the great countries of history. 240-some odd years in the scope of history is but a blink of an eye and history is full of examples of nations that became complacent, and lost their standing and their way of life. And I'm not claiming that ZTE alone will be that, but it is a part of a broader problem, and that is that we have yet to realize what a significant threat Chinese poses to this country and in every realm and sphere.

Rubio previously said he was shocked that some of my colleagues decided to let ZTE continue to do business and that Congress cant continue to let this happen.The NDAA includes the following key Florida-specific provisions for which Rubio advocated:$200 million in military construction for Florida including:Littoral Combat Ship facilities for Naval Station MayportAir Traffic Control Tower for Naval Air Station Whiting FieldF-35 facilities for Eglin Air Force BaseA Main Gate for Patrick Air Force BaseKC-135 Flight Simulators for MacDill Air Force BaseAuthorizes continued development of the B-21 bomber, work being done in Melbourne, Florida.Supports for the Gulf Range Complex that extends from Eglin AFB over the Gulf of Mexico, the largest military range in the continental United States.Additional F-35 Joint Strike FightersIncreased funding for the Navys major shipbuilding programsA 2.6% military pay raise for our troopsA rough and partial transcript of Rubios remarks is below:We are halfway through my eighth year in the United States Senate and in my time here, I have never once spoken against, voted against, or opposed in any way any of the National Defense Authorization Acts that have come before the Senate. And the reason being that despite whatever flaws one might find on most occasions in any piece of legislation, the defense of our country is the fundamental obligation of our federal government. It comes before everything else . And so I have never opposed an NDAA, and I have supported every single one of them, despite the fact that they didn't have everything I wanted or everything I likeduntil today.There is a lot of good in this legislation, and it makes it difficult to be an opponent of it. For Florida it's authorized over $200 million dollars for Military construction in the state. Littoral Combat Ship facilities at Naval Station Mayport, Air Traffic Control Towers at Whiting Field, F-35 facilities that are important at Eglin Air Force Base, KC-135 flight simulators at MacDill Air Force Base, it authorizes the Secretary of the Air Force to build a cyberspace test facility at Eglin. It authorizes the conveyance of land to the Air Force Enlisted Village, which is a nonprofit corporation, consisting of approximately 80 acres next to Eglin for independent living and apartments. It authorizes the continued development of the B-21 bomber, work thats being done in Melbourne, Florida. It fully supports the Gulf Range complex, a true treasure for our country and it's the largest military range in the continental United States.As for the country, it also has all sorts of other very important things. An over 2.6% military pay raise, it increases the active duty workforce by an increase in the active duty force of 15,600 personnel bringing the total to over 1.3 million. It tries to address the pilot shortage. It authorizes $10.7 billion dollars to buy 77 more F-35 joint strike fighters, $193 million in research and development funding for new software and improvements to be incorporated in future years in that program. It authorizes new missile defense, including $175 million intended to integrate the THAAD and Patriot systems in South Korea. It authorizes $23.7 billion for Navy shipbuilding, an increase of close to $2 billion dollars over what the President requested. We could go on and on, it does many important things in rebuilding our military strength in this country.But it failed on one important front, and that is what I believe to be a very significant and serious threat to our National Security and the future of this country, one that we are only beginning to wake up to.For the first time since the end of the Cold War, the United States is engaged in a geopolitical competition with a near peer adversary. Since 1991 there's been no other nation on Earth that could project power anywhere close to what the United States could do, until now. Unlike our country, China is a nation with an ancient history, one that leaves them with a long-standing sense of victimhood, but also one that leaves them to believe that they have a preordained destiny to once again be the most powerful nation on Earth.This is what they mean when they constantly use a phrase, youll see they use, its called historical determinism. In summary what they are saying is they are predestined to be the world's most powerful country and therefore they believe they are predestined to surpass the United States, and by mean surpass I mean surpass us geo-politically, economically and militarily. This is not a new ambition, by the way. But for two decades they have followed a strategy called hiding their power and biding their time. But all of that changed last year, in October at their party congress, their President for life, Xi, he laid out a vision for china and he did it in very clear nationalist terms. Here is what he said, backed by the invincible force of more than 1.3 billion people we have an infinitely vast stage of our era a historical heritage of unmatched depth and incomparable resolve.We have arrived at a new era where China is now in a leading position in terms of technological strength, defense capabilities and composite national strength and with a military which can fight and win. And you see evidence of these beliefs. You see is it in their impressive and massive military buildup and quantum leaps in technological advances. You see how they're working to destroy the current world order that was built by America and our allies and now seek to replace it with one that they build and one that will be led by them. That's how they offer loans, not just to get their companies more business, but to give them leverage and footholds in countries and they do so with no questions asked about democracy or human rights.The problem is those two measures will do nothing to constrain the threat that ZTE poses to the United States and our national security. Nothing. A fine when you're backed by the Chinese government, a multibillion-dollar fine is nothing. And you can put all the business people you want on their board. It is not the business people we should be concerned about. It is the technical people in these companies. The ones that can get ZTE routers embedded in American telecommunications, create backdoor access to our universities, so they can steal our research, communications systems so they can intercept our communications in military affairs and economic affairs, conduct cyber espionage, commercial espionage and potentially denial of our command-and-control in the military one day, if left unaddressed.Think about embedding these Trojan horses inside of our telecommunications systems and networks in America, any company that poses that threat should not be allowed to operate, much less remain in business, and ZTE is one such company. Even if ZTE tells the Chinese government, we don't want to do this, they have no choice, or they will cease to exist or their leaders will be in jail and somebody new will replace them that will do it. And so this is why this is so critical. And why in the bill that was passed by the Senate we reimposed these penalties, and it was taken out in conference and the threat posed by China and by its telecommunications companies are so severe and significant that it regrettably brings me to the point where I cannot support a bill I have always supported in my time here. We need to wake up to the threat that china poses to this country because we are running out of time to do so.ZTE is a big danger. They are small compared to Huawei which is a company even bigger than ZTE, that poses an even greater systemic risk. And if we can't even take on ZTE because they lobby and because of American companies coming here, how are we ever going to take on Huawei or any other dangers they pose to us?It's time we open our eyes. We are engaged in in a geopolitical competition not with some poor agrarian country trying to catch up, but with a global superpower who is quickly nipping at our heels and doing so unfairly, with the intent of replacing us in the world as the most powerful country militarily, economically, geopolitically and technologically.The history of America is short in comparison to the great empires of history and the great countries of history. 240-some odd years in the scope of history is but a blink of an eye and history is full of examples of nations that became complacent, and lost their standing and their way of life. And I'm not claiming that ZTE alone will be that, but it is a part of a broader problem, and that is that we have yet to realize what a significant threat Chinese poses to this country and in every realm and sphere. And until we do, we are going to continue to be in danger of surrendering and forfeiting our way of life and our place in the world, and if we do that, the world will be worse off for it and we will have no one to blame but ourselves for failing to act.Load-Date: August 1, 2018End of Document

Tencent plays its cards wrong: Online poker game axed in ChinaCNN WireSeptember 11, 2018 Tuesday 10:01 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 580 wordsByline: By Sherisse PhamDateline: HONG KONG (CNNMoney) BodyHONG KONG (CNNMoney) --  Tencent is killing off a popular online poker game as the Chinese government steps up scrutiny of the gaming industry. "Texas Everyday Hold'em" notified players Monday that the game was being pulled because of "changes in the company's business." It's the latest in a series of setbacks in China for Tencent, the world's biggest gaming company. Tencent's stock has plunged about 35% since January, wiping out roughly $200 billion in market value as concerns have mounted about its difficulties in its home market. Tencent, one of China's largest tech companies, offered "Texas Everyday Hold'em" through its messaging app WeChat, which has more than 1 billion users. The company stopped recharging players' accounts and halted poker games on Monday, according to a statement. Server data for the poker game will be deleted on September 25. Gambling is illegal in China, but online poker games like "Texas Everyday Hold'Em" got around restrictions by letting users play with virtual tokens like "diamonds" or "Texas dollars." They could win the items or use real money to buy them from the gaming company. But some people were trading virtual tokens for cash, analysts say, and that caught the attention of Chinese authorities. Chinese regulators didn't respond to requests for comment Tuesday.Tencent said it would compensate players according to government regulations. It didn't respond to a request for further comment.Tencent shares in Hong Kong closed down 1.8% on Tuesday.Beijing takes closer look at gamingTencent's other problems in China include delays in securing government approval to make money from new mobile games. Company executives last month attributed the halt in new licenses to a bureaucratic reorganization of Chinese agencies that regulate the industry. As a result, Tencent hasn't been able to make money from some of its most popular mobile games such as "PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds." Adding to the concerns, Beijing announced plans last month to limit the number of new online games and restrict the amount of time kids spend playing on electronic devices. Karen Chan, an analyst at investment bank Jefferies, predicted Tencent will probably be able to weather the difficulties. She noted that most of the new regulatory changes are aimed at preventing addiction among children, who usually don't spend a lot on games. Although kids play a lot of online games, they only contribute about 10% of the industry's revenue, Chan said in a research note on Friday. Last week, Tencent said it had stepped up efforts to police kids' access to "Honor of Kings," a game that came under fire last year for allegedly causing addiction in young people. The massive popularity of "Honor of Kings" was what sparked the increased government scrutiny of Tencent's games, said Neo Zheng, a Beijing-based analyst with research firm IDC. New users of the game now have to log on with their real names, which will be checked against government databases to determine players' ages. The company restricts how long minors can play, when they can access the game and how much they can spend. "Children are the hope of their families, the future of the country," the company said on its official WeChat account, parroting the government announcement laying out plans for new restrictions on the gaming industry. -- Eric Cheung and Serenitie Wang contributed to this report. TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

 U.S. escalates trade war with China by imposing $200 billion worth of goodsCountry Watch Political Intelligence WireSeptember 20, 2018 9:16 AM GMTCopyright 2018 Country Watch, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 373 wordsBodyU.S. escalates trade war with China by imposing $200 billion worth of goodsPresident Donald Trump announced a new round of tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods on September 17th, 2018, citing China’s alleged unwillingness to change its current trading practices to a fairer arrangement: "We have been very clear about the type of changes that need to be made, and we have given China every opportunity to treat us more fairly. But, so far, China has been unwilling to change its practices.” Chinese markets opened lower the subsequent day.The tariffs will hit food items such as frozen cuts of meat, various fruits, cereal, rice, and nearly all fish imports. Suitcases, handbags, and wool will also be targeted. Tech companies such as Apple and Dell vehemently objected to new tariffs as computer components were also targeted by the tariffs. These companies were worried the tariffs would ultimately increase the cost of their products.The taxes on Chinese imports began at 10 percent and were scheduled to go into effect on September 24th, 2018. If the United States and China failed to reach an agreement by the start of 2019, the taxes would be increased to 25 percent. An additional $267 billion worth of Chinese products would be targeted for tariffs by the United States in the event that the Chinese government retaliated.The September 2018 round of tariffs constituted the third round of tariffs imposed on Chinese imports throughout 2018: in July, the United Stateslevied tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods, and in August, the imposed a 25 percent tax on an additional $16 billion worth of Chinese goods. The September 2018 tariffs constituted the largest escalation in the trade war with China to that point. China had previously retaliated to the earlier United States tariffs by imposing tariffs on $50 billion worth of US products with another round on $60 billion worth of US products under consideration.Discussions between the two countries ceased in May 2018 and attempts to restart talks have mostly failed. In the week prior to the new United States tariffs, officials from both countries floated a new round of talks, but the new US tariffs were very likely to sour any prospect of new trade talks.Load-Date: September 24, 2018End of Document

Buhari Departs China For NigeriaThe Will (Nigeria)September 6, 2018 ThursdayCopyright 2018 The Will Newspaper All Rights ReservedLength: 319 wordsBody  President Muhammadu Buhari is already on his way back to Nigeria after a six-day trip to China where he participated in the Forum of China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC).The Personal Assistant to the President on New Media, Bashir Ahmed, revealed this via his Twitter handle saying the President's aircraft departed the Beijing Capital International Airport on Thursday morning.'President Muhammadu Buhari departs the Beijing Capital International Airport for Abuja after attending the #FOCAC2018in Beijing, China,' he tweeted @BashirAhmaad.FOCAC is a meeting of the Chinese government with over 50 African countries towards improving the cooperation in the Economic and other sectors.Part of President Buhari's last engagements in the Chinese capital before his departure was a meeting with business groups whom he asked to take advantage of the improved business environment in Nigeria and invest in key sectors of the economy.He also solicited the assistance of the Chinese government towards the construction of the Mambilla Hydropower Project in Taraba State.'I told President Xi (Jinping) that the Mambilla Hydropower Plant is Nigeria's equivalent of China's Three Gorges Dam, and that I look forward to him joining me for the groundbreaking ceremony in the not-too-distant future,' President Buhari had said on his Twitter handle on Wednesday.On Saturday, President Buhari and Mr Xi witnessed the signing of an agreement worth $328m between Nigeria and China.The concessional loan agreement was sealed between Galaxy Backbone Limited and Huawei Technologies Limited (HUAWEI) for the Information and Communication Technology Infrastructure Backbone Phase II (NICTIB II) project.It was signed by the Minister of Finance, Kemi Adesoun, and the Director-General of International Development Agency, Wang Xiaotoa.Nigeria and China also signed a Memorandum of Understanding for the One Belt One Road initiative (OBOR).Load-Date: September 7, 2018End of Document

China Unicom says it is unaware of megamerger planStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeSeptember 7, 2018 FridayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: HI-TECH; Pg. 1Length: 415 wordsByline: Sandy MccarthyBodyChina Unicom claimed to be unaware of the proposal when contacted, while China Telecom made no comment. But it's hard to see China's state-owned enterprises wringing out such synergies.The Chinese government is reportedly considering a merger of two state-run mobile operators in a bid to ensure the country assumes leadership in 5G networks.According to the companies' operating data, China Unicom had 302 million subscribers at the end of Q2 2018, while China Telecom had 282 million. Bernstein analyst Chris Lane notes similar mergers have resulted in 30 percent workforce reductions elsewhere; in China Unicom and China Telecom's case, that's roughly 160,000 people - a move that will be politically unpalatable for Beijing. This would strengthen their position in the mobile market versus market leader China Mobile and support quicker development of 5G in China.Earlier this year, the USA government blocked the proposed takeover of Qualcomm by Broadcom, fearing the latter's lack of reputation for research and development (R&D) would see the initiative ceded to Huawei, which is headquartered in Shenzhen, China.Djokovic overcomes dogged Millman to reach semisMillman, who had become the first Aussie to make the quarterfinals since Lleyton Hewitt in 2006, kept the three sets close. Novak Djokovic sweated it out from behind the baseline to beat Australian John Millman 6-3 6-4 6-4 at the U.S.Some observers believe the planned merger is also being driven by the intense competition between the United States and the worsening trade war between the US and China, which is causing expenses to skyrocket.Chinese vendors are now under fire in the United States, with ZTE having to wind up its operations after an import ban ordered by president Donald Trump left it struggling. Huawei Technologies, the world's largest maker of equipment for phone networks, and ZTE were banned last month from selling their gear to a USA ally, Australia, which cited security concern. A coordinated focus on 5G could push China Mobile to be more aggressive too.China's main stock indexes fell over 1 percent on Wednesday, as investors dumped banking, property and resources shares amid fresh signs of anaemic growth, and ahead of a likely escalation of the Sino-U.S. trade war.Having just two operators in the Chinese market would indicate that the government is more concerned about pushing Chinese exports than fostering domestic competition, with most markets having at least three major operators.Load-Date: September 7, 2018End of Document

Chinese companies leverage 'research and development' for tax cuts, study findsThe Duke Chronicle: Duke UniversitySeptember 17, 2018 MondayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 877 wordsByline: Mona TongBodyA Duke economics study found that more corporations are taking advantage of China's policy to incentivize research and development investment through tax cuts by relabeling their expenses as research and development, adding to the fiscal cost of the government.Because subsidizing research and development precipitates an increase in all-around economic productivity, China utilizes different research and development percentage thresholds, decided based on the size of the corporation-at which companies earn tax cuts-for their investments in research and development, according to the research team."[Firms] are gaming the system a little bit by relabeling some expenses as R&D even though they're not real research and development," said Juan Carlos Suárez Serrato, assistant professor of economics and a researcher on the study.Because subsidizing research and development precipitates an increase in all-around economic productivity, China utilizes different research and development percentage thresholds, decided based on the size of the corporation-at which companies earn tax cuts-for their investments in research and development, Suárez Serrato said.The tax cut at various thresholds is discontinuous, allowing companies to pay significantly less tax once their research and development expenses reach a different threshold, he explained."It's kind of like a big jump, [which] is called a notch." Suárez Serrato said. "What we find is that firms respond to this notch by reporting that they do more research and development...With such a tax cut 'going from 25 percent to 15 percent, you can keep 10 percent more of your profits.'"In addition to increasing their profits, companies may also be motivated to relabel their expenses to ensure they remain eligible for tax returns, Suárez Serrato added. The tax cut policy operates under a fiscal program called InnoCom, which requires firms to allocate a certain percentage of their annual sales on research and development."In some years, if [firms] sell too much relative to the research and development that they did, they might be in danger of not complying with the program," Suárez Serrato said. "So at that point, even though they planned to do real activities, they might need to-for that year, to not fall off the program-to relabel."The Chinese government reformed the InnoCom program in 2008 to include smaller companies to participate and change the notch location. Companies must be pre-registered and pre-audited in order to participate.To track what percentage of reported research and development was a product of relabelling, Suárez Serrato and his research partner-economics professor Daniel Xu-collaborated with Chinese businesses to analyze the research and development happenings. After analyzing the data, they found that there a significant number of companies clustering at each of the notches, strongly indicating many of them have relabelled their expenses.It would take a few years to develop an accurate mathematical model to evaluate the data due to the difficulty in determining what constitutes as real research and development growth, Suárez Serrato noted."[It's] a little bit of a complicated calculation because we need to basically estimate a model where firms are deciding to invest in research and development and where firms are deciding to relabel," he said.Based on a structural model where firms are making these joint decisions about investing and relabelling and according to this model, Suárez Serrato and his peers estimated about 30 percent of the reported research and development increase is a result of relabeling.Countries adopt diverse policies to incentivize research and development to achieve a higher overall productivity in the society in the long run, Suárez Serrato said."The government wants to encourage research and development because research and development has what we call positive externalities-when you develop a new idea or a new method of production, another company might adopt it and that might make that other company more productive," he added.In the United States, the tax credit system for research and development investments follows a steady, graduated pattern instead of concrete percentage thresholds, as it is in China. Because of the form that China's policy takes, there is an exceptionally large incentive to invest in research and development and perhaps also a greater chance for counter-productivity and loss of government revenue through the relabelling of research and development."If you're giving people money to incentivize them to do research and development, but say to the extreme when it's all relabelling, you don't actually have any of the positive externalities," he explained.Despite the relabelling, the tax-return policy has generated true research and development increase, and thus, true productivity increase and economic growth, Suárez Serrato said.What their research divulges is that actual productivity and returns from research and development investment may not be up to par with the reported numbers."We can't say whether or not [the policy] is good or bad," Suárez Serrato said, "we're just saying that [the relabelling] aspect of it is making it more costly than you otherwise would think."Load-Date: September 17, 2018End of Document

The Android app has already been demonstrated to the Chinese government, with the final version to be launched in the next six to nine months, pending approval from officials.Google's search service is currently inaccessible for most Chinese users due to the Great Firewall of China. The app that Google is building, however, will comply with the strict censorship laws of the country, and will limit access to content that the Communist Party regime of Xi Jinping deems unfavorable.The app, once launched will mark the first time in nearly a decade that Google has operated its search engine in China. The company's decision to comply with Chinese censorship, however, was described by Amnesty International's Patrick Poon as "a big disaster for the information age."(Market Chatter news is derived from conversations with market professionals globally.

To enter the Chinese market, Google would have to comply with the country s strict censorship apparatus, a prospect that has led to major criticism from human rights advocates. I was compelled to resign my position In the letter, which was sent this week to members of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, Poulson describes concern at Google regarding the project.  I was compelled to resign my position on August 31, 2018, in the wake of a pattern of unethical and unaccountable decision making from company leadership,  Poulson writes.  This culminated in their refusal to disclose information about Project Dragonfly, a version of Google Search tailored to the censorship and surveillance demands of the Chinese government. Poulson writes that the project appears to contradict the company s stated principles for the use of AI, and that he is able to verify some reported information about the project, much of which has been revealed by The Intercept.  Project Dragonfly,  he writes, included a  prototype interface  that tied users to their phone numbers, and it also blacklisted words like  human rights.  The project was approved after what he describes as  a catastrophic failure of the internal privacy review process. Calls privacy review  a catastrophic failure  We ve been investing for many years to help Chinese users, from developing Android, through mobile apps such as Google Translate and Files Go, and our developer tools,  the company said in a previous statement.  But our work on search has been exploratory, and we are not close to launching a search product in China. Earlier this month, top Google executives did not appear for a hearing that included Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg. Senators criticized the absence, which the company attributed to a misunderstanding over who would be an acceptable witness. Today s Senate hearing will include Google s chief privacy officer, Keith Enright, among representatives from other companies. The appearance will be a new opportunity for lawmakers to question Google, and  Dragonfly  will undoubtedly be on the agenda.Jack Poulson letter by Anonymous ZXXhPuYZX on ScribdSee Campaign:https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/26/17903128/google-china-project-dragonfly-search-engine-jack-poulsonContact Information:Colin LecherTags:,            Artificial Intelligence Newswire,            Wire,            United States,            EnglishLoad-Date: September 30, 2018End of Document

Alchemy launches new website, continues China focusRubber & Plastics NewsAugust 20, 2018Print VersionCopyright 2018 Crain Communications All Rights ReservedSection: Pg. 17; Vol. 48Length: 939 wordsByline: Kyle BrownDateline: TWINSBURG, Ohio BodyAlchemy Rubber Group is ready to move on to the next phase of its development, starting with a brand new website.The specialty chemicals trading company launched its new site to offer product information and market research, as well as its greater transparency in sourcing chemicals from China, Director Tom Bohan said."We wanted to keep everything very simple and easy to access. It's there to tell a story and present information," he said.Alchemy's story goes back to its formation by Jeff Rand, president of HB Chemical, as a method of improving the sourcing and buying models from China, Bohan said. The company established connections directly with chemical suppliers in China to trace products to their source and provide transparency.Having started with just one employee on the ground in Shanghai, Alchemy has built up to five employees working with suppliers in China, Bohan said. It has offices in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Twinsburg, Ohio. Though the company has worked mainly with HB Chemical in the past, it's opening its doors wider to new customers now."Now we're kind of in the second phase of the business model with Alchemy and beginning to market our services to other customers worldwide," he said. "We've built up our infrastructure in China and achieved all of our goals in terms of revenue and staffing. We wanted to make sure all of those things were in place before we start to expand from a sales perspective."Alchemy has expanded its supply base and started carrying a few new product lines, adding plasticizers at the end of 2017, he said. It's built out its logistics infrastructure with service providers to facilitate both transportation and market information. With its growth, Alchemy has complete audit capabilities of its supply base, building up employees to strengthen relationships with suppliers.At www.alchemyrubber.com, Alchemy actively provides market updates and intelligence, Bohan said. From the supply side in China, it covers topics such as pricing, capacity and availability, or other factors that affect the cost of chemicals offered in China.The company also provides economic data that influences forecasting capabilities, as well as transportation news that affects importing products from China."So if there's market intelligence related to freight costs or capacity, we'll include that," Bohan said.The website also includes a calendar, which will actively list events that affect the market, he said. For example, the calendar marks the Chinese Mid-Autumn Festival, which falls on Sept. 22-24 this year."If there are global conferences or any type of government-related activity on the world or regional stage, the Chinese government may influence manufacturing in order to improve the environment, or security around the conference," Bohan said.Environmental pressuresLast year, the chemicals market in China was under pressure as China's Environmental Protection Administration indiscriminately shut down all facilities facing high pollution levels. The shutdowns were sudden and could be indefinite. That environmental scrutiny continued through the end of 2017, and then backed off, Bohan said.Inspections slowed down during the beginning of 2018, which gave smaller operators a chance to start back up and eased concerns among customers, he said. But near the beginning of May, the government's environmental teams began affecting operations in Hunan province, disrupting general supply base operations there.Bohan said he's uncertain where the government's environmental scrutiny is going, but he doesn't see it relaxing. Though smaller operators have restarted processes, they'll face difficulty surviving long term with other regulations incoming.One hurdle chemical suppliers face is a 2017 guideline that requires chemical producers to relocate plants in urban areas to chemical-specific industrial parks to manufacture product, Bohan said. The deadline for smaller chemical companies to make that move is 2020, while larger operations have until 2025."This is really going to be a catalyst that forces some of that old infrastructure out, and I think that's part of it," Bohan said. "There is new technology to reduce wastewater and things like that."China's new Environmental Protection Tax Law also puts pressure on chemical producers, as it taxes chemical companies on wastewater and carbon dioxide output. The new tax, effective as of April 2018, doesn't affect all companies equally, Bohan said."If you have advanced pollution control systems, the impact is very low," he said. "But if you're an old, dirty plant, it puts an economic strain on the business. That is going to affect the smaller producer that hasn't invested in their infrastructure."Bohan said these overlying issues would affect production capacity and increase the price, but demand is very low. Beginning in May of this year, the market has seen a gradual price slide."Domestic demand in China is very, very low right now specifically for rubber chemicals," he said. "I don't know if it can be tied to tariffs, or if companies have reduced production because they see their export volumes being reduced."Alchemy gathers market data both by working with various information sources and doing its own legwork. In the past year, it's seen record sales, and is continuing to expand its coverage of the chemical supply chain to bring more reliable information to the process. The company is continuing development of a pedigree program that will allow customers to track Chinese-supplied chemicals to the source, Bohan said."It's our goal to provide complete transparency to the supply chain," he said.Load-Date: September 4, 2018End of Document

A legendary Israeli venture capitalist explains why anyone against cooperation with China is 'crazy'Business Insider USJuly 9, 2018 Monday 01:47 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 684 wordsByline: hjacobs@businessinsider.com,  (Harrison Jacobs)Highlight: Israel is particularly vulnerable to a global trade war between the US and China. A legendary Israeli venture capitalist told Business Insider that "the world's development" hinges on China and the US finding a better way to coexist economically.BodyGetty Images / Thomas Peter-Pool• The US and China are currently engaged in a trade war that could have ramifications for the entire global economy.• Israel, which has significant economic ties to both countries, is particularly vulnerable to a global trade war.• Legendary Israeli venture capitalist Erel Margalit told Business Insider that "the world's development" hinges on China and the US finding a better way to coexist economically.• Margalit called economic development the most successful driver of social change in China, said it's important that such development continues.The US and China engaged in the first shots of a potential trade war last week when the Trump administration announced a 25% tariff worth $34 billion on Chinese products, including televisions, aircraft parts, nuclear reactors, and vehicles.China responded later that day with $34 billion worth of tariffs of its own, primarily on agricultural products.A full-blown global trade war could cost the world economy $470 billion by 2020, according to an analysis by Bloomberg Economics.Meanwhile, one country with significant ties to both countries' economies is looking on nervously.Israel is particularly exposed to a global trade war. The country exports 30% of its GDP in goods and services and derives significant investment and growth for its            booming technology sector via the US and China.The episode has left some Israeli businessmen, like legendary venture capitalist Erel Margalit, feeling caught in the middle."The Chinese and the Americans need to find a better way to coexist from an economic standpoint. It's extremely important for the world's development," Margalit told Business Insider. "China is developing new business models today that are ahead of anyone else."Thomson ReutersMargalit is the founder of Jerusalem Venture Partners, one of the country's oldest and most successful venture funds. The company has created and invested in over 120 companies in the US, Israel, and Europe. As of 2015, it also            includes investment from Alibaba, China's biggest tech company.While Israeli tech has long relied on American investors, it has increasingly turned to China in recent years. China's total investment in Israel tripled to $16 billion last year."We believe that China will be the largest investor in the Israeli market in the technology sector. It will surpass the US," Edouard Cukierman, the French-Israeli chairman of Cukierman Investments House and managing partner at Catalyst-CEL, told The Jerusalem Post in December. "For many years, the Israeli hi-tech industry has been supported and led by American investors. Companies aimed for NASDAQ or the US market for exits, for IPOs."The number of Chinese financial firms that invested in Israeli tech companies doubled from 18 in 2013 to 34 in 2017, but Chinese investment in venture capital funds has gone down over the same period.As Margalit looks at the global economy, he said it's important to continue building "new dimensions of cooperation" between China, the US, and other global economies. But, he said, it needs to be done in a way that respects intellectual property and is non-threatening. Anyone against that, he said, is "crazy.""The biggest social change in China is happening economically, not through Jeffersonian democracy," Margalit said. "People need to understand it. It's important for everybody that continues to happen."NOW WATCH: What it means to be 'fearless' at work and how you can get over your fearSee Also:• Boris Johnson resigns as foreign secretary in major Brexit blow to Theresa May• Costco employees share their 9 best tips for getting an even better deal on your next shopping trip• In 2014, hell broke loose for the CEO of a young startup - and the way she handled it helped her company become one of the fastest-growing in all of ChinaSEE ALSO: The biggest difference between China and the US today explains why China is taking over the global economyDON'T MISS: Inside the creepy and impressive startup funded by the Chinese government that is developing AI that can recognize anyone, anywhereLoad-Date: February 11, 2019End of Document

Investors fear that the blocking of the Monster Hunter: World videogame regulators could severely punish the company's revenues.  Industry analysts hoped that this video game, where participants hunt fearsome creatures, was one of the biggest hits of the year. Yesterday, Tencent removed it from its platform and published a statement saying that regulators received a large number of complaints regarding the game, which has sold 8 million copies worldwide.  The shares of Tencent, which will release its accounts for the first semester next Wednesday, have fallen by 3.4 percent. The company's shares have fallen more than 14% this year and its capitalization has lost more than 140,000 million euros since its peak last January.  "Investors are very concerned about Tencent in the short term," said Douglas Morton, head of analysis for Asia at Northern Trust Capital Markets.  Several industry executives have said that many companies since March have been waiting for the Chinese government to give them licenses to sell their videogames, but they have encountered problems because China has changed the structure of its regulatory body.  "The key here is that we are not getting licenses for any game," a Tencent employee told Reuters.  This person has also ensured that the company's development team does not understand why Monster Hunter: World has been blocked when it is less violent than other titles and had also been approved by regulators before March.  "It is not impossible that they can hit you even after they have passed to the censors, in the same way that they can remove a film from the cinema," the employee said.  Neither Tencent nor the Chinese Ministry of Culture and Tourism, which regulates the video game industry, have wanted to answer questions about it.  Tencent has ensured that customers who purchased Monster Hunter: World may receive a refund until August 20 .  erp Load-Date: August 14, 2018End of Document

LIU XIA LEAVES CHINA FOR GERMANY AFTER EIGHT YEARS OF HOUSE ARRESTStates News ServiceJuly 10, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 870 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Liu Xia, the widow of late Chinese Nobel peace laureate Liu Xiaobo, left China on Tuesday after growing international pressure for her release from eight years of house arrest, an extrajudicial confinement that took a huge toll on her physical and mental health."Liu Xia ... left Beijing at noon on a Finnair flight from Beijing to Berlin," veteran political journalist Gao Yu said via Twitter on Tuesday ."Sources say that this is the result of Li Keqiang's acquiescing in person to a request by the German chancellor Angela Merkel during his visit to Germany," Gao wrote.Liu Xia, who had been held under house arrest and residential surveillance ever since her husband's Nobel Peace Prize was announced in October 2010 , was photographed grinning broadly with outstretched arms as she made a stopover in Helsinki, en route to Germany.Her release by the ruling Chinese Communist Party came three days ahead of the anniversary of Liu Xiaobo's death in a prison hospital from late-stage liver cancer.The authorities' refusal to allow Liu Xiaobo or Liu Xia to leave China at that point prompted an international outcry.Germany-based activist Liao Tianqi, who has been closely involved in the campaign for her to resettle in Germany, told RFA that he was "too happy for words" at the news."Especially because it has happened around the anniversary of Liu Xiaobo's death," Liao said. "We couldn't save Liu Xiaobo, which is a regret that I will carry for the rest of my life, and we wouldn't have been able to bear it if anything had happened to his widow." Great anger at unjust treatment But he said great anger remained among Liu Xia's supporters and rights campaigners."The Chinese government didn't treat Liu Xia like a human being ... at a time that she was already grieving the loss of her husband; they treated her like a chess piece; a gift to Angela Merkel," he said.Liu Xia, a 57-year-old poet and artist, has never been accused of any crime, and was last seen in public at Liu Xiaobo's funeral in July 2017 .Her departure for Germany also came as Chinese premier Li Keqiang wrapped up an official visit to Germany, and after U.N. human rights experts had voiced concerns for her mental health.Leaked audio clips earlier this year showed her to have been in a highly distressed and desperate state of mind prior to her release.Fellow writers and rights activists welcomed the news of her release on social media on Tuesday ."Liu Xia is finally fulfilling Liu Xiaobo's wishes and escaping from the prison that is China," author Ma Jian said via his Twitter account. "I am happy for her, but I will continue to pray for all of the tens of thousands of prisoners who remain in Chinese jails, hospitals and homes. All of those disappeared lawyers and authors are still without their freedom.""We would like to thank all of those concerned people outside of China who worked tirelessly to put pressure on this dictatorial regime," Ma wrote.U.S.-based dissident Yang Jianli tweeted that "Liu Xia has found her freedom among the clouds, tens of thousands of feet up in the sky." Liu's brother remains as hostage Since Liu Xiaobo's death, Liu Xia had repeatedly asked to be allowed overseas to seek medical and psychological treatment for her own illnesses, but the authorities had previously appeared to be dragging their feet on a reported arrangement allowing her to leave the country.Beijing-based rights activist Hu Jia, a close friend and long-time supporter of Liu's, said her departure came a little earlier than expected."Most of us thought it would likely be in August, but the trade war between the U.S. and China has escalated so much that the Chinese Communist Party is keen to rope in the E.U. as a trading partner," Hu said. "It also takes the pressure off for the [ July 13 ] anniversary of Liu Xiaobo's death.""Now, she will be able to hang out with friends, eat together and talk together, just like a normal person," Hu said.But he said the authorities still control the fate of Liu Xia's brother Liu Hui, which will likely act as a restraint on what she can do or say in Germany."There is still the sword of Damocles hanging over Liu Hui's head, should his sister start shooting her mouth off over in Europe," Hu said.Meanwhile, the writers' group Independent Chinese PEN says its members and officers have been targeted by the authorities over their continuing public support for Liu Xia.Last month, poet Wang Zang resigned from the post of president of the group soon after being voted in, following a period of police questioning.Liu Xiaobo died on July 13 , 2017 of late-stage liver cancer, while serving an 11-year jail term for subversion, and the authorities denied requests for him and Liu Xia to travel overseas to seek medical treatment.Eyewitnesses say he played a crucial role in negotiating a truce between student protesters and People's Liberation Army troops sent in to end the protests at Beijing's Tiananmen Square on the night of June 3-4, 1989, enabling hundreds to leave safely.

But Trump said on Wednesday he was not ready to make a trade deal with Beijing, according to US media. The US accuses China of unfair practices, particularly on technology. Trump also wants to slash the countries' trade deficit, which reached USD375 billion last year.US tariffs already imposed apply to Chinese goods such as semiconductor chips and machinery parts. Chinese duties affect a range of US agricultural products as well as petrol, vehicles and medical equipment, among other things.Load-Date: September 7, 2018End of Document

UDPDATE: US And China Raise Tariffs In New Round Of Trade DisputeLive Briefs PRO Global MarketsAugust 23, 2018 Thursday 7:42 AM ESTCopyright 2018 MT Newswires All Rights ReservedLength: 500 wordsBody The US and China have gone ahead with tariff hikes on billions of dollars of each other's goods in an escalation of a battle over Beijing's technology policy that companies worry will chill global economic growth.The increases came as envoys met in Washington for their first high-level talks in two months.They gave no sign of progress towards a settlement over US complaints that Beijing steals technology and its industry development plans violate Chinese free trade commitments.The 25% duties, previously announced, apply to USD16 billion of goods from each side, including vehicles and scrap metal from the US and Chinese-made factory machinery and electronic components.In the first round of tariff hikes, US President Donald Trump imposed 25% duties on EUR34 billion of Chinese imports on July 6.Beijing responded with similar penalties on the same amount of American goods.The Chinese government criticised Thursday's US increase as a violation of World Trade Organisation rules and said it would file a legal challenge.Foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang declined to give details of the Washington talks."We hope the US side will get along with us to strive for a good result from the talks with a reasonable and practical attitude," said Lu.Beijing has rejected US demands to scale back plans for state-led technology development that its trading partners say violate its market-opening commitments.American officials worry they might erode the US's industrial leadership.With no settlement in sight, economists warn the conflict could spread and knock up to 0.5 percentage points off global economic growth through 2020.Ahead of the Washington talks, Chinese state TV mocked Trump with a sarcastic video posted on YouTube and other social media pages of its international arm, China Global Television Network."You are great," said a presenter on the nearly three-minute-long English-language clip, reading a letter that pays a satirical tribute to Trump."On behalf of doctors, thank you for pointing out the need to wean off American goods like bourbon and bacon," the presenter says, referring to products on which China imposed retaliatory tariffs.The video appeared to have been removed on Thursday from CGTN's social media accounts.Trump has proposed another possible round of tariff hikes imposing 25% increases on an additional USD200 billion of Chinese goods.Beijing issued a USD60 billion list of American imports for retaliation if Washington goes ahead with that.That smaller target list reflects the fact that Beijing is running out of American goods for retaliation due to its lopsided trade balance.China's imports from the US last year totalled about USD130 billion. That leaves about USD20 billion for penalties after tariffs already imposed or planned on a total of USD110 billion.Chinese authorities have said they will take "comprehensive measures", which companies worry could mean targeting operations of American businesses in China for disruption.source: Press AssociationLoad-Date: August 24, 2018End of Document

Apple removes thousands of 'illegal' gambling apps from Chinese App StoreStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeAugust 23, 2018 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: HI-TECH; Pg. 1Length: 362 wordsByline: Sandy MccarthyBodyApple has deleted thousands of gambling apps from its App Store in China, following pressure from the state-run broadcaster CCTV.Apple has removed what the Chinese government considers to be illegal gambling apps from the App Store. That 25,000 apps have beenremoved from the app store is being propagated by the Chinese official media channel CCTV thoughApple is yet to confirm the figure. The company said the move affected illegal gambling apps.Apple has been under fire from Chinese news outlets for its weak enforcement in filtering banned content and applications. Among those, 4,000 apps were tagged with the words like "lottery" and "gambling", and were reportedly involved in selling fake lottery tickets and offering gambling services.The state media attacks came at a vulnerable time forApple, which like other USA companies operating in China, is caught in the middle amid growing trade friction between Washington, D.C. andBeijing. The market there is just too big forApple to pull out of altogether. A year ago saw it remove 700 VPN apps from the store, which were used to circumvent the country's Great Firewall and access blocked websites and social media platforms.Similar to the Aurora new celestial phenomenon has puzzled scientistsThe solar winds interact with the charged particles from Earth's magnetosphere, mainly with protons and electrons. The study's results suggest STEVE is an entirely new phenomenon distinct from typical auroras.In a statement to Bloomberg,Apple said that the gambling apps are illegal and are not allowed in the Chinese App Store. Last summer,Apple took down 700 virtual private network apps, which allow users to evade internet censorship. The VPN services, which were used to fool China's "Great Firewall", failed to meet the Chinese regulations.A CCTV report a month ago blamed the organization for permitting illicit gambling-related apps to multiply. These days trade warfare between China and the USA is going on.Apple's refusal to break encryption and allow access to intelligence agencies and police is well known in the USA and other western markets.Apple's iMessage app was also criticized by state media recently.Load-Date: August 24, 2018End of Document

China would not only survive a fight with the US, but it would prosper: AlibabaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 24, 2018 FridayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 503 wordsBody NEW YORK (CNNMoney) - The Chinese giant of e-commerce, Alibaba, does not want a trade war.  But the company said on Thursday that China would not only survive a fight with the United States, but would prosper.  And the same could happen with Alibaba.  Alibaba vice president Joseph Tsai told analysts during a earnings teleconference on Thursday that "if US products become too expensive due to tariffs, Chinese consumers could opt for domestic producers or imports from other parts of the world" .  Tsai's comments came just hours after the United States and China each implemented a second round of tariffs on goods valued at 16 billion dollars.  "We believe that the Chinese government policy will continue to support imports into China to meet the growing demand of Chinese consumers," said Tsai.  No one wins in a commercial war, but ...  Tsai added that Alibaba does not want business talks to deteriorate further, but is prepared for the worst case scenario. Alibaba will have no problem finding customers in other markets if the United States suddenly becomes a more difficult place to do business, he said.  "In terms of our international expansion, the world is a great place. We have made substantial progress in emerging markets such as Southeast and South Asia, as these markets are ready for us to add more consumers to our ecosystem, "said Tsai.  Tsai added that China has become less dependent on exports over the years and that its economy can withstand tariffs on Chinese products. He made similar comments after the company reported its results in May.  But Alibaba still has global aspirations. The founder and CEO, Jack Ma, has repeatedly said that Alibaba wants to do more business with big American brands. Several American companies already sell products on the Taobao and Tmall websites of Alibaba.  The leader of the American supermarkets Kroger has just opened a store in Tmall.  Alibaba also recently reached an agreement with Starbucks to sell coffee on its Ele.me delivery platform.  Tsai said the Starbucks agreement shows that Alibaba "works constructively with US brands to better serve Chinese consumers."  Tsai also suggested that some American workers could be harmed if a full-fledged trade war develops.  "By looking at the presence of Alibaba in the United States, our goal is to help US farmers and small businesses sell their products to Chinese consumers," said Tsai.  Solid sales in the cloud  The concerns of a trade war do not seem to have a big impact on Alibaba. The company reported sales that exceeded forecasts, led by an increase of more than 60% in retail revenue.  Shares rose initially in early trading on Thursday, but the stock lost its gains as the day progressed.  Alibaba is also a strong leader in cloud computing, a lucrative business currently dominated by Amazon's AWS unit, Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud.  Alibaba's cloud sales almost doubled from a year ago, and it is looking to host websites for more companies, including US companies. Load-Date: August 24, 2018End of Document

All Rights ReservedLength: 285 wordsByline: ELIZABETH SHIMDateline: July 3 BodyChina and the United States are expected to launch a potentially damaging trade war, but Beijing could hit its rival with tariffs first.The Chinese government could enjoy early mover advantage this Friday, because of the time difference between Washington and Beijing, Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun reported Tuesday.According to the report, the Chinese authorities will allow its tariffs against U.S. products to go into effect starting at 12 a.m. Friday.When Beijing levies those extra charges against products like U.S. soybeans, whiskey, and automobiles, it will be 6 p.m. Thursday in Washington.China will impose the taxes on a total of $34 billion worth of U.S. goods.The trade war could hurt multinational carmakers that sell imported U.S. vehicles in China.The companies had been enjoying a 15 percent tariff on imports but an additional 25 percent levy means they will now pay a tariff of 40 percent.China is retaliating against the United States after the Trump administration decided to impose a 25 percent tariff on $34 billion worth of Chinese products, starting Friday.Those goods are only a portion of the 1,333 Chinese products on the administration's list that includes electronics, iron and steel plates, engines and industrial robots.Following President 's warnings against Chinese technological advancements, Chinese President  has issued instructions to local media to not "excessively exaggerate" Chinese progress in science and technology, according to the Communist Party's People's Daily on Monday."An arrogant style of writing lowers trust in the media and pollutes public opinion," the newspaper stated. "It does not help to bind the masses together or create a clean network space."Load-Date: July 4, 2018End of Document

Trump Administration Moves To Block China Mobile From Offering Services In U.S.CE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 3, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 431 wordsBody       In a move that could further inflame trade tensions between the U.S. and China, President Donald Trump's administration has recommended blocking China Mobile from offering telecommunications services from within the U.S. A statement from the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, an agency of the Commerce Department, attributed the recommendation to national security concerns. "After significant engagement with China Mobile, concerns about increased risks to U.S. law enforcement and national security interests were unable to be resolved," said David Redl, NTIA Administrator and Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information. Redl said the NTIA subsequently recommends that the Federal Communications Commission deny China Mobile's Section 214 license request. The decision by the NTIA comes amid an ongoing trade dispute between the U.S. and China, with tariffs on billions of dollars worth of U.S. and Chinese goods set to take effect later this week. The NTIA claimed state-owned China Mobile is subject to exploitation, influence, and control by the Chinese government. As a result, the NTIA argued granting China Mobile's application would "produce substantial and unacceptable national security and law enforcement risks." Republican Senator Marco Rubio, R-Fla., applauded the decision in a post on Twitter on Tuesday, suggesting every Chinese telecommunications company poses grave security risks. "Agree with this decision 100%. It would be grossly irresponsible to allow #ChinaMobile to operate in the U.S. market. Like every #China telecommunication company, they pose a grave security risk," Rubio tweeted. Last month, the Senate voted 85 to 10 in favor of a defense policy bill that included a provision that would essentially kill the Trump administration's agreement to end crippling sanctions on Chinese telecom giant ZTE Corp. The bill would restore penalties on ZTE for violating export controls and prohibit government agencies from purchasing or leasing telecommunications equipment or services from the company. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had previously announced an agreement lifting an order that banned ZTE from buying American products. The agreement included a $1 billion fine against ZTE and forced the company to replace its board of directors and executive team and install a U.S.-chosen compliance team. The bill must still be reconciled with a version previously approved by the House, and the White House is pushing negotiators to revise the ZTE language in the joint conference committee.        Load-Date: July 3, 2018End of Document

Trump going ahead with plans for new China tariffsStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeSeptember 17, 2018 MondayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: MARKETS; Pg. 1Length: 453 wordsByline: Jean GarciaBodyThe tariffs come as a number of top White House advisers have been trying to de-escalate tensions between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.A higher tariff of 25% is already in force on $50 billion worth of imports from China, and the period for public comments on a proposal to extend it to another $200 billion worth of goods ended recently."We encourage China to address the long standing concerns raised by the U.S.".But Trump has signaled that he thinks only the threat of real economic pain will push Beijing to make major changes.Trump's top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow told Fox News on Wednesday that the USA government had received information that "the top of the Chinese government wished to pursue talks" prompting Mnuchin to send an invitation.Chelsea eye recently-signed Premier League striker as Morata doubts growCardiff have two points from five games. "We are patient, so we don't go too fast too early", Hazard told Chelsea's official website.China, which has accused the USA of trade bullying, has matched the tariffs dollar for dollar. Bloomberg reports that President Trump has told his top trade advisors that he "wasn't concerned" about their impact on negotiations with China. American officials also worry they might erode USA industrial leadership. The Journal reported that the Chinese had hoped that any final decision on tariffs would be delayed until after the next round of talks. This tactic has had mixed success. But Trump later raised questions about it, saying on Twitter that he was under no pressure to make a deal with Beijing and predicting that the United States "will soon be taking in Billions in Tariffs & making products at home". Some of them have criticized Trump's tactics but many echo USA complaints about Chinese market barriers and industrial strategy.The $200 billion tariff list included various internet technology products and other electronics, printed circuit boards, and consumer goods ranging from handbags to bicycles and furniture.And two weeks ago he said he is preparing a third package of penalties on what he said would be $267 billion in additional items, a list that likely encompasses all remaining goods produced in China."We have indeed received an invitation from the USA side". "Talks without action won't do the trick". If all of the tariffs were invoked, total imports from China facing tariffs would exceed the $505 billion in goods that the United States imported from China a year ago. Depending on how the talks go, Liu may then speak with Trump. The two leaders may see each other at the United Nations General Assembly in NY this month and are scheduled to meet on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Buenos Aires in November.Load-Date: September 17, 2018End of Document

The groups urged the administration to avoid further escalation with China and warned of the negative impact of tariffs on American businesses, families and workers."Continuing the tit-for-tat tariff escalation with China only serves to expand the harm to more U.S. economic interests, including farmers, families, businesses and workers," the coalition wrote in a letter . "Our organizations agree that longstanding issues in China have negatively impacted many U.S. companies, and we support the administration's efforts to negotiate meaningful, binding and long-term solutions with the Chinese government, (but) applying these high levels of tariffs on Chinese products will continue to miss the mark.""The negative impact will fall particularly hard on small- and medium-sized businesses and their workers, who lack the scale, resources and options to weather or adapt to these tariffs," the groups said. Tariffs "are counterproductive and so far have only produced increased costs" for U.S. businesses and consumers.The groups expressed concern over the administration's suggestion that the United States might impose tariffs on all Chinese imports."The effects of the administration's actions will most hurt the very consumers, small- and medium-sized businesses, manufacturers, farmers and workers the administration wants to protect," the letter said. "Should all trade to and from China be subject to tariffs, the impacts and disruptions to the U.S. economy would reach across the entire country, from sector to sector, and negatively impact every American family."The letter said imposing a 25 percent tariff on a total of $250 billion in Chinese imports - including both tariffs that have already gone into effect this summer and those currently under consideration - would result in $62.5 billion in tariff costs for U.S. businesses and consumers each year.

Alipay Distances itself from Cryptocurrency as China's Clampdown Intensifies FurtherStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeAugust 27, 2018 MondayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: MARKETS; Pg. 1Length: 420 wordsByline: Jean GarciaBodyTencent's WeChat Pay operator TenPay will monitor daily transactions and directly intercept any illegal trading.Ant Financial told Beijing News on Friday that users ofAlipay are not allowed to use the financial network to trade bitcoin in OTC and unregulated markets.With such extensive size and market share of the overall industry, Chinese government unquestionably realizes that the services ofAlipay would be utilized by a crypto fan to trade digital currencies and it is trusted that the regulators need to cut it. Furthermore, the government body is working out the strategy to block access to 124 exchanges operating from overseas.In addition to that, the firm will also be monitoring notable sites that have integrated Alipay into their system.'Crazy Rich Asians' sequel in early development at Warner BrosThe hit movie , which has grossed more than $35 million since August 15 world debut in Los Angeles, is mostly set in Singapore . The book also follows Rachel (Constance Wu) and Nick (Henry Golding) as they go to China to find Rachel's father.Earlier this week, theChina National FinTech Risk Rectification Office announced that it will be blocking 124 overseas crypto trading platforms from offering trading services to domestic investors. "If we find any transactions that we suspect are related to virtual currencies, we take appropriate measures including, but not limited to suspension of related fund transfers and permanently restricting payment collection functions of accounts involved".PBOC has talked a few times to third-party payment platforms including Tenpay andAnt Financial, ordering them not to offer any services related to virtual currencies such as BitCoin. The operator will also offer education on risk prevention for its users and remind them not to be misled by advertising,Ant Financial confirmed. A tweet realized by the Korean Cryptocurrency and Blockchain News that mentioned, also mentions Fiat payment channels will be highly monitored apart from Communication channels and Exchange blocks. In a ruling by the People's Bank ofChina late previous year, the institution made a decision to ban all cryptocurrency trading, as well as all Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). The ban has led to 88 local cryptocurrency exchanges and 85 ICO platforms been forced out of the country.After the Chinese government banned crypto exchanges from providing service to Chinese citizens, traders had to resort to other means of trading, and thus back-alley transactions like OTC cryptocurrency trading.Load-Date: August 27, 2018End of Document

Report: China, Russia and Iran ramp up economic spying on USAssociated Press InternationalJuly 26, 2018 Thursday 8:16 PM GMTCopyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: WASHINGTON DATELINELength: 872 wordsByline: By DEB RIECHMANN, Associated PressDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) - A Chinese cyberespionage group called APT10 relentlessly attacks U.S. engineering, telecom and aerospace industries. Russian hackers last year compromised dozens of U.S. energy companies. Iranian hackers known as "Rocket Kitten" repeatedly target American defense companies in hopes of stealing information to boost Tehran's missile and space programs.While Moscow's efforts to meddle in the 2016 U.S. presidential election are widely known, spy services from China, Russia and Iran, along with their proxy hackers, also are hard at work trying to steal trade secrets and proprietary information from the United States, according to a government report released Thursday. A classified version of the report was sent to Congress."Foreign economic and industrial espionage against the United States continues to represent a significant threat to America's prosperity, security and competitive advantage," the National Counterintelligence and Security Center said. "China, Russia and Iran stand out as three of the most capable and active cyber actors tied to economic espionage and the potential theft of U.S. trade secrets and proprietary information."Cyberespionage is a relatively low-cost, high-yield way to access and acquire information from U.S. research institutions, universities and corporations, the report said. More vulnerabilities will emerge with the increase in cloud computing, artificial intelligence and the proliferation of vehicles, home appliances, medical devices and other items connected to the internet.Cyberoperations are the preferred method for conducting economic espionage, the report said, but U.S. adversaries also acquire sensitive information by hiring sophisticated hackers, recruiting spies or gleaning material from foreign students studying at American universities.Adversaries also are infiltrating computer networks of suppliers that serve large companies and then using that connection to worm their way up the chain into large corporate computer systems. Bill Evanina, the nation's top counterintelligence official and director of the center, told reporters at a briefing that business leaders need to investigate the security of computer systems used by companies that supply their air conditioning and heating, printers and copiers and the like."Our economic security is our national security," Evanina said "We cannot just get numb to our adversaries stealing our intellectual property."The report listed two dozen technologies that have piqued the interest of foreign intelligence collectors. They include oil, gas and coal-bed methane gas energies; smart grids; solar and wind technologies; biopharmaceuticals and new vaccines and drugs; defensive marine systems and radar; hybrid and electric cars; pollution control; high-end computer numerically controlled machines, which are used to control factory tools and machines in manufacturing; space infrastructure and exploration technology; synthetic rubber; rare earth materials; quantum computing; and next generation broadband wireless communications networks.Michael Moss, deputy director of the government's Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center, said incidents of economic espionage are growing rapidly. "The thing that continues to surprise me is how fast it continues to accelerate. It's getting faster and faster," he said.China uses joint ventures to try to acquire technical know-how, the report said. It said Beijing seeks partnerships with U.S. government labs to learn about specific technology and information about running such facilities and uses front companies to hide the hand of the Chinese government and acquire technology under U.S. export controls.The Trump administration has railed against China, imposed new tariffs and called for Beijing to end the theft of intellectual property from U.S. companies. The administration also wants China to curb policies that require American and other foreign businesses to hand over technology in exchange for access to the Chinese market."If this threat is not addressed, it could erode America's long-term competitive economic advantage," the report said.Economic espionage conducted by hackers linked to Russia is mostly aimed at finding ways to inflict damage on the United States, disrupt services or benefit its economic interests, according to the report."In support of that goal, Russian intelligence services have conducted sophisticated and large-scale hacking operations to collect sensitive U.S. business and technology information," the report said. It also said that Russian "military modernization efforts also likely will be a motivating factor for Russia to steal U.S intellectual property."Iranian's operations have typically targeted adversaries in the Middle East, such as Israel and Saudi Arabia. But it also tries to infiltrate U.S. networks to acquire technologies to bolster economic growth, modernize its military and increase exports."The loss of sensitive information and technologies not only presents a significant threat to U.S. national security," the report said. "It also enables Tehran to develop advanced technologies to boost domestic economic growth, modernize its military forces and increase its foreign sales."Load-Date: July 27, 2018End of Document

Chairman Poe Issues Statement at Hearing on China's Trade, Investment StrategyTargeted News ServiceJuly 11, 2018 Wednesday 8:20 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 821 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation and Trade, and subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific issued the following statement by Chairman Ted Poe, R-Texas, at a joint hearing entitled "China's Predatory Trade and Investment Strategy":"No nation on Earth has benefited more from the post- War world order than China. From freedom of the seas, to free markets, to free exchanges of ideas, China has harnessed the international system built by the U.S. and its allies to become a major world power. In the last 30 years, with the embrace of the global economy, more than 800 million people have been lifted out of poverty in China."But despite this historic achievement, China does not want to play by the rules. Rather than help preserve the global system that allowed China to grow so rapidly, it is exploiting its vulnerabilities to gain a strategic edge over competitors. China has no intention of becoming an equal partner in the world community."Just as the Chinese Communist Party does not want rivals at home, it wants a fixed global system that assures its dominance. This includes surpassing the United States as the leading economic, political, and military power. To achieve economic dominance, China has resorted to cheating. This includes enacting predatory policies such as:- stealing intellectual property,- forcing technology transfers in exchange for market access,- imposing discriminatory licenses on foreign companies while subsidizing competing Chinese companies,- and intentionally investing in American companies to acquire sensitive U.S. technology."Beijing is also intentionally overproducing steel and aluminum to drive down prices and make it harder for competing producers to remain profitable. Ultimately, billions of dollars and millions of jobs in the U.S. have been lost because of China's cheating. But China has shown no sign of changing course. Instead, it has launched two major schemes to strengthen its economy and expand its control of the global market."First, through its "Made in China 2025" plan, China is attempting to become the leader in hi-tech industries. To do this, China is subverting the free market by imposing quotas and state subsidies to prevent competition and gain self-sufficiency. It is also prioritizing the takeover of foreign tech companies through state-owned enterprises. Combined with state sponsored cyber theft, China hopes to monopolize hi-tech innovation and production at the expense of the U.S. and its allies."Second, China launched the ambitious "Belt and Road" Initiative. Chinese officials claim the project is intended to strengthen trade infrastructure and partnerships across Asia, Africa, and Europe to revive and modernize the ancient Silk Road. But in reality "Belt and Road" is a debt trap for vulnerable economies that only benefits China. By providing massive loans to high risk markets, China fools developing nations desperate for investment into believing it's a 'win-win' deal that will ensure jobs for their citizens and attract foreign business. However, 89% of the construction contracts go to Chinese companies, Chinese workers, and Chinese materials, meanwhile the host country is left paying unsustainable debt when the projects go bust. Meanwhile, Beijing bribes and coerces local governments, ensuring Chinese influence. This results in countries being forced to side with China's interests or accepting a Chinese military presence. Additionally, this practice fuels corruption in struggling democracies."In the end, China does not share our values. We have long seen this in their human rights record, but now it is obvious in their trade policies. In 2001, we encouraged China's inclusion in the World Trade Organization. We thought China was evolving from the backwards political theories of the past and opening up to free market and rule-based trade. We were wrong."The liberalizing economic reforms we expected never came. Instead, the government increased its intervention in the economy. It is time we adapt our trade policies while working with our allies to confront China's bad behavior. Beijing has proven it is not a responsible and fair player in the global economy. It should suffer the penalties. This is necessary to maintain the stability and integrity of international markets."China has enormous potential. It has a massive population that is hard working and well educated. It has a history of innovation and trade dating back thousands of years. It does not need to cheat to be a major power. Its only major obstacle is its repressive communist government. But so long as that government is in power and uses predatory trade and investment practices to get ahead, companies and nations should avoid doing business with China."China needs to be held accountable for its bad behavior, not rewarded."And that's just the way it is."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6364810 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: July 12, 2018End of Document

State Department Conducts Daily Press Briefing, July 24Targeted News ServiceJuly 24, 2018 Tuesday 8:09 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 6377 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe U.S. Department of State issued the following transcript of the daily press briefing by spokesperson Heather Nauert:MS NAUERT: Hi, everybody. How are you?QUESTION: Wow, a briefing.MS NAUERT: I'm sorry?QUESTION: Wow, a briefing.MS NAUERT: It's good to be back with you. As you know, it always is good to be back with you. We've obviously had a very busy travel schedule lately, Michelle. We look forward to having you on the trip. (Laughter.)So I'd like to start out with a few announcements. I wanted to begin by noting that the State Department welcomed our new assistant secretary for the Bureau of African Affairs yesterday, Ambassador Tibor Nagy is a retired Foreign Service officer who spent 32 years in government service, including more than 20 years in assignments across Africa. He served as the United States ambassador to Ethiopia and ambassador to Guinea. He also served as deputy chief of mission in Nigeria, Cameroon, and Togo. For the past 15 years, he's served as vice provost for the international affairs at his alma mater, Texas Tech University, and we are thrilled to have him back here at the State Department. We're excited to have him get to work. There's a lot of good stuff going on there.Next, I'd like to mention that on Monday, July the 30th, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce will host the Indo-Pacific Business Forum, including keynote remarks by Secretary Pompeo on America's Indo-Pacific economic vision. The forum will outline the economic and commercial components of our Indo-Pacific strategy. The day-long program will include participation from senior administration officials, the private sector, and officials representing Indo-Pacific nations. The forum will highlight U.S. Government initiatives to advance economic engagement in the region, particularly on key sectors including energy and infrastructure and the digital economy. The forum will also emphasize the importance of public-private partnerships, the benefits of transparency and good governance, and unlocking the power of markets for sustainable development, and the need for U.S. collaboration with regional partners.The program on July the 30th will also include Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, OPIC President Ray Washburne, Acting Ex-Im Bank Chairman Jeffrey Gerrish, and USAID Administrator Mark Green. We'll have some additional information for you all on that soon.Next, I'd like to talk about the deteriorating situation in Nicaragua. I know many of you are following that closely. The United States Government condemns the ongoing the violence and intimidation by the Ortega-controlled armed groups in Nicaragua. That includes the arbitrary arrests of 700 Nicaraguans who have opposed the Ortega government, as corroborated by multiple sources. We also condemn the cowardly attacks on the Catholic Church leadership, the buildings, and adherents there. Along with the deaths of hundreds of protesters, the attacks have been widely documented internationally and are completely unacceptable. The Nicaraguan Government cannot continue to its excuse its behavior and blame others for its actions or the actions of those affiliated with it. The United States continues to support church-led efforts to resolve the ongoing conflict in Nicaragua. We join the international community in calling for early, free, fair, transparent elections and the protection of universal human rights in Nicaragua.That brings me to the next point, and that is something taking place here at the State Department today. I don't know if any of you had a chance to talk with some people who've joined us here for the Secretary's first-ever religious freedom ministerial that's taking place today through Thursday of that - this week. Today, in fact, we've had many survivors of religious persecution join us here at the State Department. Among the other people who are here at the State Department today: a Catholic priest from Nicaragua. I understand some of you may be interested in trying to contact him later to talk about some of his experiences in that country. If anyone is interested in that, I'd be happy to help put you in touch with some folks who are working with him.To that end, Secretary Pompeo and the United States will host the first-ever Ministerial to Advance Religious Freedom here in Washington. That ministerial will bring together foreign ministers and representatives from international organizations, religious communities, and civil society from every region of the world. As the first such event with high-level global and diverse participation, the ministerial will reaffirm the international community's commitment to religious freedom and identify concrete ways to advance shared goals. We look forward to that, and the Secretary will participate, as will the Vice President. Later this week, on Thursday, he will be here at the State Department.QUESTION: Heather, just on that, do you have a list of the participants, the other foreign ministers who are coming? Or could --MS NAUERT: I don't have one handy, but I will see if I can make that available to you. We have - I believe it's more than 80 delegations here taking part.Okay. And with that, I'd be happy to take your questions.QUESTION: Right. Thank you. Yesterday, there were some complaining from the people on the Hill about the Secretary not being able to testify before the House Foreign Affairs Committee. And today, the ranking members of three committees have sent a letter to Secretary Pompeo, Secretary Mattis, and DNI Coats in a - not really - not demanding, I guess, but strongly encouraging them to schedule testimony before their - the HFAC, the - and two other committees before Thursday at noon. Is that - the Secretary said this morning he's looking forward to testifying tomorrow before the Senate.MS NAUERT: Yes.QUESTION: I realize he's on a plane right now flying back. But is this something - I mean, they say it's urgent for him to brief Congress about, in particular, the summit between President Putin and President Trump.MS NAUERT: Look, I can tell you the Secretary would very much like to testify, as the House had invited him to do that, today. However, he's returning from California, where he's been with Secretary Mattis meeting with our important partner, the Australians, in San Francisco. Before that, as you know, he was in the Los Angeles area.He has an extremely busy schedule. That does not mean that talking with members of Congress is not important to him, and that is why he will spend considerable time tomorrow briefing the Senate. Unfortunately, his schedule this week is extremely jammed. We have the religious ministerial in which he will be hosting many foreign ministers from around the country, and there's simply not the time.Now, perhaps if the Senate decides to stay in longer, perhaps there could be some time found on his schedule.QUESTION: The House.MS NAUERT: The House. Excuse me. But the Secretary has a good relationship with his counterparts, and I --QUESTION: His former colleagues.MS NAUERT: His former colleagues. Yes, exactly. And we've had good dialogue going back and forth, and I'm sorry just his schedule does not accommodate it tomorrow.QUESTION: Okay. So basically - or not - they're not saying tomorrow. They're saying by noon on the 26th. So basically, if they want to hear from him in open testimony, they're going to have to stay in Washington longer?MS NAUERT: Matt, this is the way it goes with every cabinet secretary when the Hill tries to ask them to come testify. The secretaries, whether it's the Secretary of State or the Secretary of the Defense, they have extremely packed schedules, and I'm sorry, it's just not something that is - he's going to be able to accommodate at this time. But that - no one should draw any conclusion that speaking with members of Congress is not important to the Secretary.QUESTION: So on the substance of this, when he testifies tomorrow, is he going to be able to talk about the specifics of what was agreed to in Helsinki, if anything? Because frankly, it's been - it's been more than a week now. It's been eight days and nobody seems to know, apart from this business council and the track two idea --MS NAUERT: I guess my question to you is: Why would you want to get ahead of the senators? The senators will have plenty of questions for the Secretary about what took place at the ministerial, and he will - or at the conference.QUESTION: (Off-mike.)MS NAUERT: And I'm sure he will answer those questions.QUESTION: My entire goal in life is to get ahead of the Senate. (Laughter.)MS NAUERT: Yeah, yeah.QUESTION: That's it.MS NAUERT: He will be answering questions --QUESTION: I have no other aspirations in life.MS NAUERT: He will be answering questions tomorrow. And so I won't get ahead of the Secretary, but I will let him take care - control that.QUESTION: All right, fine. I won't ask you to answer the questions that he will be asked tomorrow, but I just want to know: Is he going to be able to put some meat on the very - I don't even know if they're bones - fragments of --MS NAUERT: I guess that is your opinion. The White House has talked about how the President has had full conversations with his foreign affairs counter - with colleagues who work with the President, including the Secretary and other cabinet officials. And I am sure there will be more coming.QUESTION: So he will be able to provide details about --MS NAUERT: I think the President has said and the White House has said that the President had full meetings with cabinet officials after his meeting in Helsinki. And I am not going to get ahead of the Secretary and his testimony on the Hill, but the White House has said that they've all been briefed.Andrea, good morning.QUESTION: Hi. Do you have any problem with the way Moscow has described the so-called agreements from Helsinki?MS NAUERT: Which in particular are you referring to?QUESTION: On Syria, for instance.MS NAUERT: Can you be more specific? Which exactly? Because they've said a lot. Yes.QUESTION: Well, I wish I could be, but I hesitate to take their word for anything.MS NAUERT: Right.QUESTION: So were there agreements on Syria that might involve disengagement in the situation on the ground?MS NAUERT: So I will give you one example that we have seen reports about, and that is about refugees. And I'm not going to be able to comment on everything the Russian Government has said, but the Secretary addressed this on Friday, that there is some sort of proposal regarding refugees in Syria. That's obviously a very serious situation. Our State Department policy continues to be and will not change: We support refugees going home under these conditions - safe, voluntary, dignified returns at the time of their choosing and when it is safe to do so. I don't think the situation, as UNHCR backs up right now, allows for that at this time. Hopefully, someday people will be able to be - to head back home. There have been some parts of Syria where we have seen people slowly be able to return home, but in other parts of country that clearly is not safe.So that's one example that I can give you where --QUESTION: I just wanted to ask you, sort of following up on other things that the Secretary will clearly be asked about tomorrow - the President said today that there had been progress on North Korea. Is he referring to public reports that there has been some signs of deconstruction of that missile launch site, or is there some other development on remains, or are there other developments that are being alluded to?MS NAUERT: Yeah, I can't speak for the President, so I can't comment on that. But I can tell you we have --QUESTION: (Off-mike.)MS NAUERT: I can tell you we have working-level meetings, working-level conversations continuing with the North Korean Government. There is certainly a lot of work left to be done. I can tell you our Deputy Assistant Secretary Mark Lambert is in - heading so Seoul, I believe it's actually today, where he'll be continuing his meetings with his counterparts. So again, a lot of work left to be done, but we look forward to continuing that work.QUESTION: Which counterparts, if I may ask?MS NAUERT: He'll be meeting with the South Koreans and the Japanese.QUESTION: Can I --MS NAUERT: Hi, Barbara.QUESTION: Heather, just to clarify, when you say they're continuing working-level meetings, this is about the denuclearization agenda or is it about the remains?MS NAUERT: I'm not going to get into the specifics, but we are continuing to have meetings. Okay.QUESTION: (Off-mike.)QUESTION: Syria?MS NAUERT: Lesley, go right ahead.QUESTION: A question on - well, can I just follow-up on something on refugees? Yesterday, there was a letter sent to the Secretary --MS NAUERT: Oh, I'm sorry. Let me go back to that for one second, regarding Mark Lambert's meeting. He'll also be meeting with the Chinese Government as well.QUESTION: But not the North Koreans?MS NAUERT: Nope. China, Tokyo, and Beijing. Excuse me.QUESTION: No worries. Yesterday there was --QUESTION: China, Tokyo, and Beijing. Wait. Are all his meetings in Seoul --MS NAUERT: South --QUESTION: -- or is he going to Tokyo, Seoul --MS NAUERT: Seoul. All of his meetings are in Seoul. Pardon me.QUESTION: So he's not going to Beijing, he's not going to - okay.MS NAUERT: He's not going to Beijing. He's going --QUESTION: All right. Thank you.QUESTION: But he's meeting --QUESTION: I just have a follow-up.MS NAUERT: I'm sorry. Let me back up. I'm sorry. I misstated this. Forgive me, please. It's ---QUESTION: (Off-mike.)MS NAUERT: It's been a long few weeks, so bear with me.QUESTION: He also went to Mongolia. (Laughter.)MS NAUERT: Yes, let me clarify. Mark Lambert is going to Seoul, Tokyo, and Beijing, and that is where he will meet with his counterparts.Okay. Lesley, go right ahead. Sorry about that.QUESTION: All right. No worries. I just want to just follow-up quickly something on - there was a letter yesterday to the Secretary from 32 former ambassadors and national security people about the possible closure of PRM, the bureau. Did - can you confirm that he actually got that?MS NAUERT: I cannot confirm that. As you know, the Secretary's on an airplane. That is not a letter that I am familiar with the State Department having received. It doesn't mean that we haven't received it. I'm just not personally familiar with it.As many of you know, OMB had included in a plan earlier this summer a review of our humanitarian assistance structures or systems here at the State Department in its reorganization report that it put forward. I can tell you nothing has been finalized on that. Part of what the Secretary's job and role is to take a look at various programs here at the State Department and make sure they're effective and efficient and the best use of taxpayer dollars and structured in the best way to adhere to our mission. So nothing has been changed. Nothing has changed. We've not made any kind of decisions, but this is something that the Secretary's certainly aware of.QUESTION: Can --QUESTION: Can we move on to Russia, please?QUESTION: Hold on. Just one thing on that. Are you saying that OMB is now going to be in the driver's seat when it comes to refugee policy?MS NAUERT: Of course not, Matt, but that was a plan that they - that is a plan that they put forward, and I think you all are aware of that.QUESTION: Well, yeah. But, I mean, is he seriously going to consider this?MS NAUERT: Matt, I'm not going to get ahead of any of the Secretary's decision making on this issue. It's an important issue that will recover a lot of - will require a lot of careful thought.QUESTION: Well, does the Secretary believe that the functions of PRM should stay at the State Department?MS NAUERT: Matt, that's not a question that I've asked the Secretary. We have a lot of conversations about things, but I've not asked him that question in particular.QUESTION: Quick follow --MS NAUERT: Lesley, did you have something else?QUESTION: I want to go to Iran.MS NAUERT: Okay.QUESTION: So the President today said he's ready to make a real deal on Iran. Given his tweet this week that seemed to stir - to make one wonder whether he's pushing for regime change, this seems to backtrack a little bit as to - that he's ready to make - negotiate a follow-up on the JCPOA.MS NAUERT: Lesley, I'm going to be very cautious about not parsing the President's words. I'd have to refer you to the White House for anything that the President said on that.QUESTION: No, no, no. But this is it - is that - given that the State Department has been in front of the pushing - making sure that countries reimpose these sanctions and stuff, is it your understanding that officials from the State Department are also prepared to engage in a negotiation on a JCPOA?MS NAUERT: I don't have any - engage in negotiations on the JCPOA? We've been talking with our counterparts all around the world about the re-imposition of sanctions and holding the Iranian Government responsible for the horrible acts that his government - its government has been involved with in many parts of the world. And beyond that, I'm just not going to have anything else for you.QUESTION: It's the Secretary, though, who suggested that the United States stands with the Iranian people --MS NAUERT: Yes, we do.QUESTION: -- but their regime is a mafia kleptocracy.MS NAUERT: Yup, mm-hmm.QUESTION: So there are certainly suggestions of support for regime change.MS NAUERT: The Secretary's been very clear about that. He has said the only change we want is a change of behavior. I would say anything beyond that is an interpretation that is coming from whatever individual is saying that.QUESTION: Well, who would the --MS NAUERT: That is not what the Secretary has said.QUESTION: And you don't think that the President's remarks today, that Lesley was just citing, are in any way a conflict with the tone and with the tenor of the Secretary's remarks?MS NAUERT: I don't think so. Okay? Okay.QUESTION: (Off-mike.)QUESTION: And just - on India?MS NAUERT: Go ahead, Said.QUESTION: Yeah. Thank you. I have a very quick question on the Palestinian issue. Last week, Israel passed a controversial nation state bill with no mention of equality to minority rights and so on. I wonder if you are concerned that such a law would make some citizens of Israel less equal than other. Do you have any comment on that?MS NAUERT: We hesitate to respond - or to answer questions about other country's legislation, much like we don't comment on pending legislation. We are certainly aware of that new law. I'd have to refer you to the Government of Israel for the specifics of that law and their position on that. But I can tell as a general matter, and as it pertains to this, that we believe in equality of all persons before the law.QUESTION: Do you feel that such a law could compromise Israeli democracy, that you highlight all the time?MS NAUERT: I'm not going to comment from that. That would be a question for Israelis. Please.QUESTION: Really a couple quick other questions --MS NAUERT: Yes.QUESTION: -- with your indulgence. One, there was a meeting today at the Security Council regarding the situation in Gaza and in the Palestinian territories. And of course, it calls for preventing war, another war in Gaza. It also talks about aid, the humanitarian situation. And could you update us on the status of, let's say, this Gaza aid package that you or that the administration has worked on for the past few months?MS NAUERT: In terms of when we look at --QUESTION: It terms of (inaudible) --MS NAUERT: When we look at the situation in Gaza, we remind folks why the situation there is as terrible as it is, and that's largely because of Hamas. And that's because Hamas continues to foment disagreement and discord among its own people. Hamas doesn't spend the money that it needs to on some of its own programs, such as electricity, food, clean water, all of those things. So this government has been behind trying to find alternatives and to try to create a better life for the people living in Gaza. You've certainly seen Jason Greenblatt and also Jared Kushner talk a lot about that. I believe it's 13 trips or so that they've made over to the region to discuss these issues. I'll see if we have anything new for you on that. I'd be happy to bring it to you when we do.QUESTION: Okay. Just to clarify there was a couple of back-to-back op-ed pieces by Mr. Greenblatt, Kushner, and Ambassador Haley.MS NAUERT: Right.QUESTION: There seems to be a backtracking from this aid to Gaza first as a way to, let's say, put forth the deal of the century. Is that the case now? Are we back to --MS NAUERT: I would have to refer you to them for specifics about their op-eds.QUESTION: On India?MS NAUERT: Hi Laurie.QUESTION: Hi. Human Rights Watch has issued a --QUESTION: Just - can we just go back to this law --MS NAUERT: Matt --QUESTION: -- (inaudible) Israel for a second? I --MS NAUERT: Well, Matt, I will come back to you. Laurie, go right ahead.QUESTION: Human Rights Watch has issued a report about the Iraqi suppression of protests, criticizing the excessive, unnecessary lethal force, particularly from the Badr Organization and the Interior Ministry. What is your comment on that?MS NAUERT: Yeah. So we're certainly aware of that Human Rights report that was issued on July the 24th. It's something that we're watching carefully. Our understanding is that the Iraqi Government is conducting an investigation into this. That is something that we would certainly support, that the U.S. Government does. But I'd also like to say we support the right of the Iraqi people to peacefully protest, as we do all around the world. The Iraqi Government has said that it will take measures to try to safeguard both the right and security of both public and private property. And I would just like to say I'd like to express our - the loss of life. There's certainly been a loss of life in this and injuries as well.QUESTION: Would you be willing to say that some elements of the Iraqi Security Forces, like the Badr Organization are more thuggish than other parts?MS NAUERT: Laurie, I'm not going to characterize that. (Laughter.) I think that's - that would be an unfortunate trap.QUESTION: Okay, and may I ask you about the Lavrov - the discussion between Foreign Minister Lavrov and Secretary Pompeo. Your readout said they discussed ideas on implementing counterterrorism process coordination. What might those ideas be?MS NAUERT: Well, I'm not going to be able to get into the specifics of that, because some of that is private diplomatic conversation. But our government has spoken numerous times about how there are ways that we could work together with other governments on issues of counterterrorism. Terrorism is not something, obviously, unique to the United States. It's also something that other countries have experienced as well. And if we could find some small places in which we could work together with the Russian Government on certain elements, on certain things, that would certainly be a good thing. And that's part of what the President has talked about.QUESTION: And did the arrest of Maria Butina come up?MS NAUERT: That is something that I would not get into. That would be a Department of Justice issue. And let me make something clear, that the State Department - unlike other governments around the world, the State Department would not be involved in any kind of law enforcement situation like that. That would all be under the Department of Justice. And so the Secretary would not have anything to say on that. Okay?QUESTION: India?MS NAUERT: Nazira, go right ahead.QUESTION: Thank you, Heather. Two question. One question regarding General Abdul Rashid Dostum returning back to Afghanistan, how much he is useful or maybe not, or yes. What's your comment? Election is close.The other question is Abu Dhabi meeting for country Emirate, Afghanistan, United States, Saudi. Do you know the result, how much is going to be (inaudible)?MS NAUERT: So first thing, I can tell you that our senior bureau official for SCA, Alice Wells, is returning today from Doha, Qatar, and that's where she's been meeting with the - she met with the deputy prime minister. She also met with other government officials to talk about their contributions to the situation in Afghanistan. Qatar has been an important and valuable partner in that. They have helped with training and equipping, they have helped with supplies, things of that nature that are obviously needed by coalition partners to help facilitate what is going on right there. So Alice is returning. She's had good meetings. And part of the reason she went there was to commend the government for their ongoing support for peace in Afghanistan.To your second question with reports about General Dostum returning to Afghanistan, we would see that largely as an internal matter for the Government of Afghanistan to handle. We're certainly aware of the reports. But while we are on the subject, I just want to say how gravely sorry the United States Government is for the loss of life that took place in the terror attack on - I believe it was on Sunday that killed about 14 people, I believe it was.QUESTION: Yes.MS NAUERT: We want to send our deepest condolences to the government. And Nazira, since it's been a while since I've seen you, we had a good, productive trip to Afghanistan, and it was really incredible to meet with President Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah and have conversations with their cabinet officials about the President's overall strategy in Afghanistan and what the United States Government sees as hope - possible hope for Afghanistan. I know some folks in the media and around the world have pooh-poohed that ceasefire that lasted a few days, but our view on this, if you can get a ceasefire that lasts a few days, perhaps you could get another one that lasts a little bit longer, and that gives the people of Afghanistan hope. So I hope it gives you some hope as well, and good to see you. Welcome back.QUESTION: Thank you very much.QUESTION: (Off-mike.)MS NAUERT: Yeah. Hey, Nick. I'm going to try to get around to as many people as possible (inaudible). Hi, Nick.QUESTION: On China. U.S. airlines are saying they are going to comply with this Chinese request to change how they refer to Taiwan. Some of them are saying that --MS NAUERT: They have said that they would? I haven't seen that development.QUESTION: And they're sort of laying the blame with the State Department, saying that this was the result of failed negotiations between State and the Chinese Government to come up with a solution. State Department had said earlier that it opposed this Chinese demand. Do you have any update?MS NAUERT: Oh, we would oppose a government's demand on private corporations that private corporations label something the way that the government demands it to do that. I was not aware that the companies said that they would fold to the Chinese Government, so I would just refer you back to those American companies.Hey, Kylie.QUESTION: Can we just, for a second, go back to North Korea? The Secretary today said that he wanted inspectors on the ground at the Sohe missile testing site location with - that they're going to be destroying. Was that the initial agreement that Trump and Chairman Kim made when they established this plan in Singapore, or is this a new ask that the U.S. is coming at with --MS NAUERT: Well, I think the dismantling of that would be in line with Chairman Kim's commitments to the United States, and I'll just leave it at that.QUESTION: Okay. And so if they dismantle this testing site and there aren't any U.S. inspectors on the ground, is that a signal of success? Is that a positive thing?MS NAUERT: Yeah, I'm just not going to get into the specifics of that. Verification is obviously something that is paramount. Verification from legitimate groups and done by legitimate countries is something that - is something that the United States Government will be looking for.QUESTION: But that's only --QUESTION: Just to clarify on this --MS NAUERT: Okay. Hi.QUESTION: -- did North Korea notify to the U.S. Government that they were beginning dismantling this site or do you just --MS NAUERT: I don't have anything for you on that.QUESTION: -- are aware of it by reports or --MS NAUERT: I just don't have anything for you on that. Okay?QUESTION: (Off-mike.)MS NAUERT: Uh-huh. Yeah.QUESTION: Can we go - can we go to Russia?MS NAUERT: Kylie, go right ahead.QUESTION: U.S.-Burma?QUESTION: So still on North Korea, there have been reports that some of the remains will be repatriated this week. Is that true?MS NAUERT: I'm not going to get ahead of anything that may or may not happen. As you all know, we had some good conversations and feel like we made some degree of progress when the last meeting was held on the 16th, and our working group conversations continue. And I'll let you know when we have any changes. Okay?QUESTION: What about --QUESTION: India.MS NAUERT: Okay.QUESTION: India.MS NAUERT: Hi. How are you?QUESTION: A Kremlin aide has said that President Putin has not accepted President Trump's invitation to come to Washington, and saying that with all the backlash and the negative reaction, it might be better to let the dust settle. Do you have any comment on that? Is that - is the State Department already involved in --MS NAUERT: That would - I mean, that would be something that would come out of the White House, so it's - you'd have to direct that question to the White House about whether or not it was a formal invitation. I don't believe it's been a formal invitation, but really, I'm speaking - that's out of my lane, and so I'd just refer you back to the White House. My understanding is that nothing has been set up at this point. Okay? Okay.QUESTION: Can we stay on Russia?QUESTION: U.S. border.QUESTION: I've been asking - we're back on Russia.MS NAUERT: Michelle, this is not just about you. There are other people, as you see. I've been trying to get around to various people in the room. I will come to you now, but as you can see, I'm not --QUESTION: Well, I only asked because it was Russia.MS NAUERT: Yes, that's fine. Go right ahead.QUESTION: I wasn't asking for personal reasons.MS NAUERT: Sure.QUESTION: So now that you've had several days since the summit in Helsinki, and I'm assuming that you and your team have been able to speak to the Secretary - when he was asked about it today, he said only that he had conversations with Trump and Lavrov and that - and he called it an incredibly important meeting. Do you know that he feels like he's fully aware of everything that happened between Trump and Putin --MS NAUERT: I can tell you the Secretary and the President have an excellent relationship. They talk frequently, as does the President with other members of his foreign policy team. The Secretary and the President spent time together shortly after that meeting, and they've been in touch every day, if not several times a day, since then.QUESTION: But does that mean that he feels like he fully knows what went on in the meeting?MS NAUERT: I think the Secretary does. He and the President are closely connected.QUESTION: U.S. border.QUESTION: Okay. And on --MS NAUERT: Last question, Michelle.QUESTION: Okay. Well, let me try to narrow them down.MS NAUERT: Okay. Well, I have other people to go to, so I'll come - go right ahead. Go right --QUESTION: Before the summit --MS NAUERT: Yes.QUESTION: -- he said that he was confident that President Trump would say in no uncertain terms to Putin that interfering in the U.S. elections was absolutely unacceptable. Does he know that that indeed happened during the summit?MS NAUERT: The President spoke about that himself. I'll refer you to the White House or back to the - hold on - back to the transcript where the President said that he brought up the issue of meddling in the election. The Secretary has also spoken to this --QUESTION: But bringing it up isn't making it clear.MS NAUERT: -- many times that that kind of activity would not be acceptable. I can't say it to you more than I already have that the Secretary has addressed this issue, the President has addressed this issue. 2016, unacceptable. If they attempt to do that again in the future, that is also unacceptable in the eyes of the United States Government. And I think that's exactly why the White House has assigned duties to the Department of Homeland Security, to the Department of Justice, and other U.S. Government agencies and departments to not only be on the lookout, but is also giving them tools and resources that they need to try to combat against any of this.QUESTION: So what did the Secretary think of that press conference in Helsinki?MS NAUERT: I have not asked him that question, Michelle.QUESTION: Turkey.QUESTION: U.S. --MS NAUERT: Okay, go right ahead.QUESTION: This question is about the U.S. border, where in the prison there are hundreds of Indians now, confirmed reports, mostly from Punjab, and they are coming through the human smuggling rings. So have you reached out to the Government of India to stop these rackets originating from Punjab? And the second - and what is going to be the future for these young men? And the third one is about all this talk about religious freedom here going on. These people have been asked to - their turbans have been taken away, and - which is a religious symbol for them, Sikh.MS NAUERT: I understand.QUESTION: And so what is the take on these points from --MS NAUERT: I don't have all the specifics on the case that you are describing to me, so my apologies for that. I could certainly link you up with some of our folks who are covering that and following that more closely.But what I can say as a general matter is that we support religious freedom. That's precisely why we are hosting this ministerial here this week with people from around the world from various faiths, and frankly, we've invited people who don't have faith as well, because we want to talk about the importance of religious tolerance and religious freedom, thinking that - believing that that not only makes for better societies, stronger countries, it helps with investment and bring investment into various countries, because you know that governments and people are more stable. But I'd be happy to link you up with some of our folks to discuss --QUESTION: About the - with the - have you reached out to the Government of India on these rackets that - starting from - and it has been going on?MS NAUERT: Well, I'll certainly look into that for you, okay? I just don't have any information on that. Okay? Okay.QUESTION: (Off-mike.)QUESTION: One more on India.QUESTION: One more?MS NAUERT: Last question. Last question, Matt.QUESTION: Can I go back to this Israel law, and then - well, you said that you believe in the equality of all people under the law, but yet you don't have any comment on this new law in Israel. So I'm just wondering, does that mean that you do not think that this new law affects the equality of all people under the law?MS NAUERT: Matt, you know very well that we don't comment on other countries' legislation or even pending legislation, okay?QUESTION: That's just not true, Heather. I can think of - I wrote them down as you said this. I can think of laws in Hungary, in Poland, in Turkey - and that's just off the top of my head - that you guys have opined on regularly. It's not true that you don't comment on other countries' laws. When other countries' laws you find problematic or concerning or offensive or whatever, you regularly speak out on them. So I'm just going to assume, I guess, that you don't have a problem with this law in Israel because --MS NAUERT: Matt, no, don't ever assume. Don't ever assume anything. When we talk about equality and how equality is something that America stands for, I would stand firmly behind that comment. So don't assume anything, okay? Don't assume anything, okay?QUESTION: I'm not assuming anything about the U.S. I'm trying to figure out what you think, if anything, about the law in Israel.MS NAUERT: Final - final question. Janne, go right ahead.QUESTION: I'd also like to know if you have any comment about the appointment, the promotion, the nomination of four senior State Department officials to be career ambassadors by the President. This building didn't say anything about that when it came out last week. Is this a good thing?MS NAUERT: We did see that nomination come out, and that is something that we were very pleased with, four career ambassadors. As you all will recall, it was less than a year ago when many of you were making snarky comments about the reduced number of career ambassadors, so we're pleased that the White House put forward the announcement of four career ambassadors. I hope that won't be lost in your reporting. I hope that also goes to show the Secretary's - how important he finds our career folks here at the State Department and how much he respects what they have to do. So we hope to --QUESTION: (Off-mike.)MS NAUERT: Hope we have a speedy process in Congress and through the Senate.Okay, final question.QUESTION: So the U.S. Senate - six senators, bipartisan senators - have proposed a bill to restrict international loans for Turkey. Would you support those sanctions? They say they are there because - they proposed the legislation because of the detainment of Pastor Andrew Brunson.MS NAUERT: Yeah. And so --QUESTION: Would you support such measures?MS NAUERT: -- if that's a sanction matter, that's something we just would not preview. But I mean, I can certainly tell you that the case of Pastor Brunson is one that we have all followed very closely, very carefully, not just here at the State Department. The Vice President has. The President has as well. And we would like to see Pastor Brunson brought home soon.Okay, and that's all.QUESTION: Just one more question?MS NAUERT: I don't have anything for you on sanctions.QUESTION: One more?MS NAUERT: Thank you, everybody. Good to see you.(The briefing was concluded at 3:43 p.m.)DPB # 36Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6384773 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: July 26, 2018End of Document

HEAR THEM ROAR CHINESE SINGER WANG JUNKAI LENDS HIS VOICE TO SIBERIAN TIGERSStates News ServiceJuly 27, 2018 FridayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 594 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: BRUSSELS, Belgium BodyThe following information was released by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP):Did you know that a small number of Siberian tigers still roam the wilds of Jilin Province in northeastern China? The province borders North Korea and Russia and the area is the northernmost habitat of this species of tiger, also known as the Amur tiger. Tigers are the largest of the world's big cats. This magnificent creature features distinctive orange and black stripes and a beautifully marked face.About 540 Siberian tigers are estimated to exist in the wild in a huge area straddling Russia, China and possibly North Korea, having made a comeback from the brink of extinction in the 1940s, when only about 40 Amurs were left, according to the World Wildlife Fund.Wang Junkai, Chinese teen singer and celebrity, is a UN Environment National Goodwill Ambassador and an outspoken defender of endangered wildlife. He chose to impersonate the tiger for UN Environment's Wild for Life campaign, and has been working for the past months with the Chinese government to protect the country's few wild specimens and raise awareness about their plight. On the occasion of International Tiger Day, which celebrates the great cat and calls for its protection, Junkai will visit rangers in Jilin Province to find out about their work and offer them financial assistance."We youth have the responsibility to protect our environment and secure our future," said Junkai at his nomination ceremony in April 2018. "Youth are no longer merely onlookers when it comes to environmental action, nor should they be." Junkai's involvement is good news for tigers his past pro-environment social media campaigns have been hugely successful, thanks to his immense popularity and influence among Chinese youth.A motion-sensing camera captures a rare sight: one of the 27 Siberian tigers known to range into northeastern China. Photo by Beijing Normal University.New park, new lifeBy the end of 2020, China announced plans to open the Northeast Tiger and Leopard National Park to help preserve the ecosystem in which small numbers of Amur tigers and leopards live. Officials hope it will bolster populations of the endangered big cats.Since the beginning of the 20th century, over 95 per cent of the world's wild tigers have disappeared, and only around 3,900 still roam wild. Junkai plans to raise further funds for tiger protection through his foundation, Kindle Blue Fund, and by selling 3,900 T-shirts, co-designed with UN Environment.Tigers are found in the wild in Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Russia, and Thailand. Around half of all wild tigers are found in India, which has recently achieved some successes in tiger conservation. A recent survey in Bhutan, which has 72 per cent forest cover, found 103 wild tigers.During the 20th century, tigers became extinct in Western and Central Asia, and were restricted to isolated pockets in the remaining parts of their range. They disappeared from the island of Bali in the 1940s, around the Caspian Sea in the 1970s, and from Java in the 1980s as a result of habitat loss and the killing of tigers and tiger prey. The estimated area known to be occupied by tigers declined by 41 per cent from 1997 to 2007.The South China tiger, believed to be the most ancient of the tiger subspecies, is extinct in the wild. The last confirmed sighting was in the 1970s. As of 2007, the captive population consisted of 73 individuals.Join the Wild for Life campaign to protect iconic species and their habitats.Load-Date: July 27, 2018End of Document

Trump applies new tariff hit to China for 200,000 million dollars; threatens moreCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 17, 2018 MondayCopyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 484 wordsBody        MEXICO CITY - The United States will impose tariffs on China's imports worth 200 billion dollars as of September 24, the administration of President Donald Trump reported Monday.  The announcement increases commercial tensions between the two largest economies in the world.  Tariffs imposed by Washington to Beijing will start at a 10% rate and by the end of the year they will rise to 25%, according to Reuters and Bloomberg.  The tariffs will affect thousands of products, from suitcases to seafood, for the first time extending the impact of Trump's aggressive tariff policy to a broad population of American consumers, according to Bloomberg.  The Trump administration said in a statement that if China retaliates after the announcement, it will immediately seek new tariffs against more products worth 267,000 million dollars.  Earlier, the Republican president told the press at the White House that there would be "some very positive news" and added that there will be "a large amount of money that will go into the US treasury."  Once the new measures take effect, the Trump government will have imposed tariffs on almost half of Chinese products imported into the United States.  The Chinese government had already warned that it would impose reprisals if Trump specified this plan.  "If the United States adopts new measures on customs duties, China (...) will take retaliatory measures to defend its legitimate rights and interests," said Geng Shuang, spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  Last week Beijing said it welcomed the opening of the US authorities and their willingness to restart the dialogue, but according to the press, China would cancel any kind of dialogue if the new tariffs go into effect.  The office of the US Trade Representative had proposed tariffs of 10% to 25% on more than 6,000 Chinese goods, within which a wide range of electronic products is located, including internet routers, Wi-Fi connection devices and others.  In a couple of tweets, Trump defended his combative trade policy on Monday and said the steel industry, which began to be protected by the White House, is now a topic that everyone talks about.  "The tariffs placed the United States in a very strong negotiating position, with billions of dollars and work flowing to our country, and even then, the cost increase has been almost imperceptible," he said.  The president threatened to apply punitive tariffs against any country that does not play fair in the trade with the United States: "If the countries do not make fair deals with us, they will be 'Tariffs'".  Washington demands that Beijing accept to reduce the United States trade deficit of about 200,000 million dollars by opening its market more to US products.  The US central bank said last week that the trade war launched by Trump puts pressure on US companies and delays or curtails their investment plans. Load-Date: September 17, 2018End of Document

In a statement, he said he would encourage companies to increase imports of products such as soybeans and vehicles from other markets.  In one particular link, Prime Minister Li Keqiang encouraged German companies to invest more in China and promised them that their intellectual property rights would not be jeopardized if they were installed in that Asian nation.  At a press conference, along with Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin after bilateral talks, Li said China would further open its bond and insurance markets, adding that it expected German companies to produce more in Chinese territory.  &"We are interested in free trade without friction,&" Merkel said in turn, before emphasizing that both Germany and China are committed to the &"multilateral order&".  The European press stressed that China is willing to discuss with the German side to jointly explore third markets, and Germany is interested in fully exploiting its advantages to work with China in Industry 4.0. The two governments agreed that they should build a cooperation platform for companies from both countries and create a more favorable business environment.  China invited Germany to participate in the International Exposition of Imports of China in Shanghai, from November 5 to 10, which is part of its &"Strip and Route&" strategy. He also encouraged German companies to invest and establish factories in the central and western regions of China.  The two sides said they should strengthen cooperation in emerging industries such as digitization, autonomous driving, artificial intelligence and the new energy vehicle. They agreed to strengthen cooperation in scientific and technological innovation, as well as cooperation in agriculture.  Germany and China enjoy close and broad cooperation, Merkel said, noting that more than 70 dialogue mechanisms between two countries fully show the depth and breadth of the bilateral relationship.  Under the current international situation, he added, Germany is ready to work with China to strengthen openness and cooperation and send the world a strong signal that both sides will continuously safeguard multilateralism and facilitate international cooperation.  Germany opposes trade wars and advocates free trade based on rules, Merkel said.  The two countries signed agreements worth 23.6 billion dollars and Li said the projects showed how cooperation can benefit different countries.  In addition to the multiple projects between government agencies, companies like BASF,BMW, Volkswagen, Daimler, Siemens and Bosch announced agreements and partnerships.  rmorales@eleconomista.com.mx  Load-Date: July 10, 2018End of Document

Google is developing services for Chinese citizens, including a search engine that could adhere to China's strict censors, The Wall Street Journal and others reported last week. At the meeting, Google co-founder and Alphabet president Sergey Brin sounded optimistic about doing more business in China, cautioning that progress in the country is "slow-going and complicated." Mr. Brin was instrumental in Google's decision in 2010 to withdraw its search engine from China to protest the government's censorship regime and attempts to hack into the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists. At the time, he described the government as having the "earmarks of totalitarianism" of the Soviet Union, where he was born. On Thursday, Mr. Brin reportedly said the company has launched a number of products in China over the past eight years, such as a file-management app and a search engine for academic research. He said the decision-making around such projects requires "a certain set of trade-offs."        Load-Date: August 17, 2018End of Document

New Studies Show Progress Against Ivory Trade, Thanks to China BanTargeted News ServiceSeptember 27, 2018 Thursday 7:42 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 884 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: BEIJING, China BodyWorld Wildlife Fund issued the following news release:New statistics released today by World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and TRAFFIC revealed that China's ivory trade ban has had positive effects since coming into force at the beginning of 2018, but further action is needed to influence key segments of society.Among 2,000 Chinese consumers surveyed, those who reported past purchase of and future intention to buy ivory products have dropped substantially since the ivory trade ban was implemented. All pre-ban legal ivory shops visited by TRAFFIC in 2018 have stopped ivory sales, and the magnitude of illegal ivory trade in most of the cities and online platforms surveyed has decreased. However, ivory trafficking hotspots remain, including along the border with neighboring Vietnam.Another point of concern is the low level of awareness of respondents when asked about the ivory ban. While spontaneous (unprompted) awareness of the ban has doubled since the law changed - from 4 percent to 8 percent of those surveyed -- further amplification of messaging is needed to increase public awareness. General support for the ivory ban remains high, with 9 out of 10 respondents expressing their agreement and support of the ban once made aware of it.Two reports, China's Ivory Market after the Ivory Trade Ban in 2018 from TRAFFIC and Demand under the Ban - China Ivory Consumption Research Post-Ban 2018 conducted by independent consultancy GlobeScan and commissioned by TRAFFIC and WWF, provide the first analysis of trends in supply and demand for ivory products in China's markets since the new legislative changes. The results were generally positive. The reports were released shortly before world leaders gather at the London Conference on Illegal Wildlife Trade to continue to mobilize global efforts to address the poaching crisis devastating elephant, rhino and other endangered species populations.In 2018, TRAFFIC visited 157 markets in 23 cities and found 2,812 ivory products in 345 stores. Compared to a similar 2017 report, the number of stores with ivory for sale decreased by 30 percent, though remains high given that trade is now banned. More than half the ivory products found for sale were concentrated in five provincial cities: Chengdu, Chongqing, Hangzhou, Dongxing and Pingxiang.Online illegal ivory trade appears to also be declining. The average number of new ivory advertisements decreased by 26.6 percent on websites and 10.6 percent on social media platforms, from pre- to post-ban.According to China Ivory Consumption Research Post-Ban 2018, 14 percent of respondents claim to have purchased ivory in the past 12 months. This is a significant drop from the 31 percent of respondents who reported doing so in a similar 2017 pre-ban survey."We are encouraged by the decline in both trade and consumer demand since the ban went into effect, but there's still work needed to address the persistent demand and lack of awareness among consumers in some parts of the country," said Jan Vertefeuille, who oversees WWF's ivory work. "And particularly concerning is the finding that people who regularly travel outside mainland China have actually shown an increase in intent to buy ivory this year. As a result, WWF is scaling up our work with consumers and with the travel industry to address this demand."The study found that 18 percent of regular outbound travelers bought ivory products on trips abroad, with Thailand and Hong Kong being the top two markets. Making Chinese travelers aware of the ban and alternative souvenirs to ivory is critical to ensure positive demand reduction results continue and carry over into long-term benefits for wild elephant populations.WWF today launched a Travel Ivory Free campaign to reach Chinese travelers to Thailand during Golden Week, an annual period of holidays from October 1-8. The campaign will engage travelers in Thailand through geolocated digital messages about the ban, alternative souvenir options and elephant conservation while they are visiting known ivory markets. Working with key opinion leaders and the travel industry, the campaign will help NGOs determine what messages resonate most with this persistent consumer segment."Closure of the legal ivory market is a critical tool for Chinese government efforts and sets a benchmark for other countries and regions where domestic ivory markets remain active. Only a united global effort will achieve the goal of stamping out ivory trafficking for the benefit of elephant conservation," said Xu Ling, overall coordinator of these research efforts in China.Faced with the worst elephant poaching crisis in three decades, countries and territories with major ivory markets such as China, Hong Kong SAR, and the US have introduced plans that are being implemented at different stages to phase out domestic ivory trade; while other countries like the UK are proposing stricter measures to curtail domestic illegal ivory trade. However, implementation and enforcement of existing regulations remains key to this global effort, combined with shifting consumer behavior and social norms that encourage ivory consumption as a luxury item which conveys wealth and status.Contact: Elizabeth Davis, 202/495-4415, elizabeth.davis@wwfus.orgCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6461027 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: September 28, 2018End of Document

In 2017, the global demand for optical fiber preform rose 11.1% year on year and reached 15.3kt, and is expected to hit 31.5kt in 2023 with the CAGR of 12.2% between 2018 and 2023 because of the growing demand for broadband like FTTx (Fiber To The X). China is the largest consumer of optical fiber preform around the globe, as a percentage of 60.5% in global demand and the expected 61.6% in 2023.Read the full report:https://www.reportlinker.com/p04037727China, the world's largest producer of optical fiber preform as well, produced 7.55 kt in 2017, leaving a supply-demand gap of 1.75kt or so and still being in short supply. The short supply will continue as the demand for optical fiber and cable is growing. It is estimated after 2022, optical fiber preform in China will be self-sufficient, and the output and demand will amount to 20.2kt and 19.4kt in 2023, respectively.Due to technical constraints, global optical fiber perform market is characterized by high concentration, only about 20 players distribute in Japan, USA and China, including Corning, Sumitomo Electric Industries, Shin-Etsu Chemical, Yangtze Optical Fiber and Cable (YOFC), and Hengtong Optic-electric, etc. Among them, YOFC topped with share of 14.7% in terms of capacity in 2017, followed by Corning with 14.4%.Allured by high prosperity of optical communication industry, there has been a remarkable increase of optical fiber preform industrialization projects across China over the recent two years. Apart from such giants' capacity expansion as YOFC, Hengtong Optic-electric and Futong Group, the key optical fiber and cable companies like Tongding Interconnection Information, Zhongli Sci-Tech, Tianjin Xinmao Science & Technology, and Hangzhou Cable also foray into optical fiber preform field. As estimated, the production capacity of optical fiber preform in China will be at least 25kt till 2023, showing a clear sign of overcapacity.On July 10, 2018, Chinese government announced to continue imposing anti-dumping duties on optical fiber preform originated from Japan and the United States with 5-year implementation period. This move not only protects Chinese optical fiber preform companies but encourages local peers to make more investments into R&D and rev up production of optical fiber preform, practically conducing to independent innovation of optical fiber and cable industry and making for the development of optical communication in China. Additionally, the price of optical fiber preform is driven upwards and is expected to stand at RMB1,225/kg in 2018.Global and China Optical Fiber Preform Industry Report, 2018-2023 highlights the following:Global optical fiber preform market (supply & demand, regional distribution, price, competitive landscape and development trend);Chinese optical fiber preform market (Policy climate, supply & demand, import & export, price, competition pattern and development trend);Development of global and China optical fiber & cable market;13 global and Chinese optical fiber preform companies (operation, optical fiber preform business, etc.).Read the full report:           https://www.reportlinker.com/p04037727AboutReportlinkerReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution.

11 UYGHURS ASK MALAYSIA'S ATTORNEY GENERAL TO DROP ILLEGAL-ENTRY CHARGESStates News ServiceJuly 25, 2018 WednesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 564 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Eleven Uyghur Muslims who are charged with illegally entering Malaysia and could be deported to China have asked the attorney general to drop the charges as they prepare for trial in September.During a court hearing in Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday, magistrate Wong Chai Sia set Aug. 8 to hear the results of the application to have charges dropped and calendared a trial for Sept. 12.The ethnic Uyghurs' attorney, Khairul Anwar Ismail, said he expected the trial to proceed if the attorney general rejected their application.The Uyghurs, who risk religious persecution if they are sent to China, have been detained at the Sungai Buloh Prison outside Kuala Lumpur since February or earlier.The men were part of a group of 20 who escaped a Thai immigration detention center in November 2017 by digging holes in a wall and using blankets as ladders before crossing the border to Malaysia."The Uyghurs said they're Turkish and not Chinese as claimed by the Chinese government," Khairul told BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service. "Nobody can prove they are from China."Apart from the Chinese government's request for them to be deported, I heard the Thai authorities are also considering having them back," he said.Khairul said the Malaysian government should consider their application on humanitarian grounds."Malaysia is not their final destination, the Uyghur men who have no passports want to go to Turkey. They're also not a security threat to Malaysia," he said.The 11 were among more than 200 Uyghurs detained in March 2014 after being found at a popular tourist spot in Thailand's southern Songkhla province. It was not clear how they had arrived there.Human rights groups speak outAn Amnesty International official said the Chinese government has been asking governments to deport Uyghur, including students, back to China."It has created a sense of horror among the overseas Uyghur community," Frankie Poon, a researcher on China at Amnesty International's East Asia Regional Office in Hong Kong, told BenarNews."The international community, including Malaysia, needs to work on stopping China from doing this unless they can provide strong reasons for doing so," he said. "We haven't seen any good reason so far."Poon said the Uyghurs face the potential risk of arbitrary detention in facilities known as "re-education centers," where some reports said hundreds of thousands of Uyghur and other Muslim minorities are detained." The Malaysian government should seriously observe the non-refoulement principle not to return anybody to a country like China where there are serious human rights concerns and a high risk of people being subjected to torture and other ill-treatment," Poon said.Latheefa Koya, executive director of Malaysian human rights NGO Lawyers for Liberty, said Malaysia is bound by international law."Their claim for asylum must be processed and if it's clear they're asylum seekers, they should be released and given protection, not jailed or charged for illegal entry," she told BenarNews.In February, Malaysia received an official request from the Chinese government to extradite the 11 men to China. Then-Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said that the Malaysian government would seek to resolve the issue diplomatically.Reported by BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service.Load-Date: July 26, 2018End of Document

US Using False Accusations On Trade To "Intimidate" Countries: ChinaStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeSeptember 24, 2018 MondayUniversity WireCopyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: WORLD-NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 422 wordsByline: Steven ClarkeBodyThere is a strong possibility that US President Donald Trump will impose tariffs on all goods coming into America from China, says investment bank Goldman Sachs.But the blast fromBeijing came as US political news website Axios reported that the White House was preparing to go further, and would launch an "administration wide" broadside against China spearheaded by US National Security Council officials.America has defended its policy, saying it is responding to Chinese state backing if its industries, which goes against global trade rules.China accused the United States on Monday of using false accusations on trade to "intimidate" other countries, as the tariff battle between the global giants intensifies."We are going to win it", Trump's Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said of the trade war on "Fox News Sunday".The latest batch of Chinese imports will face 10 percent tariffs through the end of the year, and then the rate will jump to 25 percent.Beijing has promised to strike back on Monday with duties on US$60 billion in American goods, bringing the total to US$110 billion, almost everything China buys from the United States.The ministry's list includes big-ticket items like liquefied natural gas, lumber and electronics as well as everything from peppermint oil to pig hides to cocoa butter to condoms.Google Home Mini Outsells Amazon Echo DotThe Echo Show will also be coming to India next year, but pricing for the Input and the Show have not been announced yet. It means if you're packing this up to take it somewhere with you, you've got another cord to worry about.Economists warn that a protracted dispute will eventually stunt growth not just in the US and China but across the broader global economy.Beijing subsequently followed suit by announcing tariffs on $60 billion ($A82 billion) worth of American goods.The Chinese government has not made any announcement yet.China outlined a matching bump in tariff rates for its targeted $60 billion of United States goods, but it is running out of options to even the score on Trump's threatened third wave of tariffs.Dialogue between the world's two biggest economies appears severed.However, following complaints from thousands of USA firms - including powerhouses like Apple and Walmart - 300 product lines were dropped from the target list.China summoned the U.S. ambassador inBeijing and postponed military talks in protest against a USA decision to sanction a Chinese military agency and its director for buying Russian fighter jets and a missile system.Load-Date: September 24, 2018End of Document

It is impossible to see how such a move is compatible with Google's 'Do the right thing' motto, and we are calling on the company to change course."For the world's biggest search engine to adopt such extreme measures would be a gross attack on freedom of information and internet freedom. In putting profits before human rights, Google would be setting a chilling precedent and handing the Chinese government a victory."This also raises serious questions as to what safeguards Google is putting in place to protect users' privacy.

Managing this huge volume of people requires sophisticated information technology (IT) systems to facilitate the work of border and migration agencies.Like other countries across the globe, China is successfully implementing IT-based border management tools to manage growing numbers of travellers in order to reduce the time spent clearing immigration, improve security, and facilitate seamless cross-border travel.IOM, the UN Migration Agency, is today organizing a two-day seminar in Shanghai on IT systems for border management, bringing together officials from the central and provincial levels of China's National Immigration Administration, and experts from European Union (EU) Member States and IOM to showcase various systems and identify best practices.The Chinese government at national and regional levels is already running pilot programmes for IT systems in border management. These include fingerprint scanning of all foreign travellers in Guangdong province, which was introduced in February 2017, and the use of e-gates for Chinese citizens and permanent residence card holders.IOM border management specialist Dr. Erik Slavenas told seminar participants that international cooperation will play a key role in the adoption of the new technologies. "To achieve the full potential of the use of automated border controls, we need to intensify the role of UN agencies in international cooperation and information sharing," he said.The seminar, which included a field visit to Shanghai's Pudong airport, is part of a series of technical exchanges under the framework of the EU-China Dialogue on Migration and Mobility Support project, funded by the European Union Partnership Instrument.For further information please contact Etienne Micallef at IOM China. , Tel:+86105 979 9695.

In the two past decades, the market has been growing at a fast pace. The dramatic expansions of the manufacturing capabilities and rising consumer consumptions in China have transformed China's society and economy.China is one of the world's major producers for industrial and consumer products. Far outpacing other economies in the world, China is the world's fastest growing market for the consumptions of goods and services.The Chinese economy maintains a high speed growth which has been stimulated by the consecutive increases of industrial output, imports & exports, consumer consumption and capital investment for over two decades.Rapid consolidation between medium and large players is anticipated since the Chinese government has been encouraging industry consolidation with an effort to regulate the industry and to improve competitiveness in the world market.Although China has enjoyed the benefits of an expanding market for production and distribution, the industry is suffering from minimal innovation and investment in R&D and new product development. The sector's economies of scale have yet to be achieved. Most domestic manufacturers lack the autonomic intellectual property and financial resources to develop their own brand name products.Key Topics CoveredI.

The company declined to comment further.Waymo is entering a market where major Chinese tech companies are already working on their own self-driving car programs. They include internet search giant Baidu, ride-hailing startup Didi Chuxing, e-commerce leader Alibaba and social media and gaming company Tencent.The Chinese government has sought to encourage the development of autonomous cars in the country, issuing guidelines for road tests in April.Operating in China is likely to present particular challenges for Waymo. The company has always built its own maps for its self-driving cars, but that would be difficult in China, where mapping cities remains a sensitive issue. Google Maps works on desktops in China, but the mobile app version is unavailable in the country.Waymo's move into China comes amid several steps by Google to expand its presence in the world's second largest economy.Google has had a limited presence in China since it pulled many of its services in 2010 after refusing to censor its search results.

Mobvoi's sales team targets users outside of mainland China by buying Google ads. "It's not just software, it's an ecosystem," Zhifei Li, Mobvoi's chief executive, reportedly said of Google-also a minority investor in his startup. Mr. Li is one of many allies Google has courted in recent years as it tries to keep a foothold in China, a market from which the Alphabet Inc. GOOGL -0.95% unit retreated eight years ago in protest over government hacking and censorship. While its core services like search, Gmail and YouTube remain blocked for most Chinese citizens, the company provides tools and support to a growing number of app developers, manufacturers and advertisers in the region, who rely on Google to reach global customers. Now those allies will likely be crucial as Google embarks on a broader China expansion strategy. As part of a project dubbed "Dragonfly," Google is testing a mobile version of its search engine that would adhere to China's strict censors, people familiar with the matter said. To convince the Chinese government to allow such a move, Google can point to its local partners as examples of how the company contributes to economic growth. That is in contrast to rival Facebook Inc., which also covets the China market but has had less success establishing a beachhead.        Load-Date: August 12, 2018End of Document

The Auto Finance Industry in China 2018-2022: A ?1,500 Billion Opportunity by 2022PR NewswireJuly 31, 2018 Tuesday 7:45 AM ESTCopyright 2018 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1077 wordsDateline: DUBLIN, July 31, 2018 BodyThe"Research Report on China's Auto Finance Industry - 2018-2022"report has been added toResearchAndMarkets.com'soffering.Since China joined the WTO, the auto production, sales and reserves have been growing with China's economic development. At the end of 2017, China's auto reserves were about 156 per thousand people, far less than that in developed countries. Therefore, there is a huge growth potential.The auto consumer finance industry has begun to develop in China with the increase of residents' income and the policy support of the government. In mature markets, auto finance accounts for 20%-25% profits of the auto value chain while in China the proportion is less than 10%. The market size of China's auto finance industry reached about CNY 900 billion in 2017. Despite the small market size and low profitability, there is a lot of room for growth in the future.Market players include commercial banks, auto finance companies, financial leasing companies and Internet platforms. The traditional dominators are banks that have traditional capital advantage and auto manufacturers' auto finance companies that have financing advantage and auto resources. E-commerce platforms have become the new cradles of auto finance with active financing on the primary market. Both traditional market players and independent Internet auto finance companies can reduce the costs of customer attraction by advantage of Internet platforms' visitor volume, and increase operation efficiency by big-data-based analysis on consumer credit and enterprise operation. Because of limited autos and funds, most Internet platforms function as media.Current policies are favorable to China's auto finance industry. The Chinese government encourages innovation in consumer finance, which opens more channels for auto finance. In addition, new-round auto demand arises as auto consumption gradually shifts from the first and second tier cities to the third and fourth tier cities and rural areas, which brings about more market opportunities to the auto finance industry. Other driving forces include the development of auto consumer finance market, huge investment, frequent financing activities, business efficiency increased by Internet and financial technologies, and the rapid growth of new energy vehicle market. It is expected that the market size of auto finance in China will exceed CNY 1,500 billion in 2022.Topics CoveredDevelopment environment of China's auto finance industrySupply and demand in China's auto finance industryMarket competition of auto financeAnalysis on major auto finance enterprises in ChinaDriving forces and market opportunities for China's auto finance industryForecast on development of China's auto finance industry, 2018-2022Companies FeaturedSAIC-GMAC Automotive Finance Co.

Rubio Presses Facebook, Twitter on Upholding American Values When Dealing With Authoritarian GovernmentsTargeted News ServiceSeptember 5, 2018 Wednesday 7:04 AM  ESTCopyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1434 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe office of Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, issued the following news release:At a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing today, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) raised inquiries with Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey on the requests of authoritarian governments to crack down on freedom of expression.In August, Senator Rubio led a bipartisan group of senators in sending a letter to Google CEO Sundar Pichai that expressed grave concerns about Google's reported plan to launch a censored version of its search engine in China that would prohibit websites and search terms objected to by the Chinese government and Communist Party. In July, Rubio urged Google and Facebook to deny the Vietnamese government access to sensitive user data following the enactment of a new cybersecurity law in Vietnam.A rough transcript of Rubio's exchanges is below:RUBIO: I want to thank you both for being here. First of all, there's an empty chair next to you from Google. They're not here today and maybe it's because they're arrogant or maybe it's because there's a report that as of last night--this just posted at 3:36 yesterday--this group went on basically pretending to be Kremlin-linked trolls. They used the details of the Internet Research Agency which is a criminal Kremlin link troll farm and were able to buy ads online and place them on sites like CNN, CBS This Morning, Huff Post, Daily Beast, so I'm sure they don't want to be here to answer these questions but I thank you both for being here.I was happy to read in your opening statements, Ms. Sandberg, that you talked about our democracy, our democratic process. You acknowledge responsibility for protecting our process and you talked about our adversaries, clearly linking the company to the values and the importance of this country. And I think an acknowledgement that your company would not exist were it not for in the United States because of the freedoms that we have. Twitter didn't go as far but you did, describing yourself as a global town square, but you did say that you want to support free and open democratic debate. You did refer to our democracy and you did say that Twitter was built on the core tenet of freedom of expression which is a very important core tenant. Here's why this is relevant: because we're here today because we learned and we've learned the hard way that social media that was largely seen as a tool for incredible good, also what makes it good can be manipulated by bad actors to do harm and that's what's happened. We've all learned that the hard way. And so what we're asking you to do and I think what you've agreed to do is to use the powers that you have within your platforms to crack down on certain users who are hostile actors, who are using disinformation or misinformation or hate speech for the purposes of sowing discord or interfering in our internal affairs and that's a positive.Here's the problem though, and we have to start thinking about what happens when an authoritarian regime asks you to do that because their definition of disinformation or misinformation could actually be the truth. Their discord or what they define as discord would be things like defending human rights. Interfering in their internal affairs they would define as advocating for democracy, and the reason why I think that answering that question is so important because it's going to define what your companies are. Are your companies really built on these core values or are they global companies like all these other companies that come around here who see their number-one obligation to make money and therefore market access irrespective of what the price they have to pay to do so.So, for example in 2016, the New York Times reported that Facebook was working on a program to restrict stories from showing up in news feeds based on the user's geography. The story implies, and I know that hasn't been implemented, but it implies that that was being used in order to potentially try to get back into China but any authoritarian government could try to use that tool. Vietnam, by the way where you do operate, has a new law beginning on 2019 January 1st that will require you to store user data inside the country and handover that data to the government of users suspected of anti-state activity, including spreading news that may impede Hanoi or hurt the economy, for example democracy activists.Twitter has a policy of accommodating countries that have different ideas about the contours of freedom of expression by selectively blocking tweets and accounts. For example, one of the countries you comply with is Pakistan, has asked you to block sites for blasphemy. The blasphemy - 647 cases of blasphemy over a 10-year period from '86 to 2007. 50 percent of those cases were on non-Muslim of Pakistanis in a country three percent non-Muslim. One high-profile case is Asia Bibi who has been sentenced to death after a personal dispute over drinking water with a group of women. They accused her of insulting the Prophet, she's arrested, imprisoned sentenced to death. Not relevant to Twitter but relevant to the blasphemy laws that Pakistan has asked you to comply with.Turkey has requested that you block over 12,000 accounts since 2014. You've blocked over 700, many of them are journalists. One of them is an NBA player, Enes Kanter. Russia blocked almost 80 accounts as of last check. You complied with that. One of them was a pro-Ukrainian account in 2014. And so here's why all this is relevant.I guess the first question for Facebook is ... these principles of our democracy, do you support them only in the United States or are these principles that you feel obligated to support around the world?SANDBERG: We support these principles around the world. You mentioned Vietnam, we do not have servers in Vietnam and with very minor exceptions of imminent threats that were happening, we've never turned over information to the Vietnamese government including political information.RUBIO: And you never will?SANDBERG: We would not.RUBIO: You would not agree to do so in order to operate?SANDBERG: We would only operate in a country when we can do so in keeping with our values.RUBIO: And that would apply to China as well?SANDBERG: That would apply to China as well.RUBIO: Thank you and on Twitter how does blocking the account of journalists or an NBA player in keeping with the core tenet of freedom of expression?DORSEY: Well, we enacted a policy some time ago to allow for per-country content takedown. Meaning that within the boundaries of that nation, the content would not be able to be seen, but the rest of the world can see it. And that's important because the world can still have a conversation around what's happening in a market like Turkey. And also we have evidence to show that a lot of citizens within Turkey access that content through proxies and whatnot as well. So we do believe and we have fought the government, the Turkish government consistently around their requests and often times won--not in every case--but often times have made some moves. So we would like to fight for every single person being able to speak freely and to see everything but we have to realize that it's going to take some bridges to get there.RUBIO: Well because a Twitter spokesman in response to a BuzzFeed article, I think about two years ago, here's the quote defending this policy said, "Many countries including the United States have laws that may apply to tweets and our Twitter account content." And then you went on to say what you've said "in our continuing efforts to make services available to users everywhere etc." You would agree that there's no moral equivalency between what we're asking you to do here and what Turkey has asked you to do or other countries have asked you to do in that same realm?DORSEY: We do have to comply with the laws that govern us within each one of these nations but our ideals are similar and our desires.RUBIO: Whose ideas are similar?DORSEY: The company's.RUBIO: Are similar to who?DORSEY: Are similar to how we were founded and where we were founded in this country.RUBIO: I guess my point is, you're not arguing though that. What we've at what we're asking you to do here on disinformation against foreign efforts to interfere in our elections is the same as what Turkey or other authoritarian regimes have asked you to do abroad against upon political opponents of theirs? They're not morally equivalent, these two things?DORSEY: Correct.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6432789 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: September 6, 2018End of Document

EUROPEAN, CHINESE EXPERTS MEET TO DISCUSS AUTOMATED BORDER CONTROL SYSTEMSStates News ServiceJuly 10, 2018 TuesdayCopyright 2018 States News ServiceLength: 317 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: Shanghai BodyThe following information was released by International Organization for Migration (IOM):Over 140 million people crossed China's borders between 2015 and 2016 six per cent more than the previous year. "Managing this huge volume of people requires sophisticated information technology (IT) systems to facilitate the work of border and migration agencies.Like other countries across the globe, China is successfully implementing IT-based border management tools to manage growing numbers of travellers in order to reduce the time spent clearing immigration, improve security, and facilitate seamless cross-border travel."IOM, the UN Migration Agency, is today organizing a two-day seminar in Shanghai on IT systems for border management, bringing together officials from the central and provincial levels of China's National Immigration Administration, and experts from European Union (EU) Member States and IOM to showcase various systems and identify best practices.The Chinese government at national and regional levels is already running pilot programmes for IT systems in border management. These include fingerprint scanning of all foreign travellers in Guangdong province, which was introduced in February 2017, and the use of e-gates for Chinese citizens and permanent residence card holders.IOM border management specialist Dr. Erik Slavenas told seminar participants that international cooperation will play a key role in the adoption of the new technologies. "To achieve the full potential of the use of automated border controls, we need to intensify the role of UN agencies in international cooperation and information sharing," he said.The seminar, which included a field visit to Shanghai's Pudong airport, is part of a series of technical exchanges under the framework of the EU-China Dialogue on Migration and Mobility Support project, funded by the European Union Partnership Instrument.Load-Date: July 10, 2018End of Document

The dramatic expansions of the manufacturing capabilities and rising consumer consumptions in China have transformed China's society and economy.China is one of the world's major producers for industrial and consumer products. Far outpacing other economies in the world, China is the world's fastest growing market for the consumptions of goods and services.The Chinese economy maintains a high speed growth which has been stimulated by the consecutive increases of industrial output, imports & exports, consumer consumption and capital investment for over two decades.Rapid consolidation between medium and large players is anticipated since the Chinese government has been encouraging industry consolidation with an effort to regulate the industry and to improve competitiveness in the world market.Although China has enjoyed the benefits of an expanding market for production and distribution, the industry is suffering from minimal innovation and investment in R&D and new product development. The sector's economies of scale have yet to be achieved.

The dramatic expansions of the manufacturing capabilities and rising consumer consumptions in China have transformed China's society and economy.China is one of the world's major producers for industrial and consumer products. Far outpacing other economies in the world, China is the world's fastest growing market for the consumptions of goods and services.The Chinese economy maintains a high speed growth which has been stimulated by the consecutive increases of industrial output, imports & exports, consumer consumption and capital investment for over two decades.Rapid consolidation between medium and large players is anticipated since the Chinese government has been encouraging industry consolidation with an effort to regulate the industry and to improve competitiveness in the world market.Although China has enjoyed the benefits of an expanding market for production and distribution, the industry is suffering from minimal innovation and investment in R&D and new product development.
