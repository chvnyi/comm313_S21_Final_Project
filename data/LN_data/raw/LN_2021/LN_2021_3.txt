Chinese search alternative voices under strong censorshipPueblo Today: Colorado State University - PuebloFebruary 15, 2021 MondayUniversity WireCopyright 2021 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 605 wordsBodyDoes China sound mysterious to you? If it does, don't worry, because it's mysterious to its own citizens too, especially when they wonder about something, type it in a search engine and all they get is "404 Not Found." Photo courtesy of censorship309.wordpress.com.I don't remember how many times I was asked in America if people could access Facebook in China. You can't, and just to make it clear, you can't access Facebook, YouTube or Twitter either, and sometimes even Wikipedia will go blank if people try to search something "sensitive," like Dalai Lama.China is well known for its strong censorship of media, and the overall brutal suppression of freedom of speech. By blocking global social networking sites, China stops information and alternative voices from flowing in so that people can firmly believe what the government tells them.It is a strategy many emperors have practiced throughout China's thousands of years of history. It is to fool the people and keep them in the dark on controversial issues that would arouse actions to dictate them, all in the name of maintaining stability of its nation and keeping its people together.One hundred years after China overthrew its last monarch, Chinese leaders today are still not changing their minds about suppressing free flow of information.They planted this slogan-like obligation of "maintaining stability of the nation and keeping people together" deeply in people's minds and it has become a legitimate reason to punish those who don't obey it and label them "evil separatists." But the subtext is to really maintain stability of the communist party and keep people under its control.However, this is an era of information explosion, globally. People are thirsty for knowledge no matter if it is in the U.S., China or elsewhere. This is also an era of the Internet. Blocking only some English websites won't make Chinese people stop wanting to know and speak the language.Sina Weibo, the Chinese version of Twitter, has reached 140 million registered users since it was launched in 2009. The power of Weibo is massive and it's considered a place where people can express their thoughts freely, particularly criticisms of the government.Recently, however, the Chinese government asked Weibo to suspend users' accounts who are accused of spreading rumors. Weibo even established a "rumor refuting" page to correct the misleading information on particular issues.Unfortunately, a lot of people in China don't seem capable of differentiating between the truth and rumors. They believe whatever they see on these social networking sites and will pass the information down.One general reason this applies everywhere is because people nowadays don't bother to verify their information. What's different in China is that people are disappointed with authorities and the state-controlled media, but at the same time desperate for knowledge. Now they would rather believe anything against the government.But can these be reasons for the government to take away a person's right to know or speak?I hope that can never be, because it's not the peoples' fault for not knowing how to differentiate between truth and rumors. They were never educated to ask if their rights were sacrificed for something else.The people of China are not in a society that allows different perspectives, so where can they gain the ability if they don't have the information to make judgments on?But now, through this chaotic information explosion era, it is our time to learn.China, please hear our voice. Don't say that your people are vulnerable, because it is you that doesn't make them strong.Load-Date: February 15, 2021End of Document

Amid pandemic chaos, China offers its version of freedomCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 6, 2021 WednesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1115 wordsBodyAt the end of last October, in Paris, Duncan Clark's flight was running the runway when President Emmanuel Macron announced a second national emergency shutdown in France.The country had nearly 50,000 new infections that day. The United States had nearly 100,000. Clark sighed with relief. I was traveling to China. That day, the country had reported 25 new infections, and only one had its origins abroad.Clark, an entrepreneur and author, was returning to China after spending nine months in the United States and France, the longest time away from the country since moving to Beijing in 1994.Over the past few years, he had spent more time outside China to escape air pollution, Internet censorship and an increasingly depressing political environment. However, when he returned in October, he perceived something new: he felt safe, energized and free. "The possibility of living a normal life is quite impressive," he opined.While many countries remain affected by COVID-19, China, where the pandemic originated, has become one of the safest places in the world.The country reported fewer than 100,000 contagions throughout 2020. The United States has reported a higher number every day since early November.China resembles the"normality"of the pre-pandemic world.Restaurants are bursting. The hotels are full. There are long lines outside the shops of luxury brands. Instead of Zoom calls, people come face-to-face to talk business or celebrate the new year. That country is the only one of the major economies that grew last year. Although such forecasts are often more art than science,a group is predicting that China's economy will outperform the American economy in 2028,five years earlier than predicted.The pandemic has drastically changed many perceptions, including ideas about freedom.Chinese citizens have no freedom of expression, freedom of worship, or freedom to live without fear—three of the four freedoms outlined by President Franklin D. Roosevelt—butthey have freedom of transit and lead a normal daily life.In a pandemic year, many people in the world will envy this form of freedom, one of the most basic.The global crisis could sow doubts about other types of freedom. Nearly half of Americans who participated in the election supported a president who ignored science and failed to take basic precautions to protect their country.Some Americans say they have the right to ignore the recommendations on the use of water covers proposed by health experts, a decision with which they, and others, are at increasing risk of infection. The Internet, the platform that supposedly gave voice to people who don't have it, became a useful tool for autocrats to control the masses and political groups to spread misinformation.Freedom of transit in China is at the expense of almost any other kind of freedom. It's probably the most guarded country in the world.At the start of the outbreak, the government took extreme social control measures to separate people: strategies that are not available to democratic governments. "In fact, there are many parallels between the Chinese government's treatment of a virus and how it deals with other problems," said Howard Chao, a retired California lawyer who invests in start-ups on both sides of the Pacific."It's a kind of one-of-a-kind strategy foreveryone: just take care of the problem," he said. "So, when it comes to a virus, that may not be bad. When it comes to other problems, it may not be so good." Of course, the Chinese government is eager to help everyone forget that it silenced those who tried to warn the world during the early days of the outbreak.However, there is no denying that China's success in containing the outbreak improved Beijing's image, especially when compared to America's failures.It has given acceptance to China's so-called model, the Communist Party's promise to the Chinese people of prosperity and stability in exchange for their relentless control over political power. "In this pandemic year, the Communist Party has given the people a social good: stability," said Dong Haitao, an investor who moved from Hong Kong to Beijing in August. For Dong, China's success gives him the opportunity to gain financial independence.Dong, who is setting up an asset management firm as well as a pu-erh tea start-up, is optimistic about the Chinese economy.Dong believes that, after the pandemic, China will have even stronger supply chains and a vibrant consumer economy thanks to a young generation who is more interested in traditional Chinese culture, such as tea, than its generation, which grew in the age of globalization. Dong, who moved from New York to Hong Kong in the middle of the 2008 financial crisis, decided to leave Hong Kong because the city has felt anemic during the pandemic, while many mainland Chinese cities seem to flash with energy and hope. "I don't think I can find the freedom I want in Hong Kong," he opined. It is unclear whether this change in perception can be prolonged after the pandemic ends. But the West may find it more difficult to sell its vision of freedom after China made its model so attractive.In 1994, Clark, the entrepreneur and author, founded a consultancy in Beijing and was an advisor to Alibaba,the Chinese e-commerce giant, in the early days of the company.Since he left quarantine in mid-November, he has traveled to four cities and attended many events and conferences, including one with around 900 people. "Normally, China was kind of an adventure," he said. "But that has changed. Something has changed in the world." Clark pointed this out with mixed feelings. "There's a part of me that I wouldn't want to be true, but it is," he said.Beijing and Shanghai are becoming more cosmopolitan and their consumers are becoming more sophisticated, he opined.This month, Clark went to a Scottish dance in Beijing. The piper was Chinese because the organizer couldn't take anyone from Scotland. China "feels a bit like Disney's Epcot Center," he opined. "It's as if the microcoss of the West is still here, but the West is closed for the time being."Clark's had a little hard getting used to being back in the middle of a lot of people."If you talk at a party or something, you can't push a button and silence who you don't like," he said. At the first major event he attended, he realized that someone had very bad breath, he recalled. "I thought, 'Oh my God, I haven't lived this in nine months because everyone was wearing masks, and I didn't see anyone,'" Clark said. Although Clark thinks of bad breath, "I feel like I'm living here in the future," he said. "Well, I mean, 'Better, get ready.'"c. 2021 TheNew York Times CompanyLook too       Load-Date: January 7, 2021End of Document

The secret night flights between China and Burma: weapons, soldiers or shellfish?CE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 23, 2021 TuesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 994 wordsBodyBuddhist monks from Masoeyein Taik Thit Monastery and mosque imams on Monday led the protests during the general strike in Mandalay, Burma's second-largest city. Similar scenes have been seen on Tuesday, also in Yangon and in the capital, Naipyidó. Hundreds of thousands of people, calling for the return of a democracy they have only enjoyed for a decade, have taken to the streets again for the seventeenth consecutive day defying the military who took power on February 1.Off the streets, the struggle for democracy in Burma is also in cyberspace. Since the coup d'eer, the military government has sought a major firewall on the internet, blocking Western social media and cutting off browsers. In response, a group of hackers, Myanmar Hackers, started a cyber war by knocking down the websites of some government institutions, such as the state broadcaster MRTV and the Food and Drug Administration.These days, among the civil disobedience movement that defies the military authorities, rumours have begun to spread that Chinese technicians have arrived in Burma to help the army build that great Beijing-style digital censor wall. Even rumors go further, as can be seen in some Twitter threads, where protesters ask for an analysis of images of protests in case someone detects Chinese soldiers infiltrated among the armed forces deployed on the streets.All these assumptions come in the wake of the secret flights that there are every night between China and Burma. On this information, which was mentioned last week by a couple of local Southeast Asian media outlets in their chronicles of the protests, the Australian Instituteof StrategicPolicy (ASPI) today publishes more details in a report signed by researcher Susan Hutchinson."Every night, for more than a week, unregistered flights between Yangon and Kunming (capital of Yunnan Province, southern China) have been transporting unknown goods and personnel from China to Burma. Burma's military regime is now trying to hide flights," they say from ASPI."The Chinese government and Myanmar Airways have claimed that the aircraft were transporting products from the sea. However, the details of the flights in question make it highly unlikely. The situation in Burma suggests two possibilities for what the planes are transporting. One is that they are bringing in Chinese troops and cyber specialists to help the Tatmadaw - as the Burmese army is known - control access to information and the Internet. The other is that the Tatmadaw's weapons stores are increasing."Five hard-to-track daily flightsWhen the Burmese military took power, they banned international flights. But every night, there are an average of five flights between Yangon and Kunming. These planes go with the transponders off, so they don't show up on the radars. There is also no record of the departure times of these trips in the international flight databases."We know that transponders work because we can see that they have been turned off for specific flights and then turned on for others. Beyond that, Kunming Airport has not registered them online as arrivals. Not including scheduled departure and arrival times, unlike actual schedules, makes it particularly difficult to track them in open source flight databases," they discuss from the Australian institute.ASPI ensures that itsinformation is based on data sent via satellite, as well as testimonies from Yangon airport workers and members of Burma's civil disobedience movement, who have posted photos on Twitter from the airport with flight details."China is the world's fifth armsexporter, exporting more than 16.2 billion units of ammunition over the past 15 years. Beijing has been favoring agreements with Belt and Road Initiative partners, and Burma has been one of the top three importers over the past decade. Kunming, in particular, houses a major artillery unit, as well as a variety of signal intelligence and cyber units, including one focused on operations in Southeast Asia," the report states.A month ago, General Min Aung Hlaing, leader of the military junta that governs Burma, met with China's foreign minister, Wang Yi. An encounter dubbed "brotherly" by the Asian giant's press. "China appreciates burma's army taking national revitalization as its mission," Wang said.After that meeting, some burma media outlets stressed that their military shared with the Chinese minister their complaints about the alleged fraud that occurred last November 8, in which the National League for Democracy (LND), the party leading Aung San Suu Kyi, had swept through the election with more than 80% of Parliament's seats. In addition, the local press told that before Wang returned to Beijing, General Min Aung Hlaing could have shared future Army movements with him after contesting the results of the elections.China has already supported in the past the military dictatorship that was in command in Burma from 1962 to 2010, even protecting the Burmese military from international sanctions following the 2017 Rohingya genocide. But also, during the last decade of the government led by Suu Kyi, both countries have maintained a close relationship, with the Nobel Peace Prize visiting Beijing on several occasions and supporting President Xi Jinping's Strip and Route project.Last week, Chinese Ambassador to Burma Chen Hai said in an interview that "the current development in Burma is by no means what China wants to see." He also highlighted his good relationship with Suu Kyi and his support for the "mediation efforts" of the UN special envoy in the country.However, since the february 1 coup, as the international community, with the United States at the helm, called for the restoration of democracy and the release of political leaders and detained activists, from Beijing they initially defined what happened in their neighboring country as a "major cabinet reorganization," and then asked the other nations not to "interfere in Burma's internal affairs."Load-Date: February 24, 2021End of Document

Human Rights Watch: China - Olympic Committee Fails to Honor Rights PledgeTargeted News ServiceFebruary 5, 2021 Friday 9:20 AM  ESTCopyright 2021 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 668 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK BodyHuman Rights Watch issued the following news release on Feb. 3, 2021:The International Olympic Committee's (IOC) failure to carry out its due diligence commitments for the 2022 Beijing Games is a missed opportunity to promote human rights in China, Human Rights Watch said today. Thus far, the IOC has given no indication that it has conducted or plans to publish a human rights risk assessment.Human Rights Watch had urged the IOC to undertake this review by February 4, 2021, one year before the 2022 Games are scheduled to open."The IOC knows the Chinese authorities are arbitrarily detaining Uyghurs and other Muslims, expanding state surveillance, and silencing numerous peaceful critics," said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. "Its failure to publicly confront Beijing's serious human rights violations makes a mockery of its own commitments and claims that the Olympics are a 'force for good.'"The Chinese government had made numerous promises to improve human rights to secure the right to host the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics. Yet, during the 2008 Games, the authorities repeatedly violated the fundamental rights they had pledged to uphold, including by censoring the media and the internet, arbitrarily arresting journalists, and abusing workers' rights.Since that time, the Chinese authorities have deepened their repression. President Xi Jinping's government has crushed nascent civil society, targeted labor rights activists, imposed draconian policies in Xinjiang and Tibet, and trampled fundamental freedoms in Hong Kong. Although media freedom is a core requirement for Olympic hosts, the Chinese authorities have tightened their chokehold over domestic media and the internet, and expelled journalists from international media. China has also made it increasingly difficult for people inside the country to connect to Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), which international journalists rely on for their reporting.In 2015, when China was selected to host the 2022 Winter Olympics, Human Rights Watch detailed extensive concerns about the Chinese government's human rights record. Human Rights Watch urged the IOC to "establish effective and independent monitoring mechanisms to track and report on regression on labor rights, press freedom, discrimination, and all areas where assurances were received, and commit to publicly speak out on and help ensure redress for these rights violations when they occur."The IOC Evaluation Commission's January 2015 report on China states that the IOC "received assurances" from Chinese authorities on human rights in order to win the right to host the 2022 Games. Despite requests from civil society organizations whose work focuses on China, the IOC has not made the details of these assurances public, or how it is monitoring conditions in China.In 2017, the IOC added human rights requirements aligned with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (the "Guiding Principles") in its host city agreements; those principles provide for entities to undertake human rights due diligence. Although Beijing was awarded the contract to host the Winter Olympics before the new human rights language was adopted, "Operational Requirements" included since then allow the IOC to negotiate for human rights protections and standards with the host city.In December 2020, the International Olympic Committee published its expert report "Recommendations for an IOC Human Rights Strategy," a plan for adopting human rights across its operations and integrating the Guiding Principles."The IOC can't hold itself out as an exemplar on human rights when it only defends them where doing so is easy," said Minky Worden, director of global initiatives at Human Rights Watch. "Despite the IOC's expressed commitments to push for positive change, there is no visible evidence it has pressed Chinese authorities to meet any human rights obligations."[Category: International]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7374776 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: February 5, 2021End of Document

Joining me right now to discuss this unprecedented security effort, Florida Congressman Army Lieutenant Colonel Former Green Beret and House on Services Committee Member Michael Waltz.Joining the conversation all morning long, this morning is Fox Businesses Dagen McDowell, and "The Wall Street Journal" Senior Writer Jon Hilsenrath, great to see everybody this morning, good morning to you. Michael Waltz, let me kick it off with you. Your reaction to all of events today, the Inauguration of Joe Biden, he's expected to do 17 executive orders today on day one becoming the 46th President of this great country. Your thoughts on how things will change under this new President.REP. MICHAEL WALTZ (R-FL): Well, thank you, Maria. I think we are on the verge of seeing the swearing in of Obama's third term. This is going to be Obama 2.0 if you look at the officials that Biden has nominated so far yesterday. It is literally a slew of officials that held number 2 or number 3 spots in the Obama administration that now have been bumped up one.So I've already registered my concerns particularly as it comes to Cuba and Venezuela and asking the senate foreign relations committee to really hold the line towards a reversal of President Trump's policies there in terms of Obama's failed policy of just kind of underlying philosophy of we are just nice to them, they'll be nice back to us and we'll be nice to their own people.We have to hold the line when it comes to China, just yesterday rightfully Secretary Pompeo announced genocide in terms of what China is doing to the Uighurs and the concentration camp and forced labor and we in the congress have to hold Wall Street and the incoming Biden administration accountable there in terms of the - I mean, it is jaw dropping to me to see so many American companies enforcing democracy by no longer giving money to Republicans but then making money all day long on the backs of slave labor frankly in - in China province.So these are a number of things that I think will be issues right off the bat and Republicans have the hold the line on Trump's legacy.BARTIROMO: Yes. Now I think you make a really important point. It's a point that we've made on this program. All of these CEO'S and American companies that are gearing up to go - begin business in China with all of the issues that this country needs to recognize, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared the Chinese government committing genocide and crimes against humanity through its wide scale oppression of the Uighurs and other predominantly Muslims Arabic minorities in its North Western region of Xinjiang. Incoming Biden Treasury Nominee Janet Yellen even agreed with that assessment during her confirmation hearing yesterday. Listen to what she said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CARTE GOODWIN, FORMER UNITED STATES SENATOR: I wonder if you would regard Chairman Xi and his regime as guilty of genocide (inaudible) at present.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think it's guilty of horrendous human rights abuses, yes.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: So the question becomes congressman, do you expect the Biden administration to continue President Trump's tough stance on China or will we see a change. We are showing you video right now of the Uighurs in Xinjiang, they are locked up, they are blindfolded. It's a pretty scary sight. Now this video from 2018, we don't have recent video of it. But we know that there are more than a million individuals locked up getting "reeducated in Xinjiang".WALTZ: Yes. And let's now forget the Chinese embassy recently on twitter, mind you, bragged about the force sterilization of the Uighurs. I mean that's not genocide, I don't know what is. But I - to answer your question, I think you will see that shift continue in terms of a tough stance from military sense and the shift of military assets but my concern is that the Chinese aren't looking necessarily to defeat us militarily, it is economically.So it's the 400,000 students that are - that are throughout universities and academic institutions, the theft of our IP, the cyber attacks and theft that are ongoing, the mergers and acquisitions where they're buying up key robotic, artificial intelligence and other technologies.Who knows what happened with those purchases with over a billion dollars going to Hunter Biden along those same lines, so it's that soft - the soft power issues where the Chinese are looking to dominate us. Heck, Maria, their military strategy is focused on the United States going bankrupt before they make their moves militarily and yet I think the spending under Biden is just going to be off the charts between him and the progressives in both houses of congress.So that's my real concern. That's what I'm going to be focused on going forward because I think this is the most existential threat the United States has ever faced and everything, education, Wall Street, our debt is tied to that global competition with Chinese Communist Party.BARTIROMO: Yes. No, I agree with you Congressman, we certainly said that many times on this program and unfortunately we will have to wait and see to whether the administration coming in is going to keep this tough stance. The whole world should be concerned about the Chinese Communist Party's plans to become the number one super power in the world overtaking America.WALTZ: You're right. And just this year, Biden said rise of China, no big deal. So I hope he has changed his mind in the wake of COVID and seen how they've devastated not just the United States but the world with this pandemic and they are the only ones growing economically, so champagne is popping in Beijing and we have to put a stop to it.BARTIROMO: And they've used the coronavirus as an opportunity to invade other countries like India and bully the South China Sea. We know that all of the above, everything that you listed is certainly concern here and we will keep a spotlight on it. Congressman it's good to see you this morning, Michael Waltz joining us here. Thank you so much sir, we'll keep checking back.The morning mover this morning, shares of Netflix soaring take a look premarket. The pandemic is bringing in more viewers, the streaming giant beating expectations last night adding 8.5 million subscribers in the fourth quarter alone. That pushes the total number of subscribers of Netflix, past 200 million. Almost 200 - beyond 200 million people on Netflix. The news sparking outbreak at analysts from UBS among others raising its price target from $540 to $650 a share, obviously, the stock has past its initial price target, up 13 and a quarter percent, right now.We got a lot coming out. We are just getting started this morning. Stay with us. We will talk with the President and CEO of Goya Foods coming up Bob Unanue he will talk about American business under the Biden administration and President Trump's economic legacy. Don't miss that. And then next hour, Former Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman will weigh in on the Inauguration and the Iran nuclear deal one of the plans.Plus Former New NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly is here to discuss Washington, DC on lockdown this morning and New York's rise in crime.

Don't miss a moment of it. You're watching "Mornings with Maria" live on Fox Business on a Wednesday morning.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, markets are trading higher this morning, take a look, Futures pointing to a modest gain ahead of Joe Biden's inauguration today at a busy day of earnings, Dow Industrials right now up 76, the NASDAQ up 106 and the S&P 500 higher by 15 and 3 quarters. We will get a good window into the fourth quarter this morning when Morgan Stanley, Procter & Gamble and U.S. Bancorp all report their fourth quarter numbers.United Airlines releasing its earnings later today, as well, as you see Morgan Stanley is expected to post $11.5 billion in revenue, United Health expected at $65 billion in revenue. Joining me right now is the Co-Founder and Chief Economist Cornerstone Macro Research Nancy Lazar, Nancy it's great to see you this morning. Thanks so much for being here.NANCY LAZAR, CORNERSTONE MACRO CO-FOUNDER & CHIEF ECONOMIST: Good morning.BARTIROMO: Do you have positioning around the incoming administration. I have your most recent report and you're talking so much about it's the vaccine and not massive stimulus that - that matters and look at China you say. Is there a strategy from your standpoint that changes with a different administration now?LAZAR: Well, the question is how much more stimulus do we indeed see from this administration with a December stimulus. Consumers have 2 trillion in excess savings, if they were to spend that say over the next year that would boost consumer spending by 15 percent. My point is the consumers already have a lot of fire power. Obviously, they can't spend that because of the virus. And so what you need is to send out the vaccine, more quickly than we have been doing to open travel and leisure industry so indeed the consumers can spend.The employment background is very healthy. If you take out the travel and leisure industry from that December employment report, employment rose almost 350,000. So again it's - it's COVID, it's the need to distribute the vaccine in a more efficient manner that's really going to help this economy. Now, if on top of that, you do get additional stimulus in March which my colleagues in Washington suggest we probably will - the consumers will have even more fire power and so I do worry incrementally there's potentially too much of a good thing giving consumers too much money which could potentially overheat the economy.BARTIROMO: Yes. And what does that mean for the inflation and what does that mean for Federal Reserve? Janet Yellen of course on Capitol Hill, Joe Biden's nominee to lead the Treasury Department, it's pretty much a go from - from Wall Street's perspective. They are expecting Janet Yellen to be confirmed shortly. But she yesterday had a lot of interesting comments to say. She discussed the government's sponsored entities for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.She expects - she discussed taxes, asset management. Tell me about Janet Yellen and her impact. She will lead the Treasury Department, she's is urging law makers at her confirmation hearing yesterday to act big on COVID-19 relief spending. So this is something that we just discussed in terms of what that money going into consumers' pockets is going to mean. What kind of impact do you expect, Nancy?LAZAR: As of our forecasting about 6 percent GDP for 2021. If we get additional fiscal stimulus which again Washington certainly seems to be moving toward 7 percent plus GDP is definitely a possibility for this economy. The economy is healthy. We have healthy companies. You're talking about corporate profits. We think profits are going to be stronger in fourth quarter then current consensus. That's important. We are a healthy private sector and the government potentially going to add even more stimulus to the economy.I thought one of the most interesting things she said yesterday was that they're going to not raise taxes during the pandemic and that to me is a really important step. I would particularly hope they don't raise taxes on corporations. Its companies, it's the private sector that creates jobs. They are focused on the job market which is very encouraging and therefore if they can postpone or if not potentially not even rate corporate taxes that would set a healthy path and it would actually reduce the odds that the economy would overheat and that the key thing right now is we are in a technology revolution in this country.And we are improving productivity to - to your Netflix, example, is a beautiful example, technology is driving, our company is not just a Netflix, but even factories, the increasingly the service sector, the healthcare industry and so we are in a technological revolution right now. If government can encourage businesses to continue to invest in their companies that's how you largely create jobs and heal the labor market. So for me yesterday one of the most important things she said was, indeed, not raising taxes during the pandemic. I would hope they would extend that during their whole term.BARTIROMO: I think this is such an important point that you bring up because many people were worried, for example, not just about the corporate rate but the capital gains rate going from 23 percent all the way up to 44 percent but this morning a number of Wall Streeters and analysts and observers are saying just what you are and that is company's tax increase are not going to be an issue until 2022 rather than 2021, so maybe that actually adds expectations higher in terms of earnings growth for 2021 anyway. Nancy, you have been right on all of this. We so appreciate your brilliance. Thank you so much.LAZAR: Thank you, Maria, have a good day.BARTIROMO: And to you, Nancy Lazar joining us Cornerstone Macro.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Joe Biden is expected to sign 17 executive actions later today after being sworn in as the incoming President. Some of those executive actions including mask mandate in federal buildings, having the United States rejoin both the World Health Organization and the Paris climate accord and ending the Trump travel ban on mostly Muslim countries. On President Trump's first day in office he signed just one executive order and 33 in his first 100 days in office. Dagen, your reaction to what we are likely to see this afternoon?DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NEWS CORRESPONDENT: The trouble with using executive orders as the President is that they can get reversed when someone new comes into office and we are seeing that now. Some of this innocuous may be helpful but some of it hurtful to all Americans, but clearly rejoining the Paris climate accord is a way to appease far-left factions in the Democratic Party. I will just point this out you rejoin the Paris climate accord broadly speaking it doesn't actually do much to combat global warming.U.S. Emissions per capita before the pandemic were the lowest that they have been since 1950's. So what does this do? It let's China, the world's largest emissions emitter well do nothing or wait or to do something meanwhile, the west is required to immediately start reducing carbon emissions.What will this do to the American people based on analysis, it's going to cost every American family roughly $1,500 a year in compliance, again, higher energy prices are a tax on all Americans even as China gets to keep on building new coal fired power plants as the New York Post editorial board pointed out.BARTIROMO: Yes. And China is the biggest polluter in the world. It's anybody's guess if they are going to keep their promises on any climate deal. But one that I'm concerned with is this reengaging with the World Health Organization. The WHO was basically the mouthpiece for China throughout the coronavirus and wondering if, you know, the administration is staying tough on China but soft on the WHO, is that an opening for Xi Jinping to get his rule making or his sentiments and what he wants the world to think out through the World Health Organization, Dagen?MCDOWELL: It's very disturbing and there's been very much upset at the WHO about the vaccine distribution, rightly so. I would like to have heard. But the WHO essentially one year ago lied to the world and said that there was no evidence. They were basically.BARTIROMO: That's right.MCDOWELL: No evidence of human to human transmission of COVID. And it was clearly a lie. There were parties in Asia that knew that that was the case in late December and the WHO was essentially lying for China and unleashed a deadly pandemic on the globe.BARTIROMO: Right, they would not let the most esteemed, you know, medical agency in the world go in to actually check the origins of the coronavirus and that is, of course, the CDC. So the World Health Organization allowed that, the CDC would not get allowed to view Wuhan and the origins of the disease. We still have not heard any comment about China's role in the coronavirus from Joe Biden.So we will see what he has to say about the WHO, about China and their role in allowing this deadly virus to escape the China borders. Jon, what do you think? What are the actions that you believe will have the most impact from the incoming new President?JON HILSENRATH, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL SENIOR WRITER: Well, you know, I think what he's doing right now is sending signals about his priorities. You know, you're talking about the WHO, one of the signal - and the Paris climate accord. One of the signals there is he wants to work with other countries in a more multilateral fashion.Immigration, he's signing an executive order on dreamers, climate is another one. So, you know, and then the Muslim ban. I think these are all signals and frankly I think it's going to upset a lot of Trump supporters because he's moving against what President Trump tried to do. You know, the other thing I would look out for is, one of the reasons this Georgia election was so important in turning the Senate over to the Democrats is, it now puts something they call the Congressional Review Act in the president's hands in which the new president can overturn regulations, put in place in the last few months of the previous administration's ruling.And so we could be seeing the Biden administration in the next few months turning over Trump rules, again, on immigration and environment.MARIA BARTIROMO, ANCHOR, MORNINGS WITH MARIA: Yes, and one of the executive orders today is expected to be stop all border wall construction immediately. That's going to be one of the executive orders today. So, we'll be covering that certainly tomorrow and beyond. We'll take a break, when we come back, the CEO of Goya Foods is here, Bob Unanue to talk about the president's legacy and business in America. We'll look back as well as look ahead. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, good Wednesday morning everybody, thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Wednesday, January 20th. A look at markets this half an hour. We are looking at a pretty good firmer tone this morning, Dow Industrials is up about 50 points, Nasdaq up about 100 points and the S&P 500 currently higher by 12.75. This after all three major indices finished higher yesterday, more hopes of more stimulus coming to the economy as Janet Yellen testified on Capitol Hill, talking about the fact that the administration will likely not raise taxes during the pandemic. The Dow Industrials yesterday up 116 points, the Nasdaq up almost 200 points and the S&P 500 higher by 30. European markets this morning higher as well, take a look, the major indices there showing a gain of -- well, the FTSE 100 just went negative, it is down 1.5 of a point.The CAC Quarante is up 21 and the Dax Index in Germany is up 72. In Asia overnight, stocks were up with the exception of Japan, it was down a fraction, the best performer was Hong Kong, Hang Seng index up better than 1 percent. Well, the U.S. is setting another grim record in the fight against the coronavirus. Cheryl Casone with those details right now, Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS: That is right, Maria, good morning. The U.S. yesterday topped 400,000 deaths, President-elect Joe Biden led a memorial on the National Mall at sun down to honor and remember the victims of the virus. Four hundred lights around the reflecting pool representing that grim milestone. The number of deaths has been spiking, we should say since the holidays. Meanwhile, there is some promising news and the fight against the U.K. variant. A new trial shows the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine will protect against it. The study focused on all ten mutations of the virus opposed to just one crucial one. Well, the Paycheck Protection Program is back up and running according to the Small Business Administration, roughly 60,000 applications were approved for more than $5 billion in forgivable loans.Program reopened on the 11th after closing last August, thanks to another stimulus bill that passed last month in Washington. In a new survey, one- third of small businesses say they would need financial assistance in the next 6 months. Well, Disney Executive Chairman Bob Iger and other executives seeing massive pay cut amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Iger's pay dropped 56 percent to $21 million last year as the company failed to meet some performance metrics, executive bonuses were cut as well. Disney has laid off more than 32,000 workers in the last year as its parks and cruise lines, they shut down due to the ongoing pandemic. Let's take a look at the stock in the pre-market right now. Disney is not coming up -- there it is. Stock is up 3 percent this morning.Finally, Maria, you have to be in it to win it, you've said this, another multi-million dollar jackpot going to up for grabs tonight. The Powerball $730 million jackpot could be yours. Meanwhile, overnight, the mega millions jackpot climbed to $970 million after no one won the grand prize for a total of -- get this, between the 2 prizes, Maria, $1.7 billion. Yes, in it to win it, Maria, back to you.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: That's amazing, all right, Cheryl, thank you so much. Reflecting on the past 4 years, looking ahead to the next. President Trump speaking out in his farewell address yesterday on the economic accomplishments on his watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We reignited America's job creation and achieved record low unemployment for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, Asian-Americans, women, almost everyone. Income soared, wages boomed. The American dream was restored and millions were lifted from poverty in just a few short years. It was a miracle. We rebuilt the American manufacturing base, opened up thousands of new factories and brought back the beautiful phrase made in the USA.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining me right now to talk about the impact on business is the president and CEO of Goya Foods, Bob Unanue. And Bob, it's great to see you again, thanks very much for being here. From a business perspective, give us your sense of what the last 4 years have meant, and then we want to look ahead to what you're expecting with the incoming administration.BOB UNANUE, PRESIDENT & CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, GOYA FOODS: Well, like the president just mentioned -- hi, Maria, good to be with you again. As the president just mentioned, they took down a lot of the restrictions and road blocks to make America great, and to prosper, bring manufacturing back to our shores which we still need to continue to do. I think that going forward, if we reverse all of this, it's going to be an issue, but one of the things you are going to see is that a miracle cure, all of a sudden, while coronavirus runs its course and nothing has really changed, with Trump -- President Trump out of the way, now they're going to -- people are going to go back to work. Cuomo is already talking about going back to work.And miraculous they accomplished what they set out to do, was to get President Trump out of the way. The problem is as some of these comments are, that President Trump said, they're not after me, they're after you. I'm just in the way. And I think this is mission accomplished, mission accomplished by the union, the partnership, the conglomerate of social media, big tech, big media and government, big government for ushering in the dawn of a new world order. This great reset with unverified election --BARTIROMO: Yes --UNANUE: The big prize is the United States, and they didn't go after just President Trump, they're after us now. The 80 million people that voted for him, and also all of the people in the United States, with the very few having control over our speech, our work, our religion. There's a war coming, now that the president is leaving today, there's still coming after the United States, the working class --they've decimated the working class this year by shutting down the economy. And this is not just --BARTIROMO: Yes --UNANUE: In the United States, there's censorship around the world. This cardinal -- Mexican Cardinal Juan Sandoval Iniguez was censored for by Facebook for denouncing a new world order. So, you know, big tech, social media is not looking just for the big prize of the United States, this is a world order.BARTIROMO: Yes, now, I think this will come back to haunt big tech because this is un-American to be censoring the way that we are seeing all of the censorship. I want to get your take on what we heard from Janet Yellen yesterday, because all eyes now are on President-elect Joe Biden, what his administration will mean for business in the United States. Secretary nominee, former Fed Chair Janet Yellen spoke out at her confirmation hearing yesterday, and she said that the U.S. could afford a higher corporate tax rate and should coordinate with other countries, however, she also said that they would not raise taxes during the pandemic. Here is one Wall Streeter, this is the analyst at Cohen & Company, Bob, he says Yellen says corporate tax increases would be designed to take effect after the pandemic. This is what we've expected and what team Biden has suggested.Yellen's comments, put it on the record. I mean, look, the bottom line is throughout the entire campaign, Joe Biden really didn't tell us what he was going to do in terms of business. We are hearing this now specifically from Janet Yellen saying, they're not going to raise taxes during the pandemic. It looks like it's going to be an impact in 2022 as opposed to 2021. How do you feel about that? Give us a sense of the impact of what the president's tax cut plan did when he took the corporate rate all the way down to 21 percent because it is likely going to 35 percent, but now not until 2022.UNANUE: You can't put millions of people out of work and then throw trillions of dollars and try to resolve --BARTIROMO: Yes --UNANUE: The problem with money. It's -- taxes will have to --BARTIROMO: Great point, yes --UNANUE: Go up. The president has, you know, did not -- never wanted to shut down this economy. By shutting down the economy, we decimated the working class. We have people rushing to our gates to -- from Central, South America to -- when there's no work to be done. And I don't know why quite honestly why people are rushing here if we shut down all of our work. I think that will -- that will turn around, people will go back to work. We have to. But taxes inevitably have to go up, and it -- you know, it's -- there's no doubt about it in my mind.BARTIROMO: Yes, so from your standpoint, it's this lockdown that is most impactful and we don't have any indication that Joe Biden is going to lift that lockdown --UNANUE: And one more thing --BARTIROMO: Some of the city -- yes --UNANUE: You know, you mentioned President-elect Biden, but, you know, I'm not sure -- he's a nice guy, I'm not sure he's in charge. You know, again, big tech and all these people campaigned. He never really campaigned. Big tech, social --BARTIROMO: Yes --UNANUE: Media, they did their bidding for him, and so I'm not sure if the policies that he's talked about during the election process was nothing new. It was just a me too. So I'm not sure who is in charge --BARTIROMO: Yet --UNANUE: And what the future holds.BARTIROMO: Well, we'll be getting more clarity soon. You make a good point. Ric Grenell on with me on Sunday saying that he thinks Susan Rice is the shadow president. She didn't have to be confirmed but he gave her a role being the head of domestic policy. So, we'll be watching Susan Rice, of course, who was in the top 3 or 5 people in the Obama administration back in the White House now for Susan Rice. Bob, it's good to see you, we, of course, will keep a spotlight on all of these things that will impact business and citizens. We will take a break, when we come back --UNANUE: Let me make one more point --BARTIROMO: The attack on free speech by social media giants -- yes, go ahead, Bob. The attack of free speech by social media giants continues to persist. We have the very latest as more conservative voices get silenced. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The big crack-down on conservative voices, social media platform CloutHub seeing a surge of nearly 2 million sign-ups following Parler's shutdown as people look for an alternative to Facebook and Twitter as they are being censored. Joining me right now is the CEO of CloutHub, Jeff Brain, Jeff, it's good to see you, thanks very much for joining us. Explain the platform.JEFF BRAIN, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, CLOUTHUB: Sure, CloutHub is a very different kind of platform. I felt that most social media is all about look at me and it was a missed opportunity. I wanted to create a platform where we can bring people together and give them the tools they need to address the issues that impact their lives, their communities and our country. When I started I had no idea we would be locked in our homes, our business would be closed, and we'd be, you know, have an election that was in question. But people need a platform actually where they can have a voice and like you said, we see lots of voices being silenced on social media.BARTIROMO: So, do you see Twitter as your competitor? I know you worry that the same thing that happens to Parler could happen to you.BRAIN: Well, we are actually not a Twitter alternative, we are much broader platform. We're more like a Facebook or -- you know, we actually allow you to do everything you do on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube in one platform. It's a very convenient platform. Now, as for what happened to Parler, that's wrong what happened to Parler, it should never been taken down. And we're being proactive. I've worked with, you know, Apple and Android and AWS, you know, months ago to explain to them what we are and what we are not. You know, we have robust monitoring on our platform. People want to be able to speak about the issues, there's very serious issues that are facing our society and country, but they don't want the violence, they don't want the hate and they don't want the porn on platforms, and we keep that off of our platform.BARTIROMO: Well, I mean, look, there's porn on Twitter, right? I mean, there's violence --BRAIN: Right --BARTIROMO: On Twitter, so who knows, you know, what the reasoning is here. I mean, do you think that there was more porn and violence on Parler than there is on Twitter? So, I don't know, you know, they're making judgments on this and he was -- John Mace who's been on this program was relying on the cloud services of Amazon. So, what does your platform have that you will be able to say and you know, continue business even if you see some of these companies decide, well, we're going to take the rug out from under you like they did for Parler --BRAIN: Yes --BARTIROMO: Do you have a platform that moderates, that has rules in place to moderate threats and violence to prove it to these companies, or are you relying on your own infrastructure?BRAIN: Well, first of all, we do have rules against behavior. We draw the line -- you know, we encourage people to come and talk about issues, and any issue they want. As long as they talk on issue, there's a difference between issues and behavior. CloutHub has created our own AI that actually protects our platform against, you know, the violence. It captures that -- the violence, the hate, it never actually lands on our platform --BARTIROMO: OK --BRAIN: We prevent it.BARTIROMO: Terrific. All right, Jeff, we'll be watching you, we'll check it out, thank you so much. Jeff Brain joining us --BRAIN: Thank you for having me --BARTIROMO: From CloutHub. We will take a break, when we come back, the search for love goes public. The dating app business during the pandemic proved so profitable, Bumble is readying itself for an IPO, it's coming up right after this. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Dating apps have become a big business during the pandemic, so big that Bumble just filed for its IPO while in-person interactions might be limited, online love apparently soaring. Kristina Partsinevelos with this story now. Good morning to you, Kristina.KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS REPORTER: Good morning, Maria. What was once just about swiping right or left on attractive faces has now become more intentional and serious. You have user engagement on dating apps that have soared just over the past 9 months. Dating app Coffee Meets Bagel told Fox Business they've seen a noticeable change in dater's attitudes.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DAWOON KANG, CO-FOUNDER, COFFEE MEETS BAGEL: I think it's making daters think more seriously about dating, and approach dating more seriously. Ninety one percent of CMB daters have told us that now they're looking for long-term relationships, 68 percent of them are finding themselves being more honest about what they want with their matches.(END VIDEO CLIP)PARTSINEVELOS: Another trend is video chat, both Plenty of Fish and Coffee Meets Bagel told Fox Business they've seen singles use video dates more than ever, and with that hunt for meaningful relationships comes higher user engagement. According to Tinder, that app that made swiping really popular in the second half of 2020, they hit a record 3 billion swipes in one day. Tinder is owned by Match and we know the competition is ramping up. The dating app that encourages women to make the first move. Bumble is seeking an IPO, they're reportedly looking for a valuation anywhere between $6 billion and $8 billion. And then you've got Facebook that launched their own dating app just back in 2019. There's a slew of competition out there, but I spoke to one couple that met on a dating app called Whisper.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MARK CZERNIAK, MET FIANCEE ON DATING APP: We met in July and we started talking and we met in person, we haven't been apart since, and then I just had to be with her for the rest of my life, so I proposed and --ALESSANDRA PILEGGI, MET FIANCE ON DATING APP: Hey, I'm not a single lady anymore.(END VIDEO CLIP)PARTSINEVELOS: The dating app companies are encouraging people to leave those lonely days behind, and for some it works. That couple is planning to wed this upcoming May. Maria.BARTIROMO: I love that. That couple, best regards to that couple. Kristina, great stuff, thank you.

Good teachers + technology make a difference in rural ChinaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 11, 2021 MondayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 571 wordsBodyWhen the Chinese government made improving education a national priority, it designed the most massive educational technology intervention in history: it connected more than 100 million rural students with the best teachers in the country through recorded conferences."The effect of computer-aided learning on the long-term development of students" is a study prepared by academics from Northwestern, Fudan and Tsinghua universities, who sought to understand how the results of this policy could generate contributions to the current field.The exercise launched in 2004 allowed high-quality teachers to impart their knowledge via broadband satellite Internet to students in rural primary and secondary schools. But, for the analysis, those who were in the equivalent of fifth to eighth basic were contemplated.Using data from a massive survey applied a decade later, the researchers found that the policy positively impacted long-term variables, with results that persisted seven to ten years after the intervention.Those who exposed the program increased their educational achievement - 0.85 more years of studies - 7.2% of their graduation probability, and improved their performance in mathematics and Chinese.He also increased his labor market share, earning better wages and more prestigious positions, and were more familiar with the use of computers and the internet."We show how technology can be an effective way to bridge the gap between rural and urban areas in education. Students in rural schools are often disadvantaged because the quality of school supplies is very poor," the study concludes.Nicola Bianchi, an academic at Northwestern U. and co-author of the paper, explains that "Chinese politics was not designed to be a unique intervention. It was built to be a permanent solution to improve the quality of education in rural Chinese schools."Also, Stanford's PhD in Economics stresses that "the central government placed a lot of emphasis on politics and, as a result, local governments took it very seriously."Model to follow?The director of the Institute of Educational Informatics of the University of the Frontier, Enrique Hinostroza, highlights the masivity and follow-up that allows intervention, but proposes that it is not a role model in terms of what is generally considered quality education, "where there is much more participation and activity among students during the class".The project does not propose a way to use the computer to learn, explains the PhD at the U.U. Institute of Education in London, and clarifies that it shows a way to use technology as a channel to amplify the reach of teachers of excellence.Thus, the academic argues that "it is necessary to seriously address how to close the cognitive and digital gaps between Chilean students, not only from different geographies, but also social groups".In the face of this, it indicates that technology may be a "substantive contribution", but says that its use should be framed in a pedagogical purpose and strategy. "It's not enough to give access to technology, teachers need to have the skills to take advantage of it."Hinostroza also raises the urgency of using the internet appropriately and pertinently to teach and learn. "If we do not develop the digital skills necessary to function properly in today's global society, the possibilities for social, cultural and economic development will be seriously undermined," he warns.Load-Date: January 12, 2021End of Document

Chinese military bans Tesla cars for camera concernCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 19, 2021 FridayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 265 wordsBodyTesla Inc. cars were banned in Chinese military complexes and their housing communities due to concerns about the collection of sensitive data by vehicle-integrated cameras.The order, issued by the military, advises Tesla car owners to park their vehicles outside military property, according to people familiar with the directive who requested not to be identified because the information is private. The ban, passed on to residents of military housing this week, was triggered by concerns that the world's largest manufacturer of electric vehicles is collecting sensitive data through cameras built into cars in a way that the Chinese government cannot see or control, according to one of the people.Images of what was supposed to be a warning about the ban were also circulating on Chinese social media. Multi-direction cameras and ultrasonic sensors in Tesla cars can "expose locations" so vehicles are excluded from military residences to ensure the security of sensitive military information, as the notice.A Tesla representative in China declined to comment on the military's move. China's Ministry of Defence did not immediately respond to a fax sent after office hours.Tesla, like many other automakers, including General Motors Co., uses several small cameras, located mainly on the outside of the vehicle, to guide parking, autopilot and self-driving functions. Most Tesla models also have an interior camera mounted on the rearview mirror that can be used to detect if a driver looks at the road, looks towards their lap, wears sunglasses, or looks at something completely different.Load-Date: March 20, 2021End of Document

Faculty Slam Proposed Partnership With Chinese University Over Human Rights, Academic Freedom ViolationsCornell Daily Sun: Cornell UniversityFebruary 26, 2021 FridayUniversity WireCopyright 2021 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 1004 wordsByline: Alec GiufurtaBodyA proposed dual degree program between the School of Hotel Administration and China's Peking University is raising eyebrows among faculty concerned about engaging with a state accused of pursuing genocide in its western region and a growing record of undermining academic freedoms.The proposal came under intense rebuff before the Faculty Senate on Wednesday, which ultimately decided to postpone a sense of the Senate motion, which allows faculty to provide early feedback on University proposals.Prof. Alex Susskind, the hotel school's associate dean for academic affairs, presented the proposal at the meeting. In his opening remarks, he attempted to ease concerns of what he called "bigger picture issues" in China."Yes, there are issues and problems in that part of the world, but tourism and hospitality is one of the largest sectors in those economies," Susskind said. "Because we dominate the hospitality industry education, we want to be a part of that."Beijing faces widespread accusations of genocide over its treatment of the Uighur and other Muslim peoples. Secretary of State Antony Blinken concurred with the Trump administration's January allegation that China was committing genocide against its population.Over 1 million have been held in internment camps, and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo alleged the government engaged in forced sterilization, forced labor, torture and arbitrary imprisonment toward its Uighur population.Leaderboard 2"All of those other larger political cultural issues are, and I hate to say it, above my paygrade," Susskind said. He declined a request to comment further after the meeting.American universities, seeking revenue and a greater footprint in China, have often compromised on values of academic freedom in establishing programs. Before the proposal reached the Faculty Senate, graduate faculty at the hotel school voted to approve the proposal in March 2020.Peking University, widely considered one of the more prestigious universities in China, has a contemporary history riddled with academic freedom red flags - including firing professors with views inconsistent with the state and holding student protesters in classrooms overnight. The university recently amended its charter to secede academic control to the Chinese Communist Party. The university did respond to a request for comment.Newsletter Signup• #mc_embed_signup{background:#fff; clear:left; font:14px Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; width:100%;}/* Add your own Mailchimp form style overrides in your site stylesheet or in this style block.We recommend moving this block and the preceding CSS link to the HEAD of your HTML file. */Subscribe to our daily newsletter!Provost Michael Kotlikoff pushed the Faculty Senate to articulate "general principles" for programs, rather than question the specifics of individual programs, including the conditions in the country."We have programs in other countries in which human rights are in question," Kotlikoff said. "I strongly urge the Senate to take a more general and broader view and not hold individual programs hostage to individual concerns."The hotel school's proposed two-year dual degree program would confer graduates a master of management in hospitality from Cornell, and a master of business administration from Peking.Currently, Cornell maintains two dual degree programs and several exchange programs with Chinese universities.But for faculty at the meeting, compromising academic freedom for revenue and reach would no longer fly in the face of growing human rights abuses.Prof. Neil Saccamano, literatures in English, said he found it difficult to reconcile that the program could protect its students and faculty while "the people teaching next door can get hauled away by the Chinese government.""This seems to me a very worrisome concerning ethical problem," he continued. "I'm very concerned about the particular program with PKU, but also the more general issue of just saying genocide really isn't in our portfolio."The United States is often hesitant to label atrocities genocide - if at all. The label is considered to compel preventative action under 1948's Genocide Convention. And Cornell has a history of acting accordingly in the wake of such a declaration. In 2007, amid genocide in western Sudan, Cornell divested from assets of the Sudanese government and from oil companies in the state.In 2018, faculty in the School of Industrial and Labor Relations suspended an exchange program with Renmin University in Beijing after the school blacklisted student activists, sending them home for monitoring by national security officials.This is not the first time Cornellians have taken a stand against atrocities against the Uighur in China. In 2019, students and professors held a 'teach-in' to raise awareness on campus.Prof. Richard Bensel, government, criticized the proposal as a money-making move that placed freedoms second in an email to the government department on Wednesday."Big pictures don't go away because you ignore them or sweep them under the rug," Bensel remarked at Wednesday's meeting.Prof. Risa Lieberwitz, industrial and labor relations, raised concern over Peking University's treatment of students reporting sexual violence, and use of security forces to suppress labor activists."These are not sort of amorphous political issues," Liebowitz said.The Faculty Senate ultimately voted to push voting on a "sense of the senate" resolution to next week's meeting.In a statement to The Sun after the meeting, Kotlikoff wrote that he hopes the faculty discuss "more general" ideas that can guide specific colleges regarding existing and proposed dual degree programs."The faculty senate discussion touched on extremely important issues related to our consideration of partnerships with foreign universities," Kotlikoff wrote. "These programs ... must adhere to fundamental principles that include explicit protections of academic freedoms and prohibit discrimination against our students, as well as faculty and staff."Load-Date: February 27, 2021End of Document

Following the anti-government protests in Hong Kong, the Chinese Government and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) continue their crackdown on Hong Kong's autonomy now by imposing sweeping educational reforms."Every day it becomes more evident that Hong Kong is more controlled by the CCP," Rubio said. "The Chinese Government will stop at nothing to impose its will on Hong Kongers and undermine their long-cherished freedoms. Through the disguise of promoting patriotism, Hong Kong's government has imposed propagandistic educational guidelines. These so-called reforms make clear that the CCP's goal is to crush academic freedom in Hong Kong and begin imposing ideological uniformity on the next generation s of Hong Kongers that it has long imposed on mainland Chinese. The U.S. cannot stay silent as Beijing continues to crush Hong Kong's basic liberties. The Biden Administration must continue to hold accountable those officials linked with crushing the city's long-cherished freedoms and autonomy."Rubio is Cochair of the bipartisan and bicameral Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC) and is a member of the Subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific, and International Cybersecurity Policy.Load-Date: February 5, 2021End of Document

What if China could turn off the lights in your house?CE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 2, 2021 TuesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 661 wordsBodyA European diplomat residing in Beijing often tells an anecdote that occurred nearly a decade ago between the UK and China. While London questioned Beijing's intentions in its million-dollar investments in power grids in Europe, there was a blackout throughout Liverpool. It barely lasted a few seconds. The news didn't even take up space on the pages of the local press. But, according to the diplomat, MI6, the British Intelligence Service, showed that this power outage was caused at 7,775 kilometers in China. They interpreted it as a show of power from the Asian giant, of what they were capable of doing.Last October, there was a blackout in Mumbai, India's largest city and the financial capital of the world's fifth largest economy. For 12 hours, the buildings were out of light, as were hospitals in the midst of a coronavirus wave, and all trains were left standing. In many cities in India, blackouts are regular. But not in Bombay, which boasted of being one of the few cities that enjoyed an uninterrupted energy supply.Five months later, in India they suspect that this strange blackout was caused by a neighboring country. This Monday, several local media outlets released that officials were investigating whether China's ongoing cyberattacks could have been behind them. Maharashtra's cyber department, whose capital is Mumbai, would have "found evidence" that "groups linked to the Chinese government" would have left the more than 18 million inhabitants without light in October."Police are investigating after a preliminary report pointed to possible evidence of 14 Trojan horse programs - a 'malware' that hackers use to access the systems - embedded in the city's electrical system," Explained Anil Deshmukh,Maharashtra State Minister, at a press conference.On Saturday, a couple of days before the statements of Deshmukh, a Massachusetts (US) company called Recorded Future, which studies the use of the Internet by governments, published a report on a campaign orchestrated by a group of hackers called "RedEcho", linked to Beijing, who would have attacked India's energy sector.This would have happened a few months after several clashes between Chinese and Indian soldiers on the border they share in the Himalayas, an undemarcated area of 3,488 kilometers known as the Current Control Line (LAC). In June, at 4,200 meters high, in the Galwan Valley, one of the fights with sticks and stones ended with the deaths of 20 Indian soldiers and four Chinese.The report claims that as the confrontation continued in the Himalayas, Chinese 'malware' flowed into the control systems that manage power throughout India, along with a high-voltage transmission substation and a coal-fired power plant.Stuart Solomon, chief operating officer of Recorded Future, has explained to the New York Times that "the Chinese state-sponsored group systematically uses advanced cyber intrusion techniques to quietly entrench itself on nearly a dozen critical nodes in India's transmission and power generation infrastructure."In response, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in India wrote monday on Twitter that "speculation and manufacturing have no role to play in the issue of cyberattacks. Highly irresponsible to accuse a particular party without sufficient evidence." He also spoke on the subject at a press conference Wang Wenbin,spokesman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs: "As a staunch advocate for cybersecurity, China strongly opposes and takesvigorous action against all forms of cyberattacks."From Recorded Future they aim for cyberattacks on India to take place since the early 2020s. Weeks after the blackout in Mumbai, an Indian Energy Ministry researcher told the Mumbai Mirror newspaper that hackers would have been attacking the country's elected companies since February. "In June, a swarm of 40,000 hacking attacks by groups allegedly operating in China had used 'malware' to access and then encrypt sensitive data from public entities."Load-Date: March 3, 2021End of Document

Keynote speaker to be announced.12:30am 02:00pm ETThe Chinese Authoritarian Model and Its Global ImpactModerated by Charles Kraus.Under President Xi Jinping, several trendstechnological advancements in surveillance and big data, an institutional strengthening of the CCP, and a growing authoritarianismconverged to witness a more aggressive approach to domestic security in places such as Tibet, Hong Kong, and Xinjiang. In China's northwestern province of Xinjiang, the government has engaged in a widespread campaign of repression, mass surveillance, and detainment. In support of this effort over the past decade, China has implemented a surveillance system that combines traditional methods with high-technology such as facial recognition. With this expansion in surveillance, some analysts have identified a "China Model" of authoritarianism in opposition to liberal democracy that some warn could be exported elsewhere. Elsewhere in the world, China has begun exporting its suite of surveillance technologies to numerous countries throughout the world, an initiative that triggers some concern about negative impacts on democracy and governance. What does this approach to domestic security and surveillance mean for the international system? What does this issue indicate for the future of China and its relationships with other powers?Fellows:Darren Byler: "Chinese Technologies of Population Management on the New Silk Road"Alexander Dukalskis: "Authoritarian Image Management and PRC 'Advertorials' in Foreign Publications"Sheena Chestnut Greitens: "Assessing the Global Impact of Chinese Surveillance Technology"02:30pm 04:00pm ETGlobal Norms, Governance, and Chinese PolicymakingModerated by Robert Daly.The Chinese government adopts an increasingly assertive role in multilateral institutions, such as the United Nations, even as it founds alternate fora, like the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. It is conceivable that a stronger China will push for alterations to existing and emerging rules and norms to suit its interests. Across ungoverned spaces or areas of contested international governance, such as outer space, the deep sea, and poles, China has attempted to emerge as a global leader in norm-setting. Data policy constitutes another arena of contestation where China exerts increasing influence while advancing a competing vision of privacy and internet governance often at odds with Western models. However, Chinese policymaking does not occur in a vacuum, and a surprising history of "policy collaging" points to the oftentimes hidden outside influences on Chinese norms, legislation, and reform efforts.Fellows:Rush Doshi: "'China's New Frontiers': The Changing Geopolitics of Space, the Poles, and the Deep Sea."Wendy Leutert: "The International Origins of China's National Champions."Xiao Liu: "Understanding China's Governance Space of Personal Data"Thursday, February 410:00am 11:30am ETChina's Foreign Policy Along a Contested PeripheryModerated by Abraham Denmark.In recent years, President Xi Jinping of China has embarked upon a more assertive and active Chinese foreign policy, particularly in its own neighborhood. 2020 witnessed a deadly dispute erupt over the Line of Actual Control with India that spurred a sharp increase in India-China tensions. Shortly thereafter, the United States and India signed an important bilateral defense agreement, the BECA, which signals stronger ties in the face of rising Chinese involvement in the region. In Pakistan, China has launched the geopolitically-significant China-Pakistan Economic Corridor as part of its Belt and Road Initiative. The question of China's influence over Pakistani decision-making bears importance on India's rise and the United States' role in South Asia. Elsewhere, Taiwan is facing increasing pressure from China in the aftermath of President Tsai Ing-wen's reelection in 2020. Within this tense atmosphere, the Taiwan-Japan-United States trilateral relationship will grow increasingly important for stability in the region. Going forward, these tensions and the future of the wider region will hinge upon China's foreign policy approaches to its periphery, as well as the responses of local actors and great powers such as India, the United States, and Japan.Fellows:Christopher Colley: "An Emerging Great Power Triangle?

Of China's numerous investments, nuclear exports constitute one of the key areas with the potential for strong impact geopolitically. China's hydropower investments in Southeast Asia also have the potential to meet growing energy demand while mitigating climate change. However, they also bring challenges with cross-boundary water governance, environmental damage, and large-scale displacement of communities. Elsewhere, concerns about China's intentions and the environmental impact have forced China to deploy new discourses throughout the Global South centered on a green BRI. Is this a genuine embrace of environmentally-minded development or a clever marketing strategy? Exploring and parsing out the on-the-ground facts and bird's eye view of the BRI will expand our understanding and enable policymakers to craft effective and timely responses to this geopolitically significant effort.Fellows:Lami Kim: "Nuclear Belt and Road: China's Nuclear Exports and Its Implications for World Politics."Jessica Liao: "A Green BRI and Environmental Developmentalism?

Chinese Intentions and the Role of MisperceptionModerated by Robert Daly.Over the past four years, policy discussion on the potential for a second Cold War have expanded greatly as tensions rise in the U.S.-China relationship. Indeed, great power competition to varying degrees has become bipartisan consensus under the Trump administration. On issues ranging from trade and human rights to intellectual property and international security, the United States and China increasingly identify the other as their chief rival. However, as shown in the American experience with the People's Republic of China between 1949 and 1972, misperception and mirroring often cloud intelligence analysis and policy decision-making processes. On the other hand, American and Chinese national interests and strategic intentions are clearly divergent. On issues such as the South China Sea, China's intentions and desired end state will greatly impact the course of U.S.-China relations. Understanding the nature of the competition and its historical parallels can serve to guide policymakers and reduce the risk of escalation. To what extent are the United States and China locked into competition? Are the current tensions the result of policy choices or the natural outcome of divergent national interests?Fellows:Sara Castro: "Lop Nur and the U.S. Intelligence Gaze: Evaluating the American Intelligence Process During China's Nuclearization."Oriana Skylar Mastro: "The Heart of the Matter: Understanding Chinese Intentions in the South China Sea and Implications for U.S. Strategy."Joshua Shifrinson: "The U.S.-China Competition in Historical and Theoretical Perspective."Load-Date: January 11, 2021End of Document

China detains six people for 'insulting' soldiers killed in India border clashCNN WireFebruary 24, 2021 Wednesday 3:39 AM GMTCopyright 2021 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 658 wordsByline: By Nectar Gan, CNNDateline: (CNN) Body             China has detained at least six people for allegedly defaming four servicemen killed in a bloody border clash with India last June, as state media wages a propaganda campaign hailing the dead troops as martyrs.Police said six people were detained for up to 15 days across China, with another accused currently living overseas facing detention upon their return.Under Chinese President Xi Jinping, the government has cracked down on voices that criticize national heroes or question the official narrative about them.In 2018, China passed a law that bans people from "insulting or slandering heroes and martyrs." Originally a civil matter, the law will be made a criminal offense in an amendment to the country's criminal law, which comes into effect next month. Under that amendment, people who "insult, slander or use other means to infringe the reputation and honor of heroes and martyrs and damage the public interest of society" can be jailed for up to three years.The detentions underline Beijing's sensitivity about the border clash with India -- the deadliest between the two nuclear-armed neighbors in more than 40 years.For eight months, the Chinese military did not disclose any details on the death toll of the bloody hand-to-hand conflict with Indian troops in the Galwan Valley area in the Himalayas. New Delhi previously said at least 20 Indian soldiers died during the brawl.On Friday, China's official army newspaper revealed that four People's Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers were killed in the clash, and were given posthumous awards. A regimental commander who was seriously injured also received an award, according to the report.In an ensuing propaganda campaign, Chinese state media outlets rushed to eulogize the five PLA soldiers for their loyalty, valor and sacrifice, publishing lengthy, emotive reports on their life stories.State media also published Beijing's account of the event, blaming Indian troops for violating an agreement with China and crossing the border into the Chinese side to set up tents. According to the PLA Daily, the Chinese side was at first outnumbered by Indian troops who attacked with steel tubes, clubs and rocks. But as PLA reinforcements arrived, they eventually "defeated" the Indian soldiers and chased them away.The Indian military has not responded to CNN's request for comment. Delhi has previously blamed Beijing for the skirmish.However, not every Chinese citizen is convinced by Beijing's account of the incident.On Friday morning, a popular blogger with 2.5 million followers on China's Twitter-like Weibo raised questions over the official death toll, suggesting the real figure might be higher than four. "This is why India dares to publicize the number and names of their casualties, because from India's point of view, they won with a smaller cost," he wrote.By the evening, police in the eastern city of Nanjing had detained the blogger, identified by his surname Qiu, for "picking quarrels and provoking trouble" -- an offense commonly used by the Chinese government to target dissent and criticism.Writing on its official Weibo account Saturday, the Nanjing police claimed that Qiu had "distorted the truth" and "caused extremely abominable impact on society," adding that he had confessed to his "unlawful act."Weibo said on Friday evening it had shut down Qiu's account, which he used to post the remarks, as well as an additional account he owns.According to police, four Weibo users in total were detained for their posts or comments on other people's posts. Two others were detained for their comments in group chats on WeChat, China's popular messaging app, after other group members reported them to the police. The other person was caught by the internet police in an "online patrol" after he posted on his personal WeChat feed.                      By Nectar Gan, CNN         TM & © 2021 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Elon Musk's love-in with China may be over as regulators go after TeslaCNN WireFebruary 9, 2021 Tuesday 10:35 AM GMTCopyright 2021 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1016 wordsByline: By Laura He, CNN BusinessDateline: (CNN) Body             Elon Musk's Tesla spent the last couple of years trying to win over China in a bid to conquer the world's largest car market. Now the company risks upsetting Beijing's powerful regulators.The electric carmaker has been summoned by five Chinese regulatory agencies to answer questions about the quality of its Shanghai-made Model 3 cars, according to a statement released Monday by the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR).It said regulators were concerned aboutseveral  problems with the cars, including "abnormal acceleration" and "battery fires."The meeting is troubling for Tesla. Thanks to Musk's courting of officials, Tesla had managed to avoid cumbersome restraints imposed on global rivals trying to do business in China. The company opened one of its massive car factories in 2019 to great fanfare in Shanghai, and the country now accounts for a fifth of its revenue.But for the past few weeks, Tesla has been heavily criticizedwithin China for a series of problems involving its cars, culminating in Monday's announcement."[We will] deeply reflect on the company's operational shortcomings and comprehensively strengthen self-inspection," Tesla said in a statement posted on Chinese social media website Weibo in response to SAMR's remarks."We will strictly abide by Chinese laws and regulations and always respect consumer rights," the carmaker said, adding that it will "better contribute to the healthy development of China's new energy vehicle market."It's not clear whether regulators intend to punish Tesla or change anything about the way it operates in the country. But the controversy is a sign of just how seriously Beijing takes regulation, even among companies that it appears to favor."It's a slippery slope for Musk," said Dan Ives, a technology analyst at Wedbush Securities. The CEO "had built strong relationships within the country, but he must play nice in the sandbox in China."Strong supportTesla has been in China since 2013, but in the past few years it has established a strong relationship with the Chinese government.When the carmaker was negotiating terms with authorities in 2017 for the construction of its Shanghai Gigafactory, it managed to retain complete control - an unusual arrangement, since its peers were typically required to partner with Chinese firms if they wanted to set up a local business at that time. (China announced in 2018 that it would ease up on the automotive sector's rules on foreign ownership by 2022.)Since then, Tesla has enjoyed strong government support. It was the only foreign manufacturer without a local partner to win a big tax break for its cars in 2019. The company also resumed production quickly during the coronavirus pandemic in part thanks to local government support.Musk has also won over authorities and Chinese citizens alike, and is a welcomed guest in the country. He famously danced on stage during the debut of the Shanghai-made Model 3 early last year, which went viral on Weibo. Premier Li Keqiang once even said he would be happy to give Musk a "China green card" after the American entrepreneur said he "loves China very much."Tesla's inroads into China have paid off. The company sold $6.66 billion worth of cars in China last year, contributing 21% of its revenue, according to a recent company filing. That's more than doubled what it sold in 2019, when it had not yet started making cars there.A souring perceptionBut inrecent months, the perception of Tesla in China has begun to turn sour. Last November, state news agency Xinhua attacked the company after one of its attorneys wrote to US regulators about a recall in China, blaming "driver abuse.""Tesla passed the buck to the Chinese users' driving habits and regulatory pressure," wrote Xinhua's Nan Chen in an opinion piece published in Liaowang, a magazine run by the news agency. "This kind of 'Tesla-style arrogance' can't be tolerated."Criticism escalated last month after a video went viral in China that appeared to show a Tesla employee telling a customer that an overload in the state power grid causeda charging accident thatdamaged the car.A local branch of the power company in charge of the grid denied it was to blame, and told Tesla that it should "carefully find out the cause" of the car's problems.Tesla wrote on its Weibo account last week that the video had been edited and that the employee provided "several possible factors" for the car's issues. Even so, the company apologized."We are deeply sorry, regarding the misunderstanding caused to netizens and the trouble" caused to power authorities, the company said.State media outlets, though, piled on after the power grid incident. Xinhua earlier this month blasted Tesla once more for its "arrogant attitude," accusing the company of  "passing the buck again."The Global Times, a state-owned tabloid, also took the company to task."Though Tesla is arguably the US company most active in investing in China, the Silicon Valley-born carmaker is far from understanding Chinese consumers, as seen by its attitude in a series of scattered accident reports including explosions, drivers losing control and faulty brakes," read an article published by the Global Times.Other challengesRegulatory pressure is not Tesla's only challenge in China moving forward.The company was the best-selling electric vehicle brand in the country last year, with 135,400 Model 3s sold, according to the China Passenger Car Association.But competition is getting fierce. BYD unseated Tesla as China's top selling electric car brand last month, and other automakers like Nio, Geely and Xpeng are trying to close in.While China has welcomed Tesla so far, experts point out that ultimately Beijing has its own ambitions to lead in tech and other fields. In other words: Once homegrown companies are competitive, the country doesn't have much need for foreign firms anymore.<em>-- CNN's Beijing bureau contributed to this report.</em>                      By Laura He, CNN Business         TM & © 2021 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

WeChat, a Chinese star app that combines WhatsApp and FacebookCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 14, 2021 ThursdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 576 wordsBodyThey are totally Made in China and several of them are already among the most impactable in the world; together they have more than 3 billion users and are the equivalent or have the functions of Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, WhatsApp and Instagram, banned in the Asian giant, that with WeChat, Sina Weibo, Youku, QQ or Douban, among others, has its own versions of the most popular social networks in the Western world, although always under the watchful eye of the government.m{1189934}Some of them are multipurpose, like WeChat, China's flagship app that is the equivalent of WhatsApp, but also with Facebook features. At the beginning of this year it has a thousand 206 million users and is located as the fifth most impacted social network globally, according to a report by the consultancy iLifeBelt. The network created by tech giant Tencent offers free call and messaging services, as well as an online payment system through WeChat Pay, among other services.The second most popular network is Sina Weibo, the "Chinese Twitter", which has 523 million users. Located 10th in iLifeBelt's top ten, this microblogging website also features Facebook features.Sina Weibo has not escaped the censorship of the Chinese government; from March 31 to April 3, 2012, their services were suspended on the grounds of avoiding rumors of a coup in the country, and that same year the mandatory registration of the real names of microblog users was established with the Chinese government.If we have YouTube in the West, China is Youku and iQIYI, online video platforms that have expanded significantly in recent years; the second is known as the "Chinese Netflix" and has more than 500 million active users. It was released in 2010 by Baidu, the most important search engine, similar to Google, in the country.QQ, the equivalent of MSN Messenger, ranks sixth in the iLifeBelt ranking. This multipurpose app offers instant messaging service and features online games, music, shopping, movies and voice chat.m{1189935}While TikTok is from China, there is the local version, Douyin, which has 600 million users and ranks ninth in the most important networks in the iLifeBelt report. What makes the big difference with its Western "sister" is that Asian is much more advanced in e-commerce because from the app you can make purchases and reservations, among other things.Contrary to what might be thought due to Instagram's success on this side of the world, its Chinese version is not very popular and was even born amid the controversy as Lvzhou, by Sina Weibo, began in early 2019, but was discharged due to the alleged plagiarism of his logo. It eventually solved the incident and operates normally, albeit with little success.What has become a sensation, especially among young people, is Douban, a forum-like social network that allows users to record information and create content related to movies, books, music, recent events and activities in Chinese cities. Its features bring together formats from platforms such as Spotify, Pinterest and Twitter, and it has become very popular also among writers, academics and intellectuals.While these are the most popular social networks, there are many more that are allowed by the Chinese government under its own rules, which have been questioned by international human rights organizations, which accuse Beijing of monitoring and monitoring, through these applications, its more than 400 million inhabitants.m{1189933}Load-Date: January 15, 2021End of Document

Wonderful news that fills us with great hope. Soon we will start mass vaccination of our people," Maduro wrote on his Twitter account.The representative accompanied the message of a photo of a plane from Venezuelan state airline Conviasa, although he did not detail which vaccine has arrived in Venezuela from the various ones made in China.MADURO THANKS XI FOR SHIPPINGIn another subsequent message, he thanked "on behalf of the people of Venezuela", the President of China, Xi Jinping, "for his unwavering spirit of cooperation and solidarity" towards the Caribbean country."The Chinese vaccine will reinforce the immunization process we started in the country," he stressed.A few hours before the plane was landed, the Maduro Executive had announced Sinopharm's authorization to immunize his country's population against COVID-19, thus becoming the second vaccine approved by the Caribbean nation after Russian Sputnik V."Venezuela has approved the use of the Chinese Sinopharm vaccine to immunize the Venezuelan people against COVID-19. Thanks to China-Venezuela cooperation we serve the health and life of our people," the Ministry of Health said in a message on their Twitter social network account.In October last year, Maduro had noted that one of the four Chinese vaccines that were being developed at the time would be tested in Venezuela, although he did not specify which of them it would be.By then, Chinese vaccines from Sinovac, Sinopharm, Wuhan Institute of Biological Products and Cansino Biologics were in clinical trials.The representative promised that, as soon as the trials were completed, the vaccine would be applied to the population for "free" use.A DONATION FROM CHINAAt Maiquetía Airport, which serves Caracas, Executive Vice President Delcy Rodríguez received the plane where the vaccines arrived and stressed that it is a donation from China that "joins Venezuela's vaccination plan"."A plan where we have prioritized the health sector and, with these vaccines, we will continue to address this special sector that is at the front row of the battle against COVID-19," he stressed.With the doses received from China, he clarified, teachers will be able to be incorporated into the vaccination plan before students return to schools next April."We will also address security personnel. Very important the donation of the Chinese government to Venezuela," he said."Inputs for the ATTACK on COVID-19" also arrived on the aircraft, as well as PCR tests, medicines and other products for hospitals, he said.Last February 17, Maduro said he hoped to be able to start mass vaccination of the population in April and have vaccines from Russia, China, Cuba and the Covax mechanism, a global collaborative initiative that seeks to accelerate the development of COVID-19 treatments, tests and prevention methods.His statement arose after Venezuela received the first 100,000 doses of The Russian Sputnik V, out of a total of ten million agreed with that country, and by then indicated that the National Institute of Hygiene was evaluating the rest of the vaccines.Since the beginning of the pandemic, Venezuela has maintained an air bridge with China through which medicines and equipment have arrivedprotection to address the pandemic-derived health crisis.(With EFE information)MORE ON THIS TOPIC:Vaccines to conquer the world: China and Russia's strategies to increase their power in developing countriesWhat the two COVID-19 vaccines will look like that will be ready in the second half of 2021They demand that the Government of Bolsonaro impose a curfew in Brazil to prevent the collapse of the hospital networkLoad-Date: March 3, 2021End of Document

Biden suspends sale of TikTok and allows it to remain in Chinese handsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 11, 2021 ThursdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 612 wordsBodyThe case over the sale of TikTok took a new course. U.S. President Joe Biden indefinitely suspended his sale demanded last year by Donald Trump calling the app a risk to national security.Biden decides in this way to take a step back with the process driven by the former president. The argument for the whole scandal was that the Chinese communist government sought to collect personal data from U.S. citizens.Commerce left it in a statement last year. "The Chinese Communist Party has shown that it has the means and intent to use these applications to threaten U.S. national security, foreign policy, and economy," he said.Now the new administration is reviewing the security of the data and information TikTok collects about U.S. users, but there will be no imminent move to force the sale, The Wall Street Journal said.In short, the U.S. representative allows the application, with a range of 123 million downloads in the U.S., to remain in the hands of Chinese technology company ByteDance.Frustrated saleThere was a preliminary agreement so that the application could continue to operate in the U.S. Oracle and Walmart partnered with ByteDance within the new company TikTok Global. U.S. giants acquired a combined 20% stake.The agreement cited by the DW portal also stipulated that TikTok Global "will be the majority property of U.S. investors, including Oracle and Walmart", which will be an independent U.S. company, headquartered in the U.S. country and with four Americans among the five board members.In September 2020 Trump approved this agreement, a day earlier the U.S. Department of Commerce had announced a ban on downloads of Chinese TikTok and WeChat apps from the Google (Play Store) and Apple (App Store) operating systems.However, while the agreement allowed the application to continue operating, a decree issued in August 2020 requiring its sale passed on. As a condition, the buyer had to be American and "demonstrate his will and ability to comply with this decree."The dangers of Chinese appsDonald Trump was warning of the dangers of this social network. The data, allegedly collected by the Chinese Communist Party, allowed them to spinning fine into their objectives. And so China could "track the locations of federal employees and contractors, create records of personal information for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage," an order prohibiting doing business with ByteDance, the application's Chinese developer.The WeChat app received for the same measurements. It could no longer be downloaded by traditional operating systems and no business could be done with Chinese technology company Tencent.This app has more than 1.2 billion users worldwide according to the Statista portal and is a Simile of Whatsapp in China (the communist regime does not allow the American application). The Chinese government's meddling in Wechat is almost an open secret."The law in China gives the authorities the power to require different types of data. Logically, we have to comply with the law," a Tencent employee told El País in 2018."In countries like the United States or those in the European Union, a court order is necessary, but a call from security agents is enough in China," he added.By May 2020, a report by Citizen Lab, a security research group at the University of Toronto, showed how WeChat closely monitors the activity ofusers outside mainland China."At any time, but especially during the pandemic, when we rely on technology as lifeguards, I think it is imperative that the companies that provide those services are transparent about what they do with our data," Ron Deibert, the group's director, told The Wall Street Journal.Load-Date: February 12, 2021End of Document

H&M continues with first quarter losses and comes out to restore confidence with China after boycott on social mediaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 31, 2021 WednesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 538 wordsBodySwedish textile chain Hennes & Mauritz (H&M) closed the first quarter with a net loss of US$ 123 million, according to the financial report released onWednesday. The operating result was also negative at about $176 million.This is explained by the lower sales produced by the restrictive measures imposed in the markets where it operates, where 36% of its network of stores, representing some 1,800, suffered temporary closures. As of March it kept 1,500 stores closed, 30% of the total."It's been a year since he struck with all the force of the pandemic. I am deeply impressed and proud of the fantastic commitment and customer focus of all our colleagues during a very challenging time. While it is still largely about managing the negative effects of recurring store closures, it is clear that they appreciate our offer. When markets were allowed to open, in-store sales recovered while online sales continued to develop  very well," said H&M CEO Helena Helmersson.The company's sales fell by 21% in the period ended February 28. These were US$ 4,577 million, although revenue generated through the online channel grew by 57%. In chile's case the fall was similar to around 22%, reaching revenues of US$ 52 million, while between January and March 2020 the figure was US$ 64 million.The results of the first quarter have led H&M to delay its decision on dividend distribution, which was scheduled for the May shareholders' meeting. "The company's financial position remains strong and management's view is that there will be good prospects for handing out a cash dividend in the fall of 2021. However, since it is not possible right now to have a complete perspective on the consequences of the pandemic, a dividend will not be proposed at the next meeting in May," the company said in a statement. Situation with ChinaDuring the reporting of its results, H&M was willing to collaborate with customers and business partners in China to regain confidence in the wake of the boycott suffered in china, such as product recall and store closure.H&M was one of the first Western firms to be affected after it was known that last year it had rejected the use of cotton from the Xinjiang region, after allegations of human rights violations and forced labour were known, which have been rejected by the Chinese government."We are dedicated to regaining the trust of customers, colleagues and business partners in China. By collaborating with our partners we believe we can take joint steps to develop the fashion industry, serve customers and act in a responsible manner," he said in a statement.The Swedish firm said it does "everything" to meet the challenges and finda way forward, because China "is a very important market and we have a strong and long-term commitment in the country."The fashion chain declared it "proud" of its suppliers and was willing to be "a responsible buyer", while en ensured that it works on strategies on obtaining raw materials. "We want to work with all stakeholders to be a part of the solution and together build a more sustainable fashion industry," the writing said.H&M stressed that it follows local laws in the markets in which it is present and alluded to the importance of trust and dialogue.Load-Date: April 1, 2021End of Document

As part of their trade war, China and the U.S. press for "rare earths"CE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 21, 2021 SundayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 951 wordsBodyIn the more or less overlapping dispute that the United States and China have maintained in recent years for international leadership, last week gained space in the world's media an issue that has been gaining relevance from the hand of the technological revolution: so-called "rare earths."The Chinese government's alleged interest in knowing whether restricting the sale of rare earths to the U.S. could affect F-35 fighter production sounded alarms across the West, which largely depends on its technology and defense industries for China's provision of that element.China is the world's largest exporter of rare earths, a set of 17 elements used in cell phones, lasers, superconductors and fighters (such as the F-35), among other applications, and controls approximately 80% of the world's supply of these minerals. Something Beijing could use as a lever against the West. Although this could be a boomerang, because it could prompt other countries to search for and exploit their own rare earths.The United States itself launched a schedule to increase production capacity,which could be "very, very short" with more government support and industry innovation, according to Pini Althaus, chief executive of USA Rare Earth, a mining company that is developing the Round Top rare earth depot. Texas."Writing has been on the wall for decades, and now we're seeing firsthand why we've been sounding the alarm that China's dominance over the rare earth and critical minerals industry is a highly volatile geopolitical concern," Althaus said in pressstatements, adding, "To counter the Chinese government's effort to stop the defense and high-tech industries, the United States and its allies must continue to invest in this space."Although between 1960 and 1980 the United States was the leading country in the production of these elements, between 2014 and 2017 China went on to occupy that strategic place, according to the website 20minutos.es.Former President Donald Trump last year signed an executive order to expand and strengthen national mining of rare earths and other critical minerals, after nearly a year and a half of trade and tariff tensions with China."The United States now imports 80% of its rare earth elements directly from China, and parts of the rest come indirectly from China through other countries," Trump said in the executive order. "In the 1980s, the United States produced more of these elements than any other country in the world, but China used aggressive economic practices to strategically flood the global rare earth element market and displace its competitors," he added.Last year, a bipartisan group of House and Senate lawmakers also put forward proposals to reduce U.S. dependence on China by providing tax incentives for the rare earth industry in different areas of the U.S. territory.Current President Joe Biden, during his election campaign, pledged to "accelerate innovation in supply chain resilience" and address "issues such as dependence on rare earth minerals."This is not the first time China has used these rare earth exports as a pressure resource, the Spanish medium points out, which recalls that in 2010 Beijing limited its export to Japan by a maritime conflict, to which Tokyo responded by boosting a large investment in R&D; to develop substitute goods and diversify its suppliers, among which its suppliers are currentlyVietnam and India count, which should come as no surprise, as while China accumulates 37% of rare earth reserves, Vietnam (like Brazil) owns 18%. In this sense, a unusual proposal by former President Trump to "buy" Greenland had precisely to do with the large reserves of rare earth that island would have.  Leadership  Carles Brasó Broggi, researcher at the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya interviewed by 20minutos.es noted that "these measures are yet another element of the trade war that exists between the two powers. This conflict may enter a less aggressive stage, thanks to the new Biden administration, but commercial tension is likely to be maintained due to the fundamental competition between the two on the high-tech ground."The Trump administration had already imposed vetoes on Chinese companies such as Huawei, ZTE or Xiaomi and also limited the export of sophisticated U.S. semiconductors to China, as part of the trade contest but also with a medium-term strategic interest, to regain for the US the first place in the production of cutting-edge technologies.In that press for global dominance, China now wants to primarily punish Defense-linked U.S. companies, such as Boeing, Lockheed Martin, or Raytheon, that do business with Taiwan (the former nationalist China). For example, the manufacture of an F-35 fighter needs an average of 417 kilos of rare earths.Due, among other issues, to china's relative dependence, the Pentagon began signing contracts with U.S. and Australian miners in recent months to diversify sources of supply.  Opportunity  As BAE Negocios will point out in a timely manner, in this global context Argentina may face a great opportunity to position themselves as an actor in that market. In 2014, the Argentine Mining Geological Service (Segemar) confirmed the existence of reservoirs of "rare earths" in Valle Fértil, Province of San Juan, while in parallel an official study detected concentrations of cerium and tantalum, two of those much-sought after minerals in different areas of chaco.Also in the provinces of Mendoza, Salta, Jujuy, San Luis and Santiago del Estero are possible reservoirs of rare earths ready to be commercially exploited, something that with the corresponding environmental care could place the country at the forefront of a new non-traditional export,Load-Date: February 22, 2021End of Document

I'M A TRUMP REPUBLICAN. HERE'S WHY I WENT TO JOE BIDEN'S WHITE HOUSEStates News ServiceMarch 23, 2021 TuesdayCopyright 2021 States News ServiceLength: 1074 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the office of Pennsylvania Rep. John Joyce:In the Harrisburg Patriot-News, Congressman John Joyce, M.D. (PA-13) wrote about overcoming partisan divides to find common ground on creating American jobs for American workers. During a recent meeting with President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and bipartisan congressional leaders, Dr. Joyce addressed the growing threats posed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to America's economy and national security.Dr. Joyce continues to advocate to bring the manufacturing of items, from vital technology and defense weapon systems to essential medicines, back home to America and far away from the CCP. As he told President Biden during their Oval Office meeting, Pennsylvania workers depend on secure and resilient supply chains. Read Dr. Joyce's full op-ed here.I'm a Trump Republican. Here's why I went to Joe Biden's White HouseRep. John Joyce, M.D.March 23, 2021Some people were surprised when President Joe Biden invited me to the Oval Office for a meeting although I was not. From the campaign trail to the halls of Congress, the president and I have been vocal about our conflicting ideological convictions. We share little in common, least of all our voting records. But, when it comes to creating jobs for our fellow Pennsylvanians, we are on the same team.For too long, hardworking Pennsylvanians watched American companies and their jobs flee our commonwealth for China. Our manufacturing industry bore the cost of mounting regulations and families paid the price. This devastating cycle spurred widespread ramifications in local communities and across the country.To correct course, the United States must prioritize pragmatic solutions to end the Chinese Communist Party's grip on manufacturing and return family-sustaining jobs back home. It's no small feat. Right now, the Chinese government controls many of the materials used in the production of vital items from pharmaceuticals and medical devices to technology and defense weapon systems.As I discussed with President Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and a small group of bipartisan congressional leaders, resilient and secure supply chains are the key to Pennsylvania's success in the 21st century.In many cases, this big problem comes down to a tiny chip. As technology continues to advance, semiconductors are an increasingly integral piece of our manufacturing capacity. Chips are a central component in everything from cellphones and laptops to autonomous vehicles. The pandemic-era shift to working from home and subsequent technology demand have incited a global semiconductor shortage that is likely to create major economic consequences for consumers and workers alike.Despite Americans' reliance on chips, nearly 90 percent of the world's semiconductors are produced outside of the United States. To secure our supply chains and ensure that they can withstand global interruptions, we must restore semiconductor manufacturing back to America and to our allies. As one achievable solution, I supported bipartisan, bicameral legislation to incentivize chip manufacturing on American soil, creating jobs and strengthening our national security.Another step is prioritizing the mining of rare earth metals that are used to produce semiconductors in mineral-rich Pennsylvania and similar regions. China currently dominates this crucial industry and monopolizes the supply chain. The previous administration began groundbreaking work to source rare earth metals from coal and coal ash, valuable products of our commonwealth's energy legacy. To end our dependence on the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), the United States must continue to invest in innovation that will equip our nation's capacity to capture and process these minerals domestically.Securing our supply chains not only will safeguard our economy, but also will protect our public health. In addition to the vulnerability of relying on medical devices made in China, the pandemic has revealed the urgent need to ensure that America can produce an essential supply of medicines. As I told President Biden, the American people can no longer be beholden to the CCP for generic antibiotics and other widely used pharmaceuticals. Now more than ever, we must act.Last year on the China Task Force, I helped to develop more than 400 bipartisan and achievable solutions to counter the CCP and equip Americans to lead in global innovation. Now, it's time to put to our playbook to use.While the CCP has been exerting undue influence for decades, the COVID-19 pandemic exposed this hostile regime's growing threat to the American people, our national security, and our way of life. The clock is ticking.Like many Pennsylvanians, I recognize that the daunting path ahead requires teamwork. I stepped into President Biden's office with a plan to overcome barriers and to create jobs at home in Pennsylvania.Though America is divided east and west, rural and urban, red and blue we are one nation. Together, as a united front, we must take the steps today to equip Americans to lead the innovation of tomorrow. Despite our differences, we're playing on the same team.***As the only physician on the China Task Force, Dr. Joyce is a leader in Congress' work to secure America's supply chains. In September 2020, the China Task Force released a report with more than 400 realistic and achievable solutions to confront the growing threat of the Chinese Communist Party, strengthen our national security, protect American values, and secure our place in international leadership for years to come.The China Task Force's comprehensive strategy addresses issues ranging from securing the medical and national security supply chain to exposing human rights abuses and combating Chinese government-sponsored interference in American institutions. As part of this strategy, Dr. Joyce led legislation to return the mining and production of vital minerals home to America, to combat Chinese interference in American higher educational institutions, and to prevent future biothreats by prohibiting further manipulation of the human genome.Congressman Joyce represents the 13th District of Pennsylvania, which includes ten counties across central and western Pennsylvania. Before taking office in 2019, Dr. Joyce practiced medicine in his community for more than 25 years.Read Dr. Joyce's full op-ed in the Harrisburg Patriot-News.###Load-Date: March 23, 2021End of Document

Chinese editor calls British politician 'deranged' after Olympic boycott callUPIFebruary 16, 2021 Tuesday 2:25 PM ESTCopyright 2021 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 317 wordsByline: ELIZABETH SHIMDateline: Feb. 16 BodyTension is escalating between British politicians calling for a boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing and Chinese state media representatives warning of retaliation.Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of Chinese state tabloid Global Times, said Tuesday on Chinese platform Weibo that any nation boycotting the 2022 Winter Games should be punished with sanctions. He also referred to Ed Davey, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, as a "mentally deranged" person."As the hosting nation, to sanction a country ruining the Olympics, China would be doing justice on behalf of the heavens," Hu said.Hu previously proposed sanctions after senior British politicians proposed British Olympians skip the event next year to protest human rights abuses. Davey had said Chinese sanctions would undermine Beijing's global status after Hu's initial remarks.The current dispute began after Davey said the British government should act after the BBC reported on systemic rape of ethnic Uighur women in Chinese concentration camps."The evidence that a genocide is now occurring in western China is so clear that the United Kingdom and the whole world must now stand up to Beijing and use every available tool to stop it," Davey had said in early February, according to The Guardian.Hu said Tuesday that politicians who call for a boycott are "evil forces" that must be punished."The Chinese people will certainly stand firmly behind the Chinese government and its [potential] sanctions," Hu said. "People of the world will surely support China."Hu has also opposed a stimulus check plan, but his recent statement is being ridiculed on social media app Clubhouse, where Chinese mainlanders can freely express their opinions through virtual private networks.Netizens mocked Hu after he had said, "If our country hands out money to everybody, it means it doesn't send out money at all," according to Nikkei Asia on Tuesday.Load-Date: February 16, 2021End of Document

The Shenzhen Component Index also slumped 2.4%, or 372.59 points, to 14,870.66.Sentiment in the local equities market remained weak after US Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer directed lawmakers in the US to start drafting a bill to "out-compete" China's economic strength, particularly in semiconductors."We cannot rely on foreign processors for the chips. We cannot let China get ahead of us in chip production," Schumer told reporters in a press conference overnight.Adding to the downbeat sentiment was the Canadian parliament's passage of a motion saying the Chinese government carries out "genocide" in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. Canada's move drew the ire of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, with spokesman Wang Wenbin telling reporters that the action "deliberately smeared China and seriously violated international law and basic norms governing international relations."Wang warned that China "will firmly respond to any action that undermines its interests" as Canada's action "interfered" in China's internal affairs.In corporate news, Great Wall Motor's (SHA:601633, HKG:2333) Shanghai-listed shares fell 5.9% at close after Indian news media outlet New Delhi Television reported that government sources denied reports that the country is set to clear investment proposals from Chinese entities including that of the Chinese carmaker.Great Wall had earlier said that it is planning to pump $1 billion in India over the next few years, with plans to purchase General Motors' India car plant in a deal worth around $250 million to $300 million.Load-Date: February 24, 2021End of Document

China has since refuted the report, with the State Administration for Market Regulation saying "if it's not there [on our website], it's not [true]."Shares of Alibaba fell 2% on Monday.(Market Chatter news is derived from conversations with market professionals globally.

Xiaomi and other Chinese companies slapped with US restrictions as Trump's term winds downCNN WireJanuary 15, 2021 Friday 9:08 AM GMTCopyright 2021 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 687 wordsDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  The Trump administration is inflicting even more damage on Chinese businesses --- including smartphone maker Xiaomi --- with just days to go before President-elect Joe Biden takes office. The US Defense Department on Thursday added nine Chinese firms, including Xiaomi, to a list of companies the agency claims are owned or controlled by China's military. Businesses on the list are subject to harsh restrictions, including a ban on American investment.The addition is worrisome news for Xiaomi, which recently surpassed Apple to become the world's third largest smartphone maker, according to market intelligence firm IDC. The company's stock plunged more than 10% in Hong Kong on Friday. The Pentagon's list also included the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac), a major, state-owned Chinese plane maker that the country wants to build up as an alternative to Boeing and Airbus.The Defense Department said in a statement that it is "determined to highlight and counter" the relationship between China's military and firms that "appear to be civilian entities" but which support the military with advanced technology and expertise.Beijing on Friday blasted the new restrictions as an abuse of power by the United States.American industry has a "long history" of civil-military relationships, Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told reporters at a regular press briefing, accusing the Trump administration of "double standards" and "bullying."The US Commerce Department also put CNOOC, China's largest offshore oil producer, on another list that effectively cuts it off from American supplies and technology. The company was already on the Defense Department's list. "CNOOC acts as a bully for the People's Liberation Army to intimidate China's neighbors," said Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in a statement, referring to the country's military. His agency claimed that CNOOC has been harassing and threatening offshore oil and gas exploration in the South China Sea by other countries, such as Vietnam.Xiaomi denied it was owned or controlled by the Chinese military in a stock exchange filing. "The company confirms that it is not owned, controlled or affiliated with the Chinese military, and is not a 'Communist Chinese Military Company' defined under the [National Defense Authorization Act]," it said in the statement.Xiaomi added that it will "take appropriate course of actions" to protect the interests of the company and its shareholders. CNN Business has also reached out to CNOOC, Comac and other companies added to the US government lists on Thursday, but has yet to receive a response.The moves are the latest in a slew of actions the Trump administration has taken against Beijing in the weeks leading up to Biden's inauguration, and could complicate US-China relations for the incoming government. "The new administration will likely not be as belligerent but may also not be as willing to unwind Trump-era policies as many might hope," Jeffrey Halley, senior market strategist for Asia Pacific at Oanda, wrote in a research note on Friday.The Hang Seng Tech Index, which tracks the performance of Chinese tech stocks, fell 1.4%. Xiaomi was the worst performer on the index on Friday. The ban will cause "immediate selling pressure" on Xiaomi's stock, but will have little impact on the company's operations, analysts from Citi said in a research report on Friday.Before Thursday, the Pentagon had already added 35 Chinese companies to its military list, including chipmaker SMIC and tech firm Huawei. The Commerce Department has also imposed restrictions on many companies. (SMIC has denied that it has a relationship with the Chinese military, while Huawei has denied various US allegations that it poses a risk to national security.)The New York Stock Exchange also announced last week that it would delist three Chinese telecom company stocks to comply with US President Donald Trump's executive order banning American investment in certain companies.TM & © 2021 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

"My amendment ensures that none of the funding in this bill, and particularly none of the $10 billion in the International Affairs funding, goes to entities owned by the Chinese government or the CCP."While there was no public information available on how the majority came to its decision, Barr's amendment was one of those dismissed by the Committee on Friday. No known funds for the stimulus package have been earmarked for organizations with known ties to the CCP to date.Barr confirmed on social media that his amendment was voted down, adding that relief dollars should be protected from diversion to entities owned by the CCP."A relief bill should be targeted to help American workers and our economy. Not a liberal wishlist that is soft on China," Barr said.The RulingTrue.The Democratic majority voted no to a Republican amendment to the COVID-19 stimulus bill meant to block funds from going to entities with ties to the CCP.No known funds for the stimulus package have been earmarked for organizations with known ties to the CCP to date.Link to ImageGraphic Andy Barr on Green New DealAndy Barr on Green New DealLoad-Date: March 2, 2021End of Document

Mendix Enables Chinese Businesses to Succeed in Digital Transformation with World's Premier Low-Code Software Development Platform; - Mendix, part of Siemens Digital Industries Software, makes its formal debut in ChinaPR NewswireJanuary 19, 2021 Tuesday 4:00 AM ESTCopyright 2021 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1863 wordsDateline: BOSTON, Jan. 19, 2021 BodyPR Newswire Mendix, a Siemens business and global leader in low-code application development for the enterprise, has announced the introduction of its world-class platform to the Chinese market. The Mendix low-code platform brings tremendous advantages to Chinese enterprises seeking to accelerate their digital transformation in response to competitive pressures and new ways of doing business, both of which have been accelerated by the global pandemic. Siemens' longstanding, extensive presence in China will give Mendix significant advantages in access to customers, resources, and expertise as it brings its platform into one of the world's top technology markets.Mendix is a recognized low-code leader and visionaryMendix low-code is a powerful software platform that enables both professional and citizen developers to create enterprise-grade applications more than 10x faster than traditional development, using drag-and-drop components and model-driven logic through an intuitive graphical user interface. Its cloud-native, microservices-based architecture delivers unprecedented agility, flexibility, and scalability for digitalization projects of every size and scope.As the industry's first"all-in-one" low-code platform, Mendix is at the heart of a holistic development ecosystem that seamlessly integrates data and innovative technologies including artificial intelligence, augmented reality, IoT, and other advanced capabilities. Enterprises from startups to major multinational corporations across America, Europe, the Middle East, and beyond are using the Mendix platform to update core legacy systems and deliver innovative new capabilities to internal and external customers. Among Mendix's tier one clients are Continental, Zurich Insurance, ConocoPhillips, the Municipality of Dubai, and NS, the Netherlands' high-speed rail operator.Even prior to its launch, Mendix has attracted customers in China, including SAIC Motor, CIMC Vehicles, and Maxnerva Technology Services.Chen Jun, senior IT manager of SAIC Motor, one of China's largest automobile manufacturers, says: "Focusing on SAIC Motor's '1+4' digital transformation strategy of its passenger vehicles business, we use the Mendix enterprise-level low-code development platform to create lean manufacturing human resource management applications and ultimately achieve reduction of single-vehicle labor costs. This project covers more than 10,000 employees across four major domestic sites of SAIC Motor Passenger Cars; shortens development time by 50%; reduces deployment and maintenance costs by 30%; and achieves two major breakthroughs in business: 1) The first close collaboration of significance between business and IT teams to develop and integrate a big data platform architecture that has applications for future scenarios; 2) Allows SAIC Passenger Vehicles to go from managing month/day cycles down to the hour in its human resources lean management application, achieving significant digitalization of the entire business process and reaching a leading level in the automotive industry in China and even the world."CIMC Vehicles is a manufacturer of high-quality semi-trailers using Mendix to drive its intelligent manufacturing capabilities. Dr. Li Xiaofu, CTO of CIMC Vehicles, says: "Through the practices of vehicle certification systems, we have gained a deeper understanding with regards to the knowledge and positioning of Mendix. Mendix can play a key role in the high-end intelligent manufacturing strategy of CIMC Vehicles. In the future, the digitalization of CIMC's business systems will focus on core business capabilities, while other customized requirements can be quickly and efficiently achieved through Mendix. Furthermore, this will allow us to iterate continuously and keep up with the changes in market demands, thereby reducing the complexities of business systems and efficiently supporting the growth of the business."Shi Chunhao, COO of Maxnerva Technology Services, an affiliate of Foxconn whose business domains include smart manufacturing, smart office and new retail solutions, says: "Mendix is a new way that we have been looking for to greatly speed up application delivery in our digital operations. We have launched two apps within a month. Now we are developing the third app, and we believe it will be launched soon. Using Mendix not only helps our IT team improve efficiency and save IT costs, but allows them to quickly support business needs, increase productivity for tens of thousands of factory workers, address government requirements to reopen in the pandemic, manage project costs, help IT report work, and more."Backed by the global strength of SiemensRecognizing the ascendance of low-code and Mendix's leadership in the category, Siemens acquired Mendix in 2018 and brought it into itsSiemens Digital Industries Softwaregroup. Mendix soon became the essential software platform for Siemens' cloud platform; it is fully integrated with Siemens'MindSphereindustrial IoT solution and is a key technology in the Siemens'Xceleratordigital platform.Siemens is a global leader in industrial, manufacturing, mobility, and process industries, and has been a proud partner to Chinese industry and government since 1872. From China's first electric tram line (1899) to power plants, high-speed trains, transformers for the Three Gorges Project (the world's largest dam), and the world's first high-voltage DC link to operate at a transmission rate of 800 kV, Siemens has helped to bring innovative technology all across China.That 150-year track record continues as Siemens brings the Mendix low-code platform — the future of software development — to its customers in China, integrating the strengths of low-code for iIoT, edge computing, AI, automation, and other use cases.Mendix will also pursue new customers in China beyond the Siemens base, leveraging the specialized expertise and solutions it has developed globally in a broad swath of industries including financial services, insurance, logistics, health care, government, retail, consumer goods, and process industries."China is one of the markets of the highest importance to Siemens Digital Industries Software," says Leo Liang, senior vice president and managing director, Siemens Digital Industries Software, Greater China. "We are pleased today to introduce the world's premier low-code technology not just to our own customers, but to every enterprise in China that wants to accelerate its digital initiatives to improve operational efficiencies and better engage with customers in every available channel. Low-code is the future of software development, and Mendix is leading the way."Boosting developer productivity and empowering citizen developersThrough abstraction and automation, Mendix accelerates software development by a factor of 10 or more versus traditional coding and waterfall methodologies. But speed is just one of several critical advantages Mendix brings to application development. Mendix expands the pool of developer talent through its support of citizen developers — business domain experts and non-IT personnel who can now build applications using Mendix Studio, a development environment specifically designed for non-professional developers. Pro developers use the more advanced Studio Pro environment to build large, complex, enterprise-level applications, even adding their own custom code if necessary.These complementary environments deliver one of Mendix's most powerful and unique capabilities: the ability for developers and non-developers to collaborate meaningfully at every stage of the development process, from business requirements to deployment. With all stakeholders speaking a common language in the Mendix platform, both business and technical details are clearly understood by all, resulting in solutions that successfully meet the business need the first time — and eliminating the rework that plagues 40% of traditionally developed applications."More effective applications, collaboratively developed in a fraction of the time, delivering more successful business results — that's the essential value proposition of Mendix," says Derek Roos, Mendix CEO. "We're excited to have the reach and brand reputation of Siemens behind us as we launch the Mendix platform in China, and we are confident that our customers there will quickly reap the benefits of low-code application development."Click here to access content free of charge from Mendix World, the world's largest virtual low-code conference, featuring more than 60 sessions, including more than 20 by customers, and covering the gamut of low-code application development topics from strategy to practical, hands-on platform training. For more information about Mendix's expanded all-in-one low-code platform, visitMendix 9.Learn more about theMendix PlatformandPricing and Availability.BackgroundIn a pandemic-disrupted world, software is the new lifeblood of our daily lives and the connective tissue holding together the global economy. However, traditional software development takes far too long and very often fails to deliver the results business needs and users love. Even prior to COVID-19, there were simply not enough professional software developers in the world to build all the software currently required. The global pandemic has accelerated and exacerbated what was already a softwareandbusiness crisis. Enterlow-codesoftware development.

Translator 'steals the scene' in china-US clashCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 21, 2021 SundayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 408 wordsBodyIt is not Yang Jiechi, the country's largest foreign policy official, who has been occupying news and social media in China since Friday.He was the one who accused american colleagues at length, with a prominent phrase: "The United States is not qualified to speak to China from a position of strength." They're not stronger anymore.The mandarin phrase was his, but the one who interpreted it in English was Zhang Jing. And it is she who occupies news channels such as Feng, newspapers such as South China Morning Post and Global Times or the Sina Weibo platform.In this, according to the website What's on Weibo, the hashtag with Zhang's name reached 200 million views by Sunday, with messages with "It's my idol" and "She also showed her strength." For the SCMP, "she stole the scene."At the meeting, after U.S. attacks, Yang responded for 15 minutes non-stop, speaking 2,000 words. When Zhang asked if he could translate, he laughed and said it was "a test" (above, in the broadcast). U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said she deserved a raiseChinese profiles rescued photos showing that Yang himself, who is from the PCC Politburo, began as Deng Xiaoping's interpreter in the 1980s, in conversations with George Bush, his father, among others.NEW NORMALIn Caixin and the Wall Street Journal, the coverage of the meeting was pessimistic, with both warning of the risk of a "miscalculation" leading to conflict.Open confrontation is the "new normal," says the Chinese financial, and shows that they do not have the same "perception about their balance of power," says the American.TESLA BY HUAWEIDuring the start of the meeting, the WSJ reported that Beijing will veto the use of Tesla's cars by military personnel and officials for fear of a "national security leak."The owner of the automaker rushed to respond, in a videoconference with the Chinese government. New headline in the WSJ, "Elon Musk says Tesla won't share data with U.S."He even defended the TikTok, threatened by Washington, but the newspaper says the parallel raised is with Huawei.ONE MORE CHANCEA highlight of the New York Times throughout Sunday, the U.S. squandered "a chance to vaccinate the world" by not pressuring its drugmakers to "share the know-how." With this, "Russia and China promise to fill the void", Brazil inclusive.But Washington would have another chance, with the upcoming announcement that it will "control patent that is in theheart" of their vaccines.Load-Date: March 22, 2021End of Document

Hoover Institution panelists say women face significant barriers in national security, academiaThe Stanford Daily: Stanford UniversityMarch 8, 2021 MondayUniversity WireCopyright 2021 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 639 wordsByline: Nina IskandarsjachBodyHoover Institution fellow and former NATO Deputy Secretary General Rose Gottemoeller made no bones about the challenges of being a woman in foreign policy and national security."You have to have a tough hide," she said at a Monday event commemorating the role of women in national security for International Womens' Day. "There's no way around it, because it is often not forgiving and the games that can be played both by foreign counterparts and by your own country can be really extreme."Gottemoeller was one of four fellows at the Hoover Institute who gathered on Zoom to discuss the roles and challenges of women in the fields of foreign policy, national security, and intelligence. All said that navigating the national security and foreign policy landscape as a woman came with challenges.The discussion, which was led by current Hoover Institution Director and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, included Hoover Institutions fellows Elizabeth Economy M.A '85, Amy Zegart Ph.D. '96, Ayaan Hirsi Ali and Gottemoeller.Zegart, an expert in international security and intelligence, said there is a shortage of women pursuing academia in the United States. According to Zegart, it is much easier to be a woman in intelligence than a woman in academia.While she said universities have come a long way since the beginning of her academic career, Zegart said universities need to be deliberate, creative and flexible in addressing the additional challenges that female academics face."I've been a career academic, and I had three kids before I came up for tenure," she said. "There's an inescapable challenge in the academy for women, which is that the biology clock coincides with the tenure clock."Additionally, Zegart called on the Hoover Institute to push for the creation of introductory classes in national security and cybersecurity for freshmen and sophomores. With so many computer science majors at Stanford, such a program could attract more women to these areas and improve the representation of women across cybersecurity fields, according to Zegart.Women's representation is lacking in other nations' political systems as well, according to the fellows. Economy, senior fellow for China studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, brought up the underrepresentation of women in Chinese politics."China is a good decade behind the United States, at least in terms of how they look at women," she said. "Women who are pregnant can be fired, they get paid less, and there are still a lot of companies that advertise for women who are attractive for positions." "The feminist movement is alive but not that well in recent times, because the Chinese government had cracked down on it," she added.Economy was disappointed with her own experiences doing research in China as a woman. She found that there were few women present in her academic deliberations on foreign policy and national security. According to Economy, this disregard for female voices will only be detrimental to the future of Chinese scholarship."I feel sad, quite frankly, for the younger Chinese scholars that are not getting the opportunities to engage with their foreign counterparts," she said.Gottemoeller also said there are similar issues plaguing young women in Russia, many of whom are talented research and diplomats, but will likely struggle to "rise up through the ranks" because of the extra barriers they face.Hirshi Ali, a Dutch American activist and politician, said that creating pity for women is not the goal of talking about these disparities."The challenge is how to use your voice without coming across as a victim," she said. "I have a sense of pride, I have a sense of achievement, and I have a sense of myself. I am not looking for that condescending tap on my shoulder.

All Rights ReservedLength: 650 wordsByline: John FengHighlight: As the former Alibaba CEO has not been seen in public for two months, a 2019 op-ed in Communist Party newspaper People's Daily is trending for capturing China's current mood toward him.BodyA Communist Party newspaper article is trending in China after it appeared to predict and capture the Chinese government's displeasure with billionaire entrepreneur Jack Ma, who has not been seen in public for two months.The People's Daily opinion piece—written in the days after Ma stepped down as chairman of Alibaba Group on September 10, 2019—dismissed the 56-year-old's idol status, which turned him into something of a rock star among the country's budding entrepreneurs.Resurfacing on China's Twitter-like social media service Weibo, the article is titled "There is no so-called Jack Ma era, only an era in which there is Jack Ma.""There is no doubt that Alibaba is a successful enterprise, nor is there any doubt about Jack Ma's effect on Alibaba, but to credit an enterprise's success solely with its leader is totally unrealistic," the text read. "Even a successful entrepreneur and a successful enterprise must rely on the backdrop that is the greatness of their time."The People's Daily article suggests Ma and Alibaba—one of China's richest men and its largest e-commerce business respectively—were fortuitous to exist in an economic environment created by the Chinese government, where their growth was made possible."A seedling can only grow into a tall tree if it has the right soil and climate conditions," it continued.The article concludes: "There is no so-called Jack Ma era, only an era in which there is Jack Ma. Only individuals who seize the opportunity of their time can fulfill their potential. Be it Jack Ma, Pony Ma, Elon Musk or us ordinary people—there is no exception."Blind admiration will not bring bring success. Understanding the relationship between one's success and one's time ... is essential to achieving success."Chinese internet commenters and local news sites have described recent developments and the government's "mood" towards Ma as having been "predicted" by the tone of the text in the country's largest newspaper.Ma has not been seen since the Bund Summit in Shanghai in late-October, when he made remarks regarded as highly controversial among China's political class.China's most high-profile businessman was obliquely critical of the country's tightly controlled financial system and called for it to be overhauled for the good of the "next generation" of Chinese youth.Ma, who said financial regulators were "stifling innovation" in China, has not posted on Twitter and Weibo since the middle of the same month.Ma failed to appear on the November finale of Africa's Business Heroes, a game show he created for entrepreneurs. His slot was replaced by another Alibaba executive due to a "scheduling conflict," Reuters and others reported on Monday.On Sunday, Ma was a notable absentee at the Zhejiang Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai. He is a regular attendee of the annual forum, and his failure to make an appearance raised further questions regarding his whereabouts among Weibo users.Ma's comments are believed to have put him in direct conflict with the Chinese government. It resulted in the suspension of the highly anticipated initial public offering of Alibaba's fintech arm Ant Group just 24 hours before its launch on November 3. Last month, Chinese regulators then launched an anti-monopoly probe into Alibaba.China's state media outlets reported that both Ant Group and Alibaba had "embraced" structural changes demanded by regulatory authorities.The billionaire, who once held the affectionate nickname "Father Ma," has been vilified since his October remarks in Shanghai. Chinese media reports have chosen descriptors including "vampire" and "thug."Ma, however, who sits at number 20 on the Forbes Real Time Billionaires list, has yet to be mentioned in official party publications since the end of last year, when they confirmed he had been summoned as part of Ant's halted IPO—reported at the time to be worth $37 billion.Link to ImageGraphic Alibaba Co-founder Jack Ma Addresses AudienceWang He/Getty ImagesFile photo: Alibaba Group co-founder Jack Ma.Load-Date: January 5, 2021End of Document

Hackers attacked Indian manufacturers of coronavirus vaccinesCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 3, 2021 WednesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 483 wordsBodyA group of hackers, allegedly backed by the Chinese government, has in recent weeks attacked the systems of two Indian vaccine manufacturers whose coronavirus injections are used in the country's immunization campaign.Cyberintelligence company Cyfirma, backed by the world's largest securities and investment banking group Goldman Sachs, said Chinese hacker group APT10, also known as Stone Panda, had identified gaps and vulnerabilities in Bharat Biotech's supply chain software infrastructure and the Serum Institute of India (SII) , the world's largest vaccine manufacturer.As part of the vaccination campaign deployed in different parts of the world, China and India have sold or given away covid-19 vaccines to many countries. India produces more than 60 percent of all vaccines sold globally.The link between nuclear-armed neighbors, China and India, was strained last June when 20 Indian soldiers and four Chinese were killed in a fight on the Himalayan border. Recent talks eased the crisis."The real motivation here is the exfiltration of intellectual property and gaining a competitive advantage over Indian pharmaceutical companies," cyfirma CEO Kumar Ritesh emphasized.He also reported that the hacker group "was actively attacking SII, which manufactures the AstraZeneca vaccine for many countries and will soon begin manufacturing Novavax injections." "In the case of the Serum Institute, they found several public servers with vulnerable web servers," Ritesh added.He added: "They talk about a weak web application, also a weak content management system. It's alarming." From SII and Bharat Biotech they refused to comment.In 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice stated that APT10 had acted in partnership with china's Ministry of State Security.On the other hand, Microsoft revealed in November that it had detected cyberattacks from Russia and North Korea targeting coronavirus vaccine companies in India, Canada, France, South Korea and the United States and that North Korean groups attempted to break into the systems of British pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca.In December, from US pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc and its German partner BioNTech SE, they reported that documents related to the development of their vaccine had been "illegally accessed" in a cyberattack on the European drug regulator.China's government's stanceIn the face of complaints, China's Foreign Ministry did not respond to a request for comment. However, in response to a question about whether there were Chinese hackers who played a role in the attack on India's power grid that caused a blackout in Mumbai in 2020, from the area they indicated that they are "strong cybersecurity advocates.""China strongly opposes all forms of cyberattacks," his embassy in New Delhi said on Twitter, citing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. "Speculation and manufacturing have no role in the issue of cyberattacks."Load-Date: March 4, 2021End of Document

REPORT: Twitter Locks China's US Embassy Out Of Twitter After Post Touting Birth Rate Decline Among UighursThe Daily CallerJanuary 21, 2021 Thursday 03:54 PM ESTCopyright 2021 The Daily Caller, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: TECHLength: 675 wordsByline: Marlo Safi, Culture Reporter, marlo@dailycaller.comMarlo Safi is a 2018 graduate of the University of Pittsburgh. When she is not reporting on subjects like religion and culture, she is cooking or writing about cooking.Author ImageBodyLink to ImageTwitter locked the Chinese embassy to the U.S. out of its Twitter account following a post that touted the decreased birth rate and eradication of religious extremism in Xinjiang, where reports have detailed forced labor camps and sterilization, Bloomberg reported.The embassy shared a study in a Jan. 7 tweet that reported extremism in the region had led to people resisting family planning, and that the eradication of extremism allowed Uighur women “more autonomy when deciding whether to have children.” The study framed such findings as a boon to female empowerment, allowing women to no longer be “baby-making machines.”Link to Image(Screenshot/Twitter)A Twitter spokesman confirmed to Bloomberg that the Chinese embassy's account is still locked as of Thursday. The tweet itself wasn't removed by Twitter until more than 24 hours later, following numerous complaints from users saying that it violated the platform's policies and advocated genocide. Twitter prohibits the “dehumanization of a group of people based on their religion, caste, age, disability, serious disease, national origin, race, or ethnicity.”Although Twitter removed the tweet, account owners are also required to manually delete the post that ran afoul of the site's policy in order to regain access to their account. Since the account is still locked as of Thursday, it means that the Chinese embassy did not delete the post.“We have taken action on this Tweet for violating our policy against dehumanization,” a Twitter spokesman told Bloomberg.Multiple reports have claimed that Uighur Muslims, an ethnic minority in China, have been forced to work at factories where they undergo reeducation in order to pledge their allegiance to the Chinese government. Between 900,000 and 1.8 million Muslims have been detained in more than 1,300 concentration camps in Xinjiang as part of China's effort to sinicize its population.An Associated Press investigation reported that the Chinese government has sought to drastically lower the birth rates of Uighurs and other minorities through forced abortions, birth control, mass detentions and imprisonment. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying was reportedly confused about why the embassy's account was restricted, and claimed it was the embassy's responsibility to correct “fake reports and information related to Xinjiang,” according to Bloomberg.“We hope Twitter can adhere to objective and fair principles and not display double standards on this issue,” she said at a briefing.The Chinese government denies that it operates forced labor camps, instead claiming that the camps are intended to eradicate terrorism due to separatist violence in Xinjiang. It also claims that the changes in birth rates were not caused by forced sterilization, which is a claim made by “Western scholars and politicians,” according to the report that the embassy shared on Twitter.Link to ImageThis photo taken on June 2, 2019 shows buildings at the Artux City Vocational Skills Education Training Service Center, believed to be a re-education camp where mostly Muslim ethnic minorities are detained, north of Kashgar in China's northwestern Xinjiang region.

(RELATED: US Becomes First Country In The World To Formally Declare China Is Committing 'Genocide' Against Uighur Muslims)The Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide defines genocide as an act committed with the “intent to destroy, in or or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group,” according to the United Nations.  Acts of genocide include “imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group,” and “deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.”Graphic This photo taken on June 4, 2019 shows children walking past security as they arrive at a school in Kashgar in China's northwest Xinjiang region.(GREG BAKER/AFP via Getty Images)Load-Date: January 21, 2021End of Document

China launches its covid digital passport: with QR code and hosted on WechatCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 11, 2021 ThursdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 646 wordsBodyChina's new step towards post-ronavirus normality. After pioneering the use of tools such as digital codes to certify health status or mass testing to entire locations, the Asian giant has just launched its digital covid vaccination certificate. With their expedition, they aim to make it easier for their citizens to make international trips safely and to encourage economic recovery.Initially, the certificate issued by China will contain information on the coronavirus antidotes received by that person as well as the results of the different pathogen screening tests to which he has undergone.Mutual recognition could be with countries with the approved Chinese vaccine, in addition to Japan or KoreaThe document, whose possession is not mandatory, will be encrypted in a QR code hosted on the popular Wechat platform (a mix of Facebook, Whatsapp and others) and will be accessible to the authorities when necessary, although a paper version will also be available.This health passport, which for now is not issued to foreigners residing on Chinese soil, was born to promote safe and orderly mobility between countries. "The pandemic is still with us, but the world economy needs to start over, and meetings between people must resume without further disarm," foreign spokesman Zhao Lijian summed up.So far, it is unknown which nations the Chinese government is negotiating with to ensure the interoperability of this document. Still, the state-owned Global Times noted yesterday that it is "very possible and practical" for China to establish a process of mutual recognition with countries that have approved the use of Chinese vaccines - he quoted Malaysia, Singapore or Indonesia - or neighbors with which it is appropriate to summarize trade as soon as possible for economic reasons, in the case of Japan or South Korea.However, it seems that Beijing will continue to force all people arriving on its territory from abroad to serve 14 days of strict quarantine, although it would be considering whether to make this requirement more flexible in the future for those already vaccinated.The Asian giant is no stranger to the use of such systems. At the beginning of the pandemic, the country launched a tracking application that produced a "green code" for those users who had not been in close contact with a confirmed case or visited a place where contagions have been detected. Possession of this code was mandatory to access public transport or numerous buildings, although with the improvement of the epidemiological situation in the country its use has been minimized.With the implementation of the passport, the Asian country joins others such as Bahrain, which has also deployed a similar instrument so that people can regain mobility and revive the economy. The European Union is also working to develop its own covid passport, with Spain, together with other tourism-dependent economies, as one of the main holders of this document.However, the World Health Organization (WHO) has questioned the use of suchDocuments. The executive director of his Emergency Program, Michael Ryan, said Monday that these certificates will create "more inequalities," as there are still no vaccines against the pathogen for everyone. "Making decisions about what people who are vaccinated and who aren't can make decisions can worsen the social inequality that already exists," he emphasized.Despite these reluctances, some Chinese experts said Beijing could share its expertise and provide technical support to WHO to organize the system. "When it comes to technology, Chinese companies could build an international platform in a week. But it would be better if WHO, rather than another country or regional organization, organizes it, to ensure the independence, fairness and security of the platform's data," said Xiang Ligang, director of the Information Consumption Alliance.Load-Date: March 12, 2021End of Document

Clubhouse blocked in China as censors shut rare space for sensitive political debateCNN WireFebruary 8, 2021 Monday 3:24 PM GMTCopyright 2021 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 823 wordsByline: By Nectar Gan and James Griffiths, CNN BusinessDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  Clubhouse appears to have been blocked in China just days after it became the go-to app for uncensored conversations on a host of sensitive issues banned on other platforms.Over the weekend, several large Chinese-language chat rooms were set up on the invite-only audio app, where guests talked about politically-charged topics such as the ongoing crackdown against the Uyghurs in Xinjiang, democracy in Hong Kong and the sovereignty of Taiwan.By Monday evening, many Clubhouse users in mainland China reported that the app had been censored. When they tried to log onto the app, they received a red error message showing "a secure connection to the server cannot be made."However, like Twitter and many other platforms that are blocked by China's Great Firewall --- a sprawling censorship and surveillance apparatus --- the app can still be accessed by using a virtual private network. VPNs use encryption to disguise internet traffic, helping people in China get around the firewall. Clubhouse did not immediately respond to a request for comment.On Clubhouse, several chat rooms soon sprang up to discuss the blocking of the app. They were joined by hundreds of users, including some who said they were based in mainland China. Greatfire.org, a group which monitors internet censorship in China, also confirmed that the app had been blocked.The ban on Clubhouse comes as little surprise. With its political discussions drawing so much interest from mainland China, many users and observers expected it was only a matter of time before the app was blocked. While the censorship might deter new users, it is unclear how many existing users will be kept off the platform. Susan Liang, a 31-year-old from Shenzhen, said she would continue to join Clubhouse chats on sensitive topics via a VPN because she didn't want to give up the frank and open discussions."It is too rare an opportunity. Everyone has lived under the Great Firewall for so long, but on this platform, we can talk about anything," she told CNN Business. "It's like someone drowning, and can finally breathe in a large gulp of air."But Liang expects some other users might be discouraged by having to use a VPN, as that technology has been increasingly targeted by Chinese government crackdowns. Any VPN not approved by the government is illegal. Benjamin Ismail, an expert with Apple Censorship --- a project run by GreatFire.org --- said some users would be discouraged by the block but "it might not kill the app immediately" in China. There were other obstacles for Chinese users to navigate, even before the reported blockage. The app is only available on iPhones, and only to those with a non-Chinese Apple account. Once downloaded, prospective users also require an invite code, which can be hard to come by. On Monday, some were being sold on Chinese e-commerce platform Taobao for between $13 and $30 each. Popular political chat roomsWhile the app first became popular in China among tech industry circles, its political chat rooms quickly drew newcomers eager for release from the tight censorship at home. As it grew in popularity, many Chinese also joined to discuss topics such as culture, lifestyle and celebrity gossip. But the space for free, inclusive political discussions was one of the rarest qualities of the app for Chinese-speaking communities.One chat room hosted by Taiwan-based blogger Zola was running non-stop for almost 120 hours, joined by Chinese speakers in different time zones.Another popular chat room invited young people from both sides of the Taiwan Strait to share their views and personal stories. The discussions started with lighthearted subjects but soon turned to politics, with users comparing the political systems of China and Taiwan and debating the prospects of unification."I don't think these topics should be off limits," Jimmy Tan, a Guangzhou-based user who opened the chat room with his designer friend in Taiwan, wrote on social media Saturday. "The fact that our chats can so quickly switch to these topics exactly means that we should talk about them --- they are relevant to every one of us --- and it also means that we've been holding our tongues for way too long."Other users and outside observers expressed skepticism over how representative the groups engaging in these political discussions are of Chinese public opinion, pointing to the self-selecting nature of the participants, as well as the barriers to using Clubhouse itself which prevent it from being a completely public app.And the warning signs were already looming before the censors struck. On Monday, Global Times, a state-run nationalist tabloid, accused political discussions on the app of being "one-sided." "Political topics on the platform are not discussed as rationally as other topics like technology or culture," the paper said.TM & © 2021 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

United Kingdom to use fines to target forced labor in China's XinjiangStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeJanuary 12, 2021 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2021 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: WORLD NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 545 wordsByline: Steven ClarkeBodyThe embassy shared an article from state-run media China Daily, which claimed the "eradication of extremism" in Xinjiang, an area of China with a large Uyghur population, has given women "more autonomy".The Council on American-Islamic Relations, an advocacy group, urged Twitter to remove the tweet by the embassy, which it said used the platform "to celebrate crimes against humanity".A Chinese embassy spokesman had no comment on the use of the term "baby-making machines" to describe Uighur women.Today's actions represent the strongest measures yet taken by Canada in the face of growing global criticism of the Chinese government over its policies in Xinjiang - but they stop short of imposing "Magnitsky sanctions" on Chinese officials - something called for by a parliamentary committee that found China's actions meet the definition of genocide.An Associated Press investigation in June found that the Chinese government was forcing draconian birth-control measures on Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang, including IUD fittings, contraceptives, and even abortions and sterilisations. Forced abortions, sterilization and unwanted IUDs are "widespread and systematic" practices, according to the AP. Population growth rates fell from 1.1% to 0.6%.A Chinese government official has claimed that birth-control decisions in Xinjiang were made of the person's own free will.Start of Formula 1 season in Bahrain, return of Imola!Formula One One bosses have unveiled a revamped calendar following the postponements of the Australian and Chinese Grands Prix . The start of the season is now in Bahrain and Australia is now round 21 on November 21."The birthrate in Xinjiang decreased from 1.6 percent in 2017 to 1 percent in 2018 and the natural population growth rate fell from 1.1 percent to 0.6 percent", according to the study.The Guardian report stated that in the past few years, China has escalated its crackdown on ethnic Muslim minorities in the Xinjiang region, including the mass internment of an estimated one million people, intense human and digital surveillance, re-education programs, suppression of religious activities and destruction of religious sites. The article tweeted by the Chinese Embassy in the US compares the population growth in the region to that of the Han majority - claiming for years growth disproportionately favored the Uighurs. "While the population of Han people in the region increased by just 2 percent to 9 million over the same period".The deleted tweet posted by China's embassy in the USA said: "Study shows that in the process of eradicating extremism, the minds of Uygur [sic] women in Xinjiang were emancipated and gender equality and reproductive health were promoted, making them no longer baby-making machines"."In cranking out counter propaganda to my work, they keep digging a deeper hole", Zenz said Thursday.Canada already bans the importation of goods produced through forced labour as part of its obligations under the Canada-U.S. -Mexico Agreement , Global Affairs Canada said in a news release.British supermarket chain Marks & Spencer recently announced it will not use cotton from China's Xinjiang in its apparel in response to the latter's alleged treatment of its Muslim Uighur minority.Load-Date: January 13, 2021End of Document

Hong Kong broadcaster drops Oscars for the first time in 50 yearsCNN WireMarch 30, 2021 Tuesday 9:37 AM GMTCopyright 2021 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 570 wordsByline: By Laura He, CNN BusinessDateline: (CNN) BodyHong Kong's leading TV broadcaster will not air the Academy Awards next month for the first time in more than half a century.Television Broadcasts Limited (TVB) has been home to the awards in Hong Kong since 1969. Its decision not to broadcast the ceremony this year was "purely a commercial decision," a spokesperson said.But the decision to drop the Oscars comes as two nominees - "Do Not Split," a documentary about the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, and Chloe Zhao, who wrote and directed the drama "Nomadland" - face heated criticism in mainland China. Citing anonymous sources, Bloomberg reported earlier this month that China's propaganda department ordered all local media outlets not to broadcast the ceremony live and to downplay coverage of the awards.Hong Kong has several other major local broadcasters, including Now TV, Cable TV, Viu TV and Open TV. CNN Business has reached out to all four for comment. Open TV said it doesn't have the broadcast rights to the awards show. It wasn't immediately clear whether one of the others has acquired them.Zhao, who was born in China, recently made history as the first woman of Asian descent to win a Golden Globe for best director. Her film "Nomadland" is nominated for several Oscars, including best picture, best director, best actress and best adapted screenplay.Zhao was initially hailed in Chinese state media as the "pride of China," but the mood shifted after a 2013 interview that she gave to US-based "Filmmaker" magazine surfaced on social media. During the interview, Zhao said she grew up in China where "there are lies everywhere." Some Chinese social media users questioned whether Zhao could still be considered Chinese, given her remarks and her ties to the United States and the United Kingdom, where she was educated.Promotional materials for "Nomadland," along with the hashtag for the film, have been removed from social media platforms in China, according to the Global Times, a state-owned tabloid.Meanwhile, there has barely been any coverage of the documentary "Do Not Split" in Chinese state media or social media, which are heavily censored and vetted by the government.The film, which is nominated for best documentary (short subject), chronicles the mass protests in Hong Kong that erupted in 2019 over an extradition bill. The demonstrations eventually evolved into a movement calling for full democracy.In the year since then, the Chinese government has tightened its grip over the former British colony, and passed a sweeping national security measure last summer that banned sedition, secession and subversion against Beijing. The bill may already be having a chilling effect on free speech in Hong Kong, as journalists and their sources have grown increasingly wary they could be prosecuted.China has also stepped up efforts to curtail democracy in the city, including passing a new law on Tuesday that slashes the number of directly-elected seats in the Hong Kong parliament and further entrenches Beijing's power.TVB became a source of controversy itself during the protests in 2019, when it was criticized by protesters for what they saw as pro-government bias. The company said at the time that it has "always maintained neutrality, professionalism and objectivity in its news coverage."                      By Laura He, CNN Business         TM & © 2021 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

China Imposes Sanctions on Pompeo, Other Trump Administration FiguresNewsweek.comJanuary 20, 2021 Wednesday 2:07 PM ESTCopyright © 2021 Newsweek Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 432 wordsByline: Elizabeth CrispHighlight: China accused the former officials of undermining Beijing's "national sovereignty, security and development interests."BodyChina has announced sanctions to former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other key members of the Trump administration, accusing them of undermining Beijing's "national sovereignty, security and development interests" and further claiming that they've shown "prejudice and hatred against China."The announcement from the Chinese foreign ministry doesn't list any examples of specific accusations, but many of the officials listed have been critical of the Communist country's handling of the coronavirus pandemic and other concerns.The move against top former Trump officials, which was announced during the inauguration of President Joe Biden, bars them and their family members from entering China, Hong Kong and Macau, or doing business in China.In addition to Pompeo, sanctions are being levied against former Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro; National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien; Assistant Secretary of State David Stilwell; Deputy National Security Adviser Matthew Pottinger; Health Secretary Alex Azar; Under Secretary of State Keith Krach; and United Nations Ambassador Kelly Craft. The country announced it is also leveling sanctions against former Trump associates John Bolton and Stephen K. Bannon, who were in the Trump administration earlier in the former president's term."The Chinese government is firmly resolved to defend China's national sovereignty, security and development interests," China foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said in a statement.Trump—who has spent months blaming China for the coronavirus pandemic that has killed over 400,000 Americans, and blocked most travel to the United States from China— left the White House Wednesday morning to travel to his post-presidential residence in Florida, without attending Biden's inauguration.The former president launched a trade war with China in 2018 and took aim at Chinese social media sites, including TikTok.Before leaving office, Pompeo, also an outspoken critic of China, released a statement accusing the Chinese government of genocide and crimes against humanity—charges the Chinese government has denied—because of the country's treatment of Uighurs and other ethnic minorities. It was the final move in what had become an increasingly tense relationship between the Trump administration and China.A day before issuing the sanctions, Hua called Pompeo a "doomsday clown and joke of the century" during a press briefing.None of the officials named in the sanctions immediately responded to China's announcement. Pompeo didn't immediately respond to Newsweek's request for comment.Link to ImageGraphic Mike PompeoTami Chappell / AFP/GettyUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo speaks on "China challenge to US national security and academic freedom," December 9, 2020, in Atlanta, Georgia.Load-Date: January 20, 2021End of Document

But it also appears to be putting his business empire --- and Ma himself --- at enormous risk.The trouble started in late October after Ma criticized China's regulators at a conference in Shanghai. As Ma's financial tech firm Ant Group was preparing for the world's largest initial public offering, he accused authorities of stifling innovation and blasted the country's banks for having a "pawn shop" mentality.Beijing's retaliation was swift. Within days, regulators called off the IPO, but not before summoning Ma and Ant executives to a meeting. In the weeks since then, regulators have ordered Ant to restructure large swaths of the company. They even extended their scrutiny to Alibaba, which is now the subject of an antitrust investigation. Ma, meanwhile, hasn't been seen in public since he gave his speech in Shanghai --- a notable absence for a man who typically has no issue with the spotlight, and whose businesses now face their biggest threat in years. "I think there's one overall message that the party is really sending, and that is that tech entrepreneurs may be the most glamorous, the most publicly favorable face that China is showing to the world," said Rana Mitter, professor of history and politics of modern China at Oxford University. "But there is no one individual, no one company bigger than the Chinese Communist Party."Many observers of China say Ma is most likely lying low as authorities turn up the heat on his businesses, having gotten the hint about speaking out of turn.But it's also not unlike Beijing to dole out severe punishment for prominent Chinese figures who clash with the interests of the Communist Party.Superstar actress Fan Bingbing, for example, abruptly dropped out of sight in 2018 before reappearing a year later to apologize for a tax evasion scandal. And real-estate tycoon Ren Zhiqiang disappeared for several months last year after he allegedly criticized President Xi Jinping's handling of the coronavirus pandemic. He was eventually jailed for 18 years on corruption charges.A larger-than-life figureA former English teacher with humble beginnings, Ma has long personified China's economic prosperity and entrepreneurial grit. He built Alibaba into a $500 billion tech empire and amassed a personal fortune of some $50 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. As his companies, grew, Ma became the friendly face of China's economic rise. He frequently met with heads of state --- Ma has lunched with former President Barack Obama and taken selfies with former UK Prime Minister David Cameron --- and last year even donated Covid-19 supplies around the world. Ma's style as an executive at Alibaba was unabashedly flamboyant, too: Once, he sang the 1950s classic "Unchained Melody" on stage at a company conference, often dressed up in costumes and appeared at events with celebrities like David Beckham and Nicole Kidman. On one level, Chinese authorities liked that Ma represented a high-powered and glamorous version of China "because one of the things the Chinese Communist Party has found it almost impossible to do is to create soft power in the world," said Mitter, the Oxford professor.The government has encouraged the growth of its home-grown tech giants, including Alibaba, Ant Group, Tencent and Baidu, while shutting out their big American rivals. They're all largely indispensable in China for social interaction, entertainment, commerce and more.But authorities in China increasingly view that outsized influence as a risk to the country's political and economic stability. Ant Group, for example, is able to collect lending fees free of the tough regulations imposed on commercial banks. "The squelching of the big name tech entrepreneurs is part of that wider process by the party to take back control, and really rewrite the narrative of how China's tech innovation takes place only under the circumstances the party will allow," Mitter said.In recent months, the government's steps to rein in the industry have gotten more blatant. The Communist Party published an unusually frank set of guidelines in September, for example, that called on its members to "educate private businesspeople to weaponize their minds with [Xi's] socialism ideology."And Xi himself signaled a tech crackdown last month at an economic conference, where he called on the country to strengthen anti-monopoly efforts against online platforms and prevent a "disorderly expansion" of capital. In the weeks since then, that tightening of the screws has come to pass. In addition to the regulatory demands for Ant Group and investigation into Alibaba, authorities have warned other tech representatives against creating monopolies and abusing consumer data for profit. The last of his kindMa, a Communist Party member, remains out of sight. His social media pages have been dormant since October, and he even missed the finale of an African entrepreneurial talent show that he created. (Alibaba said he missed the event because of a "scheduling conflict.")While Beijing hasn't been shy about fining or even jailing executives critical of the government --- Ren, the real estate tycoon who was imprisoned last year, allegedly penned an essay that obliquely referred to Xi as a power-hungry "clown" --- tech industry and government observers say Ma may be voluntarily staying out of the spotlight, at least for now. The Chinese government wants its narrative about the Ant Group IPO to dominate the public conversation, said Duncan Clark, author of "Alibaba: The House that Jack Ma Built" and founder of investment advisory firm BDA China. He added that the company likely knows that it won't help to have any "diversity of opinion" on the issue."But certainly it's remarkable ... the silence is somewhat deafening," Clark said, adding that he expects Ma to eventually come out publicly with a scripted statement about contributing to reform in China. "He got the signal that 'I spoke too much, that caused me trouble so I need to shut myself up'," said Angela Zhang, an associate professor at the University of Hong Kong who has studied Chinese antitrust enforcement.Loss of 'soft power'One thing, at least, seems clear: As the Chinese Communist Party piles pressure on the country's tech titans, it seems unlikely the industry will see another figure like Ma. Alibaba CEO Daniel Zhang, who succeeded Ma as chairman in 2019, struck a conciliatory tone on regulation in November by describing the government's efforts to tighten restrictions on internet companies as "timely and necessary."The loss of that kind of voice, though, will have consequences for Beijing, Mitter said. Many countries, particularly in the West, already view China and its businesses as existential threats worthy of heavy sanctions and scrutiny --- tensions that stem from fears that Chinese corporations all operate at the behest of the Communist Party. Stifling criticism from those tech leaders at home could make exerting influence abroad even harder. "The ability of a figure like Jack Ma to speak out will be harder, and I think this will actually create a further problem for China's desire to generate soft power," Mitter said. "Nobody really takes seriously figures from any country who go around the world simply spouting the government line."TM & © 2021 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

U.S. campaign against Huawei takes effect: sales outside China plummeted in 2020CE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 31, 2021 WednesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 403 wordsBodyThe Chinese company has announced a drop in both terminal sales and revenue during 2020.The three-year battle of the US government and Chinese technology company Huawei for now has a clear loser. The mobile phone manufacturer that two years ago had a chance of becoming the company with the highest sales worldwide, has been falling for months due to restrictions and sanctions established by the United States to avoid its presence in the Us country.The fight began under Donald Trump, who directly threatened Huawei by considering the Chinese company to spy on the Americans. Biden's mandate does not appear to have changed the rules of the game and Huawei continues to suffer the consequences of this war. Mainly because for two years you have not been able to use Google services on your phones, so the new models are not equipped with Android, Google Maps, or Gmail... nor is it easy to install it.With this landscape, Huawei's market is almost completely reduced to Chinese territory. That's why while Huawei's revenue in China continues to grow, where much of its business is still growing (15% more than in 2019), according to 2020 financial results, revenues in many other markets, including Europe and North America, fell by double-digit percentages.Last year was "a really tough year for Huawei," a Chinese company executive told journalists on Tuesday, according to the Washington Post.The executive advanced the company's expected results today and said U.S. export controls have had "a big impact on Huawei, especially for the consumer business.""The anti-Huawei campaign can give the company's industrial rivals a short-term advantage," he added, "but in the long run we believe this is damaging the reputation and competitive advantage of American industry."According to data from consultancy Canalyst on the third quarter of 2020, the Chinese company would have disappeared from the top 5 manufacturers that sell the most globally, surpassed by Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo. However, it remains a fifth manufacturer in the IDC report, which is 42% year-on-year huawei's downfall.Xiaomi is without a doubt one of the great beneficiaries of this fall.• Huawei• Donald Trump• Companies• Technology• Technology companiesXiaomi presents its first folding smartphone, Mi Mix FoldBiden bets on alliances to slow down Pek?

China calls on US to remove unchanged restrictions on its expansionist planCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 23, 2021 TuesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 667 wordsBodyChina's regime made a direct call to Joe Biden's administration. Although the Asian giant made no proposal to change its domestic and foreign policy, it did urge the United States to withdraw trade bans and reduce alleged interference.Biden's government has said it will review a number of issues around China. It happened recently when it suspended the sale of the TikTok app. The goal, by order of former President Donald Trump, was for it to pass into the hands of a new owner, this time American, to avoid alleged electronic espionage. However, the current U.S. representative ordered his suspension on the grounds that he would review "data security and the information the application collects about U.S. users."Since taking office, Biden has made some pronouncements regarding China. However, it would not be clear whether there would be significant changes between the two nations. The meantime was taken advantage of by China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi."We know that the new government is reviewing and evaluating its foreign policy," Wang Yi said during a meeting called the Lanting Forum in Beijing, according to the Associated Press. At the time he called for the lifting of trade restrictions, as well as contacts between people and also the cessation seen by the Chinese regime as an "unwarranted interference" in the Taiwan, Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Tibet areas.According to Xi Jinping's official, they suggest that the United States "abandon prejudice, abandon unwarranted suspicions, and act to restore policy to China to the reason for ensuring China's healthy and constant development."Abuses of sovereignty and HRDsXi Jiping's government minister launched several qualifiers. In its view, the United States must "stop smearing" the reputation of China's ruling Communist Party.A few days ago, the Chinese government blocked the BBC signal after a report denouncing human rights violations of religious minorities in the Xinjiang region. In this and other investigations, witnesses have recounted what is going on inside: systematic rape of women, subjugation and ideological indoctrination.There is also the conflict with Taiwan. Xi Jinping's regime maintains a constant siege of that territory to gain control of the island and the South China Sea. That's so much so that China has established huge military bases on small artificial islands. The situation has been in tense calm for decades.In previous years, the United States has supported Taiwan's sovereignty through planes, soldiers, weapons, and ships to avoid control of those waters. Recent shipment of aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt, accompanied by a cruiser and guided missile destroyer, prompted China to respond with 11 aircraft flying over Taiwan's air defense zone.The Past Davos ForumDuring Donald Trump's presidency, greater restrictions were imposed on China, such as increased import tariffs in 2017 and sanctions on Chinese officials. In 2020 he ratified a law on the latter point, freezing the assets of these officials in the U.S. and banning them from entering the country.The Chinese minister, now facing a new US administration, called for the elimination of these tariffs to which he labeled them "unscainable."This pronouncement is in addition to a series of statements already issued by the communist regime. At the Davos Forum, held virtually last January, Xi Jinping warned of a "new Cold War" and called for "abandoning prejudiceand follow a path of peaceful coexistence, mutual benefit and cooperation for everyone to win," the BBC said.In response, new White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki resumed an argument similar to when the sale of TikTok was suspended, claiming that they will start from an alleged "patience approach" to respond to the Asian country's "abuses.""That means we're going to consult with our allies, with Democrats and Republicans, and we're going to allow the inter-agency process to develop to review and evaluate how we should move forward with our relationship," he said. Load-Date: February 24, 2021End of Document

Bolsonaro says China released production of Coronavac in BrazilCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 25, 2021 MondayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 640 wordsBodyPresident Jair Bolsonaro (no party) said on Monday (25) that the government was informed by Chinese authorities that production facilities for Coronavac should arrive in Brazil in the "coming days"."The Chinese Embassy informed us in the morning that the export of the 5,400 liters of production for the Coronavac vaccine has been approved and are already in an airport area for ready shipment to Brazil, arriving in the coming days," the president wrote on Facebook."So too are the astrazeneca vaccine insums that are being released. I appreciate the sensitivity of the Chinese Government, as well as the commitment of Ministers Ernesto Araújo [Foreign Affairs], Eduardo Pazuello [Health] and Tereza Cristina [Agriculture]".In a video published in the profile of Minister Onyx Lorenzoni (Citizenship), Pazuello says that the insums for Coronavac should arrive in Brazil by the end of the week."The forecast of the arrival of the insums in Brazil is until the end of this week, thus ensuring the continuity of the manufacture and distribution of the vaccine", says the holder of Health, who is in Manaus to show reaction of the government in the face of the crisis of lack of oxygen for treatment of Covid-19 in hospitals in the city.Coronavac is developed by a Chinese pharmaceutical company and in Brazil is produced by the Butantan Institute, linked to the government of São Paulo.The immunizer is at the center of the so-called "vaccine war" between the governor of the state, João Doria (PSDB), and Bolsonaro. Over the past year, the president attacked Coronavac on more than one occasion, said it did not convey confidence and ensured that the government would not buy it.But pressure from governors and criticism of the lack of planning of the Brazilian immunization campaign led the Ministry of Health to announce the purchase of 100 million doses of the vaccine.  Bolsonaro had been betting on the vaccine developed by the University of Oxford in partnership with the company AstraZeneca, which in Brazil will be produced by Fiocruz (Oswaldo Cruz Foundation).After an attempt by the government to import 2 million doses of Oxford / AstraZeneca have delayed, immunization in the country began on Sunday (17) in São Paulo, in an action capitalized by Doria and felt as political defeat by the Planalto Palace.Both Coronavac and Oxford/AstraZeneca have their timelines threatened by difficulties in accessing raw materials made in China.In recent days, Doria and government ministers have appealed to Chinese authorities for the IFAs (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient) that were held in the Asian country to be released.The history of offenses to China by allies of the Brazilian president -- including his son, Congressman Eduardo Bolsonaro (PSL-SP) and former Education Minister Abraham Weintraub -- were pointed out as obstacles to beijing's green light. In addition, Foreign Minister Ernesto Araújo has a bad dialogue with the Chinese diplomatic mission in Brasilia, another obstacle to the negotiations.Faced with the risk of delay in Butantan's production schedule, the government mobilized ministers who have good relations with China to try to expedite the procedures demanded by Beijing.The argument of the Brazilian authorities is that the problems for the release of the products were technical and that there was no political component in the recorded delay.In parallel, Doria also initiated talks with the Chinese embassy, and asked former President Michel Temer to talk to the diplomatic mission in Brasilia.China's ambassador to Brazil, Yang Wanming, commented on Bolsonaro's announcement on social media."China is together with Brazil in the fight against the pandemic andwill continue to help Brazil in this fight within its reach. Unity and solidarity are the right ways to overcome the pandemic," the diplomat wrote.Load-Date: January 26, 2021End of Document

HOSPITAL RESEARCHER SENTENCED TO PRISON FOR CONSPIRING TO STEAL TRADE SECRETS, SELL THEM IN CHINA DEFENDANT WILL PAY $2.6 MILLION IN RESTITUTIONStates News ServiceFebruary 1, 2021 MondayCopyright 2021 States News ServiceLength: 596 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: COLUMBUS, OH BodyThe following information was released by the United States Attorney's Office Southern District of Ohio:A former Dublin, Ohio woman was sentenced in U.S. District Court today to 30 months in prison for conspiring to steal exosome-related trade secrets concerning the research, identification and treatment of a range of pediatric medical conditions.Li Chen, 47, also conspired to commit wire fraud.Chen admitted in her guilty plea in July 2020 to stealing scientific trade secrets related to exosomes and exosome isolation from Nationwide Children's Hospital's Research Institute for her own personal financial gain.Chen and her husband, co-conspirator Yu Zhou, 50, worked in separate medical research labs at the Research Institute for 10 years each (Zhou from 2007 until 2017 and Chen from 2008 until 2018). They pleaded guilty to conspiring to steal at least five trade secrets related to exosome research from Nationwide Children's Hospital.Exosomes play a key role in the research, identification and treatment of a range of medical conditions, including necrotizing enterocolitis (a condition found in premature babies), liver fibrosis and liver cancer.Court documents detail that Chen conspired to steal and then monetize one of the trade secrets by creating and selling exosome "isolation kits." Chen started a company in China to sell the kits.Chen received benefits from the Chinese government, including the State Administration of Foreign Expert Affairs and the National Natural Science Foundation of China. She also applied to multiple Chinese government talent plans, a method used by China to transfer foreign research and technology to the Chinese government."Chen and her husband executed a scheme over the course of several years to set up businesses in China, steal American research and profit from doing so," U.S. Attorney David M. DeVillers said. "Chen willingly took part in the Chinese Government's long-term efforts to steal American intellectual property. She deserves time in federal prison.""Chen's sentencing today is a recognition of the seriousness of this offense," stated FBI Cincinnati Special Agent in Charge Chris Hoffman. "Chen admitted to abusing the trust of Nationwide Children's Hospital by stealing cutting-edge research to establish a company in China for her own financial gain. This sentence should serve as a deterrent to anyone else committing similar acts that the FBI will work closely with our partners to ensure the United States remains a world leader in science and technology innovation."Chen will forfeit approximately $1.45 million, 500,000 shares of common stock of Avalon GloboCare Corp. and 400 shares of common stock of GenExosome Technologies, Inc. As part of her sentence, she was ordered to pay $2.6 million in restitution.Chen and Zhou were arrested in California in July 2019 and their case was unsealed in August 2019 when they appeared in federal court in Columbus. Zhou has also pleaded guilty and awaits sentencing.David M. DeVillers, United States Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio; John C. Demers, Assistant Attorney General for National Security; and Chris Hoffman, Special Agent in Charge, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Cincinnati Division, announced the plea entered into today before U.S. District Judge Sarah D. Morrison. Assistant United States Attorneys S. Courter Shimeall, Peter K. Glenn-Applegate, Special Assistant United States Attorney J. Michael Marous and National Security Division Trial Attorney Matthew J. McKenzie, are representing the United States in this case.# # #Load-Date: February 1, 2021End of Document

China siege of Taiwan tests Biden's foreign policyCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 2, 2021 TuesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 955 wordsBodyChina's historic conflict with Taiwan could become a turning point for the foreign policy of Joe Biden, who sometimes advocates for China and others supports accusations of genocide committed by Xi Jinping's regime.Tension recently increased the conflict that has been dormant for decades. Taiwan—so far—has the United States, which has provided it with planes, soldiers, weapons, and ships for the dispute over the South China Sea.In this new chapter, the Chinese People's Liberation Army sent more than 11 warplanes on January 23 to fly over Taiwan's air defense zone, the next day they sent another group of 15 aircraft. But the event was not spontaneous: it occurred on the same day Joe Biden authorized the shipment to that maritime area of the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt, accompanied by a cruiser and a guided missile destroyer.The fact is more than relevant to the White House, as Xi Jinping is convinced to re-annex Taiwan to the People's Republic of China and it seems that it will not rest until it is achieved. A Financial Times note mentions a conversation between the pilots of the Chinese H-6 bombers, confirming orders against the simulated target and launching anti-ship missiles at the aircraft carrier.The picture is complicated for President Biden. With only a few days in power he already experiences China's power anxiety and faces the intimidation of the regime. In addition, it strains any approach that the U.S. representative plans with his counterpart Xi Jinping.A historic conflictThe china-Taiwan struggle is over 60 years old. In the first territory, known as the People's Republic of China, Xi Jinping rules; in the other, called republic of China, governs Tsai Ing-wen.This antagonism is complex. Taiwan was recognized as the legitimate government of all of China until 1971 when the UN granted that figure to the Communists in Beijing, the BBC notes. From that country they pressured other governments to recognize it as well. The result complicated things more.In that decade many countries normalized relations with the communist Chinese government, while relations with Taiwan became unofficial. This is the case for the United States and the European Union. Over the years, they maintain diplomacy with the People's Republic of China, but did not depart from Taipei, maintaining economic, cultural and commercial relations.However, both countries maintain a tense coexistence. China also wants to seize the South China Sea to the point that it has built huge military bases on artificial islands, flying over its rival's skies, with the aim of warming spirits and unleashing a conflict that will lead them to seize their neighbor.It is presumed that there are valuable oil and gas deposits in the area, according to the Swiss Info portal. That's why Xi Jinping is looking to step on the claims of Taiwan and other nearby countries such as the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and VietnamIt's here, going over the story, when we see the crossroads for Joe Biden. With just a few days in office, Donald Trump's historic struggle during his four years of rule is already living in his own flesh.The threat beginsIndo-Pacific Command is the U.S. division responsible for overseeing military operations in Asia, from there they reported that the flyover of Chinese aircraft "at no time" posed a threat. But they also do not dismiss signals, warn that such drills are increasing and "only seek to intimidate or coerce those operating in international waters and airspace."This generated a response from the Biden government that was not tooVehement. "We urge Beijing to cease its military, diplomatic and economic pressure on Taiwan," the State Department said, according to the Financial Times.The media adds that China's development of missiles capable of targeting U.S. ships and aircraft in the region has helped counter U.S. military power in Asia and the Western Pacific. Although Chinese experts say Beijing "still unwilling to risk an open conflict with the United States." With these new actions, the People's Liberation Army pushes even more of the United States to "adjust" its stance.In contrast, during his presidency Donald Trump called Taiwan "one of its most trusted partners" against the Chinese communist regime and its growing threat to the region. At the end of 2020 he sent a high-ranking delegation to Taipei, an event that had not occurred since 1979.In addition, in 2019 the Pentagon had announced the approval of an arms sale to Taiwan, subject to congressional approval, worth $2.2 billion, according to the BBC.Trump strengthened this strategic relationship to deal with china's communist regime. David Stilwell, then U.S. Deputy Secretary of State, ratified relations that include military cooperation and collaboration "to counter Beijing's destabilizing behavior."China's warningIn line with this escalation of tensions, Xi Jinping's regime passed a new law authorizing its coast guard to fire on foreign vessels, CNN reported.The legislation came into force on February 1 and also allows foreign structures to be demolished on reefs and islands claimed by China. This new regulation would also include the historic conflict against Japan in the East China Sea."Regular patrols near the Diaoyu Islands will be guaranteed by legislation," the statement reads.A warning against Biden was issued from China. The head of international relations of the Communist Party of China (PCCh), Yang Jiechi, asked the U.S. not to interfere in "internal affairs" such as Taiwan, Hong Kong or Xinjiang, EFE said.The official said that these issues are "sensitive" and that if Washington "does not understand" the damage to relations between the two countries will be "serious."Load-Date: February 3, 2021End of Document

Footwear Distributors & Retailers Issues Public Comment on U.S. Trade Representative NoticeTargeted News ServiceFebruary 1, 2021 Monday 1:42 AM  ESTCopyright 2021 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 5398 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON, Feb. 1 -- Matt Priest, president and CEO of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, has issued a public comment on the U.S. Trade Representative notice entitled "Hearing: 2021 Special 301 Review". The comment was written on Jan. 27, 2021, and posted on Jan. 29, 2021:* * *On behalf of the Footwear Distributors & Retailers of America (FDRA), thank you for the opportunity to participate in the 2021 Special 301 Review.FDRA is the footwear industry's trade and business association, representing more than 500 footwear companies and brands across the U.S. This includes the majority of U.S. footwear manufacturers and over 90 percent of the industry. FDRA has served the footwear industry for more than 75 years, and our members include a broad and diverse cross section of the companies that make and sell shoes, from small family-owned businesses to global brands that reach consumers around the world.Our member companies work hard to design, produce, and deliver shoes to U.S. consumers. Each year, approximately 2.3 billion pairs of shoes cross U.S. borders (or 7.2 pairs of shoes for every man, woman, and child in America). Many of our footwear companies also sell brands that reach consumers in markets all over the world. These companies manage supply chains that span the globe, so they understand the importance of protecting IP and innovation. The U.S. must work to address the failure of other nations to protect patents, trademarks, and copyright in both law and practice, because this supports U.S. footwear jobs and communities.IP enforcement is also essential to consumer protection, safety, and trust. As just one recent example, some FDRA Members have found bad actors making counterfeits of products that are designed and marketed as being made of recycled materials, one of the leading areas of innovation for the American footwear industry. This harms brands, damages consumer trust, and undermines important efforts to achieve greater sustainability in our industry.Strengthening IP protection and enforcement is vital in 2021. With the COVID-19 pandemic, we are witnessing an unprecedented surge in e-commerce, and counterfeiting operations become more prevalent during times of economic uncertainty. As the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) conducts its annual Special 301 Review for 2021, FDRA would like to highlight several global IP trends and country-specific issues of concern to our members.General Comments on Global TrendsFDRA supports USTR's efforts to fight counterfeiting and piracy across the globe. The protection of IP is a cornerstone of the knowledge-based economy and establishes the conditions necessary for innovation. Footwear companies spend hundreds of millions of dollars each year to design, produce, and ship innovative footwear to Americans. Counterfeit footwear threatens jobs in our industry and puts our consumers' trust at risk.FDRA's concerns about global IP protection and enforcement trends fall into four categories:1. Challenges on E-Commerce Platforms: With the significant rise of e-commerce over the past few years, footwear companies have seen a substantial and troubling increase in both unauthorized sales and counterfeiting, as bad actors use popular e-commerce sites to target unsuspecting consumers in the U.S. During the COVID-19 pandemic, e-commerce shipments have grown exponentially.* For online platforms, the seller contact information is not consistently verified and often found to be inaccurate. Even when contact information is available, platforms often do not share full and detailed data on violators with rights owners.* Brands do not have the resources or ability to get in touch with every online seller suspected of selling counterfeit or infringing product to ask for additional information and pictures. FDRA member companies have also discovered that many individuals and entities selling counterfeit or infringing goods on these platforms use false identifies, making it impossible for brands to identify the bad actors. Since individuals often provide cover for commercial activity on platforms, all sellers should be verified rather than select entities with sales over a certain threshold.* Information provided or displayed by platforms may be misleading to consumers, including fulfillment services provided by platforms, the ranking of a good based on sales, or the advertisement of the good on the platform. For example, the product images, reviews, and seller information can be inaccurate and unrelated to the specific seller or product at issue, and references to "replicas" are often overlooked by consumers. Each of these techniques provides a false sense of legitimacy for counterfeit goods sold on platforms.* Under the current court-developed framework for notice and takedown procedures, platforms do not have sufficient motivation to detect and prevent counterfeiting and infringements. They often profit from both the individual sales and by the availability of a broad selection of third-party sellers' products, including counterfeit and infringing goods. In some cases, this encourages platforms to develop long and convoluted notice and takedown procedures for brand owners.* On an annual basis, FDRA member companies are forced to file trademark counterfeiting and infringement lawsuits against thousands of platform sellers alleging direct liability - not secondary liability - for selling counterfeit and infringing goods. These lawsuits are limited in their efficacy because (1) many of these sellers are located in China or other countries and have used false contact info to register with the marketplace; (2) these sellers almost never appear in court and simply default; and (3) the sellers have limited funds in their platform accounts - usually just a fraction of the amount of the judgment our companies are awarded.* For the 2021 Special 301 Report, FDRA encourages the Committee to closely examine the ways in which these current e-commerce challenges directly impact global IPR protection and enforcement.2. Inability of CBP to Seize Goods Based on Design Patent Infringement: Bad actors currently take advantage of a loophole to evade U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and deliver counterfeit footwear to the U.S. market.* Counterfeiters increasingly ship labels and trademark tags separately from infringing products and attach them to the infringing products once in the U.S. market in order to avoid seizure by CBP.* If the labels are seized by CBP, the more valuable fake shoes will still enter the U.S. Under current law, CBP is authorized to seize counterfeit trademarked shoes but cannot seize a shoe that is clearly a copy of a trademark shoe absent the presence of a logo or distinguishing tag.* Bipartisan legislation (S. 2987, The Counterfeit Goods Seizure Act of 2019) was introduced during the 116th Congress. The bill would directly address the current loophole by giving CBP authority to seize based on design patent infringement.* A number of other countries, such as Mexico, India, Japan, South Korea, and the European Union (EU), already allow such design patent enforcement.* FDRA supports the re-introduction of this legislation during the 117th Congress, and we urge the Administration to work with Congress to enact this legislation as soon as possible to give CBP greater authority to address this critical issue for footwear companies and consumers.3. Additional Enforcement Gaps: There are a number of other areas that contribute to the surge of counterfeit footwear entering the U.S. market.* Infringers often use express mail and postal services to deliver counterfeit goods in small packages, making it more challenging for enforcement officials to confiscate these goods. The sheer volume of small shipments makes it impossible for CBP to adequately screen or x-ray all incoming mail to detect such shipments. Almost two million small packages per day already entered the U.S. in 2019, before the COVID19 pandemic exponentially increased the volume of shipments.* The quality of information available to CBP on small parcels is as important as the process used by port authorities to communicate with rights holders. In order to increase the effectiveness of enforcement actions, the ability to track real importers and identify the bad actors, we recommend creating standards and automatization for information sharing between authorities and rights holders. One relevant operational advancement would be to migrate the Customs Notices from physical letters to electronic communication format. CBP should also define standards of the information allowed to be shared, like the details of the intermediaries involved in the importation of the goods. This would facilitate how the IP holders collaborate with the intermediaries in preventing counterfeit goods being shipped from abroad.* Customs officials may also lack sufficient training or knowledge to consider trade dress as a basis for seizure. In today's 21st century retail environment, the way that a brand presents a shoe - from its appearance to packaging - is a critical part of the customer experience. Companies devote significant resources to innovation in this area, which directly impacts a brand's reputation and the relationship it has built with the consumer.4. Inadequate Protections for U.S. Companies in Foreign Markets: In numerous countries, legal and procedural obstacles exist to securing and enforcing trademark rights.* Penalties are often inadequate to deter criminal enterprises from engaging in trademark counterfeiting operations. In many countries, the penalties imposed on these enterprises are so low that they only add to the cost of doing business.* Many countries need to establish or improve transparency and consistency in their administrative trademark registration procedures. Also, at times, the judicial systems in developing nations lack transparency and independence, making it difficult for rights holders to pursue claims. The judicial systems in many countries also lack proper specialization and training on IP rights.* Counterfeiters now commonly register domains that advertise and sell counterfeit goods. Many of these counterfeiters use a country code top-level domain (ccTLD) to avoid detection and to avoid the reach of the U.S. judicial system. FDRA member companies face significant trademark infringement and lose valuable Internet traffic because of misleading and fraudulent domain names, and it can be hard for companies to find relief.* The theft of trade secrets has become an increasingly important issue for global brands. For U.S. companies to grow and compete globally, they must have confidence in the legal protections provided to trade secrets domestically and around the world. At times, foreign governments are complicit in, and even participate in, the theft of trade secrets.Country Specific IssuesAs the U.S. works to strengthen IP protection and enforcement for American workers, businesses, and consumers, FDRA encourages the Administration to enter into new bilateral or multilateral trade agreements that will benefit U.S. footwear companies and consumers and include strong IP protections for a 21st century economy.ChinaFDRA believes the Phase One trade agreement with China is an important first step, but the new Administration should immediately work to negotiate a Phase Two agreement that fully eliminates footwear tariffs and further strengthens IP protection in China.This is key for U.S. footwear companies, because China has a dynamic and growing market of footwear consumers eager to buy U.S. brands and it serves as a key footwear production hub. China has also integrated the use of technology and e-commerce at an incredible pace and scope to deliver products to Chinese consumers. Today, this vast Chinese market involves nearly one-fifth of the world's population.China has made a number of significant improvements in its protection and enforcement of IP rights, and FDRA values the work that the central government has done to raise the importance of IP. The Amendment to the Patent Law, approved in October 2020, included the passage of the Fourth Amendment, which will make the protection of partial designs available in China with the effective date of June 1, 2021. The term of a design patent has also been extended from 10 years to 15 years. In addition, the Implementation of Patent Examination Guidelines, in line with the Amendments, will strengthen the ability to protect and enforce designs in China.More work still needs to be done, however, especially at the local and regional level. FDRA is hopeful that the Chinese government, both at the national and sub-national levels, will over time become increasingly aware of the value - both to Chinese consumers and to the Chinese economy - of vigorously protecting IP rights. FDRA looks forward to seeing continued progress on commitments made by the Chinese government as part of the Phase One trade agreement that seek to address a number of key issues highlighted below.Continued Rise in Counterfeit GoodsBasic IP enforcement in China is inadequate. China is still the number one source of counterfeit and pirated goods imported into the U.S. Within China, local officials often turn a blind eye to counterfeiting activity. Knock-off footwear, purportedly from America's best-known sportswear brands, is commonly found in "brick and mortar" Chinese retailers and in well-trafficked markets such as the Jin Long Pan Foreign Trade Garment Market in Guangzhou, the Luohu Commercial Center in Shenzhen, the Chenghai District in Shantou, the Qi Pu Market in Shanghai, and the Silk Market in Beijing. The Provinces of Guangdong, Zhejiang, and Fujian pose particular challenges for footwear brands, because all three are major footwear hubs, producing both legitimate footwear as well as counterfeit products. In addition, the current regulations related to export declaration by Customs make it difficult or almost impossible to trace back to the real owners when export counterfeits are seized.In FDRA's view, input from the central government is needed to ensure that China's IP laws and regulations are consistently applied. IPR enforcement still does not represent a high priority for some local governments that might perceive it as an obstacle to boosting local economic development. The level of priority, awareness, and expertise of the law enforcement officials also varies in different provinces or cities, with opportunity to improve cross-territory enforcement.An area that is particularly important to brands and consumers is increasing protection for designs and trade dress. Ensuring adequate protection for designs and trade dress drives the innovation and entrepreneurship that will improve conditions for those living in China, and it will help prevent bad actors from defrauding consumers with similar-looking products.Difficulties of the Legal LandscapeIn addition to shortcomings in IP enforcement, China's complex legal landscape poses many challenges for U.S. brands. Because China is a first-to-file jurisdiction, well-established U.S. brands may discover that an unrelated Chinese party has already registered their trademark, seeking to exploit the reputation of the U.S. brand or to force the American company to pay a fee to "buy back" the rights to its own trademark. FDRA member companies have expressed concerns about the significant increase of trademark filings. While there has been a reduction in both filing fees and the average time for the government to review these filings, this high volume makes it easier for bad-faith trademarks to register and gain approval, and this could consequently drive up costs for legitimate U.S. businesses that are forced to oppose infringing marks. There has been little progress on efforts to advance new regulations or legislation to contain bad faith trademark filers that continue to flood the trademark office.U.S. rights holders that endeavor to "work within the system" by filing claims in Chinese court can sometimes face a difficult, unpredictable, lengthy, and costly process, especially if they seek protection from local courts. At times, local courts demonstrate a bias for the local defendant and a lack of understanding of IP matters. As civil actions increase, China should provide IP training to judges and court officials in order to facilitate more consistent application of the law across China, and it should also increase funding and staff to ensure adequate resources are in place for criminal IP enforcement.Current Challenges in Online MarketsThe significant growth in e-commerce creates unprecedented challenges for American companies on both U.S.-based online platforms and global online platforms. Because of the vast size of its population and the integration of technology and e-commerce platforms to reach these consumers, this issue poses a particular challenge in China.As noted in past FDRA Special 301 comments, Alibaba's numerous e-commerce sites continue to serve as a significant and escalating source of counterfeit goods sold to U.S. and global consumers. The company has taken steps to address this issue, including the hiring of a well-respected executive in 2015 to tackle IP infringement challenges, bolstering its hiring of IP enforcement staff, and greater engagement with rights holders. However, much more needs to be done, considering the enormous size of these markets, the incredible potential for abuse, and the exponential growth in counterfeit goods sold on the platforms. Alibaba's Taobao consumer-to-consumer marketplace platform is rife with offerings of counterfeit footwear and other consumer goods, and AliExpress is quickly becoming the number one source of e-commerce in many countries around the world but lacks adequate procedures in place to screen counterfeit products.All Chinese e-commerce platforms need to take a more proactive approach to counterfeit products - an approach that requires filtering and removing illicit products, rather than relying on brands to trigger time-intensive and expensive takedown processes.Collecting evidence and tracing back from online to offline to nail down the source has been a major challenge, with a heavy burden placed on the rights holders. The booming of social media makes this issue even more difficult. As online IPR enforcement has increasingly become a priority, a large number of enforcement officials need to be trained.The establishment of three Internet courts in Hangzhou, Beijing, and Guangzhou helps to reduce the rising number of online disputes between citizens in a time and cost-efficient way thanks to the admissibility of blockchain-backed online data as evidence. We look forward to the courts extending this work to trademark infringement cases soon.Overall, the adequate protection of IP benefits not only rights holders and their American workers, but also benefits legitimate Chinese manufacturers and Chinese consumers. Because of these shared benefits, FDRA and its member companies will continue to work with stakeholders within China to foster improvements in the IP regime.VietnamToday, Vietnam is the second largest supplier of footwear to the U.S. market, providing the U.S. 20.4 percent of footwear by volume and 25.8 percent by value. Excluding China and Vietnam, the rest of the world provides the U.S. only 12.9 percent of footwear by volume and 24.4 percent by value. When the Trump Administration placed 301 tariffs on Chinese-made footwear, many companies moved production from China to Vietnam in an effort to avoid the new tariffs. This accelerated a sourcing shift that was already taking place, as Vietnam has become an increasingly important country for footwear and apparel production.Concurrently, more counterfeiters are also moving manufacturing to Vietnam, where they manufacture not only pure counterfeits but also look-alike knockoffs. It has become even more important for Vietnam to strengthen the IP protections available and align with international practices. Vietnam has recently opened a public consultation to review and update its IP legislation. After years of deliberation, China recently added protection for partial designs into its new Patent Law. Vietnam now also has a key opportunity to include clear definitions for the protection for partial designs into its amendments. Equally important is to clarify definitions such as counterfeit trademark goods to consider trademarks or signs which are identical orhardly distinguishable from a trademark currently protected, without the permission from the trademark owner.On the enforcement side, it is important to highlight that the Vietnamese government has in place an excellent program to control the transshipment of counterfeits from China via Vietnam to Laos, Cambodia, or Thailand. This has established an effective control of counterfeit goods in the South East region. The Vietnamese government also advanced its policies by publishing the Decree 98/2020/ND-CP on August 26, 2020 to address the definition of "quality counterfeit" under Article 192 of its Criminal Code, which was effective on October 15, 2020. This measure, long requested by rights holders, should allow for appropriate criminal prosecution. To this end, it is important to promote technical assistance to build the capabilities for law enforcement and help prosecutors better understand the legal changes and nature of IP rights.MexicoExisting provisions in Mexico's Customs Law only give authorities ex-officio power to initiate boarder measures, but not to make determination, seize, and destroy IP infringing goods. For that reason, goods that are suspected of IPR infringement still must obtain an order from either the IMPI or the Attorney General's Office for inspection and detainment. The administrative action is usually helpful when the infringer is a well-stablished business and there is a way of finding a domicile for notifications. The downside is that, as the proceeding is executed as a trial, the costs are extremely high. As a result, the criminal option has become the preferred go-to action for IPR holders to enforce, especially through the AGO's Specialized Unit dedicated to investigating crimes against copyrights and industrial property. Nonetheless, recent budget cuts by the federal government have impacted the AGO's Specialized Unit activity, reflected in less action towards infringing goods.FDRA encourages the Mexican government to advance its enforcement framework adding power for Customs to seize and destroy counterfeit goods independently. In addition, we encourage the government to work with online platforms for them to proactively i) implement registration requirements for third-party sellers that allow the authentication of both seller and product; ii) block offers for suspicious counterfeit products; iii) ban repeat offenders; and iv) prevent banned offenders from re-registering on the platform in order to reduce the pressure from the increasing volume of small parcels from e-commerce in the system.RussiaMassive markets of counterfeit goods, both physical and online, continue to flourish in Russia. Enforcement procedures are generally slow and inefficient, a particularly negative sign in a country where infringing goods are not only imported but also domestically manufactured. An apparent reluctance by enforcement authorities to take action against large infringers and poorly staffed IP economic crime police has contributed to the deterioration in the level of enforcement.Though the legal system has been improved in certain respects, (e.g., updated and more detailed IP legislation and the creation of IP specialized courts), court proceedings move slowly, and judges remain reluctant to award damages. FDRA is also concerned that the procedure for the destruction of seized counterfeit goods does not provide an obligation to inform the rights holders. Rights holders are not invited to participate in the process and to verify whether the goods are actually destroyed.Meanwhile, enforcement bodies, particularly the police and customs officials, are not active in fighting counterfeiting. Online piracy continues to plague the Russian market, and the government has not established an effective enforcement strategy to combat the growing array of pirate web sites located in the country. Considering the vast size of the Russian e-commerce market, and considering that sporting goods, clothing and footwear are the fastest growing categories, FDRA would suggest that USTR establish a dialogue with the Russian government and enforcement bodies to develop and implement a better strategy to fight against counterfeiting over the Internet. FDRA member companies continue to face a persistent and growing threat of online counterfeiting in, and from, Russia.BrazilGovernment support for IP enforcement is minimal, whether measured in terms of funding or personnel. In addition, a lack of IP expertise amongst judges and law enforcement authorities represents a major obstacle to address IP infringement. The legal system is less than efficient, to put it mildly. In the judiciary of the State of Sao Paulo, for example, IP owners have had difficulty obtaining injunctions to seize counterfeit products. For these reasons, several brand owners have stopped even trying to pursue IP infringement in Brazil, because such efforts commonly result in sustained costs with no tangible results. The government of Brazil also needs to provide adequate resources to address lengthy delays and backlogs in the processing of trademark registrations, design patents, and utility patents. This is critical for footwear companies that rely on trademarks and design patents to protect their innovative products.In addition, because of a complex customs and regulatory system, imported consumer goods in Brazil are often more highly-priced than in other markets. These high prices fuel the smuggling of counterfeit goods onto the black market. FDRA members, which are amongst the more popular consumer brands in Brazil, must often compete with a flourishing black market. In fact, markets for fake goods operate openly in Brazil, most notably downtown in Sao Paolo, where there have been more seizures, but no effective impact on reducing distribution throughout the year. These openly-operating fake goods markets are supplemented by a thriving network of counterfeit goods producers. A very high percentage of the counterfeit goods sold in Brazil are manufactured in Brazil. Nova Serrana city, Minas Gerais State, counts more counterfeit factories than legitimate ones. The United States should pressure Brazil to combat the flagrant manufacturing and selling of counterfeit merchandise throughout the country.The European UnionFDRA member companies have partnered well with European Union-wide entities to coordinate IP policy and to more effectively crack down on trade in counterfeit goods. This has included participation in the multi-stakeholder Observatory on Counterfeiting, established after agreement by EU member states in 2009. The Observatory makes recommendations on EU IP policy and legislation, data collection, and efforts to increase consumer awareness. Through the Observatory and other institutions, FDRA member companies have worked with member states such as France, Italy, the U.K. and the Czech Republic to improve IP enforcement. FDRA members have also noted improvements in online enforcement and an increased focus on IPR issues in Communications and Recommendations published by the EU Commission.Nevertheless, challenges still remain in the EU. First, at the Rotterdam Port, footwear companies have previously expressed concerns that counterfeiting is not considered a priority for Dutch law enforcement authorities (FIOD and Customs). The Rotterdam port and the logistics facilities of the Netherlands play a crucial role in the importation and distribution of counterfeit products throughout Europe, yet very few of the detentions at the Port are of U.S.-branded footwear, even though U.S. brands are among the most-infringed trademarks in the world.In addition, the EU should work to modernize and reinforce its legal framework to better combat online counterfeiting. In past 301 comments, FDRA has recommended the introduction of a duty of care principle, applicable to all actors of the digital value chain. Online platforms should be obliged to act with diligence by taking proactive, reasonable, and appropriate measures in order to protect consumers and IP rights holders against the promotion, marketing, and distribution of counterfeit products. Online platforms should take preventive measures that aim to stop the placement online of counterfeit goods (e.g., filters or measures to secure the traceability of content providers); should take reactive measures to ensure the swift removal of counterfeit goods (e.g., efficient "notice and takedown" mechanisms); and should take follow-up measures to prevent repeated infringements (e.g., suspension of accounts of counterfeit sellers, and the imposition of sanctions from the first attempt to sell or advertise counterfeit goods).IndonesiaToday, Indonesia is the third largest supplier of footwear to the U.S. market, accounting for 5.1 percent of U.S. footwear imports by volume and 6.6 percent by value. As the fourth largest country by population, it also serves as a key market for U.S. brands.FDRA recommend that Indonesia review its trademark opposition proceedings. The Indonesian trademark office has a very narrow interpretation of trademark rights, and in opposition proceedings in general only decide cases in instances where the parties' mark and goods are nearly identical. Since Indonesia is such a large source of manufacturing, machinery, and footwear production knowledge, improving the procedures is critical to preventing infringers and counterfeiters from obtaining "similar" but not quite identical trademark registrations. In addition, the trademark office should allow for the invalidation/cancellation/opposition appeal process. Today, once a decision is made in an opposition, the only additional recourse by the brand owner is to file costly and time-consuming civil litigation.IndiaIndia continues to grow in terms of footwear production for the U.S. market, particularly for leather upper footwear. In addition, India has the world's second largest population. With a growing economy, India will continue to become increasingly important as a key market of footwear consumers. FDRA recommends that India work to effectively implement its IP laws and focus on increasing the number of dedicated officials trained in IP matters. India should also modernize manual procedures for IP protections with its trademark office and elevate protection for famous marks. In addition, the "Famous Mark Registry" would benefit from having rules, standards, and timelines established to allow for brands to in fact be able to participate.ConclusionFDRA appreciates the opportunity to submit comments on the challenges faced by our member-companies around the world in the protection of their IP rights. As leading global innovators, our members are driving advancements in product design never before seen. Our industry stands on the cusp of innovations that will alter the way global footwear manufacturers produce footwear and consumers purchase footwear. Now more than ever it is vitally important that the U.S. government work to protect these innovations, designs, brands, and images worldwide.We stand ready to work with USTR to bolster respect for, and enforcement of, IP by our trading partners. Doing so protects American jobs and benefits U.S. consumers.Sincerely,Matt PriestPresident & CEOFootwear Distributors and Retailers of America* * *The notice can be viewed at: https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=USTR-2020-0041-0001TARGETED NEWS SERVICE (founded 2004) features non-partisan 'edited journalism' news briefs and information for news organizations, public policy groups and individuals; as well as 'gathered' public policy information, including news releases, reports, speeches.

China launches digital health passport for international travelCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 9, 2021 TuesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 412 wordsBodyThe new Chinese digital passport will be used to demonstrate the health situation of international travellersChinese government sources announced the launch of the digital health passport to be used for international travel. The aim of this new technological measure will be to demonstrate the sanitary situation of travellers who go abroad, or enter the country.China hopes that this digital health passport will help to start with greater border opening, and to revive the world economy amid the Covid-19 pandemic.Digital health passport to expose history of vaccination and PCR testingAccording to the Chinese authorities, the digital health passport can be downloaded from a smartphone, allowing all travelers to carry it during travel.The Xinhua press agency detailed that, through a confidential QR code, the digital health passport will allow each country to read information related to Covid-19 vaccination and traveller virus screening results.  "(The) international travel health certificate is a smartphone application that displays and verifies the user's vaccination history and Covid-19 (PCR and antibody) test results." Chinese authorities  In addition, it was also confirmed that the health passport will be available on paper, seeking to make it the "coronavirus health passport" worldwide.Although the health passport is not yet mandatory, and its use is reserved for China,Xinhua noted that, in the country, such QR codes have improved the comfort and safety of travelers in domestic transport, and in their stay in public places, as they "show that the user has not been in contact with a confirmed case of coronavirus, or if they have traveled to a place where contagions have been recorded."China aims to facilitate border crossingThe digital health passport is expected to "contribute to greater opening up Chinese borders, and boost the recovery of the economy in the world."In this regard, Wang Li, China's foreign minister, announced that the country will issue health certificates to "facilitate safe and orderly transit" of all international travelers.Thus, the launch of the digital health passport in China,opens up the possibility of its use widespread abroad to lift travel restrictions to enter or leave the Asian country.For their part, the United States and the United Kingdom are considering launching similar systems for travellers. The European Commission will present the proposal for a "green passport" on 17 March.With AFP information.Load-Date: March 10, 2021End of Document

United States Becomes First Country in World to Declare China's Uighur Treatment GenocideNewsweek.comJanuary 19, 2021 Tuesday 1:56 PM ESTCopyright © 2021 Newsweek Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 498 wordsByline: Benjamin FearnowHighlight: The CCP has committed genocide against the predominantly Muslim Uighurs and other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang," Pompeo said in a statement.BodyThe United States became the first country to officially declare Chinese government of Uighur Muslims an act of "genocide," announcing findings Tuesday which found China's policies toward the minority group are "crimes against humanity."Outgoing Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said U.S. investigation into the Chinese Communist Party's treatment of ethnic and religious minorities found overwhelming evidence China has committed genocide against the Xinjiang region Uighurs. Pompeo said "we are witnessing the systematic attempt to destroy Uighurs by the Chinese party-state" in his Tuesday statement. The announcement is seen as a final scathing blow between outgoing President Donald Trump and Beijing and responds to legislation Congress passed on December 27 requiring the U.S. to determine if forced labor or other alleged crimes were taking place against the Muslim minorities of China."After careful examination of the available facts, I have determined that the PRC, under the direction and control of the CCP, has committed genocide against the predominantly Muslim Uighurs and other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang," Pompeo said in a statement.Pompeo said "these crimes are ongoing" against the Uighur people, referred to in several countries as the "Uyghur" people. The U.S. State Department determined that genocidal acts have been committed in the Xinjiang region since at least March 2017. International activist groups and foreign leaders have condemned China for having complexes in Xinjiang described as, "vocational training centers." These sites are used to stamp out extremist opinions and to teach people new "skills," which many critics have likened to concentration camps."The Chinese Communist Party is not our friend," Pompeo added as words of warning to his successors in the incoming Joe Biden administration. He made a point of reiterating that the U.S. did not make the decision to identify the genocide lightly or for political purposes.The U.S. probe of crimes against humanity in China have received public support from many members of Congress who have chastised American companies for doing business with the Chinese."Reports indicate that the Chinese government is sponsoring forced labor camps for its Uyghur people in support of nearly 100 global brands, including Nike, Apple, Samsung, Volkswagen, and Huawei. This is absolutely horrifying. Protecting human rights is far more important than protecting profit. The world—including business leaders—cannot turn a blind eye toward the Chinese Communist Party's treatment of Uyghurs," Romney posted to Facebook in March.International political leaders and factions such as Britain's Labour party have publicly condemned China's alleged crimes against the Uyghur people, but Pompeo's address solidified the U.S. as the first nation to officially accuse the Communist Party of genocide.This story is developing, please check back with Newsweek shortly for additional information.Link to ImageGraphic uyghur uighur muslim minority chinaDAVID LIU / Contributor/Getty ImagesAn old Uyghur is tested at a temperature checkpoint on June 29, 2020 in Kuqa, China.Load-Date: January 19, 2021End of Document

FCC Commissioner Starks Issues Remarks at American Conference Institute National Forum on Team TelecomTargeted News ServiceMarch 18, 2021 Thursday 11:17 AM  ESTCopyright 2021 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1885 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Federal Communications Commission issued the following remarks on March 17, 2021, by Commissioner Geoffrey Starks at the American Conference Institute National Forum on Team Telecom:* * *Thank you to ACI for inviting me today. I'm excited to discuss Team Telecom and the FCC with you, and am delighted to appear at the same event as my friend and former FCC colleague, Loyaan Egal. It seems like only yesterday that we were investigating universal service fraud issues together. But a lot has changed since then. As the last year has demonstrated, our world has never been more interconnected. Events on the other side of the planet can profoundly affect our way of life in the United States. The communications sector is no exception. Our communications network once consisted of a relatively limited group of American companies that interacted primarily on the basis of trust, not unlike neighbors in a small town leaving their back doors open. As the communications marketplace has evolved with new entrants and new technologies, however, our "neighborhood" has become larger and more dangerous. While the great majority of foreign participants present no security threat, our networks face a rising tide of activity by adversary states and other bad actors intent on compromising Americans' privacy and security. Foreign investment is critical to the growth of the US communications sector. At the same time, however, regulators must ensure that any such investment does not jeopardize our national security. That's why the FCC's partnership with Team Telecom is critical to the future of our communications networks.That partnership begins by recognizing the important role played by both groups in reviewing foreign investments in our communications sector. As a former DOJ official, I value the expertise of our law enforcement, diplomatic, trade, and national security agencies. At the same time, I have an independent responsibility as an FCC Commissioner to assess whether the public interest supports approval of a given application. Both groups must cooperate in their review of foreign investments.Until recently, that review presented some concerns. While the Commission and Team Telecom did their best to communicate and act quickly, applicants properly complained that the process took too long and lacked transparency. Thus, I was proud to support the FCC's action last year to update our procedures. Coupled with an Executive Order clarifying the structure and procedures on the Executive Branch side of the review process, our decision will ensure that foreign investment applications receive a thorough inter-agency review that is clear and predictable, with timely feedback.These modernization efforts are timely. In the last several years, the United States has experienced increased malicious cyber activity by foreign agents seeking to access our networks to disrupt services, misroute information, and monitor private data. Just in the last few months, we learned that an adversary state engaged in a massive hacking attack that compromised the security of thousands of organizations, including many government agencies. And earlier this month, a leading American company disclosed that another adversary state had exploited vulnerabilities in its software to access the email accounts of organizations around the world.Our networks have never faced greater threats, and federal policymakers must work together to ensure that those networks are secure from both external and internal attacks. On that note, my colleagues and I initiated hearings earlier today to determine whether we should revoke the US operating authority of two Chinese-owned telecom carriers and their affiliates on national security and law enforcement grounds. In doing so, we relied on recommendations from Team Telecom, which advised us that these companies are ultimately owned and/or controlled by the Chinese government and vulnerable to its exploitation.Moreover, under Chinese law, the companies must cooperate with their government's demands for network access. These companies, therefore, pose a significant risk to both our national security and law enforcement interests, and mitigation measures are unlikely to effectively address the risks in a manner that would enable their continued operation in the United States. These are only the latest in a series of FCC decisions revoking or rejecting Chinese carriers' authority to operate in the US and constitute an excellent example of how the Commission is working with Team Telecom to protect our telecom networks against foreign adversaries.The threats don't stop at our borders. While these actions focus on removing threats within the United States, we can't neglect other important communications areas that are subject to oversight by the FCC and Team Telecom. I've previously addressed my focus on the international carriage of traffic between the United States and the rest of the world via undersea cables. These cables, which are only about the width of a garden hose, carry 99% of the world's internet traffic. And while they've been important to international communications for a long time, their growing speed and capacity has made them essential to our modern economy and national security.The Commission reviews applications to connect the US with these undersea cables. Because these cables are so important, the Commission and Team Telecom work together to ensure that adversary countries and other hostile actors can't tamper with, block, or intercept the communications they carry. Team Telecom has recently expressed security concerns about proposals from American tech companies and Chinese telecom carriers for undersea cables connecting our countries. I share their concerns, and the need for additional attention here. Just last week, Facebook withdrew its application for a cable between Hong Kong and California. I've also urged taking a closer look at the four existing submarine cables connecting our countries, most of which are partially owned by the same Chinese companies that are the subject of our other revocation proceedings.Let me be clear -- undersea cables connecting the US and China are critical to our shared technological and economic future. However, the FCC and Team Telecom must be confident in the security of our communications over these connections. We also must encourage the growth of competitive alternatives to Chinese-connected cables, so they don't become the least expensive option for all our communications.With the transition to a new Administration, it's timely to consider other national security issues regarding our communications networks. For example, even as the Commission has revoked the authority of Chinese carriers to interconnect with our telecom networks, some of those same entities operate data centers in the United States that are not subject to FCC jurisdiction. As the Department of Homeland Security has warned, these data centers leave their customers vulnerable to data theft because Chinese law requires these companies to secretly share data with the Chinese government or other entities upon request, even if that request is illegal under US law. Currently, the FCC lacks the authority to address this potential national security threat, but as part of any review of our jurisdiction over broadband services generally, the Commission should work with the new Administration and Congress to consider whether the FCC needs broader jurisdiction to tackle this emerging network security issue as well.We also need to continue to address the problem of insecure equipment in our networks. For nearly two years, I've led the call for the removal of Huawei and ZTE equipment from our telecom networks. Telecom carriers throughout the country purchased this equipment lawfully and in good faith, but once policymakers directed its removal, those carriers deserved help with its removal and replacement. Thus, late last year, Congress appropriated nearly $2 billion to fund the replacement of this equipment. The FCC needs to complete its proceeding implementing this legislation and begin the reimbursement process so carriers can remove this equipment and replace it with secure devices.The equipment issues aren't limited to telecom providers. According to one study, we will have more than 25 billion connected devices worldwide by 2025. Networks of IoT devices could help reduce carbon emissions and waste, increase productivity, protect public safety, and generally enhance our way of life. But many of these devices also originate overseas, including from adversary states like China. News reports as recent as last week have highlighted security issues regarding devices like web cameras, wireless routers, and WiFi extenders. The Commission should work with other policymakers and retailers to ensure that all devices connected to our networks meet NIST cybersecurity standards. Failing to do so risks harm not only to the consumers and businesses with insecure devices but to our broader networks as a whole.None of this is unique to the United States. Countries around the world face these same challenges. As President Biden recently said, we should stand "shoulder to shoulder" with our allies and partners to address these issues. That means the FCC must continue and expand its outreach to other countries so we can coordinate our responses and maintain a unified front on national security issues.The FCC should also consider some internal changes. I've encouraged the agency to form a national security inter-bureau task force. The Commission currently reviews national security issues on a distributed basis among its various bureaus. For example, the International Bureau works with Team Telecom on applications to enter the US telecom market, while the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau participates in the National Security Council's NSPM-4 process, and the Wireline Competition and Wireless Telecommunications Bureaus consider national security in license transfers and number portability matters. This distributed structure makes internal coordination challenging and risks inconsistent treatment of national security issues between different bureaus. A national security task force would ensure that the FCC is more coordinated, deliberative, and collaborative in managing the shifting demands of an interconnected world.The Commission also should explore staff details with the agencies that make up Team Telecom. After years of serving primarily as a supporting agency on national security issues, a bipartisan consensus appears to have formed in support of a greater role by the FCC. That requires us to increase our in-house expertise so that we can act with confidence and gain a deeper understanding and appreciation for the work of our partners.As technology continues to evolve and our telecom "neighborhood" continues to expand, the Commission must be collaborative and proactive in preserving national security.

Now to some of the top stories that we're following this morning.Former President Trump's impeachment trial delaying the next round of stimulus checks until next March. Pardon me until March. Cheryl Casone has more on that. Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: That is right Jackie and good morning. Now that the trial is over, lawmakers are on recess until next week and that's delaying Congress's efforts to get those checks to struggling Americans by the end of this month.The checks now possibly delayed until sometime in March as lawmakers continue to hammer out the final details like income threshold. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wants to have the next coronavirus relief package on President Biden's desk before March 14 when extended unemployment benefits expire for millions.Well, President Biden will allow more than 25000 people seeking asylum into the United States from Mexico, beginning the reversal of the Trump administrations 'Remain in Mexico' policy where migrants applying for asylum waited in Mexico while immigration courts considered those applications.That Trump era program enrolled about 70,000 asylum seekers. This week two border crossings are reportedly get a process about 300 people per day. The International Organization for Migration says it will test asylum seekers for COVID-19 before they enter the country.Well Roaring Kitty is set to testify on Capitol Hill.

Thank God, nobody was hurt.CASONE: Yes.DEANGELIS: Thank you so much for that.CASONE: You bet.DEANGELIS: Meantime as we said, the markets are closed today for the Presidents Day holiday but the Futures are looking at a small gain today. You can see the Futures are indicated higher by 141 points. Investors eyeing the week ahead as earnings season starts to wind down.A number of companies reporting this week including CVS Health and Walmart as well. Joining me now Mahoney Asset Management CEO Ken Mahoney. Also joining the conversation all morning The Wallstreet Journal senior writer Jon Hilsenrath and the King's college in Manhattan, Professor of business and economics and Fox news contributor Brian Brenberg.Good morning everyone. Great to see you this morning. Thank you for being here. Ken, let's start with you. Talk about what we're seeing in the markets. Obviously we're just watching futures today. It is a holiday here but new records were set last week and so many folks are wondering. Is this in fact a bubble?KEN MAHONEY, CEO, MAHONEY ASSET MANAGEMENT: I don't know if it's above or not. Behind its stained earnings in the fourth quarter which ended December 31, you're seeing what 90 percent reporting so Walmart, CVS this week kind of finished out their S&P 500 and 82 percent of those companies either match or beat expectations.So it's very real. Yet to have earnings. Again I feel bubbles are out there when you don't have earnings or earnings sustainability or earnings visibility, which now we have that visibility. You know last year around this time, a lot of CEOs said you know we can't give visibility. We don't what earnings are going to be with this pandemic and now you're starting to see some visibility, you're starting to see some of that so look, there are some areas, no doubt.The administration has not gone away from fossil fuels, have gone towards renewables and electric vehicles. Some of those ETFs, individual stocks are going parabolic. So yes, those areas, they are definitely kind of bubblisciuos I guess but in the area as far as the market as a whole, I don't see that because we have low interest rates which again elasticity of earnings and we have really good earnings growth.DEANGELIS: Well, it's interesting and I'm just going to ask you about the earnings picture there because there are some companies that are not giving any guidance at all. Some companies warning you know in certain sectors and industries are going to have to furlough workers because the recovery isn't happening necessarily as fast as everybody expected it to.You know you've got bang out numbers from big tech for example. They've been leading the rally but does that really mean that the health of the whole economy is strong?MAHONEY: Look, you're right Jackie, it's fits and starts. Again while we're talking about earnings in general, of course the big techs have kind of helped out quite a bit. Yes, this is a very difficult environment because we really don't have the haves and have nots. The have nots are clearly you know cruise companies, airline companies, travel, leisure, hotel chains, restaurant chains. I mean unfortunately you know those are still lagging and will continue to lag until we get through the rollout, till we start seeing effects where we really get down to where we can get back to business so to speak.It really is the haves and have nots to your point Jackie and the have's definitely been technology. Stay home economy, the mode economy has really given a lot more demand towards Cloud and AI and Robotics and all these years, they have grown quite a bit fast before the pandemic but now even accelerated more because of this stay at home economy that we're in.DEANGELIS: Yes and Wall Street is also watching Capitol Hill and of course the next round of COVID-19 relief. The markets have pointed higher ahead of the expected $1.9 trillion bill. They definitely are pricing it in. Ken, how do you think that's going to impact the economy? What's your prediction for what happens after that?Usually people you know they're pricing it in. They get excited about it and then what?MAHONEY: Well yes, it feels like a sugar high, right? So I think this is kind of a two-act play sort of play sort of, little pop twist in there somewhere. The first act is the kind of the sugar high, the stimulus.You know people going to Home Depots and Walmarts and Best Buy and use that money, hopefully not buying GameStop with that money and then the second outcome unfortunately maybe the other side of it, how we pay for this. Higher income taxes, capital gains taxes, corporate taxes, more regulations and second act, I don't think investors are going to like that too much.But that's a - right now and yet, we can't look too far ahead but look what's in front of us, moving averages you know as you said, we were setting records and so forth but yes, we got to stay away from looking too far down the road but certainly down the road we're going to have to pay for this in some way.DEANGELIS: We are and another issue that the Fed is going to have to deal with is going to be inflation. Jon Hilsenrath, there's a big debate about whether you know we're going to see that inflation come to the market. The Fed will tell you that they've got it all under control and other people will say well, we keep putting so much, injecting so much money into the economy, it's impossible not to see that happen.JON HILSENRATH, SENIOR WRITER, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Yes you know when I think about inflation, you have to think about prices in different respects, right? So there's consumer prices, that's how the Fed defines inflation. What's happening to the price of dry cleaning or picking up groceries but then you look at asset prices and I think that if we go and what we've seen over the last couple of decades is when we've gotten price pressure, it's been in asset prices and not consumer prices.So I think that's where you get - you potentially get some problems down the road. Now we're seeing an asset price boom right now. The Fed says they're not too worried about it but if the economy's going to get destabilized, it's going to be there. Real estate prices, stock prices, some other realm like that.DEANGELIS: All right, I'm going to thank Ken Mahoney and of course my panel's going to stick around. Gentlemen, great conversation but I do want to get to the Morning Mover this morning because we're watching oil, crude oil prices rising nearly 2 percent, hitting their highest level in over a year.Look at that $60.55 and we're just getting started this morning. Coming up, Cracking COVID conspiracies. Former U.S. ambassador to the Netherlands Peter Hoekstra is here on the AP's new investigation and what China knew about the coronavirus before the world did and next hour former North Carolina Congressman Mark Walker talks about his run for Senate and competition with Lara Trump.Then former Acting ICE Director Tom Homan talks President Biden's reversal of a major Trump era immigration policy and the surge at the border and Arkansas Congressman Rick Crawford is here as well on a new reconciliation package from the House Agriculture Committee.In the 8:00 hour former senior adviser to President George W. Bush, Brad Blakeman on former President Trump's second acquittal and how both sides of the aisle can stand to work together going forward. Don't miss a moment of it. You are watching Mornings with Maria live on Fox business.DEANGELIS: Welcome back. The CDC cost of education after promising to reopen schools in its first 100 days, President Joe Biden is concerned about the high costs in following the Center for Disease Control's guidelines. Biden saying, "We need to move fast in order to get students back in the classroom." Joining me now to discuss Reason Senior Editor Robby Soave. Robby, good morning to you.Your thoughts on this with respect to what the CDC guidelines are. How much it will cost to get everybody back into schools, to do it safely and also this debate about should the teachers be vaccinated?ROBBY SOAVE, SENIOR EDITOR, REASON: Yes, the CDC guidelines will make it extremely difficult to reopen a lot of schools, particularly the six-feet rule is just going to be very hard because I mean in some schools, you'll need twice as much room to accommodate all the students and they just don't have that, which seems a little.I mean it's difficult, right? Because students, young people, teenagers and young girls are not severely negatively impacted by COVID-19, by the disease. They've been more negatively impacted by the mitigation efforts which have kept them out of schools for a year and the Biden administration despite saying, we need to get kids back to school within the first 100 days, well, Jen Psaki clarified now that means - that means half of the schools open one day a week by April 30.DEANGELIS: Right.SOAVE: That's like what, six more days of school maybe, the rest of the school year. That is not - that is not nearly good enough for the kids.DEANGELIS: Right, so reopen for one day a week and check the boxes, we're done, we did what we promised that we were going to do but what's been so difficult to parse through when it comes to reopening schools? How we live our lives just as humans walking around?Some of the misinformation that's out there, different things, conflicting things that we've been told. So for example, you talk about the six-feet social distancing requirement within the classroom. You know I've been thinking throughout the pandemic well, they're saying if you wear a mask when you're inside, you wear a mask when you can't socially distance so shouldn't that be good enough.SOAVE: Yes, it really should be good enough. It's what many other sectors of society are dealing with and handling and but schools are the one place where nothing is good enough to convince teachers, many Teachers Unions that we can reopen and we have to do it. It's like - it's like the kids, the young people are the least prioritized factor in this entire pandemic and they've been out of school for a year.They're going to have negative long term, I think outcomes because of this and short term, their mental health is terrible, school's their social life. I can't imagine having that taken away from you for such a long period of time and with no end in sight. I mean I'm not sure the schools are going to open in the fall to be perfectly honest.DEANGELIS: It's been difficult and Jon Hisenrath, I want to bring you in because I know that you have children and parents out there have been struggling with this. Your thoughts on getting kids back to school, what it's been doing to parents and their home life as well and also with respect to the economy, you got to get kids in school to get the parents back to work.HILSENRATH: Yes, it's - it's a real problem and you know for - it really depends on school - on school districts case by case. You know my youngest boy is in a district with over 100,000 kids and what I've seen is that the school district is solving for the least common denominator which is always keep them at home.You know it's not just how do you get them into the classroom, it's also how do you get them - how do you get them on the school bus? I mean you got kids from different socio economic statuses. It's a major problem but Robby pointed to this and I think it's something people need to be thinking about is even if they get kids back to school within a 100 days, the school year's almost over.We pretty much lost a year at this point of in-person schooling. I think we need to be starting to think about what happens this summer and going into the fall when you know kids would be out of school anyway. We want parents as you say to get back to work.What are we going to do with our kids during this summer? I think we need to be having that conversation too.DEANGELIS: That's part of the conversation and how they're going to catch up on everything that they missed this past year and if this bleeds into next year. Meantime I want to shift gears for a moment because Minneapolis planning to spend $6.4 million to hire more police with the city losing almost 200 officers after last spring's riots.Robby, real quick, what do you think about refunding the police after you defunded the police?SOAVE: Yes, it's interesting because it's an activist slogan among a certain progressive mindset but if you talk to the people in the communities often, they don't want the police defunded. They know they need the police and then this is - this is related by the way, the uptick we've seen in crime this year, last year.It's part of pandemic mitigation, right? Teenagers not in school, people - adults not working. There - some of that is - that's going to lead to people committing crime because they should have been in a structured environment and they're not and you took that away from them.So all of these things are related and certainly the push to totally abolish the police has not actually been helpful to the people who live there but we got to be - you know we got to be very concerned about it's not anywhere near like as large as crime was back in the 80s or early nineties but that that was - we do not want to see that reversal impact the entire country.DEANGELIS: And Brian, I want to bring you in here because you were from Minnesota and Brian is also in the studio with me. This is the first time I've been in the studio with someone in about a year but we are socially distanced. You know your thoughts on this as somebody who comes from that state?BRIAN BRENBERG, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: That community Jackie has been so whipsawed by this situation. So you have the defund movement. You had hundreds of police officers say I'm out, retire, medical leave and the community was left sort of in chaos and now you have areas in that community where businesses simply haven't come back.People won't go down to do business. Lake Street is a ghost town right now so the movement was so destructive in terms of reducing confidence and that confidence hasn't come back. Now you see the communities saying we need the police officers but what police officers want to come back to that? That's the question right now.DEANGELIS: Yes and it's tough for people to feel safe and that's all they want right now. We will continue this conversation but Robby, I want to thank you for joining us this morning. Great to see you. Thank you so much.SOAVE: Thank you.DEANGELIS: Coming up, beating impeachment again. Former President Trump acquitted in the second impeachment trial. We talk agenda items Congress should now put the focus on. That's next. Plus a royal surprise. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have something to smile about this morning. We're going to tell you about it ahead.DEANGELIS: Former President Donald Trump was acquitted by the Senate in a second impeachment trial on Saturday. The vote failing to achieve the two- thirds majority needed to convict the former president of inciting January's capitol riots.With the controversial trial now in the rear view mirror, Congress is going to focus on the agenda ahead of President Biden. On Sunday Morning Futures, Maria spoke with Alan Dershowitz about why the acquittal was good for the constitution. Take a look at this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ALAN DERSHOWITZ, HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR EMERITUS: Well, first of all, I think it was a great day for the constitution yesterday and I think a great day for Mitch McConnell because he taught us a civics lesson. You don't have to support President Trump or Donald Trump. You don't have to agree with his speech to support the first amendment and to support the constitution and its limitations on the power of the Senate to put a former President on trial.McConnell accepted the constitutional argument I've been making from the very beginning that Congress has no power to put on trial, Citizen Trump.(END VIDEO CLIP)DEANGELIS: Brian, with impeachment now over of course, the focus is going to be on the Biden agenda, what they can get done here, how they can pass policy in a bipartisan way. Your thoughts.BRENBERG: Well, that's an interesting thought, the bipartisan policy approach. I think that's one of the reasons that you know, we were talking about after the impeachment what's going to happen. Are Republicans going to be able to unify? Will they be divided?I think Republicans are going to be able to unify out of this. I think they're looking at a Biden agenda that has not been bipartisan, has no intention of being bipartisan and presents a lot of issues that Republicans can rally around against. So look coming out of this, I actually see a lot of momentum for Republicans and I think it's going to leave Democrats searching just a little bit because they don't have that bipartisan branch to reach out with and so they're sort of left where we go from here?Trump was our unifier but that issue seems to have passed.DEANGELIS: Well Jon, Biden got out there and he said I'm going to unify. I'm going to pass policy in a bipartisan way. I'm going to work with both sides of the aisle. We haven't seen that so far.HILSENRATH: Yes and I think it's going to be very hard for Democrats to do that and I think you know the one thing you're going to be able to get Republicans to rally around is opposing President Biden. You know, I think the other piece that we have to look at is you know President Trump was - former President Trump was acquitted and I think we're now going to be looking at what is the future of the Republican Party look like.What is its identity going to be and two presidents are going to hang over it. You know one is opposition to Biden but the other is what is the role of Donald Trump in the future of the Republican Party. I think we're going to see that playing out. You know we have a story in the Journal today about candidates already running for 2022 on an agenda of pro-Donald Trump.So, his acquittal keeps him I think very much in the political scene in Washington and we might see Democrats unifying against that as well so bipartisanship, I'll believe it when I see it.DEANGELIS: We will be watching very closely guys but coming up on the show, we're also watching bitcoins bounce. The cryptocurrency hitting another record. We've got the latest there. Plus calling all drivers. Planters needs a new nut mobile driver. How to sign up for that? It's making a buzz this morning. We're going to tell you all about it.DEANGELIS: Welcome back, I'm Jackie DeAngelis in for Maria Bartiromo today, it is Monday, February 15th, and it is Presidents' Day. And markets in the United States are closed today in observant of Washington's birthday. But there is futures trading and you can see they're looking higher at the moment, the Dow indicated higher by about 155 points. Now, stocks are finishing in record territory. They finished there on Friday with all three major averages ending the week up at least 1 percent, so strong U.S. markets. The European markets all pointing up this morning as well. Take a look there, green across the board with the FTSE seeing a 100- point gain.In Asia overnight, the Shanghai and the Hang Seng closed today for the Lunar new year. The Nikkei and the Kospi both higher with vaccine rollouts across the globe boosting optimism over the COVID-19 recovery. Tensions of course rising as China accuses the United States of gravely damaging relations amid the coronavirus pandemic. Cheryl Casone has the details for us, Cheryl?CASONE: That is right, Jackie. The World Health Organization's fact- finding mission into the origins of COVID-19 sparking an international war of words. Over the weekend, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan says the Biden administration has deep concerns about the way in which the early findings of the COVID-19 investigation were communicated. The question is, the process used to get to those findings, a report suggest the outbreak was much larger in Wuhan, in December 2019 than previously reported by China. Investigators are now seeking access to hundreds of thousands of blood samples from that city.Well, Bitcoin sliding back after hitting record highs on Sunday. Cryptocurrency dropping as much as 6.1 percent since reaching nearly $50,000. Bitcoin growing more than 60 percent so far this year with the financial industry embracing the currency. Right now, it is at 47,000 and change, though still close to those all-time highs from the weekend. Meanwhile, Dogecoin is having a moment. Elon Musk announcing that the cryptocurrency would have his full support if major holders sold off their coin to avoid too much concentration. Dogecoin which has dog mascot has grown in popularity recently as part of the same movement that saw investors flock to GameStop. Another stocks from social media.And finally this, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are expecting their second child. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex sharing this picture on social media. The couple are already parents to son Archie who by the way turns two this May. They currently call California home, Jackie, after stepping down from their royal duties last year. They do make cute babies. Back to you.DEANGELIS: They do. And I wonder if this time they will have a girl. I will say I'm a sucker for little girls. Cheryl, thank you for that. Meantime, China's role in COVID-19 conspiracies, the "Associated Press" publishing a nine-month long investigation indicating that China played a lead role in spreading misinformation about the deadly virus. The probe noting that after China's foreign minister spread rumors of U.S. development of the virus in March, hash tag about the rumor was spread 314 million times on the Chinese social media app Weibo. This comes as the head of the World Health Organization mission investigation that investigated the virus says COVID may have been more widespread in its early days, claiming that there were more than a dozen unique strains in Wuhan in December of 2019.Joining me now, former Ambassador to the Netherlands, former Michigan Congressman and House Intelligence Committee Chairman and Center for Security Policy Board Advisor's Chairman Peter Hoekstra. Peter, good morning to you. Let's start with the China conversation, obviously, we know that the virus came from Wuhan. We know that China knew how to lock Wuhan down at least internally with respect to people traveling in and out. But they let people get on planes and take the virus with them essentially around the world. At this point, now they're trying to say that the United States started the virus. I mean, this is really -- it's really crazy when you think about it.PETER HOEKSTRA, CHAIRMAN, CENTER FOR SECURITY POLICY BOARD OF ADVISORS: No, it really is and we heard this in Europe, you know, for the whole last year. You know, it's the U.S., they're responsible or you know, it's not as in these type of things, it's a consistent message. The Chinese Communist Party has been shaping this narrative through every avenue that they could, whether it was the World Health Organization, whether it was through international media, whether it was through foreign governments, pressuring foreign governments to say positive things about China's performance with the COVID virus for these countries to be able to get the personal protective equipment that in some cases was only available from China. They're very good at, you know, putting their narrative out there.DEANGELIS: And the World Health Organization, which by the way we give hundreds of million dollars to. Former President Trump got out of it, wasn't paying the dues, President Biden now saying we're getting back into it. And they are sort of supporting these theories.HOEKSTRA: They do. I mean, again, what we saw was the World Health Organization really becoming a mouthpiece for the Chinese Communist Party. It's one of the reasons that the, you know, the Trump administration decided to pull out of the World Health Organization, and it's amazing that, you know, they're now doing a study, a year later, why wasn't the World Health Organization in there in January of 2020? Why was the Chinese government not allowing independent investigation to occur in Wuhan early last year, to go in and to get in front of this crisis rather than now looking back, you know, 12, 13 months later after China has had the opportunity to really -- and to shape the evidence, to come up with whatever answer they want to have these researchers come up with today.DEANGELIS: Want to shine a light on it, and they didn't want anybody in the world really knowing what was happening. The best way to do it, to keep a secret was to keep it secret and keep it locked down. Meantime, Brian, I want to talk to you about this because when we talk about the economy, the global recovery, we are so interconnected to China. You know, it's going to be difficult to rebound without the two parties working together. At the same time, we want to take a harsher stance on a country that we consider a foe. So, how does the new administration handle this?BRENBERG: Well, what's really difficult here is China doesn't seem to have a strong interest in telling the truth or revealing what's actually going on. So, from a global perspective, it's hard to figure out how you interact with a country, how you trade with the country that seems to have zero interest in doing it on a fair basis. But what a lot of people worry about is, are we going back to the status quo now? You know, things changed under President Trump, the relationship with China became much more stand-offish, but because we were growing in our recognition --DEANGELIS: Well, someone pushed back for the first time.BRENBERG: But now the question, going back to the status quo where China gets -- to the ambassadors point, where they get to tell the narrative they want to tell --DEANGELIS: They want, right --BRENBERG: Where they get to put the squeeze on countries to promote what they're talking about. I think that's a real risk here, and it's a real risk to the global economy because you can't trade, you can't do business when you fundamentally cannot trust what your partner is saying.DEANGELIS: And this is really interesting, and it ties in because we were also watching the fact that Iran halting its nuclear inspections. Tehran saying that it's going to stop the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog from inspecting its facilities beginning on Sunday unless all parties including the United States return to the 2015 agreement. Former President Trump pulled out of the nuclear deal back in 2018. Ambassador, your thoughts on this because it reminds me of what's exactly sort of what's happening with China here, it's almost like a quid pro quo. You know, President Biden, we're going to tell you what to do.HOEKSTRA: Well, what they're doing is they're testing the Biden administration. You know, last week, the Biden administration delisted the proxy for Iran and Yemen, it's no longer a terrorist organization. They're seeing how far they can go. You know, will they actually get back to the point where the Americans put a bunch of money on an airplane -- on you know, on pallets loaded on an airplane and send it over to Iran. They are testing, they know that this administration is rolling back many of the Trump initiatives, and they're trying to get back to the agreement, even though for the last four years, we've consistently seen Iran cross one red line after another in their nuclear program.They're seeing exactly how far they can go. They're testing the Biden administration right now.DEANGELIS: And Jon, I want to get your take on those tests, whether they come from Iran, whether they come from China. They pose a threat of conflict, of course, and the markets always react to that. So how do you think going forward, Wall Street investors are going to be looking for in relations with respect to making decisions?HILSENRATH: You know, I think you have to take Iran and China separately. Iran has been basically cut off from the global economy for years. China, as you mentioned is right in the center of the global economy, and for me, the big question and the big test is, what do America's companies do here? So, you know, they've invested so aggressively, they've put such a big footprint in China, and they now have a decision to make. Do they want to bet on China and all the growth that they thought, and the low cost labor they thought they were getting from there?Or did they say, you know what? China hasn't been playing by the rules of the game, and we got it, we have to diversify out of this place. And I think the onus is right now in American boardrooms to decide what side they're on in all of this.DEANGELIS: All right, gentlemen, we're going to have to leave it there, but my thanks of course to Ambassador Peter Hoekstra. Great to see you this morning. Thank you. Coming up on the show, getting back in the air, we are looking at the White House meeting with airline executives as they consider testing for domestic travelers. That's coming up next. Then the new face of 9 to 5, we've got all of the ways the pandemic has changed the regular workday, it is making a buzz this morning. Plus, a programming note, Larry Kudlow joining the Fox Business family. Kudlow premieres tomorrow at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time. He's going to be speaking with former Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin in his first interview since leaving the White House. You don't want to miss it. You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.DEANGELIS: Good morning and welcome back. Airline industry is under strain. Leaders of major U.S. airlines meeting with White House officials last week, pushing them not to require a COVID testing for domestic flights, arguing that it would further devastate the already fragile industry. Joining me now, former Spirit Airlines CEO and the Sterling Team operating partner Ben Baldanza. Ben, good morning, great to see you. Talking about the airlines here and this administration that says it wants to follow the science, but when I look at the numbers with respect to what's happening with COVID transmission and airlines, there really is no proof similar to what we've seen in restaurants, for example, that is increasing the spread. Your thoughts?BEN BALDANZA, FORMER SPIRIT AIRLINES CEO: Well, thank you, Jackie, it's great to be with you. Yes, if you follow the science, it would say that inside an airplane, it's one of the safest places you can be outside of your home. There have been virtually no transmission on board an airplane. The few cases that have happened were before airlines mandated masks on airplanes. So if you require testing to get on domestic flights, you'd be diverting really important testing resources, almost needing to double the amount of tests done every day. By the time we get to the Summer, for some people who have already been vaccinated and to move into an environment where the likelihood of transmission is really low. It's really kind of crazy policy.DEANGELIS: And you've got airlines obviously, you know, scrambling and trying to look ahead, trying to figure out what the demand is going to look like, and we're seeing conflicting messages. For example, American warned that it may have to furlough 13,000 workers, but then Spirit Airlines is saying, no, we're going to see a pick up here and we should be hiring more. So how do -- as we, as investors, how do we know how to read this?BALDANZA: Well, that's a great question, and it really comes down to different business models. Carriers like American and United and Delta are very dependent on business travel and business citizens are not really traveling that much right now. The travel that's making up people who are flying right now are mostly people visiting friends and relatives. We're not yet into family vacations, and carriers, lower-cost carriers like Spirit or JetBlue or frontier or something, they live more on leisure kind of traffic. So they can be more aggressive in this environment. I expect the low fare carriers to actually pick up share in this environment because their business models are more attuned to the kind of traffic that we're seeing now and likely to see just in the post-COVID period.DEANGELIS: That is such an interesting point. Meantime, the house committee last week approving a proposal, giving airlines another $14 billion in payroll assistance as part of President Biden's $1.9 trillion relief bill. This would be the third round of support for the pandemic-hit industry. How crucial is this aid to the industry in your opinion?BALDANZA: Well, in my opinion, Jackie, it really comes down to employment. It's what this money would be used like it was the first two times, is to keep people employed without this -- and others have said, employees would be furloughed again because they're not needed for the amount of flying out there. So, if the airlines furloughed the employees, they go on an unemployment insurance, and they get the taxpayer money that way. Through this kind of way, they stay employed, they stay current in their job and it's a little better. But if you think about it, think of the two things we've talked about here. One policy is give airlines money to keep people employed, the other would be an act of policy of testing that would require that airlines get rid of people --DEANGELIS: Right --BALDANZA: Because demand would drop.DEANGELIS: It would make it much harder.BALDANZA: It can be because this is --DEANGELIS: Well, it is, and you know some people would say well, it's not so much about the testing, it's really about prevention, and we're looking at, you know, the rest of the year as we see vaccine distribution happening, it's progressing. Do you think that as we see more people become vaccinated and maybe there's some sort of COVID passport that says you know, you got your stamp and you got your shots, that the demand for travel will build up?BALDANZA: Well, that certainly will help, but what will help the most is when things open up again. I might be willing to fly on an airplane, and I might be vaccinated -- even though I'm not, but I might be vaccinated here, have a stamp that says I was, but I still have to have some place to go, so where I land, if I go to New York, I'm going to want to go see a show, I'm going to want to go to a restaurant, I'm not going to want to quarantine for two weeks, if I go to Orlando, I'm going to want to go to Disney or something. And so, those things have to happen, so it's not just individuals get vaccinated, but enough people get vaccinated that legislators can say it's OK to start opening up again. Those two things are both going to be necessary to bring travel back.DEANGELIS: Well, Ben, if you're traveling, don't come to New York, Broadway is not open, not much is open here, although we can dine indoors finally at 25 percent capacity, and people are very excited about that. But all the New Yorkers apparently have gone down to Palm Beach where it's buzzing down there because of a different rule policy, and not necessarily more cases of the virus. So really interesting stuff. Great to see you this morning, thank you, Ben.BALDANZA: Thank you, Jackie. Great to be with you. Stay safe.DEANGELIS: OK. Coming up, call in all drivers, Planters needs new nut- mobile drivers. How to sign up, and I'm wondering if I can submit people that I know. It's making a buzz this morning, we're going to tell you about it coming up next.DEANGELIS: It's time for the Morning Buzz. First up, the 9 to 5 work day is dead. That was a statement made from Salesforce president last week as more companies move away from traditional work day hours. In a Pew Research Survey, 54 percent of Americans would consider working from home after the pandemic if given the chance. Tech giants believe giving people freedom to work remote will boost effectiveness. Jon, 9 to 5, is it a thing of the past? I mean, people that can do it seem to really like it.HILSENRATH: I'd say rest in peace. I think it would be great if it was gone. You know, I think we have -- we have two kinds of workers now, shift workers and 24/7 workers who get to choose what part of the 24/7 they're working in. The other thing, with all respect to Brian that I hope is dead with this pandemic is the necktie. It looks great on you, but I'm just tired of tying knots around my neck, and I hope never to have to wear one again.DEANGELIS: It's fair enough, I literally have a friend who is considering moving to the Bahamas because she can work from anywhere. It's really remarkable. Next step, the dream job for peanut lovers. Planters looking for recent college grads to come on board -- or several of them, come on board the nut-mobile, spread the good word on all things peanuts for a year. You would travel across the country, appear at events, store, grand openings and train at peanut prep. All you need is a bachelors degree, a drivers license and a desire to talk about Planters for 365 days. Brian, it sounds like you have to be a bit of a nut to do that.BRENBERG: Well, I think this job is for Jon because you don't have to wear a necktie for this one. So Jon, that's where you go right here. Look, I would love to have this job. It's a 12-foot high, 13,000-pound vehicle, so you've got to have some good training. The problem is they're only making it available to recent college grads.DEANGELIS: Yes --BRENBERG: What's up with that? I think they should have an experienced driver behind the wheel on this thing, and I'm ready for it. Let's do it.DEANGELIS: You can stand up and talk about knots --HILSENRATH: Hey, Brian, this --DEANGELIS: For 365 days.HILSENRATH: I got two problems with this job, one is based on that picture, you've got to be able to do a handstand and I haven't done one of those in a long time.(LAUGHTER)The other is you have to look happy with your hands flying in the air, I could -- I can't do that all day, you know, 365 days a year --BRENBERG: Oh, come on, Jon. You are happy guy, Jon. You'd be great at that job. Mr. Peanut --HILSENRATH: I've got to have my grunchy days.DEANGELIS: I think you're both great, and you'd be great at it. But you've aged out, sadly. So, we'll see, we'll --HILSENRATH: Thank you very little.DEANGELIS: We'll see who ends up getting it. All right, still ahead, earnings season wrapping up as U.S. investors await another round of stimulus. The "WORD ON WALL STREET" is ahead. It all starts next hour on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.Load-Date: February 15, 2021End of Document

China-ASEAN Economic and Trade Cooperation Annual News ASEAN TribuneMarch 25, 2021 ThursdayCopyright 2021 ASEAN Tribune All Rights ReservedLength: 1131 wordsBody 25 March 2021 (China - ASEAN Business Council) In 2020, China and ASEAN further intensified their economic and trade exchanges and cooperation, overcoming various difficulties, striving to take off, and achieving remarkable breakthroughs, becoming a rare bright spot in the global economy. The China-ASEAN Report and the China-ASEAN Business Council jointly selected the top ten news about economic and trade cooperation between the two sides in 2020, hoping that readers can get a glimpse of the magnificent achievements of China-ASEAN economic and trade cooperation.1. For the first time, China and ASEAN are each other's largest trading partnersUnder the impact of the new crown pneumonia epidemic, the economic and trade cooperation between China and ASEAN has not fallen but increased. According to China Customs statistics, in 2020, the import and export volume between China and ASEAN is 4.74 trillion yuan, an increase of 7% year-on-year.

The Lancang-Mekong cooperation has made great progress in linking up the new international land-sea trade channelThe "New International Land-Sea Trade Corridor" runs through the western region of China, connecting Southeast Asia and Eurasia. The land-sea agglomeration and regional linkage effects are prominent. The Lancang-Mekong cooperation and the "new international land-sea trade channel" will further unblock trade channels, mobilize the power of western China, southwestern China and other ASEAN countries, achieve greater investment in Mekong countries, further optimize resource allocation, and maintain industrial chain supply The chain is stable and promotes coordinated development.6. China-ASEAN cooperation in fighting the epidemic has injected strong momentum into bilateral relations.During the epidemic prevention and control period, the Chinese and ASEAN governments and people united and helped each other to overcome difficulties, deepened cooperation in the field of public health, and became a model of global solidarity in fighting the epidemic. Chinese companies have carried out extensive cooperation with pharmaceutical companies in ASEAN countries. In addition to supplying vaccines at the procurement level, China has also transferred upstream technologies such as vaccine R and D and production to them, which will help improve local vaccine production capacity and is a strong support for regional anti-epidemic cooperation .7. China-Cambodia free trade agreement signedOn October 12, China and Cambodia formally signed a free trade agreement. The China-Cambodia Free Trade Agreement is the first free trade agreement to establish a separate chapter for cooperation on the "Belt and Road" initiative.

ASEAN has become a key area for Chinese enterprises to invest abroad, and has played an active role in promoting economic recovery in the region and stimulating employment.9. China and ASEAN countries establish a "fast channel" for personnel exchangesOn June 8, China and Singapore launched a fast channel to facilitate the exchanges of necessary business and civil servants between the two countries. Subsequently, fast channels between China and Indonesia, Laos and other ASEAN countries have also been opened, which has become a normalization of epidemic prevention and control. China and ASEAN countries resume exchanges and cooperation and support important measures to resume work and production.10. The China-ASEAN Expo was successfully heldFrom November 27 to 30, the 17th China-ASEAN Expo and China-ASEAN Business and Investment Summit were successfully held.

Biden's Asia Policy Czar Was An Executive Of Group With Chinese Communist Party Ties: ReportThe Daily CallerJanuary 27, 2021 Wednesday 05:39 PM ESTCopyright 2021 The Daily Caller, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: DAILY-CALLER-NEWS-FOUNDATION; usLength: 559 wordsByline: Thomas Catenacci, Reporter, tcatenacci@dailycallernewsfoundation.orgBodyLink to ImagePresident Joe Biden's Asia policy czar pick was a top executive at a non-profit foundation that had direct ties to the Chinese Communist Party, The Washington Free Beacon fist reported Wednesday.President Joe Biden's choice to head Asia policy Kurt Campbell served on the board of the U.S.-China Strong Foundation as vice chairman until August 2020, The Washington Free Beacon reported. The group is funded by Chinese-American philanthropist Florence Fang, a leader of the National Association for China's Peaceful Unification (NACPU), which is controlled by China's international propaganda agency the United Front Work Department (UFWD).“The indicators suggest that the U.S.-China Strong Foundation could be a [Chinese Communist Party (CCP)] front group, or so heavily influenced by the CCP as to be tantamount to a front group,” Anders Corr, an intelligence analyst, told the Free Beacon. (RELATED: Biden Says He'll Be Tough On China - His Record Says Otherwise. Here's How Biden Got It All Wrong On China)The UFWD works to “co-opt and neutralize sources of potential opposition to the policies and authority of its ruling [CCP],” according to a 2018 U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission report. The department works to suppress opposition groups in China and to conduct influence operations on foreign soil.Link to ImageKurt Campbell, former assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs prepares to shake hands with China's Vice Foreign Minister Cui Tiankai before a meeting at the Chinese Foreign Ministry in Beijing on Oct. 11, 2011. (Ng Han Guan/AFP via Getty Images)Campbell's U.S.-China Strong Foundation has previously appeared to celebrate CCP achievements and policy priorities, according to the Free Beacon. The foundation celebrated the 90th birthday of the People's Liberation Army and, on multiple occasions, Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative, an infrastructure project that was recently condemned by the State Department.The NACPU supports the “One China Principle,” the idea that Taiwan is a territory belonging to China. The State Department designated the NACPU a foreign mission in October, Reuters reported.In August, around the same time as Campbell left U.S.-China Strong, the foundation's website appeared to vanish, according to the Free Beacon. The website currently leads to a webpage that says the domain cannot be found.Campbell was a State Department official in former President Barack Obama's State Department and advised the Biden campaign on Asia policy.The foundation's Twitter profile says its mission is to “strengthen American capacity to understand China by investing in a new generation of leaders who have the knowledge and skills to engage with China.”Campbell spearheaded the the group's founding in 2013, the Free Beacon reported. Other leaders of the foundation include Ronnie Chan, a former Hong Kong government official and registered foreign agent of the Chinese government, and Cindy Mi, whose educational company fired teachers for teaching about the Tiananmen Square massacre, according to The Epoch Times.Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Coronavirus: China, the first country to launch the use of a vaccination passportCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 9, 2021 TuesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 425 wordsBodyChina's authorities have announced the launch of a COVID-19 vaccination passport to facilitate travel to its citizens and to slow the progress of the coronavirus in the midst of a pandemic.At a press conference, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian has detailed that it is an electronic health certificate for citizens who want to travel abroad. It will also include information on the tests and tests carried out on each person."The pandemic is still with us, but the world economy needs to start over and people-to-people meetings must resume without further resignation," said the spokesman.Thus, he explained that as countries implement vaccination efforts, "mutual recognition of these campaigns has become part of the new health codes between different countries.""To help the global economic recovery and facilitate cross-border travel, the Chinese government has decided to launch this vaccination certificate for travellers," he said before noting that it will be available in two formats: one digital and one on paper.In this regard, it has nuanced that the information will be encrypted in a QR code that can be verified, decrypted and read by the relevant authorities when necessary.In addition, it stated that the Chinese Government was ready to address with other countries the establishment of a "recognition of mechanisms" on health codes in relation to "current concerns" under the pandemic."This will facilitate visa issuance and make travel between countries simpler, which will contribute to new safer and more orderly meetings," he concluded.On the last day, the country has reported 17 new cases of coronavirus from abroad, according to data from the Asian giant's Ministry of Health.On the other hand, the total number of positives for COVID-19 stands at 90,002, including 180 people who are under medical care.

Cashless Systems have a CostBagpipe, The: Covenant CollegeMarch 30, 2021 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2021 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: OPINIONS; Pg. 1Length: 758 wordsByline: Ethan BrownBodyIn 1946, a man named John Biggins created the first cashless credit system that allowed customers at his bank to pay local merchants through their account rather than with cash. Since then, America has progressed towards ever more cashless methods of payment. Physical currency was designed to represent wealth and ease bartering. Beginning with precious metals as coinage with actual value, money progressed into a representation of the precious metals through the use of clad coinage, and, eventually, paper money alternatives. Many view cashless systems as the next step in the process of monetary evolution. Cashless systems, however, may mean the loss of freedom and privacy, and open an easy path for totalitarian control of the people.A cashless society is a country that has ceased to use any form of solid currency. Instead, wealth is transferred through a credit system, phone apps, or fingerprint and facial recognition technology. The absence of physical money has many benefits for the consumer and their government. Under a cashless system, payment transactions are quick and secure. Facial and fingerprint technology is virtually unhackable. Without cash, all criminal activities and corruption would be easily traceable. According to Paul Armstrong, a contributor to Forbes, and Mehul Desai, a contributor to the World Economic Forum, crimes, robbery, fraud, tax evasion, bribery, and illegal drug deals would be greatly reduced.A cashless system, though, comes with a great risk to individual freedoms that negate these potential benefits. All transactions would be traceable and monitored by the government and/or private corporations that would have the power to deny transactions. Your wealth would be completely under someone else's control, and they would decide how you could use it. Business Insider author Alexandra Ma cites numerous examples of Chinese financial control initiatives stopping purchases of merchandise and services based on the individual's social score, even stopping families from sending their children to better schools.China's current economic system demonstrates how quickly a cashless system can destroy individual freedom and infringe on human rights. Cash in China is becoming extremely rare. Instead, most of China utilizes a social credit system. This system creates a score for a person based on their social behaviour. A person can raise his credit by following traffic regulations, having and retaining a decent job, and even watching Xi Jinping give a speech. A person's social credit is negatively affected by poor driving, criminal history, browsing history, social media posts and laziness. In most cities, China has established a facial recognition system that tracks the patterns of each citizen such as locations they frequent or roads they commonly use, and monitors any irregularities in patterns, alerting law enforcement whenever one is detected.A person's social score determines what they are permitted to purchase. In some cases, individuals are prohibited from making travel-related purchases and prevented from buying property regardless of whether or not they can afford it, according to Business Insider. Even internet access can be restricted. By blacklisting the credits of reporters who criticize the Chinese government, news that is not approved can effectively be minimized from public viewers. The system is rapidly becoming a totalitarian's dream.Under China's cashless system, you are not the one deciding how to spend your money. Instead, either the government or a private corporation has that authority. In China, currency is used to control citizens' behavior.In the United States we have already seen this happening on rare occasions. PayPal has closed accounts associated with hate groups and has also denied service to conservative organizations. According to the National Review, banks have denied loans to firearm companies that produce controversial products. While public outcry and legal actions have limited these actions, a cashless society would undoubtedly make service discrimination easier.The development of the Chinese system should serve as a warning for mistaking a cashless society as merely monetary progress and not a potential nightmare. There is little privacy in the Chinese system: your actions are reviewed and judged by the ones who control your money. What freedom is left is reserved for the social elite. Financial incentive has proven very effective at controlling people's behaviors and eliminating any noncompliance with the system.Load-Date: March 30, 2021End of Document

Elon Musk responds to spying concerns in China: Trust us, we're just like TikTokCNN WireMarch 22, 2021 Monday 9:39 AM GMTCopyright 2021 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 687 wordsByline: By Michelle Toh, CNN BusinessDateline: (CNN) Body             Tesla CEO Elon Musk says his company's cars would never be used for spying in China, in response to reports that the country's military has banned the vehicles over such concerns."There's a very strong incentive for us to be very confidential with any information," the billionaire said Saturday at the China Development Forum, an annual conference organized by a unit of the government's State Council. "If Tesla used cars to spy in China or anywhere, we will get shut down."Just hours before he spoke, Reuters and Bloomberg reported that China's military had banned Tesla vehicles from entering its complexes, expressing concerns over cameras equipped onboard.Additionally, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that the government was restricting "military staff and employees of key state-owned companies" from driving the US automaker's cars, "citing concerns that data the cars gather could be a source of national security leaks."The outlets citedanonymous sources. Tesla did not immediately respond Monday to requests for comment from CNN Business.China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in response to questions from CNN Business that it was not aware of the specifics of the Tesla case."But any enterprise operating and investing overseas must comply with the laws and regulations of the host country. As long as foreign enterprises come to China to operate and invest in accordance with the law and regulations, China takes a welcoming and open attitude and is dedicated to creating a better business environment for enterprises of all countries," the ministry said.Speaking via video call on Saturday, Musk compared the controversy to the one that troubled TikTok last year, a company he said didn't receive "trust." The ByteDance-owned app faced a potential ban in the United States last year on alleged national security grounds."The United States wanted to shut down TikTok. Luckily, it did not happen," Musk said. "Many people were concerned about TikTok. But I think this kind of concern is unnecessary, and we should learn lessons from it."High stakesTesla has made a big splash in China in recent years, particularly after it built its Shanghai Gigafactory. In 2019, the company began making cars there to bolster its presence in the world's largest auto market, with Musk even calling the plant a "template for future growth." The company managed to retain complete control of the project, which was unusual at the time. And it has enjoyed strong government support in recent years.But the American carmaker has also attracted scrutiny from regulators recently, leading some observers to wonder whether its special relationship with officials is over. Last month, Tesla was summoned by Chinese officials to face questions about the quality of its Shanghai-made cars.According to a report The South China Morning Post on Saturday that cited an anonymous source, the military ban was issued a "couple of weeks ago" because Chinese leaders had become "very concerned" about the company's vehicles. The newspaper went on to add that Musk may visit China next month, citing the same source.China is critical to Tesla's global strategy, and "remains the linchpin" that justifies a higher stock price for Tesla in the coming years, according to Dan Ives, managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities.That's why over the last few days, Wall Street has been "laser focused on any actions from Tesla [or] Musk in response to this poker move," Ives wrote in a note to clients Sunday."We believe this statement ... was important for Tesla and Musk to make directly to the Chinese and the government in Beijing given the strategic importance of its [electric vehicle] ambitions within China," he added."With a brewing Cold Tech War between the US and China" he said that Tesla and others "remain caught in the crossfire and ultimately Musk needed to draw a clear line in the sand."<em>- Shanshan Wang and Shawn Deng contributed to this report.</em>                      By Michelle Toh, CNN Business         TM & © 2021 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Xi Jinping touts coronavirus cooperation as China persists with vaccine disinformation pushCNN WireJanuary 26, 2021 Tuesday 5:46 AM GMTCopyright 2021 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1258 wordsByline: Analysis by James Griffiths, CNNDateline: HONG KONG (CNN) BodyHONG KONG (CNN) --  Addressing the world's economic elite in Davos on Monday, Chinese President Xi Jinping said that "containing the coronavirus is the most pressing task for the international community." In a speech to the World Economic Forum, Xi called for "closer solidarity and cooperation, more information sharing, and a stronger global response," as well as "international cooperation on Covid vaccines." China has been praised for its "vaccine diplomacy," promising shots to developing countries and investing in vaccine candidates that do not require expensive cold storage to be effective. But as questions have been raised over the effectiveness of one of those vaccines, the country's state media has reacted aggressively, targeting not just critics but also other vaccines, in an apparent effort to tear down their reputation in the name of defending the Chinese shots. Along with hyping reports of deaths allegedly related to vaccines -- a dangerous game that could undermine not only confidence in the Pfizer and Moderna candidates targeted by Chinese media, but all coronavirus shots -- China's propaganda organs have also pushed alternate theories about the origins of the pandemic itself, including a long-debunked claim that it began in a US army lab. "If the United States truly respects facts, it should open the biological lab at Fort Detrick (and) give more transparency to issues like its 200-plus overseas bio-labs," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said last week, adding that the US should invite World Health Organization (WHO) investigators "to conduct origin-tracing" as they are in China. The leading US military germ lab, Fort Detrick briefly became a trending topic on Chinese social media after Hua's comments, which were heavily promoted online by the Communist Youth League, among other Party and state-backed accounts. Previously, Chinese officials have suggested -- without evidence -- that even if the pandemic did originate in Wuhan, the coronavirus could have been brought to the city by US soldiers taking part in the Military World Games in October 2019. Beijing has also pushed the idea that the virus could have entered the country on frozen food or other goods, despite most outside researchers disputing claims that it could be easily spread this way. Asked by CNN about her Fort Detrick comments, Hua claimed there was evidence that "the epidemic broke out in multiple places earlier in the autumn of 2019 and there might be links between the seasonal influenza in the US and the epidemic," adding that it was "not for China, but for the US, to offer the answers."Claims that the pandemic had "multiple origins" have not been supported by most scientists, and even if true, do not change the fact that the Chinese city of Wuhan was where the first major outbreak occurred, and where local officials were found to have downplayed the danger, allowing the virus to spread. Wuhan remains the most likely origin of the pandemic itself, providing scientists with important data about how the virus evolved and what lessons we could draw from this for the future. After months of delays and diplomatic wrangling, a WHO research team arrived in the city earlier this month to begin an investigation, bringing with them additional scrutiny, which seems to have prompted the sudden resurgence of the Fort Detrick conspiracies. The WHO team has already said that they have no intention of assigning blame, nor is it necessarily their job to do so. However, any suggestion of uncertainty about the origins of the pandemic, or how the virus first began spreading, will likely be seized upon by Beijing to reinforce the alternative theories state media is already advancing. New outbreaks of the virus in China itself, after months of having largely got the pandemic under control, also add to the urgency of deflecting blame outwards, particularly as cities are plunged back into lockdown and potential economic misery. Xi has repeatedly emphasized the success of the Chinese Communist Party in tackling the pandemic, an achievement that is all the more striking when compared with the US and much of western Europe. As it rolls out vaccines both domestically and internationally, the chance of turning the coronavirus from a reputational disaster into a propaganda win must be all the more alluring. But the promotion of vaccine disinformation could have major repercussions, not only in the US but also in China.On Monday, Global Times, the state-backed tabloid which has led the charge on attacking the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA-based vaccines, used the death of a single patient in California to claim without evidence that the shots were dangerous. Health experts have said repeatedly that deaths will occur after vaccination -- especially in the early stages, when most people inoculated are elderly and sick -- but this does not mean they were caused by the shot itself. Global Times even cited health authorities in Placer county, who it said reject "the link between the person's death and the vaccine." But this did not stop the paper using this as a peg to quote anonymous Chinese experts claiming mRNA shots were dangerous and "may contain unknown risks." This reporting goes beyond attacking the specific Pfizer shot too, suggesting that the technology used to develop the newer mRNA vaccines is itself untrustworthy -- a claim that has no substance and could have repercussions for future Chinese products as well as the existing Pfizer/Moderna shots. Such reports are having an effect. Last week, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte pointed to reports -- heavily promoted by Chinese officials and state media -- of deaths in Norway, where the Pfizer vaccine is being distributed. Norwegian health authorities have said there was no correlation between receiving the Pfizer vaccine and increased risk of death among the 23 deceased patients who had previously received the shot. "Almost everybody that I know is scrambling to buy this Pfizer (vaccine)," Duterte said in addressing calls from some lawmakers to prioritize the US manufacturer's shots over Chinese vaccines. "If you want to follow the experience of Norway, go ahead. Nobody would stop you."His comments were quickly picked up by Chinese media, feeding another round of disinformation. Writing this week, Yanzhong Huang, senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, said that China's success in tackling the pandemic at home may have left the country with a false sense of security when it comes to vaccines. Huang cited polling data showing that a surprising number of Chinese respondents cited "not being enough at risk from Covid-19" as a reason to refuse taking a shot, an unusual result even in countries were vaccine hesitancy is far more widespread than in China. Similar sentiment could be behind the Chinese government's willingness to play fast and loose with vaccine misinformation. China has among the least vaccine hesitant populations in the world, according to a recent Nature study, and even if skepticism were to increase, the ability of an authoritarian state to force mass inoculation is not in doubt. But as Xi himself noted Monday, vaccines are vital to the global pandemic response, indeed, this is why Beijing has invested in providing inoculations to developing countries. But such an effort will be undermined if, along with vaccines, China is also exporting misinformation and hesitancy. TM & © 2021 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

A Global Times article cheered the departure of President Donald Trump's “toxic rhetoric” as Biden took office.“Joe Biden was officially sworn in as the 46th President of the US during a relatively empty event heavily guarded by thousands of soldiers with weapons of war, and used his inaugural speech to address domestic challenges in stark contrast to Donald Trump's bellicose and at times borderline racist rhetoric against China during his farewell speech,” the Global Times article published Wednesday said.The Global Times article also quoted Lü Xiang of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, China who said the anti-China rhetoric of Biden appointees to lead the State, Treasury and Defense Departments wouldn't be matched by their actions in office. (RELATED: Chinese State Media Suggests US Big Tech Censorship Proves Free Speech Is Unattainable)“So the remarks they made are not entirely equal to the policies they would make after they take the office,” Xiang told The Global Times. “They will and must make adjustments to Trump's policies.” The Chinese state-run media outlet Global Times published this cartoon and this article today.

On the floor, a map of the world is seen with the word “sanctions” written multiple times and on the wall, “America First” is written in red ink.CCTV published an article Wednesday about how China welcomed Biden's decision to re-enter the Paris Climate Accords.“China welcomes the expected return of the United States to the Paris Agreement on climate change,” the article said.Meanwhile, the People's Daily published an editorial celebrating the departure of former Sec. of State Mike Pompeo. The piece said Pompeo, who was highly critical of the Chinese government, will be known for his “ego, lies and little desire to improve the state of the world.”“Because of Pompeo and his likes, America's global image is now in tatters, with Pompeo's final acts of madness another footnote to its fiasco,” the editorial said.In the final days of his tenure leading the State Department, Pompeo released a memorandum declaring that China is committing genocide. Days before, the State Department released a report saying that it had reviewed evidence the coronavirus escaped from a Chinese lab.In 2016, Chinese President Xi Jinping issued new rules ordering news outlets to serve the Chinese Communist Party, removing their independence, according to an article in China Daily, another state-run news outlet praising the decision.Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

CAIR Welcomes Biden Inaugural Committee Rejection of Former Sen. Boxer's Donation, Citing Her Links to China's Oppression of Uyghur MuslimsTargeted News ServiceJanuary 16, 2021 Saturday 8:10 AM  ESTCopyright 2021 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 899 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Council on American-Islamic Relations issued the following news release on Jan. 15:The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) and its California chapter (CAIR-CA) today praised President-elect Joe Biden's inaugural committee for refunding a $500 donation from former California U.S. Senator Barbra Boxer, who recently registered as a foreign agent due to her lobbying work on behalf of a Chinese firm that has allegedly helped China imprison hundreds of thousands of Uyghur Muslims in concentration camps.SEE: Biden to return donation from ex-California Sen. Barbara Boxer over Chinese lobbying(https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/Biden-to-return-donation-from-ex-California-Sen-15865366.php)CAIR, the nation's largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, also condemned Boxer for her decision to work for a blacklisted Chinese military proxy connected to China's ongoing oppression and Genocide of Uyghur Muslims and other Turkic ethnic minorities in China.On Tuesday, the controversy led to Boxer to announce her decision to de-register as a foreign agent for the U.S. subsidiary of Hikvision, a firm blacklisted by the U.S. Commerce Department after the Department of Defense reported the company is controlled by the Chinese military.In a statement, CAIR-CA CEO Hussam Ayloush said:"We are pleased that President-elect Biden's inaugural committee chose to reject former Sen. Boxer's contribution. Hopefully, this gesture is a sign that the Biden administration will forcefully stand up against China's oppression and systematic genocide of Uighur Muslims. It is quite disappointing that Senator Boxer, once elected to governmental leadership to serve the people of California, would have chosen to lobby on behalf of a foreign government dedicated to eradicating a large segment of its population."In a statement, CAIR National Government Affairs Director Robert S. McCaw said:"CAIR thanks and commends President-elect Joe Biden's inaugural committee for refunding former Senator Barbra Boxer's contribution because of her lobbying on behalf of a Chinese firm linked to the unprecedented oppression of Uyghur Muslims. No American should turn a blind eye to China's genocide of Uyghur Muslims, much less lobby in support of it."On Monday, CAIR welcomed Twitter's decision to remove a "horrific" statement celebrating the ongoing genocide of Uyghur Muslims posted by the Chinese Embassy to the United States.Last Thursday, China's U.S. Embassy posted a state media report defending China's oppression of Uyghur Muslims and other Turkic ethnic minorities in China by claiming that Muslim women in Xinjiang are "no longer baby-making machines" and that the decreased population growth in the province led to a drop in terrorism.CAIR and other organizations condemned the tweet as an admission and celebration of genocide, and called on Twitter to remove the post, which the social media platform did on Saturday.SEE: Twitter blocks China embassy tweet for 'dehumanising' Uighur women(https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/twitter-blocks-china-embassy-tweet-dehumanising-uighur-women)Last month, CAIR joined the US Council of Muslim Organizations (USCMO), Free Uyghur Now, and other global allies in a virtual press conference calling on the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) to join the international community in standing with Uyghur Muslims and other Turkic ethnic minorities.SEE: CAIR to Join U.S. Muslim Coalition in Questioning OIC's Silence on China's Abuses of Uyghur, Turkic Muslims - CAIR - Council on American-Islamic Relations(https://www.cair.com/press_releases/cair-to-join-u-s-muslim-coalition-in-questioning-oics-silence-on-chinas-abuses-of-uyghur-turkic-muslims/)CAIR ACTION ALERT: Urge Congress to Reject Attempts by Nike, Apple, Coca-Cola, Other Corporations to Weaken Forced Labor Legislation Cracking Down on China's Abuse of Uyghur Muslims(https://www.cair.com/press_releases/cair-action-alert-urge-congress-to-reject-attempts-by-nike-apple-coca-cola-other-corporations-to-weaken-forced-labor-legislation-cracking-down-on-chinas-abuse-of-uyghur-muslims/)CAIR Welcomes Dept. of Labor Report Exposing Arbitrary Detention of Uyghurs, Other Muslim Minorities in China(https://www.cair.com/press_releases/cair-welcomes-dept-of-labor-report-exposing-arbitrary-detention-of-uyghurs-other-muslim-minorities-in-china/)CAIR Action Alert: Urge Trump to Formally Designate China's Oppression of Uyghur Muslims as 'Genocide'(https://www.cair.com/press_releases/cair-action-alert-urge-trump-to-formally-designate-chinas-oppression-of-uyghur-muslims-as-genocide/)According to human rights monitors, there are at least 1.8 million and as many as 3 million Uyghurs and other ethnic Turkic minorities that are being detained in concentration and forced labor camps. In these facilities, they are forced to renounce their faith, stripped of their human rights, and face torture and other abuses. Through mass detention, forced labor, and forced sterilization, the Chinese government is destroying the Uyghurs' ethnic and religious identities.The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) is America's largest Muslim civil liberties and advocacy organization. Its mission is to enhance understanding of Islam, protect civil rights, promote justice, and empower American Muslims.[Category: International]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7354483 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: January 16, 2021End of Document

China, from the world's first covid outbreak to be the first power to growCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 9, 2021 TuesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 820 wordsBodyShanghai(China), 9 Sea (EFE)- After being the first country to record covid outbreaks and suffer its economic effects, China became one of the few territories worldwide - and the only one among the major powers - to experience economic growth in 2020.Official data show a progress of 2.3% of GDP during the pandemic year, which was the worst figure since 1976 and still a success given the international economic collapse that coronavirus has caused.After a few hesitant weeks, at the end of January 2020 the authorities decided to decree the confinement of the city where most cases were accumulating, Wuhan (central-west), which added to the arrival of the Lunar New Year - the main festive season of the year in the country - to slow economic activity almost dry.With a few one-off regrowths in the summer, and especially at the end of the year, China put the pandemic under control from the second quarter, focusing most of the economic damage on the former, in which industrial production fell by 8.4%; the profits of major companies, 36.7%, and GDP by 6.8%.CRISIS AND OPPORTUNITIESStrategic cabinet Tsingyan Research drew up a list of hardest-hit sectors in the country, including manufacturing, which was affected not only by the stop in activity but also by the difficulties of many migrant workers returning to their workplaces due to restrictions on mobility.One of the sectors that thanked China for rapidly regaining normalcy was real estate, as listed developers had no liquidity other than to endure another year without activity, according to a report by the consulting firm Capital Economics published in February last year.Other industries that suffered were the restoration - in the lunar New Year the restaurants not only did not make their usual August but lost more than 65 billion euros - or entertainment - or entertainment: the cinemas, for example, were closed almost half a year.Strict contagion prevention measures also hit a tourism sector where, during the first bridge held with the Labour Day pandemic, turnover plummeted by 60% even though the duration of the festive season was one more day than in 2019.First-quarter sangria is summed up by a figure: more than 460,000 companies closed their doors in that period, with the number of companies created down 29% from the same time last year.SMEs accounted for the brunt, with some major declines in the country over the past few months, such as the HNA conglomerate, which went from spending more than $40 billion on worldwide acquisitions - including Deutsche Bank or Hilton - in the middle of the decade to filed for bankruptcy after the virus licked its debt elimination program.However, there were sectors that were not only not affected but took advantage of their opportunities, such as e-commerce, telework, remote education or digital entertainment. In short, those who recorded an increase in demand because most citizens were trying to avoid household departures.The spread of the pandemic to other countries was also a backing force behind the operations of exporters of remote work material - from desks to computers - and, above all, producers of medical equipment such as masks or personal protective equipment. In 2020, sales abroad rose by 1.9%.STABILITY, PEKON MANTRAThe Chinese government's strategy, which still hadin memory the crisis of another coronavirus, SARS (2002-2003), was to try to crush the virus before betting on the recovery of economic activity.However, Beijing launched a series of aid and incentives to protect the economy, with employment as a priority to protect stability, a key concept for the country's authorities.According to official figures, urban unemployment had reached 6.2% by February - by 2019, the peak had been 5.3% - with nearly 4 million jobs destroyed during the worst times of the pandemic in the country, and, according to some analysts, the actual rate could have been double.One of the government's flagship plans was the issuance of the so-called "anti-covid bonds" worth 1 trillion yuan ($153,174 million, EUR 128,981 million), already eliminated by 2021.It also opted to further reduce taxes - a total of 2.6 trillion yuan ($398.29 billion, EUR 335.315 billion) - and partial or total exemption from social security contributions for troubled enterprises, while large state banks made 50% more loans to SMEs.Thus, in the second half of the year the improvement was remarkable in most key indicators such as inflation, which ended 2020 with a 2.5% increase - the target was 3.5% after six years of 3% - after the moderation of pig prices by the end of the African swine fever epidemic.Ahead of 2021, and to the chagrin of many analysts, the government has again set a growth target - of "more than 6%" - after not doing so last year, although it is a conservative target well below expert forecasts, which expect Chinese GDP to advance by more than 8% this year.Victor EscribanoLoad-Date: March 10, 2021End of Document

China proposes global rules for central bank digital currenciesCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 25, 2021 ThursdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 438 wordsBodyChina on Thursday proposed a set of global rules for central bank digital currencies, from how they can be used around the world to highly sensitive issues such as monitoring and information sharing.Global central banks aim to develop digital currencies to modernize their financial systems, protect themselves from the threat of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, and accelerate domestic and international payments. China is one of the most advanced in its effort.Mu Changchun, director general of the Digital Currency Institute of the People's Bank of China (BPC), presented the new proposals at a seminar of the Bank for International Payments, as quoted by Reuters."Interoperability must be enabled between CBDC (central bank digital currency) systems in different jurisdictions and exchange," he said. The CFP shared the proposals with other central banks and monetary authorities, he added."The flow of information and funds should be synchronized to make it easier for regulators to monitor transaction compliance," he added.As digital currencies like bitcoin gain more traction between large companies and investors and private projects like Diem - backed by Facebook - seek approval, central banks have a responsibility to accelerate plans to issue digital cash to defend against threats to their control over money.The CFP aims to become the first major central bank to issue a CBDC, as part of its drive to internationalize the yuan and reduce dependence on the dollar-dominated payment system.The European Central Bank is also exploring the introduction of a digital euro over the next five years. However, it is in Germany's opposition, out of the Bundesbank's concern that a digital euro could pose risks to banks.Advance with the digital yuanLast Monday, at a summit of the 2021 China Development Forum, Mu brazened concerns about potential user privacy violations, and ensured that digital currency has the highest level of privacy protection among the payment tools available today.According to Xinhua, China's digital yuan, while still in its pilot stage, will include more people in the digital age, which is rapidly developing, and facilitate daily life, while strengthening the security of digital payments. The digital currency will be launched by the issuer and will be backed by the Chinese government as an alternative to paper currency."The use of cash will be reduced by at least 40% over the next decade," predicted Zhu Min, president of Tsinghua University's National Institute of Financial Research, who added that digital currencies backed by central banks will become more common around the world.Load-Date: March 27, 2021End of Document

The Washington Post editorial board called it “plausible” in a Feb. 5 editorial, and called for the World Health Organization to investigate. A research group affiliated with a prominent foreign policy think tank and funded by Facebook released a report on Monday asserting that the theory that the coronavirus pandemic originated from a leak in a lab in Wuhan is disinformation, even though the theory has not been debunked.“The report focuses on how varying, unverified, and outright false narratives that the virus was a bioweapon or the result of a lab accident spread globally on social media and beyond, and the geopolitical consequences of those narratives,” reads the report, from The Digital Forensics Research Lab (DFRLab).DFRLab, which is affiliated with the Atlantic Council, conducted a study in conjunction with the Associated Press into the amplification of several theories about the origins of the virus.In 2018, Reuters reported that Facebook was a major funder for the lab. The social media giant donated at least $1 million to the Atlantic Council in 2019, according to the think tank's most recent annual report.A spokesperson for the Atlantic Council told The Daily Caller News Foundation that Facebook was not involved in the latest study, entitled “Weaponized: How rumors about COVID-19's origins led to a narrative arms race.”For the study, DFRLab analyzed theories that the virus was created in a U.S. military lab in Maryland and released into China and, conversely, that the Chinese government created it as a bioweapon in a lab in Wuhan. (RELATED: A Study Touted As A Blow To Conservatives' Complaints About Big Tech Was Funded By Biden Donor)While those theories have been widely debunked, the researchers also looked into the origins of the theory that the virus first infected humans as the result of an accident in a lab in Wuhan, China.While the lab leak theory was widely dismissed in the early days of the pandemic, it has gained traction even among liberal institutions as a possible explanation for how the coronavirus first infected humans.On Feb. 5, the Washington Post editorial board called on the World Health Organization to investigate the lab theory during a fact-finding mission to China.“We don't know where the pandemic began. But a major step toward finding the answer is to examine all the relevant databases and laboratory records, including those at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and elsewhere, and the clues they may hold,” the editorial board wrote.The board called the lab leak theory “plausible” and said that it “must be investigated.”DFRLab's report focuses mainly on disinformation pushed out by pro-Beijing operatives who sought to deflect blame for the pandemic away from the Chinese government.The Associated Press noted in its write-up of the study that the Chinese government “took a leading role” in disseminating virus-related disinformation.The most prominent example of Beijing-linked disinformation is from Lijian Zhao, the deputy director of China's Foreign Ministry Information Department.“It may be that the US military brought the epidemic to Wuhan,” Zhao tweeted on March 12, 2020.While the report focuses on China, the DFRLab researchers also criticize prominent Republicans like Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton, an early proponent of investigating the lab leak theory.The DFRLab researchers stop short of accusing Cotton of peddling disinformation. Instead, they assert that his calls for investigating the origins of the virus laid the groundwork for conspiracy theorists to float more extreme theories about the root cause of the pandemic.“We still don't know where coronavirus originated,” Cotton tweeted on Jan. 30, 2020.Cotton acknowledged that the prevailing theory that the virus started at a food market in Wuhan was plausible. But he also noted that the Chinese government had withheld information about the virus, and that Wuhan was home to a research lab that studied coronaviruses.“Could have been a market, a farm, a food processing company. I would note that Wuhan has China's only biosafety level-four super laboratory that works with the world's most deadly pathogens to include, yes, coronavirus,” he wrote.Two weeks before Cotton sent the tweet, the World Health Organization published a now-debunked claim, based on information from the Chinese government, that the coronavirus did not spread via human-to-human contact. (RELATED: FLASHBACK: WHO Tells Everyone Don't Worry, The Coronavirus Isn't Contagious) Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in #Wuhan, #China????????. pic.twitter.com/Fnl5P877VG - World Health Organization (WHO) (@WHO) January 14, 2020DFRLab asserts that while Cotton's statements “would not meet the strict definition of disinformation,” his remarks “provided source material for others” to deliberately spread false information about the virus, including that it was created as a bioweapon.Cotton has vehemently denied pushing the theory that the virus was a China-made bioweapon.“The mainstream media are largely apologists for Chinese communists and they will accept Chinese communist propaganda,” Cotton told The Daily Caller News Foundation on April 1.“They immediately try to accuse anyone who raises these reasonable questions as conspiracy theorists that are accusing China of creating a biological weapon.”DFRLab provides little explanation for dismissing the lab leak theory beyond a citation from a World Health Organization official Peter Embarek, who said last week that it was “extremely unlikely” that the virus started at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.WHO director-general Tedros Ghebreyesus walked back the assessment on Thursday, saying that “all hypotheses...remain open and require further study.”The WHO investigation has come under intense scrutiny, and even earned rebuke from the Biden administration.Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser for President Joe Biden, issued a statement on Saturday saying that the U.S. has “deep concerns” about the WHO investigation in the wake of reports that Chinese authorities had withheld raw data collected on early coronavirus patients.One of the WHO team investigators has long fought against the lab leak theory, well before it was thoroughly investigated.A science community watchdog group released an email on Monday in which Peter Daszak, a zoologist on the WHO investigative team, asked colleagues in February 2020 to sign a letter stating that the lab leak was a “conspiracy theory.”A spokesman for the Atlantic Council defended the DFRLab report, telling the DCNF that it is “an important examination of the escalation of unverified or false narratives about the origins of COVID-19.Alex Kisling, the think tank spokesman, said that the “bulk” of the study “focused on the attempts of malign foreign actors to cast blame on the United States for creating the virus.”Regarding Cotton, Kisling said that the report “is clear that the senator's comments on the origin of the virus were unverified.”“Those speculative comments, however, were then amplified by others to support a false narrative, namely that the virus was developed as a bioweapon.”Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

China Plans to Launch ‘Crypto-Yuan’ to Bolster Communist Regime’s ControlCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 15, 2021 FridayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1045 wordsBodySpanish – Over the years, the Chinese regime has sought to control all possible fields: technology, economy, politics, health. And although many of its initiatives are already known, it always manages to find a new field to expand its power.One of them is that of digital coins. Beijing plans to convert the yuan into a cryptocurrency backed by its Central Bank. The country would say goodbye to bills and coins to seek to control its population and commercial ties with other countries.It also wants to wage war on platforms such as WeChat Pay and Alipay, which are not tied to that country’s banking system, and execute transactions independently.Digital supremacy seems to be crucial to the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CCP). So much so that it is fighting to impose its 5G technology worldwide and has implemented cybernetic espionage to influence governments and societies.But before going to other countries, the Chinese regime first seeks to control its population. This statement was made by Ana Maria Moreno Ballesteros and Philippe Boland, specialists in blockchain technology and managers of the University Network for ICTs (UxTIC), in a conversation with the PanAm Post.  The risk of encrypting the currencyChina began research into the digitization of its currency in 2014, and a currency development program was approved in 2017, according to the BBC. During the past year, it has already carried out pilot tests in some cities.Other countries are also carrying out research and developments to change their monetary systems to a digital cryptographic environment, such as the European Central Bank (ECB).Cryptographic technology allows adding more security to the currency, avoiding counterfeits and duplicates. Additionally, it establishes a total traceability. In short, the government will know who is spending on what.  Although it is an advantage to avoid tax evasion, the conception that the centralist regime in China could give it would appear to be more of a problem than a solution.A public statement by Xi Jinping in October 2019 would have led to an acceleration of the technological processes of monetary exchange. “The most powerful countries are accelerating their initiatives,” he said.The blockchain technology specialist, Philippe Boland, explains that “although China could use blockchain technology, the idea is that it is centralized and that goes against the philosophy of empowering users, to retain and have control of their own assets.”World trade“China wants a faster and more efficient raw material supply system, so they are acquiring ports, roads, mass transport systems, mines in other countries,” Boland points out.With the investment that China is making on a large scale internationally, it could impose the use of its new digital currency on other countries. This would show how much money is in the accounts.The situation is extrapolated to private individuals. “It’s a danger because they know exactly how much you have in the account, combined with 5G technology to have personal and health data is tremendous. Corrupting a person is much easier when you know they don’t have anything in their wallet. Controlling money is a key element,” adds Boland.A note from Business Insider shows the percentage of China’s investment in the rest of the world. Between 2000 and 2014, Chinese communism allocated more than 273.6 billion USD to finance a total of 3485 projects in 138 territories around the world.Controlling access to money“Party cadres must understand that the leadership attaches great importance to blockchain technology, given its prospects for application in the real economy, popular lifestyle, and governance. The text is part of an editorial in the People’s Daily, the main newspaper of the regime.Let’s keep in mind that the new currency would not be anonymous, something that is offered by currencies with other technologies such as Bitcoin (banned in China). The regime could have the data of each transaction, facilitating the tracking of capital movement, reports El País. For China, this is tempting. The more information it has, the better for the regime’s objectives.What’s the difference between the banned Bitcoin and the digital Yuan? The former is a decentralized currency where control depends on several. There’s no one administration unit. Anyone can generate bitcoins and switch them from wallet to wallet.In contrast, the new Chinese currency uses all the security components but does not have the decentralization of Bitcoin. Control and value will be determined by the Chinese government. “In the US, the Central Bank is independent of the State, but China can make a 50 to 100 percent devaluation when it decides to do so, that is, it can be a totally volatile currency because it will depend on the secretariat of the Communist Party of China,” warns Boland.“If all the servers of the yuan are in Chinese entities and one day they decide that the ‘crypto-yuan’ is not interesting to them, they simply turn off their servers and the people who had that currency no longer have a way to rescue it, make transfers or use it,” emphasizes Ana María Moreno Ballesteros, who also teaches the subject Introduction to the blockchain.An article in The Economist reported towards the end of last year that the digital yuan could enter into circulation in 2021. The People’s Bank of China is said to have filed more than 100 patent applications for digital currency.Beating the competitionCompetition is also directed at national companies such as Alibaba, the e-commerce giant. In fact, Alipay was born from that company.Alibaba has had a great impact on electronic payments, something that the communist regime does not like. And incidentally, its founder, Jack Ma, has been missing since October of last year.During a speech on October 24, Jack Ma denounced Chinese authorities as outdated and backward and called for more regulatory freedoms for consortia like Ant Group. Since then, his whereabouts are unknown, and there is no official response.“The government is taking back all online payment channels because it has a fifth of the world’s population. Before covering the entire world, it is first consolidating itself in its own house,” concludes Ana María Moreno Ballesteros.Load-Date: January 16, 2021End of Document

China to have the world's first digital currency by 2022CE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 27, 2021 SaturdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 776 wordsBodyChina's payment system is essentially digital, covering more than 40% of total transactions,with a growth rate of 12% per annum, meaning it would reach more than 60% by 2025. At this time the digital payment system is used by the entire population between 18 and 29 years of age, which acts with a clear tendency to consider the use of cash as an absolutely marginal phenomenon,a mere return of the past. The International Bank for Payments (BIS) based in Basel, Switzerland, has set the following ranking on the valuation of digital transactions (without cash) worldwide: first China, with US$532.9 trillion in 2019, implying that they have increased more than 300% in 6 years; Second Britain, with US$118.7 trillion; third U.S., with US$102.9 trillion; France, with US$32 billion; and fifth, and last Japan, with US$29.33 trillion.The result of these figures is unequivocal: the People's Republic conducts more digital transactions than the rest of the world's large economies combined. More than 765 million Chinese - just over half of the country's population reaching 1.44 billion - have made digital payments in the first quarter of 2020; and this phenomenal expansion occurred through two major Internet platforms: Alipay, a subsidiary of Alibaba; and WeChat Pay, owned by Tencent. Alibaba and Tencent are 2 of the top 3 digital platforms in the People's Republic, and are among the top 7 in the world, of which the top 5 are North American, led by Amazon/AWS (China's third largest platform is Baidu). Rural areas of the People's Republic made more than 20% of total digital payments in 2019; and 92% of holders of "smartphones" (mobile Internet) closed their transactions digitally in the same period. All users of "smartphones" are expected to use 5-G units by 2030. Alipayy WeChat Pay has a combined base of 1.9 billion active users worldwide by 2020, and expand at a rate of between 10% / 15% per year.AntFinancial - Alipay/Alibaba's "fintech" arm - announced last year that 28 million small and medium-sized enterprises actively used their services, whereo their competitor WeChat Pay noted that more than 50 million individual merchants were its customers. This means that nearly 80% of China's private businesses make their payments digitally. More than 150 million Chinese tourists traveled abroad in 2019, in the pre-pandemic stage; and that's why Alipay and WeChat Pay were accepted in 56 countries of the global system. This means that more than 60% of Chinese tourists abroad used Alipay's services, where as 35.2% of the total did so with WeChat Pay. The e-commerce data of the People's Republic are as follows: first, the number of online shoppers amounted to 782.4 million in 2020; and then there were 854 million e-commerce users who made their payments digitally. Finally, every year these indices increase by 12%/14% per year. The Chinese government's strategic objective is now to have a digital currency ("e-yuan") of legal course in the last quarter of 2022,when the "Winter Olympics" will be performed, which is supposed to attract a multitude of tourists and fans from all over the world, in addition to placing China through television, once again, at the center of global events. To this end, the National and People's Assembly would sanction in the second halfof the year a law that turns the renminbi into a digital currency of legal course in the second largest economy in the world. The "e-yuan" would be the world's first digital legal tender.The digital renminbi is based on two major trends in the Chinese economy: the population is the most banked in the global system (79% of the total has bank accounts or savings banks); and more than 80% of Internet users (which are 1.1 billion over a population of 1.44 billion) use "smartphones" (4/5 generation mobile Internet); and the consequence of this convergence of factors is that the service of digital payments, and in general all Internet procedures, tends to be free. Today between 0.6% and 1% are paid per transaction, and as the system expands, and therefore systematically reduces its marginal costs,it appears 0% on the near horizon. This is the rule of the entire digital economy: as the system grows its costs disappear, and freely prevails. The "e-yuan" or digital renminbi of forced course implies a qualitative leap for the process of internationalization of the Chinese currency that is underway, and whose objective is to make it one of the four global currencies: first and foremost the fundamental, the US dollar, then the euro, the yen, and the renminbi, which could happen through a further overtaking of the historical calendar in 2025 or earlier.Load-Date: February 28, 2021End of Document

China Arrests Six for Disputing Regime's Account of India Border ClashNewsweek.comFebruary 23, 2021 Tuesday 6:29 AM ESTCopyright © 2021 Newsweek Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 888 wordsByline: John FengHighlight: One of the men held is a blogger with 2.5 million followers on social media site Weibo, which has suspended his accounts for a year.BodyChinese authorities have arrested six people and are pursuing a person who lives overseas following online comments that cast doubt on Beijing's official account of a deadly border clash with India.Six men between the ages of 20 and 40 were detained or turned themselves in over the weekend. They have been accused of defaming "heroes and martyrs" who died or were injured in the Galwan Valley melee with Indian troops last June, according to statements by public security organs in Beijing and five other provinces.One People's Liberation Army commanding officer was seriously injured and four soldiers were killed during the clash, according to a video released last Friday by China's state broadcaster CCTV, which blamed the violence on Indian troops who had crossed into Chinese territory.The PLA servicemen were honored posthumously, with their pictures and patriotic last words shared widely on China's social media platforms on Friday.However, news of arrests came as early as the following day, with police in Nanjing, in the coastal Jiangsu province, announcing the detention of 38-year-old blogger Qiu Ziming for "defaming the heroic officer and soldiers who guarded China's border."Qiu, an investigative journalist, had 2.5 million followers on his verified Weibo account—a site similar to Twitter—and was considered a person of influence, said Shanghai-based news site The Paper.In a post on his "Labi Xiaoqiu" Weibo account, Qiu called into question Beijing's account of the death toll, saying: "All four soldiers who died were trying to rescue [the officer]. If the rescuers themselves died, then there must have been more who couldn't be saved.""This shows that there must be more than four people dead," he wrote.Weibo said it had suspended Qiu's account for one year after the incident and would remove his affiliated account—"Qiuyexing"—for the same period.Announcing the arrests, Chinese authorities said Qiu and the five others were charged with "picking quarrels and provoking trouble," a vaguely defined crime commonly used for public order offenses. It is also deployed to charge dissidents, lawyers and journalists.Investigations into the online comments began after other social media users reported the men, police said.Three of the group have been handed sentences of seven, 13 and 15 days, but it is not clear how long Qiu and the two remaining suspects will be kept in custody.Qiu is by far the highest-profile figure in the group. His arrest received an official response from the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, China's top anti-corruption body, which said those who "smear" the country's heroes would "pay the appropriate cost."On Monday, police in Chongqing, a municipality in southwestern China, said they were "pursuing online" a 19-year-old who was wanted in connection with offending comments on Weibo.However, the authorities said the teenager had been living overseas since July 2019. They did not reveal how they planned to arrest him."Desecration of heroes and martyrs cannot be tolerated," a statement said. "Cyberspace is not outside the law."China criminalized the defamation of war heroes and martyrs in 2018, but an amendment to the country's law—coming into effect next month—will allow the state to charge individuals formally and issue sentences of up to three years.Responding to the charges brought against the 19-year-old, Yaqiu Wang, a China researcher at Human Rights Watch, tweeted: "I wonder whether this signals an escalation of the Chinese government's long arm of censorship. The usual tactic is to warn critics or harass their China-based families without resorting to formal prosecution mechanism."Wang added: "Formally prosecuting overseas critics will have a chilling effect within the diaspora community, but at the same time, it attracts bad international press, hardens critics and drives them underground (unlike inside the country, anonymity is possible for overseas critics.)"Earlier this month, China and India announced their intention to withdraw troops from the heavily fortified Line of Actual Control, a 2,100-mile undefined border between India's Ladakh region and China's Aksai Chin region.The standoff has been marked by skirmishes including the deadly melee in Galwan Valley, which also resulted in the deaths of 20 Indian soldiers.On Sunday, a joint statement issued by India's defense ministry said both armies had fully withdrawn from the north and south banks of Pangong Lake.This followed a 10th round of military talks a day earlier, in which further disengagement along the western sector of the line was discussed, according to the Press Trust of India.The United States welcomes "ongoing efforts" to de-escalate the border dispute, State Department spokesperson Ned Price told reporters in Washington on Monday."We will, of course, continue to monitor the situation closely as both sides work towards a peaceful resolution," he said.Also on Monday, the foreign ministry in Beijing expressed support for India's hosting of this year's meetings between the BRICS economies—Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.Under the de-escalation of tensions between the two nations, New Delhi will approve 45 investment proposals from China, including deals with automakers Great Wall Motor and SAIC, according to Reuters.Link to ImageGraphic China, India Troops Clash on Disputed BorderCCTV/AFP via Getty ImagesThis video frame grab taken from footage recorded in mid-June 2020 and released by China Central Television (CCTV) on February 20, 2021, shows Chinese (foreground) and Indian soldiers (R, background) during an incident where troops from both countries clashed in the Line of Actual Control in Galwan Valley.Load-Date: February 23, 2021End of Document

The main opposition parties support the motion and control the majority of seats in the House of Commons.There was no immediate indication of what Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal Party would do on the proposed declaration.After O’Toole urged the government this week to press the International Olympic Committee to move the 2022 Winter Olympics out of Beijing, Trudeau hesitated at using the word “genocide,” which he called an “extremely loaded” term.“When it comes to the application of the very specific word genocide, we simply need to ensure that all the i’s are dotted and t’s are crossed before a determination like that is made,” Trudeau this week.The move is the latest attempt to hold China accountable for its treatment of the Uighurs and other predominantly Muslim and ethnic Turkic minorities, who have been subjected to an unprecedented crackdown that is increasingly drawing international concern.Former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared before he left office that China’s policies against Xinjiang’s Muslims and ethnic minorities constituted crimes against humanity and genocide. His successor, Antony Blinken, reiterated the statement on his first day in office.Researchers and rights groups estimate that since 2016, China has rounded up a million or more Uighurs and other minorities into prisons and vast indoctrination camps that the state calls training centers.Pompeo cited widespread forced birth control and forced labor among Uighurs. The Associated Press reported last year that the Chinese government was systematically forcing sterilization and abortion on Uighur and other Muslim women and sent many to camps simply for having too many children.China denies any abuses and insists the steps it has taken are necessary to combat terrorism and a separatist movement.O’Toole has also said China is imposing a police state on Hong Kong and arbitrarily detaining two Canadians in Chinese prisons. He said if the Olympics are not moved, a boycott could be considered.Canada continues to press Beijing to release Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, both detained since December 2018 following Canada’s arrest of Meng Wanzhou, a top executive at the Chinese technology company Huawei and the daughter of the company’s founder. Canadian police detained Meng in Vancouver on a U.S. extradition request nine days before Kovrig and Spavor were arrested.The U.S. is seeking Meng’s extradition on fraud charges, and her extradition case is before the Canadian courts. Her arrest severely damaged relations between China and Canada. China has also sentenced two other Canadians to death and suspended canola imports.Load-Date: February 19, 2021End of Document

Asian neighbors pen letter of fear to Ohio's lieutenant govAssociated Press State & LocalMarch 31, 2021 Wednesday 8:36 PM GMTCopyright 2021 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: DOMESTIC NEWS; POLITICAL NEWS; STATE AND REGIONALLength: 991 wordsByline: FARNOUSH AMIRI, Report for America/Associated PressDateline: COLUMBUS, Ohio BodyCOLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Dozens of Asian American residents of the suburb that Ohio’s Republican lieutenant governor calls home penned a letter to him Wednesday, citing their concerns over a tweet he sent referring to the “Wuhan virus” and the fears they have for the safety of their children because of such comments."Lt. Governor Husted, your choice of words has only raised the anxiety and fear that Asians and Asian Americans in Upper Arlington are currently experiencing," the letter obtained by the local NBC affiliate read.“Our children have been targeted for bullying and abuse in the district well before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, but that abuse has increased significantly in the last 14 months and has reached levels that have brought news media attention to our doorsteps," the letter continued. “Our children are the classmates, friends, and neighbors of your children.”The letter to the lieutenant governor was signed by nearly 70 members and families of the Asian community in Upper Arlington, a suburb of Columbus.It came in response to a March 26 tweet where Husted linked to an article in which Robert Redfield, the ex-director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said, without citing evidence, that he believed the virus originated in a lab in Wuhan.“So it appears it was the Wuhan Virus after all?” Husted tweeted Friday from his personal account.His intention with the tweet, Husted said in an interview with The Associated Press earlier on Wednesday, was to criticize the Chinese government.“I was just pointing out that this is an international crisis, in my opinion, that the Chinese government is responsible for and I wanted an independent investigation,” he said. “So I wasn’t trying to accomplish anything that the political left or political right thinks that I might have from that tweet other than to draw attention to the issue.”The claim that COVID-19 originated in a lab in Wuhan has been scrutinized in the past year by health officials, including the leading U.S. infectious disease specialist, Dr. Anthony Fauci.The claim was further muddied when a draft obtained by The AP on Monday and formally published Tuesday from the World Health Organization’s inquiry said it was “extremely unlikely” that the virus emerged accidentally from a Chinese laboratory and was likely spread from animals to humans.Some replies on the original post supported Husted for standing up to China. More numerous were critical replies from Twitter users who said such rhetoric feeds into hate and violence against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.The organization Stop AAPI Hate released a report last month that showed it received more than 3,800 reports in the U.S. of episodes ranging from shunning and verbal harassment to assault from March 2020 to Feb. 28 of this year. Many of the confrontations were linked to misconceptions around the virus.A gunman walked into three spas on March 16 in the Atlanta area, killing eight people, six of them Asian women, though police have yet to designate the shootings as a hate crime. The shock was still fresh when a man was caught on surveillance video Monday in New York City kicking an Asian American woman and stomping on her face while, police say, he shouted anti-Asian slurs.For Democratic State Sen. Tina Maharath, the first Asian American woman elected to the Ohio General Assembly, Husted's tweet was the second time that week she heard an elected official call the coronavirus that first emerged in Wuhan, China, the “Wuhan virus,” she said.Maharath said Husted and others are following the lead of former President Donald Trump, who sometimes used overtly racist terms to refer to the virus.“When you say those things, such as attach locations or ethnicities to the disease, it creates racial profiling, and then it turns into xenophobic behavior,” Maharath said. “And when leaders with that kind of power repeat those terms in confidence and double down on it, it leads to more hate crimes.”Two days before Husted's tweet, Republican Ohio Sen. Terry Johnson mentioned the “Wuhan virus” on the chamber floor.“We called it the Wuhan virus because that’s where it came from,” Johnson said. “We always called viruses by where they came from, but now we don’t even do that because of all this political correctness.”Senate Republican spokesperson John Fortney said the overreaction to the phrase is a part of cancel culture, adding that it is important to question the origin of the deadly virus.In the past century, international health experts have intentionally avoided naming diseases after the city or region of origin because of potential stigma. In 2015, the World Health Organization issued guidelines that discouraged the use of geographic locations, animals or groups of people in naming diseases.But Husted remained firm in his AP interview.“On Twitter, there were a lot of people who are from what I will call the cancel culture, who immediately assumed that there was a racial element to the tweet," Husted said, “which there wasn’t any.”His neighbors, however, believe Husted's words matter, regardless of intention, and offered an invitation to “meet personally to discuss the issues of violence and hatred towards Ohio’s Asian and Asian American citizens.”“As Lt. Governor, you are uniquely positioned to represent and protect the interests and safety of all Ohioans,” the letter stated. “As a resident of Upper Arlington, and our Lt. Governor, you are uniquely situated and have the power to take action to protect the families of our community. To protect all of our families.”___This story has been corrected to show that the former CDC director's name is Robert Redfield, not Robert Redford.___Farnoush Amiri is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

Is there a struggle between the Chinese regime and the entrepreneur?CE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 24, 2021 SundayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 630 wordsBodyJack Ma has reappeared. After nearly three months of uncertainty about his whereabouts, he gave an online speech at a rural teachers ceremony on Wednesday, pointed out Tianmu News, a Chinese government-controlled press agency. The last time he had been seen in public was on October 24. At that time, at a forum in Shanghai, the founder of the popular online trading platform Alibaba dared to criticize the global financial system and the one it governed in his own country.Perhaps empowered by his success and his aura of "man who made himself," who has both seduced his connationals as a role model (after all, he went from being a simple English teacher to a digital commerce tycoon), Ma noted that China's financial industry "does not have a mature ecosystem." He complained that banks continued to work with a "pawnshop mentality" and called for the release of over-regulation.President Xi Jinping's regime would not have liked these words. Within days, the authorities prevented online payment giant Ant Group, also founded by Ma, from trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The stock market operation was going to make more than $37 billion and would have become the largest in history. As if that were not the case, on 24 December, the Chinese regulatory authorities announced an investigation against Alibaba for alleged monopoly practices. As a result, the firm lost nearly a third of its listing. And Jack Ma vanished. Rumors of his fall from grace in the almighty Communist Party of China (PCCh) multiplied.His virtual reappearance on Wednesday seeks to silence speculation, although there is still room for doubt. Ma, the eccentric millionaire who imitates Michael Jackson or appears on a stage dressed as a glam rock star would have opted for a low profile. According to the AFP news agency, he even praised the CHCH's efforts to eradicate poverty. Have you learned your lesson? At least Alibaba's stock went up again.It wouldn't be the first time a billionaire has disappeared. In 2015, Guo Guangchang, founder of Fosun International and considered the "Chinese Warren Buffett", was unseeded for five days. His company also went so far as to suspend its listing. It was then learned that he had been arrested as part of an anti-corruption operation. He was eventually released and merely noted that he had cooperated with the authorities on a "delicate" matter.China launched a major anti-corruption campaign in 2012, after President Xi Jinping became head of the Communist Party. In practice, allegations of corruption are suspected of eliminating those who oppose Xi's line. In September, real estate entrepreneur Ren Zhiqiang was sentenced to 18 years in prison for criticizing the way the government handled the pandemic in Wuhan. The formal charge was corruption.Death has also been usedas punishment. This month, Lai Xiaomin, former chief of financial conglomerate China Huarong, was sentenced to death once again on corruption charges.The regimen has been syndicated from having as a common practice the disappearing people. Guo Wengui, a Chinese billionaire who is considered corrupt by Beijing, now lives as a refugee in New York. He claims that he was imprisoned, tortured and that he was tried to kidnap and kill for refusing to share profits with the government. She points out that people close to him have been imprisoned. "There are hundreds, about 500 millionaires and celebrities missing," she said to the middle France 24.In all these cases, the feeling is that the regime seeks to show who is in charge. "I think there's a general message the Party is really sending: there's not a single individual, no company bigger than the Chinese Communist Party," Rana Mitter, a professor of modern Chinese history and politics at Oxford University, told CNN.Load-Date: January 25, 2021End of Document

China to tighten rules for tech giantsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 5, 2021 FridayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 266 wordsBodyChinaChina will tighten the regulation of technology companies to more effectively combat monopolistic practices and financial flows that pose a risk to the financial system,Prime Minister Li Keqiang announced this Friday.Efforts [to combat] monopoly situations and unregulated capital flows will intensify" to ensure healthy competition, Li said, at the opening of the annual plenary session of the Chinese parliament.In late 2020, the communist government stopped online payment giant Ant Group, founded by Jack Ma, pioneer of e-commerce in China with his Alibaba group. The aborted operation should have been the biggest introduction to the stock exchange of all time.Alibaba and its rival Tencent (with the WeChat Pay service) are the two private giants that split the vast electronic payment market in China, a so far unregulated sector in a country where cash has almost disappeared.Beijing is particularly concerned about the growing weight of the private giants,to the detriment of traditional banks and whose loans pose a risk to the country's financial system.In recent months, the Chinese government had already begun to strengthen control over digital giants. In December, Alibaba was put under investigation by "suspicious monopoly practices".Regulators also tightened the rules on online microcredit, popular among Chinese and small businesses that struggle to borrow from traditional banks.The digital economy has in recent years hada strong development, thanks to the generalization of electronic payments and the multiplication of online services within reach of smartphones.MJPR***Load-Date: March 6, 2021End of Document

The Shenzhen Component Index added 2.4%, or 349.90 points, to 14,857.34, ending a five-day losing streak that pushed the index to the lowest since Dec. 31, 2020.Sentiment in the local equities market recovered after the latest Caixin China General Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which measures manufacturing activity in the country, stood at 50.9 in February, still indicating an expansion, despite falling from 51.5 in January, missing a consensus estimate of 51.4, according to a Reuters poll.However, manufacturers in China remained generally upbeat about their output over the next 12 months, with the degree of optimism reaching the second-highest in 6.5 years, according to the Caixin-IHS Markit survey.The survey data came just a day after the Chinese government's own survey also showed a slowdown in factory activity, with the official PMI also falling 1.5% to 50.6 in February from 51.3 in January, missing analysts' consensus estimate of 51.1 based on a Reuters poll.The government also reported the 11th straight month of expansion within the country's services activity, driven by strong activity within the retail, catering, entertainment and related sectors. China's services PMI fell 1.9% to 51.4 in February from 52.4 in January.On the corporate front, shares of new energy electrical equipment company BECE Legend Group (SHE:000803) jumped 10% at close after the Shenzhen Stock Exchange removed the delisting risk warning against the company's shares, effective Monday.Load-Date: March 1, 2021End of Document

Virus and Aliexpress hit Chinese stores in SpainCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 5, 2021 FridayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 768 wordsBodyThe pandemic and economic crisis in which the country is plunged is not only affecting domestic trade, but also abroad, and more specifically Chinese, which has invested more than 4 billion euros in Spain since 2015.Thousands of Chinese citizens based in our country have had to leave because of the pandemic and the strong pressure that is being put on the part of the competition of online commerce, such as Aliexpress or Amazon, who sell similar products at low prices, in addition to the rise of chains that also market bazaar products, such as Lidl, with strong discounts.It is estimated that the output there is is very significant, with a figure of around 27,000 people compared to the previous year, although at the moment there are no official figures as there is no registration at the national level. However, the crisis is not affecting in the same way multi-product, clothing or telephony stores, among others, as restaurants or small grocery stores, which have had to close and which has had a domino effect, leaving many people unemployed. The first to closeA year ago, when the pandemic was still China's business, the merchants of this country were the first to see the wolf's ears and closed the doors of their businesses in Spain before anyone else. The strict measures they took from the outset have made them less contagious compared to other citizens. According to data provided by the Chinese community itself, 1,300 citizens have been infected and 21 of the nearly 200,000 living in Spain have died. "Caution is part of our culture, we prefer to prevent," says Jia Jun, spokesman for the Chinese Association in Spain (ACHE).While everyone is working hard to save business, the Chinese community says they will do everything they can to try to foster cooperation between the Spanish market and the Chinese market, as "more than ever we have to be united and look for opportunities to help us get through this crisis in the best way."Although not a few have decided to return to their country because of the economic crisis and, as Esperanza Liu, a Chinese journalist based in Spain, acknowledges, "over time, if things do not recover, they will go further." However, some have also done so just because they are vaccinated. Lizhong Zhou, president of the Association of Chinese Merchants of Valencia, explains that to travel to his country of origin "it is mandatory to make a quarantine of 28 days and in addition to the price of the plane ticket, you have to pay about 700 euros of the assigned hotel where you have to be isolated for two weeks when you arrive, plus the expenses of being another seven days in another hotel where you live and finally you are obliged to stay a week more at home with phone medical control." Leaving is not easy, but as a small Chinese trader explains, "there it is all very organized. All you need is your Chinese passport to get vaccinated, whether you live outside, and the vaccine is free. However, you need to have time to be able to quarantine and enough money to pay all the expenses."However, since the Association of Chinese of Spain they consider that it cannot be generalized, since thesemovements are natural. Most Chinese citizens residing in Spain have stayed. "People are more afraid of contracting the virus on the trip, besides that China has a very strict quarantine. We are not very clear about the free of the vaccine. You'll be vaccinated if you qualify, no matter where you live. If you are a high-risk person or work in high-exposure posts to the virus such as toilets, police, airport staff, etc. And in addition, vaccines are voluntary, stakeholders can consult all the information published by the government."Beyond the Chinese community, all Spanish trade continues to claim aid. A total of nine employers, including Hospitality of Spain, Restoration Marks, the Spanish Trade Confederation or the textile trade association Acotex claimed in February assistance of 12.5 billion euros to save both sectors - trade and hospitality - which are among the most affected by the coronavirus crisis. Of that total amount, 8 billion will go to hospitality and EUR 4.5 billion for trade.On 9 March, the Government plans to approve in the next Council of Ministers the public aid package amounting to EUR 11 billion for the hospitality, tourism and trade sector which President Pedro Sánchez announced on 24 February and which has raised great doubts ever since. This package will be aimed at avoiding solvency problems in companies, especially SMEs, after the impact suffered.commentsforum0WhatsApp  Facebook  Twitter  Linkedin       Load-Date: March 6, 2021End of Document

Microsoft warned that Chinese hackers gained access to user mailCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 4, 2021 ThursdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 591 wordsBodyU.S. software multinational Microsoft warned Tuesday that hackers supported by the Chinese government gained access to email accounts from its Exchange Server business service.Microsoft said a "highly qualified and sophisticated" group of hackers, which is sponsored by a government and operates from China, has been trying to steal information from various U.S. targets, including universities, defense contractors, law firms, and infectious disease researchers.In an official blog post of the company, its corporate vice president for user security and trust, Tom Burt, indicated that hackers took advantage of four previously unknown system weaknesses.Through the system failures that the hackers managed to identify, they accessed the server, from which they were able to steal information such as accounts and email contacts while installing elements of malicious software or malware.The company noted that it has released security updates to fix vulnerabilities in its Exchange Server software, which is used for email services and work calendar, especially for large organizations that have their own email servers. It does not affect personal email accounts or cloud-based Microsoft services.Microsoft noted that the hacker group, which it identified as Hafnium, was able to trick Exchange servers into accessing them. Subsequently, hackers became someone who should have access and created a way to control the server remotely so that they could steal information from an organization's network.He added that the group is based in China, but operates from private virtual servers leased in the United States, which helps it avoid detection.Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, refused to identify any specific objectives or say how many organizations were affected.Volexity, a cybersecurity company based in Reston, Virginia, to which Microsoft attributes intrusion detection, reported that its network security monitoring service began detecting a suspicious data transfer in late January."They were just downloading the email, they literally attacked with everything," said Steven Adair, president of Volexity, who said the targets have included "defense contractors, international aid and development organizations, and the NGO community and think centers."Adair noted that it was concerned that hackers will accelerate its activity in the coming days before organizations can install Microsoft security updates."That's how bad it looks now, I think it's about to get worse," he said. "This gives them a limited number of opportunities to go and take advantage of something. The patch isn't going to fix that if they left a back door."Last December, the cybersecurity company FireEye, one of america's largest, reported that government-linked hackers from a foreign country - suspicions are focused on Russia - managed to access their systems and steal material from them.On that occasion, FireEye called the attacker "highly sophisticated" and made available to its customers a series of tools designed to counter any attack in case hackers attempted to use the stolen material to access their equipment.The material stolen by hackers in that case were products that the firm uses to detect weaknesses in its customers' networks and thus remedy, so they could beexploited to precisely the opposite: identify vulnerabilities and proceed to attack.(With EFE and AP information)READ ON:UK record: head of speculative fund paid $480 million in 2020Japanese tycoon seeks out eight people who want to travel to the Moon for free in 2023Load-Date: March 5, 2021End of Document

But he said the report was exaggerated and that China has the right to use social media.China blocks key data from first cases: WHO researcherAn Associated Press investigation in collaboration with the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Laboratory found that powerful political figures and allied media in both China and the United States, Russia, and Iran flooded the globe with misinformation about the virus.The report known days earlier contends that Chinese officials reacted against the version—fed by then-US President Donald Trump and others—that the virus had been manufactured in China, a possibility they ruled out by most experts.Chinese space probe sends a video of MarsAsked about AP's report at its daily conference at the chancellery,Hua said that some in Western countries like the United States do not want to hear China's objective and real voice.They fear that more people will know the truth so that they can no longer spread false information unscrupulously and do whatever they want to deceive and monopolize international public opinion," he said.The Chinese reaction was to spread rumors that the virus had been created in a U.S. military laboratory and released during an international military athlete competition in Wuhan, the Chinese city where the new coronavirus was first detected in late 2019.'Our gratitude always': Ebrard to China and CanSinoSearching for the origins of the virus has become a political issue. Trump wanted to blame China, in part for deflecting criticism of his administration for the way it faced the pandemic in the United States.In turn, China has reported that the virus was circulating outside the country before the outbreak in Wuhan, hinting that it arrived from abroad.Determining the origin of the virus will likely require years of research and may never be known. The most likely hypothesis, according to most scientists, is that it was transmitted by bats in southwest China or neighboring Southeast Asia to other animals, which in turn transmitted it to humans.Asc  Load-Date: February 19, 2021End of Document

Chinese Dissidents Tell Supreme Court: Protecting Donor Privacy A Matter of Life and Death; First Liberty Institute submits friend-of-the-court brief in key cases challenging California's blanket private donor records reporting requirementGlobeNewswireMarch 1, 2021 Monday 10:33 AM PTCopyright 2021 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: LAW & LEGAL ISSUESLength: 491 wordsBodyWASHINGTON, March  01, 2021  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- First Liberty Institute representing Citizen Power Initiatives for China ("Citizen Power") today filed a friend-of-the-court brief at the Supreme Court of the United States in cases regarding donor privacy, Americans For Prosperity v. Becerra and Thomas More Law Center v. Becerra. Citizen Power is a nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing a peaceful transition to democracy in China and has donors who face reprisals by the Chinese government and those acting on its behalf.You can read the brief here."For our client and its supporters, maintaining privacy is a matter of life and death," said Kelly Shackelford, President, CEO, and Chief Counsel for First Liberty Institute. "In today's cancel culture, people know it's unwise to trust our own government with their private information, let alone China. It is vital that the Justices protect donors' privacy to shield them from threats, harassment, and worse."Citizen Power's founder and president, Dr. Yang Jianli, narrowly escaped capture as he witnessed the Tiananmen Square massacre. Following his return to China, he was imprisoned until diplomatic efforts by the international community   including the United States   procured his release. Immediately following his return to the United States, he formed Citizen Power Initiatives, which has seen at least one of its major donors imprisoned in China.California requires all charitable organizations that solicit contributions within the state to register and file periodic reports with its Attorney General, including a list of the names and addresses of all of their major donors. California law imposes no civil or criminal penalties for disclosure of these records. The district court also found that California's blanket disclosure system has resulted in the exposure of around 1,800 confidential donor lists and that even during some of the litigation, California's website rendered vulnerable to unsophisticated hackers every confidential document in the registry.According to the brief, "The liberties that the First Amendment expressly guarantees depend on a vigorous protection of the auxiliary freedom of association. Blanket donor-disclosure regimes like California's create an intolerable risk of exposure and thus severely abridge that freedom. Exposure of a group's members and donors can subject them to significant reprisals by the public and therefore dissuade further membership and donations   a fact that this Court has acknowledged when marking the freedom of association's contours."About First Liberty Institute First Liberty Institute is a non-profit public interest law firm and the largest legal organization in the nation dedicated exclusively to defending religious freedom for all Americans.To arrange an interview, contact Chris Freund at media@firstliberty.org or by calling 972-941-4453.Contact: Chris Freund, media@firstliberty.org Direct: 972-941-4453Load-Date: March 1, 2021End of Document

China encourages conspiracy theory: COVID emerged in US labCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 25, 2021 MondayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 379 wordsBodyLocal media and a Chinese government official have been tasked in recent days with stoking conspiracy theories about the origin of coronavirus and have sought to dismiss pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine, despite studies indicating it is safe.This arises in the context that the Communist Party, which governs the country, is strongly challenged by the production of vaccines made in China, in addition to the slow initial response to SARS-CoV-2 that could enable global expansion.According to officials and media, the virus could have developed in a U.S. military lab. In addition, they continue to sow doubts about the effectiveness of Western vaccines in deflecting attacks as a World Health Organization (WHO) team landed in Wuhan, China,to initiate research on the origin of the virus.Some of these conspiracy theories find a receptive audience at home. The social media hashtag "American's Ft. Detrick," initiated by the Communist Youth League,was seen at least 400 million times last week after a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs called for a WHO investigation of the biological weapons lab in Maryland."Its purpose is to pass the chinese government'smismanence in the early days of the pandemic to the US conspiracy," said Fang Shimin, a writer now residing in the United States known for exposing fake titles and other frauds in Chinese science. "The tactic is quite successful because of the widespread anti-American sentiment in China."Yuan Zeng, a Chinese media expert at Leeds University in Britain, said government stories spread so widely that even well-educated Chinese friends asked him if they might be true.Inflating doubts and spreading conspiracy theories could increase public health risks as governments try to dispel unease about vaccines, he said. "That's super, super dangerous."In the last round, state media called for an investigation into the deaths of 23 elderly people in Norway after receiving the Pfizer vaccine. A host of CGTN, the English-language station of the state broadcaster CCTV, and the Global Times accused Western media of ignoring the news.Health experts say non-vaccine deaths are possible during mass vaccination campaigns, and a WHO panel has concluded that the vaccine did not play a "contributing role" in Norway's deaths.Load-Date: January 26, 2021End of Document

Why Has Jack Ma, Alibaba Figurehead and China's Richest Man, Gone Missing?RealMoneyJanuary 8, 2021 Friday 10:00 AM EDTCopyright 2021 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1007 wordsByline: Alex Frew McMillanHighlight: China's highest-profile entrepreneur has vanished from sight for more than two months, and is said to have been told by the authorities not to leave town.BodyIf Elon Musk vanished from sight for more than two months -- at his most insufferable, I'm sure we've all wished that would happen -- investors would be sending out a search party. Where is the figurehead who has led their company and its shares to unprecedented heights?His Chinese counterpart, Jack Ma, has now vanished from vision for more than two months, with his company under investigation by the Chinese authorities. There is no word of his whereabouts. Here in Asia, we're wondering where China's poster-boy entrepreneur has gone.It's rumored, and quite likely, that Ma has been told not to leave China. He may well be keeping his head under the parapets of his own accord. Whatever the case, the situation is so serious and politically charged that the Beijing government is now reportedly censoring news in the Chinese media about the antitrust probe into Ma's baby.Ma, the co-founder and figurehead of the e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding  , was last seen on Oct. 31, when he took part in the livestreamed gala extravaganza to kick off China's festival of spending, "Double 11." That was exactly one week after he gave a speech at a financial conference in Shanghai in which he criticized China's banking regulators and industry, calling out the state-run banks for having a "pawnshop mentality."Bad move. Several highly influential bankers and regulators were in attendance, spluttering into their Nongfu Spring bottled water. Behind the scenes, we hear, Chinese President Xi Jinping was furious.Xi had already met privately a couple of years back with Ma and the founder of video-game maker and WeChat app operator Tencent Holdings (TCEHY), Pony Ma (who is no relation), to remind China's two richest people and most-famous executives that their companies operate only at the behest of the Communist Party. Xi, he needed not remind them, is the only sheriff in town.Days after that Shanghai speech, Ma and the two top executives at Ant Group, the company Ma founded to process payments for Alibaba's Web sites, had been hauled in for questioning about their free-wheeling financial model, which extends consumer loans to shoppers and offers a suite of third-party financial services. On Nov. 3 Ant was blocked from listing its shares for the first time, only two days before what was scheduled at US$37 billion to be the largest initial public offering in world history.President Xi personally quashed the IPO,  . That rings true, since the Shanghai stock exchange had already cleared the offering before then ordering that it be pulled at the last minute. Xi "has displayed a diminishing tolerance" for big private businesses that wield capital and influence -- and jumped-up executives who challenge the iron rule of the man dubbed China's "Emperor for Life."Chinese regulators are now seeking to restructure and possibly break up Ant Group, which runs the ubiquitous Alipay digital-wallet app. They are also concerned about business practices not only at Alibaba but also its rivals such as JD.com  and Pinduoduo  . Chinese e-commerce sites have a notorious "1 from 2" policy for many merchants that forces them to agreements to sell their goods only via the Web site of one platform.Ant is getting kicked in the other shin, too. U.S. President Donald Trump is making one of his last actions in office  on Tuesday to ban U.S. individuals and companies from transacting with Alipay and seven other Chinese apps, including Tencent's WeChat Pay and QQ Wallet. Trump said the apps are able to capture "vast swaths" of personal and sensitive information from users, making them a national-security threat.Ma suddenly finds himself a political persona non grata. The Chinese government's propaganda arm has issued a directive to news outlets to toe the official line on the investigation into Alibaba, and not to engage in any kind of analysis of the events without permission, the  today, citing two people who read the order.Several online blog posts discussing Ma's whereabouts have been censored and taken down, according to the FT. What's more, an online publication backed by Alibaba that published an editorial warning about excessive punishment of Chinese tech companies was forced to cease operations for a month.Ma did not show up for his own TV show in November. He personally heard the pitches from entrepreneurs looking to become Africa's Business Heroes, in the show by that name. But when the final episode aired, he was nowhere to be seen, his place taken by an Alibaba executive. An Alibaba spokesperson said "Jack Ma had to miss the final due to a scheduling conflict."Ma is not on the official list of people who are prevented from leaving China. But Bloomberg reports that he was in December told not to leave the country. A hashtag about him being banned from leaving was scrubbed by censors from China's Twitter-like Weibo  app.Musk may be the richest man in America, and indeed now the world. But Ma, who loves the limelight, is his direct equivalent in China, his US$65.6 billion fortune making him the richest man there. Ma stepped down as executive chairman from Alibaba in September 2019, but his shadow over the company looms large, while he is a mythic figure among Chinese investors chasing the next "unicorn" startup to turn into a billion-dollar company.There's a danger for the Communist Party in taking on Ma. While political rights are nonexistent in China, personal-property and commercial rights are well-protected. Setting Alibaba in the party's sights will spook other successful entrepreneurs, most of whom already attempt to secret large chunks of their wealth overseas, out of the hands of the Communist Party.Still, the Communist Party will usually find a way of bringing you down if they want you to fall. Bribery and corruption allegations are the normal charges leveled.Temporarily, it seems, they've already got their wish with Mr. Ma. I'd bet he is keeping quiet after opening his mouth in Shanghai got him into such trouble in Shanghai. But when and where will he surface next?!Load-Date: January 9, 2021End of Document

China's army of small investors want in on the GameStop maniaCNN WireJanuary 29, 2021 Friday 11:55 AM GMTCopyright 2021 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 720 wordsByline: By Laura He and Serenitie Wang, CNN BusinessDateline: (CNN) Body             The frenzy over GameStop has inspired amateurs everywhere to shake up stock markets. Now China's massive army of retail investors wantsto get in on the action.Talk of the video game retailer's epic share surge has taken over Chinese social media and the eye-popping gains in that stock and others have become the envy of the country's young day traders. They're now calling on each other to band together to emulate their American counterparts in driving up the share prices of struggling companies."Market makers are trembling in front of retail investors who grouped together," wrote one user on the social media website Weibo. "It will soon be China's turn."Just as Millennials and Gen Zers in the United States have bemoaned the hedge funds and short-sellers that are part of the Wall Street elite, many small investors in China have cried foul over what they see as exploitation of the market by the big institutions.Mainland China's financial markets are very different to New York's. Short-selling is highly regulated and incredibly rare, making it hard forChinese investors toreplicate the US frenzy that has pumped up GameStop sharesas a way to stick it to hedge funds that bet the company's stock would crash.Even so, everyday investors in China have a ton of influence over market activity. There are more than 177 million retail investors, or individual traders, in China. That's 99% of the investor base, according to December statistics compiledby the China Securities Depository and Clearing Corporation.And they have their grievances, too.Mom-and-pop investors often complain that they are being harvested like "leeks" - a common vegetable in the Chinese diet" - by the big players cheating them out of money they think they deserve.  (The government can sometimes be the target of this anger, too, if the broader market is doing poorly.)"This is so awesome," wrote another Weibo user, referring to the GameStop saga. "The 'leeks' from all over the world should all unite."Chinese investors could in theory try to collectively push up the price of an individual stock and then dump it before institutional investors do. But that's a tall order, given the resources and knowledge that big-time stock pickers have. And institutional firms that focus on long trades can ultimately benefit from stock surges.Hard to replicateDictating major market swings is "theoretically" doable for Chinese individual investors, said Kenny Tang, CEO of Royston Securities, a Hong Kong-based brokerage firm, given their familiarity with using social media chat rooms to place bets on individual stocks."You can imagine it's not hard for some of them to gang up and have an influence on individual stocks, especially small caps," said Tang.China is no stranger to market volatility driven by frenzied trading. When the Nasdaq-style Star Market launched in Shanghai in 2019, local investors helped some of the stocks skyrocket in value. Shares in one company rocketed by 400% on the first day of trading.The Chinese government and state media are also keenly aware of how those individual investors can drive shares. State media, for example, called on local investors to pour money into markets last summer as the economy recovered from the coronavirus pandemic. When the rally appeared to be moving too fast, some news outlets dialed back a bit and encouraged more conservative trading.Analysts warn, though, that coordinated trading in a country like China, where everything is highly regulated, is fraught with peril."If you catch regulators' attention, it probably won't end well for you," said Tang, who added that people who attempt to organize big market swings risk arrest, should the government suspect them of stock market manipulation.Others, like retail investor Luke Chen, aren't really sold on the idea of an amateur revolution in China because of how much more professional knowledge the established investment firms hold."Individual investors are way less powerful than big investors in terms of capital size, investing knowledge - even some trading apps are exclusively better optimized for big investors," said Chen, who is based in Shanghai.                      By Laura He and Serenitie Wang, CNN Business         TM & © 2021 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

I'M COLLECTING THESE VIDEOS DAY AND NIGHT IN AN ATTEMPT TO SHOW THE WORLD': FORMER CAMP DETAINEEStates News ServiceMarch 19, 2021 FridayCopyright 2021 States News ServiceLength: 706 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Zumrat Dawut discusses how she is using China's own propaganda to expose abuses in Xinjiang.Zumrat Dawut, a former internment camp detainee who has witnessed first-hand the Chinese government's oppression of Uyghurs in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), has been a vital source of testimony and other evidence for international governments and media. She has repeatedly testified and reported on the tragedies of the internment camp system, where up to 1.8 million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities are believed to have been detained since early 2017.As more evidence has emerged about China's policies in the XUAR, Beijing has faced increasing international scrutiny, including from the U.S. government, which in January designated them part of an orchestrated genocide. The parliaments of Canada and The Netherlands last month passed resolutions using similar language. Meanwhile, the Chinese government has been orchestrating a propaganda blitz in a bid to refute the claims.Dawut, who now lives in Virginia with her family, spends much of her spare time searching for video and other evidence about the Uyghur situation on Chinese social mediaoften posted by state media outlets. She then uploads videos to other social media platforms that circulate more widely outside of China, particularly Facebook, where the videos are shared and viewed many times. RFA's Uyghur Service spoke with Dawut about the videos she has found and her motivation in sharing them with the world.Dawut: I have been benefiting greatly from apps and programs developed by the Chinese government, who believes in what they're doing. Using these apps, I'm collecting videos day and night, looking for proof for the world. I've been collecting these videos because I think we have to tell the world about what's going on, always with proof for all of our assertions.People living outside the Uyghur Region can't fully understand what's going on, but we Uyghurs, all of us Uyghurs living abroad, we know. Hashar (corvee labor) has been around since we were all small. In the past, it was the cadres from village brigades and townships who would take people out into the fields to do hashar, to dig streams and till the fields. But if you watch the videos that are currently coming out, police are appearing in these settings. If you look at the videos, you can even see that the police are bringing them to and from the worksites by bus, systematically ... Looking at this, it's not even possible to rule out the possibility that the laborers are people who have been brought from camps. If we tell non-Uyghurs about this, we can't fully explain it to them. We're Uyghurall Uyghurs know about this, about hashar. We can't fully explain it in words to non-Uyghurs, that they force Uyghurs to work, that they make us work for free. We can't fully express this, and so I'm collecting these videos day and night in an attempt to show the world. I'm sharing them on Facebook and other channels.All of the videos have a value we can take advantage of. Like the one where a girl at school asked if her teachers were going to punish her if she spoke Uyghur. I made that the subject of my search and found it myself. I did the work and then I shared it. I knew I should put something out about it, and that I could not stop my work. I didn't sleep the next night. I stayed up and searched for more videos similar to that one, and I found a video of a child in Kashgar saying that their school doesn't allow them to speak Uyghur, that they have to speak Uyghur in secret since they're not allowed otherwise. Each of my own children would be able to give interviews about the way children aren't allowed to speak Uyghur in school right now, the way they're punished if they do.The shares have been very good. [They've] been shared a lot. The view count is really high. Many journalists have written news based on information they found on my Facebook wall. They've asked me questions about where and how I found the videos, and they've written some good news articles based on them.Reported by Mihray Abdilim for RFA's Uyghur Service.

SXSW Online 2021: 'In the Same Breath' should be mandatory viewingMichigan Daily: University of Michigan-Ann ArborMarch 26, 2021 FridayUniversity WireCopyright 2021 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: ARTS; Pg. 1Length: 896 wordsByline: Katrina StebbinsBodyExempting the news, I have been trying to avoid all media made during and/or about the COVID-19 pandemic, instead retreating to familiar comfort movies over the past year and drawing a clear line between my exits into escapism and my real life. Making this distinction has been helpful in maintaining some semblance of control over a small part of my life, in keeping something that brings me joy away from what's been happening outside.Nanfu Wang's "In the Same Breath" documents the spread of COVID-19 from its source in Wuhan, China. It depicts the Chinese and American governments' handling of the situation and the immense toll it has had on the families of victims and the frontline healthcare workers who have worked through the worst of the pandemic. The documentary unequivocally breaks the informal, "no-COVID-in-my-movies" rule I had laid out for myself, but, as the United States marked a full year of the pandemic and lockdown, I felt like I was ready to cross the line.I wasn't."In the Same Breath" begins and ends on the same day, one year apart - Jan. 1 - at midnight during New Year's celebrations in Wuhan. Wang, whose mother lives in a village 200 miles outside of the city, had flown in with her young son to ring in 2020. She ended up going home to New York City early, leaving her son in her mother's care, but as the novel coronavirus spread throughout Hubei Province, she and her husband scrambled to get their son back to the United States.That was in mid-January of 2020. By Jan. 23, Wuhan was completely closed off in an effort to contain the virus to the city. International alarms hadn't been set off yet, and the Chinese government was scrambling to keep everything quiet and contained. However, Wang noticed message boards start to explode with posts from people concerned that they had been showing alarming symptoms of what doctors had dismissed as the common cold or flu. As cases started to rise exponentially and the city locked down, Wang enlisted a team of camerapeople from within Wuhan to film inside hospitals and on the near-empty city streets.The access these camera operators offer can be stunning in its reach, as it spans from inside hospital rooms, right next to patients dying of the virus, to the inside of an ambulance carrying someone to the hospital, to small apartments and narrow stairways where the infected are seen being carried away on stretchers. This footage is gut-wrenching in its intimacy. It captures, in one instance, a woman being turned away from a hospital because it's at full capacity. Her family members are left standing on the street, wondering if she will be able to survive the trip home.These shots of on-the-ground footage are interspersed with testimonials from people whose family members died of the virus and clips from Chinese news networks tracking the government's response or nonresponse to the virus's emergence. These clips give a more holistic view of COVID-19's impact on the city on a personal and political level, but they also serve to emphasize a greater point Wang makes about Chinese propaganda and nationalism.In a particularly eerie sequence, nine news anchors repeat the same lines insisting that the virus is not a threat, over and over again, word for word. Two family members of COVID-19 victims, devastated by their losses, adamantly insist that they are grateful to the government for leading them through the pandemic.The documentary is not only an indictment of Chinese authoritarianism, government censorship and propaganda, but of the American healthcare system. It draws parallels between the way early warnings about the virus were suppressed in China and the way that some health care workers in the United States were reprimanded, punished and sometimes fired for raising concerns about hospitals' preparation for the virus. It recalls how Dr. Anthony Fauci publicly insisted that there was no reason to be walking around with a mask on as late as March 8, 11 days before California became the first state to issue a stay-at-home order.One of the film's closing arguments posits that the official number of COVID-19 related deaths in Wuhan, around 3,000 at the end of Wuhan's lockdown in April, was in reality upwards of 30,000. In the United States, we've seen the same kind of manipulation of numbers recently, with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo currently being investigated for, among other things, covering up high death counts in nursing homes.All of the film's elements come together to a devastating effect. Through testimonials and such frank images of suffering, the personal consequences of the pandemic inspire compassion. When they are tied to evidence of governmental mishandling of the pandemic (evidence which we have in spades) and images of rising authoritarianism, they inspire outrage, frustration and maybe just a little bit of existential dread."In the Same Breath" is as brutal and unflinching as it is informative, and I feel its emotional impact deeply. Watching it meant scaling my carefully constructed wall which blocked out COVID-19 related content and falling into a painfully comprehensive look at the reality of the pandemic. It made me simultaneously relieved that we are through the worst of things but terrified of what it's going to mean for the world going forward.Daily Arts Writer Katrina Stebbins can be reached at katstebb@umich.eduLoad-Date: March 28, 2021End of Document

NYSE bans Chinese telecom stocks in second about-face of the weekCNN WireJanuary 6, 2021 Wednesday 4:25 PM GMTCopyright 2021 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 482 wordsDateline: LONDON (CNN Business) BodyLONDON (CNN Business) --  The New York Stock Exchange will delist three Chinese telecommunications stocks to comply with an executive order from the Trump administration --- its second about-face on the issue this week.The exchange said Wednesday that it would end trading of shares in China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom on Jan. 11. The decision comes after President Donald Trump banned Americans late last year from investing in firms that the US government suspects are either owned or controlled by the Chinese military.The NYSE has now abruptly changed its position on the issue twice, sowing confusion among investors and whipsawing the companies' stocks.The exchange first announced last week that it would bar shares of China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom. But it reversed course on Monday, citing "further consultation with relevant regulatory authorities."By Wednesday, the exchange had reverted to its original position, citing "new specific guidance" from the US Treasury Department that was delivered on Tuesday.Confusion at the NYSEThe bizarre back-and-forth has left investors in the lurch. The three companies are also listed in Hong Kong, and shareholders sold holdings there on Monday before buying back in when the NYSE backtracked the first time. Shares in New York fell on Wednesday following the latest announcement. China Telecom's stock dropped 3.7%, while China Mobile fell 2.7%. Shares in China Unicom were off 2.3%.The action is poised to ramp up tensions between the world's two biggest economies shortly before President-elect Joe Biden enters the White House. The Chinese government has criticized the United States for "wantonly suppressing foreign companies listed in the country" and previously said it would take "necessary measures" to safeguard the interests of Chinese firms.On Tuesday, Trump signed an executive order banning transactions with eight Chinese apps, including Ant Group's Alipay and Tencent's QQ Wallet and WeChat Pay. It's not clear it has teeth, however, given that it's due to take effect after Trump leaves office.All three of the telecom companies have traded in New York for many years. China Mobile, the country's largest telecom company, has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange since 1997. Rivals China Telecom and China Unicom, meanwhile, have been trading there since the early 2000s.Trump's order on firms with alleged military connections, which kicks in next week, gives investors until November 2021 to divest from financial instruments with exposure to such companies.It's part of a broader campaign the Trump administration has launched against China's technology sector. Washington has also struck at the country's artificial intelligence and semiconductor sectors in recent years.--- Laura He contributed reporting.TM & © 2021 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

CHINA ANNOUNCES NEW ANIMAL TESTING POLICY FOR COSMETICS AFTER PETA PUSHStates News ServiceMarch 8, 2021 MondayCopyright 2021 States News ServiceLength: 442 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: Norfolk, VA BodyThe following information was released by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA):Following a sustained PETA effort that included exposing companies for secretly paying for tests on animals, China has just announced that it will allow imported "general cosmetics"such as shampoo, body wash, lipstick, lotion, and makeupto be sold in the country without being tested on animals. This means that companies that take certain steps can soon market most imported ordinary cosmetics in China without being required to pay for them to be force-fed to animals or dripped into their eyes.In 2012, PETA uncovered that many companies that had banned all animal tests were quietly paying the Chinese government to test their products on animals. The group learnedand publicly revealedthat China required companies to pay for tests on animals for cosmetics and other personal-care products. After exposing the companies' secretive support for testing, PETA took action to end the testing requirements. It partnered with leading non-animal testing experts at the Institute for In Vitro Sciences (IIVS) and awarded the institute two grants, which enabled a team to train Chinese scientists in non-animal test methods and set up animal-free testing laboratories in China. PETA also proposed that IIVS seek support from cosmetics companies, which the scientific nonprofit organization did.This new policy follows China's 2014 rule change that allows companies that manufacture general (formerly known as "nonspecial use") cosmetics in that country to avoid animal tests for such products."No animal should die in a laboratory for any reasoneverand especially not for a lipstick," says PETA Senior Vice President Kathy Guillermo.

US/China.- China and US cross reproaches and expectations in one of their first contacts in the Biden AdministrationCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 6, 2021 SaturdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 335 wordsBody    MADRID, 6 (EUROPA PRESS)    The Chinese government has urged the United States to "rectify its mistakes made" to work together with "mutual respect," Beijing reported following Saturday's conversation between top diplomat Yang Jiechi and new US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in one of the first talks between the two countries following Joe Biden's arrival at the White House.   In response, US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken reminded China that China will continue to defend its traditional values and has called on the Asian giant to respect international law.   Yang, director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, emphasized that the two sides "must respect each other's core interests and the options of the political system and the path of development and manage their internal affairs," following years of trade tension with former President Donald Trump.   "China will unwaveringly follow its path of 'Socialism with Chinese characteristics' and no force will be able to stop the realization of the Great Rejuvenation of the Chinese Nation," Yang said, according to the recount of the conversation, picked up by China's official news agency, Xinhua.   In response, and according to a message posted on his Twitter account, Blinken made it "clear" that the United States will "defend its national interests, democratic values, and hold Beijing accountable for its abuses of the international system."   In addition, it has warned that China will "be held accountable for its efforts to threaten stability in the Indo-Pacific, and especially in the Taiwan Strait."   Biden, in previous days, expressed his intention to continue to put pressure on Beijing because of its "human rights practices". Just days after his arrival at the White House, the State Department has issued a statement supporting Washington's "commitment" to Taiwan and calling on Beijing to "cease military, diplomatic and economic pressure" on the island.Load-Date: February 7, 2021End of Document

Continue reading Yuan Pay GroupIn this era, everyone wants to earn online, but most people find it difficult to find online earning means. Trading is one of the best online options to earn a lot of money while staying at      home. The Coronavirus pandemic has also promoted remote working. During the lockdown, the major companies asked their employees to work from home. A vast majority of people who became      unemployed during the lockdown are turning to online trading.Yuan Pay Group ReviewFor trading, there are many trading platforms or exchanges that are offering hundreds of products for trading. But people in the majority do not possess the technical skill of trading. What s      more, it takes a lot of time to become a professional trader. Trading bots, on the other hand, provide a safe way to investors because these do no demand high skills. One will have to submit      money and wait for profit because the algorithms used in the software automatically execute trades. Out of unlimited trading bots, Yuan Pay App is a reliable trading bot with unlimited      features.Brief Introduction to Yuan Pay Group AppYuan Pay Group is the first reliable software that allows you to trade the Chinese national cryptocurrency, digital yuan. As you know, the Chinese cryptocurrency is going to become the next big      reserve currency of the world as China is the fastest growing economy in the world. It is the only app that is offering the digital yuan for trading. Moreover, the company claims that it is      regulated by the Chinese government.With the Yuan Pay Group, one can convert his national currency into the digital yuan. In the coming days, China s national cryptocurrency will become the top-rated currency of the world. This      is a golden opportunity for you before it may become the favorite coin of the investors. The software is built using the advanced technology of the modern era that executes only winning trades.      A trader can be offered the ability to trade other top-rated pairs that result in high profit. The firm started contributing crypto community in 2010, and since then it has worked with many      banks and institutions in putting cryptocurrency on the mainstream road. It does not work like traditional bots in the markets. Rather, it is a unique platform that works on advanced principles      of technology. According to the company: YuanPay group was created in 2010 and since then we ve been working with banks and other organizations to legalize crypto trading in China and develop relations with external investors. Start your Journey with the Yuan Pay GroupNo company can beat the Yuan Pay Group in ease and functionalities. If you follow few simple steps, you can become a dedicated member of the trading company. I will elaborate on the simple      strategy to become the official member of the firm. Following are a few simple steps that you need to follow.Phase 1: RegistrationUnlike many other companies, Yuan Pay Group will not put you in confusion as the process of registration is simple and easy. Besides its regulated nature, it does not demand comprehensive      information that is required to fulfill requirements of anti-money laundering (AML) and Know your customer (KYC) policies. Simple, you have to write basic information in the given boxes, which      are opened after you click on the registration page. The basic information includes first name, last name, email, and phone number. Furthermore, it is recommended to use a strong password so      that the account will remain safe from any kind of hacking attack.Phase 2: Deposit MoneySimilar to the first step, the second step is also easy and does not waste the time of investors. The customers, in this step, are required to submit funds in the trading bot. As long as you do      not add money to the wallet of the company, the next process will not start. Yuan Pay Group does not ask users for large money, but one can start his trading journey with a little amount of      money in his bank account. It has set the minimum limit of deposit at 250 euros, which means that a user can easily trade digital yuan by adding only 250 euros to the authorized bot.Phase 3: Start TradingFinally, you are eligible to carry out a trading process involving top-rated coins in the market. On top of that, an investor can easily purchase Chinese digital currency. Once you become      familiar with it, you can earn tens of thousands by investing only a small amount of money. However, I will recommend you take benefit of demo trading because it will introduce you to the site.Top-Notch Features of Yuan Pay Group AppThe features offered by the Yuan Pay Group App are not available on its competitor platforms. The more you become familiar with it, the more you admire it. Cutting it short, I will brief you on      its top features.Regulated BrokersWhen a user trades instruments on the trading bot, it connects them to regulated brokers via API. The connected brokers are not common firms but are registered with concerned authorities.      Moreover, the rules and regulations do not create any kind of fuss in traders  pathways. What s more, the fast execution system of the trading bot will let you earn thousands of dollars in a      matter of days.Professional TeamThe team plays a major role in the success of a company. The software of the bot is designed by a team of professional developers. The developers have employed artificial intelligence to make      it feasible for the modern crypto markets. The team of the Yuan Pay Group has years of experience in the field. For your kind information, it is developed by experienced traders and developers.      According to the bot website, it was working with the Chinese government in the development of China s state digital currency.  In the  Contact Us  section, a user can register his query      or complaint. The support team of the company will contact the user promptly.Best For Novice TradersThe best thing about a trading bot is that people are not bound to gain trading experience before diving into the sector. Novice traders should select Yuan Pay Group because it makes things      easy and helpful for beginners. Earning profit without having prior experience is a charming thing. What s more, there is no need to download it on your device as it executes online. There is      only one condition as you have to become an official member of the company. Sit back and see how your minimum investment turns into large capital. When we compare it with other trading bots in      the market, we should accept the fact that it is provided with the largest return on investment.Fee Of CostOut of hundreds of trading bots, there are a few which are great in features. And there are some which offer services to customers free of cost and do not charge on trading, deposits, and      withdrawals. On the first page of the bot, it is mentioned that the company does not ask customers to pay any fees on trade. So, it is the best opportunity for newly aspired people to check the      high-profit nature of cryptocurrency. The fee structure is competitive, and you will not find such a low rate list on any other platform.Customer SupportIt is true that online chat support is not available for users. The lack of an online chat support option is the only demerit of the bot. However, the  Contact Us  is active 24-hours a day as      support agents respond to customers  queries on time. It has hired professional support agents, which work very hard to serve users in the best way possible. Till now, I have not heard a user      complaint regarding its customer support.Easy Deposits and WithdrawalsThe majority of trading platforms in the market do not ease the process of deposits and withdrawals. But you will find Yuan Pay Group a good bot when comes to the question of deposits and      withdrawals. Withdrawal facility remains available anytime, which sounds nonsense, but it is 100% true. Based on my personal experience and user reviews, I can assure you that the withdrawal      option will available to you 24-hours a day. Moreover, it does not present a list of questions before money withdrawal.Demo OptionAll bots in the market are not providing users the facility of demo option. Yuan Pay Group is one of the unique bots that are giving permission to traders to enjoy the demo option of the      software. The demo option helps people familiarizing themselves with the bot. With the demo functionality, one can know about the app in detail, plus advantages and disadvantages. Additionally,      there is no risk of money loss if you are a beginner in the field. It is the most reliable and efficient method to learn about crypto trading.Is Yuan Pay Group a Scam?As I have used the trading bot personally, I have not found any kind of fraud with it. But there are some wrong rumors which are only spread by competitors. The old customers of the bot      expressed their full satisfaction with it and also admired it for top-notch functionalities. It is a fully regulated and authorized trading company that fulfills all rules and regulations of      the regulatory authority. It fulfills the criteria of a secured trading firm. So, one cannot raise a question about its regulated nature of security. It is the best trading bot for both      beginner and professional traders due to its easy-to-use functions and options. As the company claims it is registered with the Chinese government, traders and investors can also enjoy the      trading of the digital yuan. The unemployed people could earn money by putting only 250 euros in the robot.Integrated User InterfaceThe user interface of the Yuan Pay Group is friendly and integrated so that customers will not get awkward. The user interface of a company has importance because it is the first impression of      a company or a product to customers. If a new member lands on the site and finds the user interface difficult, he will not come back. In the same way, if a trading company does not offer      friendly UI, there are very few chances that traders create a permanent relationship with that firm.Yuan Pay Group is fortunate in this sense because its user interface is outstanding. The team wrote all needed information on the homepage of the website so that newcomers will read it      carefully before registration. The reach to destination points is just a click away. Everything opens after tapping some clicks. Even beginners can feel the experience of professionalism. The      journey from your landing on the first page to real-time trading just consumes few minutes. So, an intuitive interface is one of the best features of the trading robot.How does Yuan Pay Group work?As per the site, Yuan Pay was first founded in 2010. Since then, it has been offering services related to cryptocurrency. It has worked with banks and other financial institutions in pushing      cryptocurrency to the mainstream. Finally, the Chinese government rolled out national cryptocurrency to empower the digital economy. The team of the trading robot also says that Yuan Pay Group      is selected by the government to distribute digital yuan.After years of hard work, Yuan Pay Group became authorized by the Chinese authority in the selling and buying of China s state cryptocurrency. The world s famous Financial Times reported that      the Chinese official cryptocurrency is one of the revolutions of the 21st century. China is the first largest economy to come up with a state-level digital currency. According to financial      experts, the new official currency of China will undermine the reserve power of the US dollar. The US is far behind China in the development of the national digital currency.The detailed information mentioned on the site will assist you in how to use it. According to the given information, it claims the offering of high return over investment. It is a good thing      about the site that everything is mentioned in a clear way so that new beginners will not baffle with bulk information.Is it Profit Making App?In terms of profit-making, it is the best trading bot in the market. There are many entities running in the market which does not offer high return over investment. Moreover, they also cut high      fees on deposits and withdrawals. They also charge service fees on the execution of trades. On the other hand, Yuan Pay Group does not charge fees to customers at the time of money withdrawals.      It is the best opportunity for the people who got unemployed during the pandemic. Similarly, housewives can also take profit from the opportunity by investing only 250 euros in the robot. So,      start your journey with the Pay Group App and be ready to earn money in thousands of dollars. On the website, it mentioned how interested people can become rich by purchasing China s new      cryptocurrency. The firm claims that is the only government-approved entity that can distribute digital coins among global investors.User SecurityThe security of users is the first priority of the trading bot. People care and pay major attention to a company before joining the company. It is impossible that funds of users become unsecure      on the platform of Yuan Pay Group. Once you become an official customer of the bot platform, the team of the firm takes full responsibility for his funds. Additionally, the funds of users are      safeguarded with the latest technology.In its entire history since its creation, the bot did not become vulnerable to any kind of theft attack. On the other hand, many competitors of Yuan Pay Group became victims of scams or      cyberattacks. What s more, it is authorized by the regulatory authority and follows anti-money laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) policies. So, there is no chance of scam or theft      attack as long as you stay on the app.Focus on Privacy and TransparencyFirst of all, I will talk about the rules and regulations of the company, which are related to the privacy of users. The privacy of customers is the foremost thing which should be kept in mind.      Some scam companies are selling the personal information of consumers to third parties and take millions of dollars in exchange for users  personal data. The information of a user will remain      hidden even from the staff of the company. The personal information taken at the time of registration is only for compliance purposes.Like privacy of users, the team working behind the Yuan Pay Group also pays attention to transparency on the platform. Here, transparency means that there should be a transparent relationship      between the company and its users. Everything on the site is written with a clear voice. Traders often complain that trading firms charge fees that are not even mentioned on the website. But      the Yuan Pay Group does not include hidden fees. The details about trading fees can be known by connecting with the support team of the bot.High-rated ToolsWith tools, experienced traders make a lot of money. But if the tools are accessible and feasible, the beginner traders can also fill their bank accounts with money. So, it is also a case with      the Yuan Pay Group that the tools available are very beneficial in trading China s state digital currency. With these tools, a user can purchase digital currency in a matter of minutes.Positive FeedbackDue to top-notch functionalities, the think-tank in the industry passes very positive reviews for Yuan Pay Group and the digital yuan. PayPal founder Peter Theil claimed that China is very      progressive in the development of digital currency at a national level. Furthermore, it is the first incident ever that a government is involved in the creation of cryptocurrency. Richard      Branson, the owner of Virgin Group, said in the past that when China would launch crypto, he would definitely invest in it. I have found a bundle of positive reviews on the trusted sites which      give me a firm belief that Yuan Pay Group is a reliable trading bot.ConclusionYuan Pay Group is famous among traders and investors due to its premium wallet features and management of cryptocurrency. As a leading trading bot, it defines itself as the only regulated      crypto company that is providing a golden opportunity to investors of purchasing Chinese national cryptocurrency.Tags:  Tags:, Content Marketing, IPS, Wire, EnglishLoad-Date: February 1, 2021End of Document

Urge Chinese to eat less meat to 'change the world'? Stop passing the buckPR NewswireFebruary 4, 2021 Thursday 9:01 AM ESTCopyright 2021 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 649 wordsDateline: BEIJING, Feb. 4, 2021 BodyPR NewswireA news report by China.org.cn on meat consumption and environmental issues: TIME magazine recently published an article titled "How China could change the world by taking meat off the menu."It gives an overview of the development of plant-based meat in China. Seemingly objective, the author linked China's meat consumption with global environmental issues between the lines, implying that China should and can put its weight behind the plant-based meat industry and cut meat consumption.However, the author deliberately ignores an important fact: per capita consumption of meat in China is well below levels seen in Europe and America.In light of eating habits and spending power, people in China don't eat meat every day or every single meal, compared with European and American countries where meat consumption has a larger place in culture and tradition. OECD data shows that in 2014, the three countries with the highest per capita meat consumption were Australia (90.3kg), the United States (90.1kg), and Argentina (86.6kg), while the average consumption in the EU countries is 64.9kg. In light of these figures, China's per capita meat consumption of 49.8kg ranks behind many Western countries.In recent years, some Western media have tended to play up China's meat consumption. TIME's article is nothing new. In 2016, the Washington Post reported on the updated set of dietary guidelines released by the Chinese government, but its focus was on how the new recommendations had the potential to reduce China's meat consumption, or at least slow its growth, which in turn it said would help put a substantial dent in global greenhouse gas emissions. In 2018, the Atlantic published a piece with the headline "China's love for meat is threatening its green movement," while in 2019, an article from the Economist stated that "The planet needs China to curb its appetite for meat."These articles sensationalized beliefs around the ideas that "China's meat consumption is high" and "China could change the world by eating less meat." They maintained that China should take a large portion of responsibility for environmental issues and accused China of being the "biggest environmental destroyer," trying to pass the buck on how their own practices affect the environment.China has always advocated and taken action in trying to solve environmental problems in different ways. For example, China has promoted frugality nationwide and launched campaigns to curb food waste, which effectively reduces energy consumption, including those related to meat. China's total installed capacity for renewable energy currently accounts for 30% of the entire world's volume and the proof of its afforestation efforts and making the country greener are for all to see. In 2019, China's carbon emission intensity dropped by 48.1% compared with 2005 and achieved its 2020 emission reduction targets ahead of schedule. After the United States withdrew from the Paris Agreement, China once again made a new emission reduction commitment. It can be said that China has tangible evidence of its contributions to addressing climate change.Environmental issues should be taken seriously by all humanity, but paying more attention to the issue doesn't mean asking any country to simply "eat less meat." It's better to unite and do one's part, rather than shifting responsibility onto others. Saving the planet is not the responsibility of China alone. To change the world requires the joint efforts of the whole world.China Mosaichttp://www.china.org.cn/video/node_7230027.htmUrge Chinese to eat less meat to 'change the world'?

Against: Blindly trusting mediaThe Troubadour: Franciscan University - SteubenvilleMarch 25, 2021 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2021 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: EDITORIALS; Pg. 1Length: 686 wordsByline: Stanley ColacoBodyStanley ColaçoStaff WriterLuke 11:34 reads, "Your eye is the lamp of your body; when your eye is sound, your whole body is full of light; but when it is not sound, your body is full of darkness. Therefore be careful lest the light in you be darkness."As Catholics, the question is quite simple: what are we seeing and is it the truth?In the documentary "The Brainwashing of My Dad," Jen Senko tries to paint the media, particularly Fox News, as evil. She claims that talk radio made her dad racist, homophobic and bigoted. In this, Senko complains about right wing media for 90 minutes before arriving at her conclusion: conservative media is bad.Donald Trump railed about liberal media throughout his presidency, and for good reason. An independent study from the Pew Research Center showed that Trump had as much as three times the amount of negative media with less than one eighth the amount of positive reports compared to Obama.According to that same study, he had the record for the least amount of balanced or unbiased reports out of the presidents studied.Outside of the news media, the story isn't that different. Obama, and democrats in general, were praised by television, film and sports stars. Trump was threatened with bombings.From a more Catholic perspective, the media doesn't fare any better. In October 2020, a viral clip was spread around that featured Pope Francis discussing "gay marriage." In the clip it appeared that the pope had expressed support for homosexuals to get "married" within the Catholic Church. In reality, the video released had been heavily edited. In fact, the clip had taken clips from all over the interview, some more than half an hour apart, and smashed them together.Internationally, Catholics who stood by the Bible's teaching on the subject were shamed and the media used the clip in order to push their agenda. When the truth came out and the clips were proved to have been doctored, very little was done to fix this. Why?The media is almost never kept in check. Outside of citizen interest groups, there are little to any effective checks imposed on the media.In 2003, Newsweek reported that Army officials at Guantanamo Bay had desecrated Qurans as a form of torture. In the aftermath, Afghanistan and Pakistan were rocked with protests, leading to the deaths of 17 people.In other parts of the Middle East, American embassies and cultural centers were rioted and ransacked. Did Newsweek see any consequences? No, a simple retraction was issued and minor steps were taken to correct its fault.There is a clear bias within the media but in order to understand the actions we should take, we must understand why the bias occurs. In order to understand this, we must understand who runs the media: China.AMC, our nation's largest movie chain, is run by China. In telecommunications, CCTV was renamed to CGTN, or China Global Television Network. Chinese drones supposedly being used to fight forest fires in California were instead rerouting information to Chinese officials. Huawei, a telecommunications equipment company, openly stole American trade secrets and sent them back to the motherland. ABC and CNN have billions of dollars in holdings scattered throughout Shanghai.In private ownership, the truth doesn't fare any better. Every single major news network with private ownership either publicly endorsed or privately gave money to one of the two major players in the last election.The media also gains its funding from politically connected individuals. PBS is paid for by taxpayers, but those who decide on how much the network gets are politicians.Disney changes their films and goes as far as rewriting them in order to please the Chinese government. Why? Because they are funded by the Chinese government. Buzzfeed bends its knees to democrats because they received funding from top DNC officials. Our media is not free because it owes many debts.In summation, it is clear that the media cannot be trusted. It shows clear and consistent bias, doesn't keep American interests or the truth as its priority and is not even free to make independent decisions.Load-Date: March 28, 2021End of Document

In the fall, anonymous users Zoom-bomb virtual panel about Uyghur MuslimsThe Justice: Brandeis UniversityFebruary 9, 2021 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2021 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 1586 wordsByline: Gilda GeistBodyIn November, anonymous users interrupted a virtual panel discussing the oppression of the Uyghurs Muslim minority group in Xinjiang, China. One user played the Chinese national anthem and others used the annotation function of Zoom to write "Bullshit" and "Fake News" across the screen. A joint statement from the event sponsors said that just before the Nov. 13 event they were notified about "threatening emails from members of the Chinese Students and Scholars Association" urging the University to cancel the panel. The emails, according to the sponsors' statement, were sent to the President's Office, the International Students and Scholars Office and the Office of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion.Leon Grinis '22, organizer of the event and recipient of the Maurice J. and Fay B. Karpf and Ari Hahn Peace Award, told the Justice in a Jan. 31 email that he was unable to remove the annotations on the screen, mute the disruptive members or unmute himself because his Zoom account was not linked with his Brandeis account at the time of the event, and the meeting only allowed for one meeting host at a time (the host was the only user who could perform such functions during the event). Because his account was not linked with Brandeis, Grinis explained, Information Technology Services was unable to identify those responsible for the attack, including whether they were Brandeis students."I want to clarify that the majority of attendees were more than respectful and engaged in peaceful and interesting discussions with members of the panel," Grinis wrote. "It was due to an unknown number of individuals who had previously, purposefully colluded and agreed to, on social media platforms such as WeChat, to petition to several university organizations, including President Liebowitz, to hinder, prevent, and sabotage the event's launch and unfolding."The Uyghur people are a Muslim, Turcic-speaking ethnic minority living predominantly in Xinjiang, a historically contested region that became part of the People's Republic of China in 1949. In 1955, it was designated as an autonomous region, a Chinese administrative division created to give more legislative rights to provinces with a relatively high population of ethnic minorities. Since 2017, one million of the 11 million Uyghurs in China have been detained in over 85 camps in Xinjiang, according to an article in PBS NewsHour. Although the Chinese government previously claimed these camps did not exist, they now acknowledge them, calling them "vocational education and training centers" with the purpose of "prevent[ing] the breeding and spread of terrorism and religious extremism," according to a paper published by the State Council Information Office. Testimonies reveal that Uyghurs were interrogated and brutalized while they were detained at these camps, per the PBS NewsHour article. The Chinese government has also passed laws outlawing the veils and long beards that Uyghur people frequently don.According to the Brandeis events calendar, the panel - sponsored by the International Center for Ethics, Justice and Public Life and the Maurice J. and Fay B. Karpf and Ari Hahn Peace Awards - featured experts, professors and Uyghurs and was intended to "bring focus towards improving China's treatments towards its ethnic minorities." One of the panelists was Rayhan Asat, a Uyghur attorney who grew up in China but now lives and practices law in the United States. She spoke to the Justice on Dec. 14 about the panel, which Asat said she did not expect to be disrupted. Before the event, Asat said she was notified of the emails asking the University to cancel the event, at which point she became "uncomfortable."When Asat joined the Zoom meeting at the beginning of the panel, some participants had their profile pictures set as images of prominent Chinese leaders, such as Xi Jinping, the current Chinese president. "I was afraid at that moment," Asat recalled. "I felt just horrible." She said she saw this action as a way of instilling fear and silence. While another panelist was speaking, Asat said, one user played the Chinese national anthem for 20 to 30 seconds. That user was removed from the Zoom meeting.For almost five years now, Asat's brother has been detained in a Uyghur concentration camp in China. Asat began her presentation by talking about him and showing a slideshow of pictures of him. One of the users used the annotation function to write "SOB" across a photograph of her brother, but Asat said she tried not to be distracted by it as she presented. She explained in her presentation and to the Justice that she and her brother had been model citizens in China, but that even that was not enough for him to avoid government detention.Grinis wrote in his email to the Justice that although he and others held sticky notes up to the camera to try to tell Asat how to to remove the annotations, "since she was focused on persevering and presenting, ultimately the insults remained on screen and continued to grow," including the words "Bullshit" and "Fake News" written across more images of her brother."They're just like erasing him as if he's nobody," Asat said. "That moment was just incredibly painful. And I think that's exactly how it happened. ... They just forcibly disappeared him. Like he just vanished."Asat said that despite the strong emotions she was feeling in reaction to the disturbance, she continued her presentation. "I'm an attorney and I'm professional," she said. "I cannot stoop to somebody else's level, but just maintain my integrity and professionalism." Although she managed to remain composed during the panel, Asat told the Justice that for days after the event, she had nightmares.After Asat's presentation, the moderator made an announcement that these disturbances were unacceptable, and then commended Asat for maintaining professionalism throughout the incident.The moderator then moved on to the Q&A section of the event. The first participant that was called on did not have a question, but rather read a prepared statement in response to the panel. Asat said this statement claimed that everything that had been covered during the panel was untrue and used language associated with the Chinese Communist Party. Another participant, before asking his question, said, "Some of the panelists are so emotional today," Asat recalled, a comment which she said she felt was sexist. "I'm talking about my brother being detained and not being able to talk to him for more than four years and not knowing whether he's alive. Like, I mean, I think I should be allowed to be ... emotional," she told the Justice.Although the panel faced numerous disruptions, some expressed their support for Asat during and after the event. She recalled that one student, before asking his question, also apologized for the behavior of other participants. After the event, a number of Brandeis students emailed her apologizing on behalf of the other participants and saying that, aside from the disruption, the event was well done. Asat also received emails from three different students telling her that they had seen Brandeis students planning this Zoom-bombing on WeChat. The students apologized for not having the courage to try to stop the disruption of the panel, Asat said. A staff member from the ODEI also reached out to her after the event, she said.Tensions between the United States and China have continued to escalate in recent months, as both the Trump and Biden administrations have used the term "genocide" to describe the CCP's policies over the Xinjiang region. Both nations have placed sanctions on each others' state officials, per a Jan. 20 Bloomberg article.Asat specified that her remarks during the panel had not been critical of the CCP. "I didn't start off by accusing the Chinese government of anything. I just started off by telling a story about my brother [and] who he is. It's nothing controversial," Asat said. During her presentation, Asat had also talked about her work to improve relations between China and Turkey, efforts that her brother had been proud of. "Had I not believed that [the] Chinese government could be [a] force for good, why would I even engage in those bilateral relationships, helping China's image ... worldwide?" she said.Asat speaks regularly on the topic of Uyghur oppression in China at universities across the country, at conferences and on television, but has never experienced backlash or disruption like she did at the panel in November. "Talking about this experience always makes me feel so uncomfortable and just brings back this very dark memory," she said. "I could be in those camps if I returned [to China]."After the event, the event sponsors wrote a statement - provided to the Justice by Professor Melissa Stimell - affirming Brandeis' commitment to "freedom of expression and civility of discourse as fundamental educational cornerstones." The statement explained that the Maurice J. and Fay B. Karpf and Ari Hahn Peace Award allocates funds for Brandeis student projects that promote peace and coexistence. Grinis received the award funding in fall 2020 to host this panel. "The hope for this panel was to educate the Brandeis community about the situation in Xinjiang from an objective and non-politicized perspective," the statement said. "It is our hope that we can create a space within the University for safe and objective discussion of this and other topics that are often fraught with intense emotions and misunderstandings."Load-Date: February 9, 2021End of Document

SECRETARY ANTONY J. BLINKEN WITH DANA BASH OF CNN'S STATE OF THE UNIONUS Fed NewsMarch 25, 2021 Thursday 9:31 AM  ESTCopyright 2021 HT Media Ltd. All Rights ReservedLength: 2627 wordsBodyWASHINGTON, March 25 -- The U.S. Department of State issued the following press release:QUESTION: Thank you so much, Mr. Secretary, for joining me. I want to start with a speech this week that you gave. You listed China first among the military and non-military threats to the United States. This comes, of course, after you clashed with Chinese officials in Anchorage last week. China is challenging the U.S. on cybersecurity, economics, and with its military, and committing what you've called genocide against the Uyghurs. So do you consider China the United States' biggest adversary?SECRETARY BLINKEN: Dana, I wouldn't simplify it to one label. There are clearly and increasingly adversarial aspects to the relationship. There's certainly competitive ones. There are also still some cooperative ones. But the common denominator is the need to approach China from a position of strength, whether it's adversarial, whether it's competitive, whether it's cooperative. And that's a big part of the reason that I was in Asia last week, in Japan and Korea, and a big part of the reason that I'm here in Europe and at NATO and the EU this week. It's about making sure that as we engage China, one of our biggest sources of strength - our alliances, our partnerships - when we approach the challenges that China poses together, we're going to be much more effective in dealing with them.QUESTION: You said at your confirmation hearing, Mr. Secretary, that you believe the Chinese Government misled the world about coronavirus. Given that and the millions of people, of course, who have died around the world, should China be punished for that?SECRETARY BLINKEN: Dana, I think the issue for us is to make sure that we do everything possible to prevent another pandemic even as we're working through this one, or at the very least to make sure that we can mitigate in much more effective ways any damage done if something happens in the future. And a big part of that is making sure that we have a system in place, including with the World Health Organization, that features transparency, that features information sharing, that features access for international experts at the start of something like this. And that's where I think China, like every other country, has real obligations that it needs to make good on. So I think what we need to be focused on is making sure we're protecting ourselves and protecting the world going forward. And that's going to require a lot of reform, and it's going to require China to do things that it hasn't done in the past.QUESTION: That sounded like a no when it comes to repercussions for what happened in the past and maybe even that's happening currently, which is the damage that is being done around the world because of this pandemic. No repercussions, no punishment?SECRETARY BLINKEN: Look, I think that we've got to - there's a report coming out shortly by the World Health Organization. We've got real concerns about the methodology and the process that went into that report, including the fact that the government in Beijing apparently helped to write it. But let's see what comes out in that report. But we do need to have both accountability for the past - but I think our focus needs to be on building a stronger system for the future.QUESTION: Okay, let's talk about what's going on in Europe right now. The U.S., as you well know, is threatening sanctions over a new natural gas pipeline known as Nord Stream 2. It's between Germany, which is a key NATO ally, and Russia. You made a really - a big show and a point of saying that unity is important with European allies, as you just said just now during the trip that you're on in Europe. This pipeline is already about 90 percent done. So how worried is the Biden administration about the influence that this pipeline could give Russia in the region?SECRETARY BLINKEN: Well, first, just to put this in context, because it's true, we have a difference with Germany over this, but Germany is one of our closest allies and partners anywhere in the world. And one of the things that really came out from the conversations this week is that in so many different areas that are having an impact on the lives of our citizens, we are working closely together. And the fact that we have a difference over this pipeline is not going to change that, but we do have a difference.And President Biden has been very clear for a long time that he thinks the pipeline is a bad deal and a bad idea. It undermines European energy security. In fact, it undermines the very principles that the Europeans have agreed on about the need to diversify energy sources and supply to make sure they're not reliant on any one country, especially not Russia. It is potentially harmful to Ukraine, to Poland, to other countries. It gives Russia more of a weapon using energy as a tool of coercion.So we think it's a bad idea, and it was important for us to be able to tell that directly to our close partners in Germany, and that's what I did. And of course, Congress feels the same way, and we have sanctioned companies based on the law that are participating and trying to build the pipeline, and we've made clear that we'll continue to do that. We just wanted to make sure that there was no ambiguity in our position, that our friends and partners understood us. And it's really unfortunate that the pipeline is in any way a source of division; but despite, again, that difference, it's not taking away from the fact that in virtually every other area we are working more closely together than ever.QUESTION: Is there anything you can do to stop its completion?SECRETARY BLINKEN: Well, ultimately, that's up to those who are trying to build the pipeline and complete it. We just wanted to make sure that our position, our opposition to the pipeline, was well understood.QUESTION: Understood. So I want to ask about Russia. The U.S. and Russia is in an incredibly tense period right now. After President Biden called Vladimir Putin a killer, the Kremlin called back its ambassador. Under Putin, of course, Russia has interfered in American elections, put bounties on U.S. troops, hacked into U.S. computer systems. President Biden has said that Russia will pay a price for those actions. So what will that price be and when will that happen?SECRETARY BLINKEN: Well, you're exactly right. You've - I think you've touched on some of the most important points. And we've seen across the board these different examples of Russia's aggression. There's also what's still going on tragically in eastern Ukraine, to add to the list. And the President has been very clear that there will be consequences for these acts. And we are in the process of completing reviews of the cyber attack through SolarWinds on us, the interference in the election, the use of a chemical weapon to try to murder Alexey Navalny - we've already spoken and acted on that - the bounties on U.S. forces in Afghanistan. And there will be costs and consequences. And I think you're seeing as well - and what I heard here at NATO was a shared concern about Russia's actions across the board and a shared commitment to stand together against them.At the same time, as we're very clear-eyed about that, we also find areas where it's in our mutual interest to try to cooperate. We extended the New START Nuclear Arms Reduction Treaty, one of the first things we did. There are other areas in the realm of so-called strategic stability where we might find ways to work together because it's in our mutual interest. But it really starts with being clear-eyed about the challenge that Russia poses and addressing that challenge together. I can tell you from the NATO meetings there's an absolute commitment to do that.QUESTION: Right. But are you saying that you are not going to act and punish Russia for everything that is done to the United States without NATO or European partners, or are you saying that the U.S. will do it unilaterally if need be? And if so, how quickly? What's the timeline?SECRETARY BLINKEN: I'm saying two things. I'm saying that as the President's been very clear, we will take necessary actions at a time and place of our choosing. But whether it's with regard to Russia, whether it's regard to other countries that that pose a challenge, we are stronger and more effective when we're able to do it in a coordinated fashion. You've seen examples of that just in the past week with coordinated sanctions by the United States, by the - and the European Union, the UK, Canada, when it comes, for example, to China and its human rights abuses in Xinjiang. You'll - you've seen that in the case of Russia, as well. But we will take the steps necessary to defend our interests. And I think, again, what I take away from the meetings this week and all of all the conversations we've had with our allies and partners is there is a real determination to make sure that to the greatest extent possible we work together.QUESTION: Yes. Let's turn to Afghanistan. We are getting closer and closer to the May 1st deadline put in place by the Trump administration to withdraw all remaining 2,500 troops in Afghanistan. So the question is: Considering the fact that President Biden said that it would be tough to meet that deadline, CNN is reporting that he's considering an extension. What specifically does the administration need to see before you decide the time is right to safely withdraw U.S. troops?SECRETARY BLINKEN: Well, as you know, we're reviewing the policy very actively right now. One of the reasons that it was so important to come here this week was to do two things. One was to share our thinking with our allies and partners. There are actually more European forces in Afghanistan right now than there are American, so they're deeply invested in this with us, and they've been shoulder to shoulder with us from the very start. The one and only time NATO's Article 5 - an attack on one is an attack on all - has been invoked was actually in defense of the United States after we were attacked on 9/11. So we have a deep sense of gratitude to our European partners for that.But one of the things that was important was not only to share our thinking as we're going through this review, including the May 1st deadline, but to listen, to hear from our partners who are so invested, their ideas, their thoughts, their analysis. And that's exactly what I did. I listened very carefully. I phoned back to Washington, spoke to the President to relay the views of our allies and partners. And that's going to factor into his thinking and into the decisions he makes.QUESTION: So as a candidate, as you well know, Joe Biden promised to end the forever wars and bring all U.S. combat troops home. Will he keep that promise here?SECRETARY BLINKEN: He will. And we've been very clear and NATO has been very clear that the approach that we're taking to this is we went in together, we've adapted to circumstances together, and we will come out together when the time is right. And what we're focused on now is looking at the May 1st deadline. But beyond that, and as we're doing that, it was also very important to try to accelerate the diplomacy, because ultimately everyone recognizes that there is no military solution to Afghanistan. There has to be some kind of political settlement, and it has to be a settlement reached by the Afghans themselves.So we've put some energy into the diplomatic effort in sharing some ideas with the Afghan Government, with the Taliban in bringing them together, including at a conference that will take place in the weeks ahead in Turkey, having the UN play a more prominent role in bringing people together, and also getting all of the neighbors and other countries that have both an interest and influence in Afghanistan to actually engage and get into this effort. So all of that is happening at the same time, and the - what is ultimately necessary for Afghanistan to have a just and sustainable peace is for the parties to come together and negotiate one.QUESTION: I have to ask about Saudi. The Biden administration did not directly punish Saudi Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman after the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi despite an intelligence report saying that he was directly responsible for approving his murder. And President Biden didn't hesitate to call Vladimir Putin a killer. Do you consider Mohamed bin Salman a killer?SECRETARY BLINKEN: Dana, here's what we did, and it's important. The report that you refer to we put out in the full light of day. It's not a report that was written a couple of weeks ago. It had been sitting around for a little while and we put it out. And that in and of itself is significant, because it's not that there was anything new in the report in terms of what had previously been reported, but the fact that the Government of the United States put its imprimatur on that report and on that information, including responsibility for the murder of Mr. Khashoggi, I think is in and of itself important.Second, we sanctioned a number of direct participants in the murder of Mr. Khashoggi. And maybe as significantly going forward, to make sure that the best of our ability this doesn't happen again, we put in place -QUESTION: And I understand -SECRETARY BLINKEN: - something we call the Khashoggi Ban, which makes sure that anyone who, on behalf of a government, tries to intimidate, silence, or do harm to someone speaking out against that government, whether it's a dissident, a political opponent or a journalist - well, we're going to make sure that that person does not set foot in the United States. And that applies not just to Saudi Arabia; it applies around the world. And so I think we've been clear about that. At the same time -QUESTION: Yeah. And I understand all of that transparency, but -SECRETARY BLINKEN: The transparency is usually important, and beyond the transparency these -QUESTION: I understand all of that transparency, but the fact is that you said - sorry, the delay is a little much. Let me just get in and just say that you have been transparent and you have been very clear about his role, the Saudi crown prince's role. So is he a killer?SECRETARY BLINKEN: Here is - here's the other fact that's very important. We have to - we have to and we do deal every day around the world with leaders of countries who do things that we find either - from objectionable to abhorrent. But in terms of actually advancing our interests and advancing our values, it's important to deal with them. The crown prince is likely to be the leader of Saudi Arabia far into the future. We have a strong interest, for example, in working to end the war in Yemen, probably the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. That's going to take meaningful engagement by the Saudis. And doing so - and we've actually made real progress in that direction in the last couple of months - doing so is going to advance values that we hold dear in terms of protecting the lives of innocent civilians.There are - in terms of advancing human rights and progress in Saudi Arabia itself, are we better off recalibrating the relationship as we did or rupturing it? And I think that in terms of actually making a difference on the things we care about, the recalibration was very necessary. And the President's been clear about that. But rupturing the relationship actually won't help us advance our interests or values.QUESTION: U.S. Secretary of State Tony Blinken, I have so much more to talk to you about. Please come back. I appreciate you giving us the time today.SECRETARY BLINKEN: Thanks for having me.

EXPLAINER: What is Clubhouse, the buzzy new audio chat app?Associated Press Financial WireFebruary 11, 2021 Thursday 12:51 AM GMTCopyright 2021 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; DOMESTIC NEWS; ENTERTAINMENT NEWS; STATE AND REGIONALLength: 960 wordsByline: BARBARA ORTUTAY and MICHAEL LIEDTKE, AP Technology WritersBodyClubhouse, an invitation-only audio chat app launched less than a year ago, has caught the attention of tech industry bigshots like Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg — not to mention the Chinese government, which has already blocked it in the country. What is Clubhouse, you ask?WHAT IS CLUBHOUSE?The iPhone-only app, once you’re in, lets you start or listen into conversations on a whole host of topics, from tech to pro sports, parenting, Black literature and so on. There are no posts, photos or videos — only people’s profile pictures and their voices.Conversations can be intimate, like a phone call, or might include thousands of people listening to a talk by boldface names, like a conference or stage interview. Think part podcast, part conference call, part social media. It's free to use and there are no ads, at least not at this point.HOW DO I GET IN?Currently, the only way to get an invitation is to score one from someone already on Clubhouse. It's still in “beta," version, like Gmail was in its early days, when it was a badge of nerd worthiness to get an account. If you don't know anyone who can invite you yet, you may not have to wait much longer. When Clubhouse first came out, new members only got two invitations. That number has now grown to five, signaling that the app feels ready to broaden its audience. You can also download the app and get on a waiting list to be let into Clubhouse.This is part of the app's current appeal — like an exclusive club, only it's expanding by the minute. The aura has been magnified by the star power of early members such as rap star Drake, actor Jared Leto, actress Tiffany Haddish, and influential technology figures such as venture capitalist Marc Andreessen and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. Although Clubhouse hasn't divulged how many people are using its service, its app has been downloaded 5.3 million times, according to analytics firm App Annie.Once you have an invitation, you can import your Twitter profile — or start from scratch — and then follow people or “clubs" on a broad range of topics. The app encourages people to use their real names, though this does not appear to be enforced. You'll also need an iPhone — Clubhouse doesn't yet work on Android phones and is not on the web.WHO MADE CLUBHOUSE?It was created by Silicon Valley entrepreneur Paul Davison, best known for a location-driven social networking app Highlight that Pinterest bought in 2016, and a former Google engineer, Rohan Seth. Although it obviously wasn’t planned, they probably couldn’t have picked a better time to start welcoming a select few into Clubhouse. The app made its debut last March, just as people were being ordered to stay at home to battle the pandemic and found themselves eager to talk to other people besides their family or roommates.WHY IS IT GETTING MORE ATTENTION NOW?The primary reason is probably that Musk and Zuckerberg recently made surprise appearances on Clubhouse. When two technology icons worth a combined $280 billion choose to use the same app to get their message out within a few days of each other, people tend to sit up and take notice.In his Jan. 31 appearance, Musk began by discussing his mission to get to Mars through its rocket ship company Space X and sharing his views on cryptocurrency, artificial intelligence and the ongoing pandemic. But then he rocked the Clubhouse by summoning Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev to the virtual stage for an interview about the app’s role in transforming GameStop’s stock from a dud into a Wall Street sensation that at least briefly devastated sophisticated investors who had bet the shares would continue to decline.That interview illustrated two points that are important to remember about Clubhouse. Although the app itself says it doesn’t record the discussions occurring within its rooms, that doesn’t mean other participants aren’t. And the posted recordings of discussions like that also prove there are ways for getting around Clubhouse’s 5,000-person limit in its rooms.Zuckerberg’s Feb. 4 appearance on Clubhouse didn’t delve into anything quite as hot as the GameStop frenzy, but his presence still added to the curiosity about the app. In true Facebook fashion, the company is also reportedly working on a copycat, known internally as Fireside.SO IS IT ALL TECH INDUSTRY PEOPLE?While the early users of Clubhouse were largely venture capitalists and startup folks, as the app's user base has expanded so has the diversity of its members. Users can now explore subjects such as “Ask A Coach: Life, Love & The Pursuit of Joy, Money/Health," “Bitcoin Basics for Baby Boomers," “Drag Race Clubhaus," “Investing While Black" and “Plant-Based Basics for Beginners with Dietitian Jasmine."WHAT HAPPENED IN CHINA?Thousands of Chinese users have flocked to the app in recent months, lured by the unfettered discussions it allowed with people abroad — particularly about democracy, Taiwan and other sensitive topics. That was especially striking given that President Xi Jinping’s government is increasingly hostile to independent voices. Clubhouse allowed many mainland users their first direct communication with people in Hong Kong and Taiwan and with exiles from the Uighur minority in the northwestern region of Xinjiang.The app was removed from Apple Inc.’s China store by at least Dec. 16, according to Benjamin Ismail, an activist with the group Apple Censorship which tracks censorship in the Apple Store. Users still could download it if they had access to an Apple app store abroad.But on Monday, Chinese users lost access to Clubhouse, much the way thousands of other websites and social media apps have been blocked by the Chinese Communist Party using the world’s most extensive system of internet filters.Load-Date: February 10, 2021End of Document

Asian neighbors pen letter of fear to Ohio's lieutenant governorPolitico.comMarch 31, 2021 Wednesday 9:52 PM GMTCopyright 2021 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 442 wordsHighlight: Jon Husted used the phrase "Wuhan Virus."BodyCOLUMBUS, Ohio - Dozens of Asian American residents of the suburb that Ohio's Republican lieutenant governor calls home penned a letter to him Wednesday, citing their concerns over a tweet he sent referring to the "Wuhan virus" and the fears they have for the safety of their children because of such comments."Lt. Governor Husted, your choice of words has only raised the anxiety and fear that Asians and Asian Americans in Upper Arlington are currently experiencing," the letter obtained by the local NBC affiliate read.Jon Husted has been Ohio's second highest-ranking official since 2019."Our children have been targeted for bullying and abuse in the district well before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, but that abuse has increased significantly in the last 14 months and has reached levels that have brought news media attention to our doorsteps," the letter continued. "Our children are the classmates, friends, and neighbors of your children."The letter to the lieutenant governor was signed by nearly 70 members and families of the Asian community in Upper Arlington, a suburb of Columbus.It came in response to a March 26 tweet where Husted linked to an article in which Robert Redfield, the ex-director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said, without citing evidence, that he believed the virus originated in a lab in Wuhan."So it appears it was the Wuhan Virus after all?" Husted tweeted Friday from his personal account.His intention with the tweet, Husted said in an interview with The Associated Press earlier on Wednesday, was to criticize the Chinese government."I was just pointing out that this is an international crisis, in my opinion, that the Chinese government is responsible for and I wanted an independent investigation," he said. "So I wasn't trying to accomplish anything that the political left or political right thinks that I might have from that tweet other than to draw attention to the issue."The claim that COVID-19 originated in a lab in Wuhan has been scrutinized in the past year by health officials, including the leading U.S. infectious disease specialist, Dr. Anthony Fauci.The claim was further muddied when a draft obtained by The AP on Monday and formally published Tuesday from the World Health Organization's inquiry said it was "extremely unlikely" that the virus emerged accidentally from a Chinese laboratory and was likely spread from animals to humans.Some replies on the original post supported Husted for standing up to China. More numerous were critical replies from Twitter users who said such rhetoric feeds into hate and violence against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.Load-Date: April 1, 2021End of Document

CSIS Issues Commentary on Banning TikTokTargeted News ServiceFebruary 10, 2021 Wednesday 8:20 AM  ESTCopyright 2021 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 822 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Center for Strategic and International Studies issued the following commentary:* * *Ban TikTok (Again)By James Andrew LewisSenior Vice President and Director, Strategic Technologies ProgramThe Trump administration never really made a compelling case as to why TikTok, the music video app, was a national security risk. TikTok had moved U.S. users' personal information out of China to the United States and Singapore, closing one avenue of risk. TikTok could be compelled by the Chinese government to use its update process to gain access to users' devices and networks (we have all learned the "infected updater" trick after the SolarWinds hack), but that would have been a cumbersome process. Banning TikTok made no sense.That has changed with the announcement that TikTok plans to use its network to provide e-commerce services to U.S. consumers. There are two objections to this update. First, why should TikTok be able to operate in the United States when U.S. e-commerce providers and social networks lack the same privileges in China? The habit of making unilateral concessions to China (which it demanded as a condition for market access) in the past is one reason that we find ourselves in a messy trade dispute with it. The disparity in the treatment of Chinese and U.S. companies is part of a larger Chinese strategy to gain technological and commercial advantage--as when Chinese companies could do business in the United States, but U.S. companies were forced to take a Chinese partner or provide access to technology. This is beginning to slowly change with agreements like the European Union's Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI) with China, although it is too early to tell if Beijing will fully live up to these commitments. Reciprocal treatment should be the cornerstone of policy.Second, e-commerce provides a much greater stream of useful data than amateur music videos. This commercial data can be analyzed and correlated with other data that China has acquired (often illicitly) in ways that could put U.S. consumers at risk. China has made improvements to its privacy laws, but they take second place to its national security laws that require cooperation from Chinese companies when the central government makes a request without any right of appeal or without any transparency. There is no expectation of privacy in China. Intelligence agencies are as hungry for big data as are private companies. Data analytics and artificial intelligence have transformed intelligence collection. Access to data by a Chinese company should not be taken lightly, since it could also lead to access to data by the Chinese government.Washington's action in blocking the acquisition of the U.S. financial service company MoneyGram by China's Ant Financial is a precedent. The acquisition would have given Ant access to U.S. citizens' sensitive personal data and the Chinese government could, if it chose to, also have gained access. The recent unhappy experiences of Ant and Jack Ma show the power of the Chinese state over its companies. While TikTok's personal video service should continue to be allowed, its move into e-commerce deserves more scrutiny.A concession to TikTok on e-commerce without similar concessions by China for U.S. companies would be a mistake. That does not mean TikTok should never be allowed to provide e-commerce service in the United States. It means that a concession on TikTok should be made as part of reciprocal concessions for U.S. e-commerce and social media companies. Second, allowing TikTok to do business should be accompanied by meaningful and verifiable commitments to privacy by the Chinese company that are at least the equivalent of what would be expected from U.S. firms. This is admittedly a low bar, given the weakness of privacy law in the United States, but one that Chinese companies still have difficulty meeting.This ban need not be permanent if China is willing to negotiate. Reciprocity and common understanding on privacy point to TikTok e-commerce access as an agenda item in some larger negotiation on the bilateral relationship. Any negotiation will be caught up in larger debates over trade, technology, and economic espionage. These debates are necessary to reshape the nature of trade with China in ways that protect the United States and its allies.China may not be willing to negotiate. Even if it does, it may prevaricate over reciprocal concessions, but reciprocity in the trade relationship with China is crucial to the bilateral relationship. TikTok's decision to enter e-ecommerce changed the terms of the debate. Before, there was very little reason for concern. Now, absent agreement with China, or significant and verifiable concessions on privacy and the treatment of data by TikTok, any move into e-commerce in the United States should be stopped.[Category: Political][Category: ThinkTank1]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7380711 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: February 10, 2021End of Document

US identifies export barriers in 65 trading partners, including SpainCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 31, 2021 WednesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 729 wordsBodyU.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai published on Wednesday the 2021 National Trade Estimation Report (NTE), which provides a detailed inventory of major foreign barriers to U.S. exports of goods and services, investment, and e-commerce.As Ambassador Tai explained, "the President's Trade Agenda published earlier this month outlined a clear vision to support America's working families by promoting a fair international trading system that drives inclusive economic growth."In this way, he added, "the NTE Report 2021 identifies a number of important challenges and priorities to guide the Biden Administration's effort in developing a trade policy that reflects American values and rebuilds better."Published annually since 1985, the NTE Report is a comprehensive review of significant foreign trade barriers affecting exports of goods and services from the United States.The 570-page document examines 65 trading partners and groups of countries, including america's largest trading partners, the 20 partners with which Washington has free trade agreements and other economies as well as groups of countries of interest such as the Arab League, the United Kingdom (included as an independent entity for the first time in this report) and the European Union.Together, these economies account for 99% of trade in goods and 87% of US services trade.The NTE Report covers important trade barriers in 11 areas, including (1) import policies such as tariffs, import licences and customs barriers; (2) technical barriers to trade; (3) sanitary and phytosanitary measures; (4) subsidies; (5) government procurement; (6) intellectual property protection; (7) barriers to services; (8) barriers to digital commerce and e-commerce; (9) barriers to investment; (10) competition; and (11) other barriers.Overall, the NTE Report highlights significant obstacles that present significant political challenges with implications for America's future growth opportunities, and the fairness of the global economy. Examples of these significant obstacles areBarriers to agricultural trade: The NTE Report details a number of tariff and non-tariff barriers to US agricultural exports in all trading partners and regions, ranging from non-science-based regulatory measures, opaque approval processes for agricultural biotechnology products, onerous import licensing and certification requirements , as well as restrictions on the ability of US producers to use the common names of the products they produce and export.Digital commerce: The NTE Report 2021 details restrictive data policies in India, China, Korea, Vietnam and Turkey, among other countries; local software pre-installation requirements in Russia, Indonesian tariffs on digital products, and existing or proposed local content requirements for online streaming services in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the EU, Mexico, Ukraine and Vietnam; discriminatory tax measures in Austria, India, Italy, Spain, Turkey and the United Kingdom in reference to the "Google rate".Overcaly capacity: China's state-led approach to economy and trade makes it the world's leading infringer in non-economic capacity building, as evidenced by severe and persistent overcastability in various industries, including steel, aluminum, and solar power, among others.China is also on track to create severe overcaly capacity in other industries through its search for industrial plans such as Made in China 2025, under which the Chinese government is handing out hundreds of billions of dollars to support Chinese companies and require them to achieve preset targets for domestic market share - at the expense of imports - and global market share in several advanced manufacturing industries.Technical Barriers to Trade: Technical regulations or conformity assessment procedures that unnecessarily restrict trade or curb the circulation of innovative products risk losing opportunities to leverage US leadership in high-tech science and manufacturing, services, and agriculture.The many examples of this challenge set out in the NTE Report range from the European Union's unre transparent chemical regulations to the cybersecurity and encryption standards of Chinese information technologies, to the standards for testing and certification of telecommunications equipment in India and Brazil.commentsforum0WhatsApp  Facebook  Twitter  Linkedin       Load-Date: April 1, 2021End of Document

An attack on Microsoft attributed to China becomes a global crisisCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 8, 2021 MondayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 759 wordsBodyA sophisticated attack on Microsoft Corp. is transforming into a global cybersecurity crisisas hackers rush to infect as many victims as possible before companies can protect their computer systems. The attack, which Microsoft said began with a Chinese government-backed piracy group,has so far claimed at least 60,000 known victims worldwide, according to a former senior U.S. official with knowledge of the investigation. Many of them appear to be small or medium-sized enterprises trapped in a large network that attackers launched while Microsoft was working to solve the attack.The European Banking Authority became one of the most recent victims,while said Sunday that access to personal data through emails stored on Microsoft's server may have been compromised. Other victims identified so far include banks and electricity suppliers, as well asnursing homes and an ice cream company, according to Huntress, a firm based in Ellicott City, Maryland, which oversees customer safety. A U.S. cybersecurity company that asked not to be identified said its experts were working with at least 50 victims, trying to quickly determine what data the hackers might have extracted while trying to expel them.The rapidly intensified attack came months after the attack on SolarWinds Corp. by suspected Russian cyberattacks, and caught the attention of U.S. national security officials, in part, because the latest hackers were able to affect so many victims so quickly. Investigators say that, in the final stages of the attack, perpetrators appeared to have automated the process, encompassing tens of thousands of new victims around the world in a matter of days.Washington is preparing to take its first major action in retaliation against foreign intrusions over the next three weeks, the New York Times reported, citing unidentified officials. It plans a series of clandestine actions in Russian networks, aimed at sending a message to Vladimir Putin and his intelligence services, combined with economic sanctions.The president, Joe Biden,could issue an executive order to prop up federal anti-Russian piracy agencies,the paper reported. "We are undertaking a full government response to assess and address the impact," a White House official wrote in an email Saturday. "This is an active threat that is still developing and we urge network operators to take it very seriously."The Chinese hacking group, which Microsoft calls Hafnio, appears to have been dabbling in private and government computer networks through the company's popular Exchange email software for several months, initially attacking only a small number of victims, according to Steven Adair, head of Volexity, a Virginia-based company.The result is a second cybersecurity crisis that will occur just a few months after suspected Russian hackers violated nine federal agencies and at least 100 companies through manipulated updates from IT management software manufacturer SolarWinds LLC. Cybersecurity experts defending the world's computer systems expressed a growing sense of frustration and exhaustion.Both the incidentrecent as the attack on SolarWinds show the fragility of modern networks and the sophistication of state-sponsored hackers to identify vulnerabilities difficult to find or even create them for espionage.In the case of Microsoft viruses, simply applying company-provided updates will not remove attackers from a network. A review of affected systems isrequired," said Charles Carmakal, senior vice president of the cybersecurity company FireEye Inc. And the White House emphasized the same thing, including Tweets from the National Security Council that urge the growing list of victims to carefully check their computers for signals from the attackers. Initially, Chinese hackers seemed to target high-value intelligence targets in the U.S., Adair said. About a week ago, everything changed. Other unidentified hacking groups began attacking thousands of victims in a short period of time, inserting hidden software that could give them access later, he said.Data from other security companies suggest that the scope of the attacks might not be so bad. Huntress researchers examined about 3,000 vulnerable servers in their partners' networks and found about 350 infections, or just over 10%.Microsoft said customers using its cloud-based email system are not affected. The use of automation to launch very sophisticated attacks can mark a terrifying new era in cybersecurity, one that could exceed the limited resources of protection systems, several experts said.Load-Date: March 9, 2021End of Document| About LexisNexis | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions | Copyright © 2021 LexisNexis Page 26 of 273Chinese search alternative voices under strong censorship  Page 29 of 273Amid pandemic chaos, China offers its version of freedom  Page 31 of 273The secret night flights between China and Burma: weapons, soldiers or shellfish?  Page 33 of 273Human Rights Watch: China - Olympic Committee Fails to Honor Rights Pledge  Page 45 of 273Biden's day one executive actions orders include rejoining World Health Organization and ending Muslim travel ban; U.S. tops 400k COVID-19 deaths; New trial sho....  Page 47 of 273Good teachers + technology make a difference in rural China  Page  of Chinese military bans Tesla cars for camera concern  Page 50 of 273Faculty Slam Proposed Partnership With Chinese University Over Human Rights, Academic Freedom Violations  Page  of RUBIO CONDEMNS CCP'S EDUCATIONAL REFORMS IN HONG KONG, URGES BIDEN TO STAND UP TO BEIJING  Page 53 of 273What if China could turn off the lights in your house?  Page 57 of 273WILSON CHINA FELLOWSHIP CONFERENCE 2021  Page 59 of 273China detains six people for 'insulting' soldiers killed in India border clash  Page 62 of 273Elon Musk's love-in with China may be over as regulators go after Tesla  Page 64 of 273WeChat, a Chinese star app that combines WhatsApp and Facebook  Page 66 of 273Venezuela received a donation of half a million coronavirus vaccines from China  Page 68 of 273Biden suspends sale of TikTok and allows it to remain in Chinese hands  Page 70 of 273H&M continues with first quarter losses and comes out to restore confidence with China after boycott on social media  Page 73 of 273As part of their trade war, China and the U.S. press for "rare earths"  Page 76 of 273I'M A TRUMP REPUBLICAN.
