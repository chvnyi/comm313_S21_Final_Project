China, looking post-virus, to push tech autonomy at CongressAssociated Press InternationalMarch 3, 2021 Wednesday 1:37 AM GMTCopyright 2021 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 944 wordsByline: JOE McDONALD, AP Business WriterDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) — Chinese leaders are shifting focus from the coronavirus back to long-term goals of making China a technology leader at this year's highest-profile political event, the meeting of its ceremonial legislature, amid tension with Washington and Europe over trade, Hong Kong and human rights.The National People's Congress, which opens Friday, has no real power. But the ruling Communist Party uses the gathering of 3,000-plus delegates to showcase economic and social plans. The party-appointed delegates, who don't represent the public, endorse decisions already made by party leaders.The NPC usually focuses on domestic issues but those increasingly are overshadowed by geopolitics, including a feud with Washington over technology and security. In October, party leaders declared that making China a self-reliant “technology power” is this year's economic priority.Chinese leaders were rattled after Washington cut off access to U.S. processor chips and other inputs needed by telecom equipment giant Huawei and some other companies. That threatens fledgling industries seen by Beijing as a path to prosperity and global influence.“China is moving from fighting the coronavirus to returning to long-term development objectives,” said Citigroup economist Li-Gang Liu.During the congress, leaders will announce closely watched spending plans for the People’s Liberation Army. Last year’s official budget was $178.6 billion, the second-largest after the United States, but outside experts say total spending is up to 40% more than the reported figure.This year's session comes amid repeated clashes between President Xi Jinping's government and Washington, Europe, Japan, India, Australia and others over trade, technology, Hong Kong, human rights, the coronavirus and territorial claims.Xi's government also is encouraging Chinese exporters to focus more on domestic markets in response to Washington's tariff hikes on goods from China.The congress, to be held mostly by video link to keep Chinese leaders, delegates and reporters separated as an anti-virus measure, provides a platform for announcing initiatives aimed at tightening control over Hong Kong.Last year’s session endorsed a national security law for the semi-autonomous territory in response to pro-democracy and anti-government protests. A senior official has called for changes to its tightly controlled electoral system to make sure Hong Kong is led by what Beijing calls patriots.Legislators are due to endorse the party’s latest five-year development blueprint, which takes effect this year.The ruling party has spent heavily over the past two decades to build up China’s fledgling suppliers of semiconductor, solar, aerospace and other technology. But its smartphone manufacturers and other industries still need U.S., European, Japanese and Korean processor chips and other advanced components.That campaign took on added urgency after then-President Donald Trump slapped sanctions on Huawei Technologies Ltd. and some other companies starting in 2018.China is evolving from lower-value manufacturing to "technology intensiveness," said Zuo Xiaolei, an economist in Beijing. She said that, coupled with stronger consumer spending, could help foreign economies by boosting imports.On Monday, the industry minister, Xiao Yaqing, called for efforts to “effectively safeguard China’s economic security” in the face of “fierce international competition.”China needs to develop an “independent and controllable” supply chain, Xiao said, a reference to official pressure on manufacturers to use more domestically produced components and technology, even if they cost more.Xiao cited integrated circuits, next-generation telecoms and electric cars as priorities, according to the Shanghai news outlet The Paper.China needs to “speed up development of the digital economy,” Xiao said at a news conference.The party also is expected to present more details of plans to meet targets for having China’s carbon emissions peak by 2030 and achieve neutrality by 2060. The party has promised repeatedly to develop a clean, energy-efficient “green economy."China has been the world’s biggest carbon emitter since 2005, making whatever it chooses to do critical to reining in global warming. China still gets almost 60% of its power from coal.“This is the area that poses a great challenge,” said Citigroup’s Liu. The 2030 target means “this very high dependence on coal will have to decline drastically.”On Friday, investors will watch whether Premier Li Keqiang, the top economic official, announces an annual growth target. The target officially is just a budget tool, but leaders have sought to reassure consumers and entrepreneurs by promising to meet it.Last year, the party declared it had met its goal of doubling economic output from 2010 levels, which required annual growth of about 7%. Xi says the next target is to double output again by 2035, a longer period that would allow growth closer to 5%, still among the highest for any major country.Li skipped announcing a target last year due to the pandemic. The premier and other leaders say consumer spending and other indicators are more important, but analysts say they might feel pressure to show the economy is back on track by setting a formal target.After last year's multi-decade-low 2.3% growth, forecasters say it would be easy to hit 7% as manufacturing and spending rebound."Growth will not be what the government is most concerned about," said He Fan, an economist at Shanghai Jiaotong University. After last year's crisis, he said, leaders now “care about effectiveness and safety.”___AP researcher Yu Bing in Beijing contributed.Load-Date: March 3, 2021End of Document

ZK International's Subsidiary, xSigma, Published its Roadmap and Announced Ethereum Layer 2 Plans As its DeFi Project Maintains $110 Million of Locked ValuePR NewswireMarch 10, 2021 Wednesday 8:30 AM ESTCopyright 2021 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1536 wordsDateline: WENZHOU, China, March 10, 2021 BodyPR Newswire  ZK International Group Co., Ltd. (Nasdaq: ZKIN) ("ZKIN", "ZK International" or the "Company"), is pleased to announce that after one week since the launch of xSigma DEX, xSigma Corporation, a subsidiary of the Company and a blockchain R&D lab, is pleased to reveal its roadmap for the coming months. As of the time of this press release, the xSigma DeFi Protocol has $110 Million in Locked Value, our stablecoin DEX has surpassed $6 Million of trading volume. Currently there are over $40 billion worth of total funds locked in the major DeFi protocols, according to defipulse.com.As our DeFi protocol continues to grow, and the price of Bitcoin trades above $54,000, we have outlined the roadmap for the future development of the xSigma DEX post-launch as follows:1. MarketingAny project will falter without new users learning about it and onboarding. Therefore, we will focus initially on engaging with as many users as possible within xSigma's target market framework outlined in its WhitePaper. We will conduct various marketing activities and promotions, including presenting at online conferences, reaching out to well-known influencers for feedback, presenting on various podcasts, and partnering with prominent players in the DeFi field.2. Technical ImprovementsWith any new project there are growing pains, of which there are still some improvements left to be done by our top management team.More specifically, our plan includes:Deploying a second stablecoin pool, by April 2021 Adding a SIG-lock pool to the Rewards smart-contract — you will be able to stake SIG to earn additional rewards, by March 2021 Launching the gas cashback program, by April 20213. Fulfilling promises by March 2021As a means of establishing a long-term trust within the xSigma community, we will burn the extra unminted tokens from the Rewards fund to date. We will also burn the same amounts proportionally from the Dev Fund and Growth Fund (30% and 10% accordingly).4. DAO Upgrade by April 2021We will roll out a two-stage plan to fully decentralize xSigma. After we finish some preparation on keeping pools running and steady, we will transfer full control of them to the community.First, we will set up an off-chain DAO where SIG holders will be able to vote proportionally to their stake, but without the need to pay gas fees. We will execute their decisions on-chain from the Dev Team multisig.Second, we will deploy the full-scale DAO, which means every small change should be proposed and voted for via on-chain transactions. This step requires good coordination and the ability of the community to govern itself. We will make sure xSigma is mature enough before committing full responsibility to the DAO.5. Build an exchange user baseLastly, xSigma hopes to work together with the SIG holders in the future, as with the support of the xSigma community lies the bright but a long road of transforming xSigma into a vibrant stablecoin exchange.The xSigma team will conduct research into viable growth opportunities, but the actual development will only happen with SIG holders voting to commit developer resources.Governed by your decisions, xSigma Lab will consider different options. Some examples may include:Add new coins to the exchange Upgrade our farming formulas Add new farming pools Research Layer2 solutions Integrate with most of the aggregators and market data platforms Upgrade UI to work flawlessly on mobile Redesign exchange UI to incorporate user feedback Add more wallet options to access xSigma Port to different blockchains Explore stablecoin-related projectsMr. Jiancong Huang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of ZK International, stated, "A genuine thank you to the xSigma community for all the trust they have placed in us. Together with you, we're building the future of a decentralized exchange."About ZK International Group Co., Ltd.ZK International Group Co., Ltd. is a China-based designer, engineer, manufacturer and supplier of patented high-performance stainless steel and carbon steel pipe products that require sophisticated water or gas pipeline systems.

Nanfu Wang documentary shows origin of Covid-19CE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 31, 2021 SundayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 531 wordsBodyOn January 1, 2020, as Wuhan residents celebrated the New Year, Dr. Liu was searching at 3 a.m. for a hospital to care for him for respiratory discomfort. Days earlier, this doctor and private clinic owner in that Chinese city had treated several patients with the same symptoms: fever, cough and chest pain.On the afternoon of the start of the year, news reports from the Asian country reported that eight people had been arrested for spreading social media rumors about unknown pneumonia. They were the beginnings of the Covid-19 pandemic that has caused the deaths of 2.2 million people worldwide. ?? Stay informed on our Google News channelThus begins In the same breath, a documentary by Nanfu Wang that had its premiere at the Sundance Festival. A feature film focused on the origin of the disease in Wuhan and exposing the stories of the population that spread the consequences of the virus through social media despite the silence of the government.The documentary gathers testimonies of those who have lost loved ones to the coronavirus; doctors and nurses who chronicle their experience and the traumas that are experienced inside a hospital, as well as the propaganda the Communist Party used not to cause uproar among the population. Made in less than a year, In the same breath was filmed entirely remotely. Nanfu Wang was confined to the United States during the development of the pandemic, so to record what was happening in China she found 10 cameramen who filmed anonymously, as the U.S. authorities banned any kind of photographic or video registration. "Many of the collaborators, cameramen or researchers who participated did all the work for themselves: they filmed, edited and produced. They all did it individually. And it was very efficient because everyone is very talented and made this possible," she said in a Q&A; session after the premiere at the meeting that takes place virtually because of the pandemic. The genesis of this documentary came precisely in Sundance, as Nanfu Wang was sworn in in January in the 2020 edition of the festival, just as the disease took hold in China. "The first day I mentioned the idea of doing something was January 21 and then it all exploded. Every Chinese citizen will agree with me that the first few days of confinement we read information all the time. And since I couldn't go back to China, I had the idea of making a movie based on stories that were on social media that seemed emotional to me, but then it became a documentary," he narrated.Much of the production that worked on this documentary appears in the credits as "Anonymous", due to the regulation of information that exists in China. The documentary even exposes the disappearance of some journalists and activists who have followed the stories about the coronavirus and questioned the Chinese government's performance."There is always a risk and concern. I think everyone in front of or behind the camera, the production team and our researchers are taking some risk in telling these stories and are willing to face it."In the same breath was acquired by HBO for distribution in the United States and its tentative release date will be in early summer 2021.Load-Date: February 1, 2021End of Document

The United States blacklisted Xiaomi after the Chinese regime awarded an award to its founderCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 5, 2021 FridayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 389 wordsBodyThe U.S. Department of Defense revealed this Friday that Chinese smartphone giant Xiaomi Corp was blacklisted as a company with military ties in part because of an award given to the company's founder for his service to the Chinese state.Lei Jun, founder and CEO of Xiaomi, received the "Outstanding Builder of Socialism with Chinese Features" award from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.As The Wall Street Journal explained, this award - coupled with Xiaomi's ambitious investment plans in advanced technologies such as 5G and artificial intelligence - was enough for the Department of Defense to add Xiaomi to a list of companies supporting the Chinese army in January.This designation, imposed in January 2021, prohibits Americans from investing in the company, the world's third-largest smartphone seller.The company has previously denied any relationship with the Chinese Army and claims that it sells products and services solely for civilian and commercial use.Xiaomi was added to the Department of Defense's list during the final days of the Trump administration along with eight other Chinese companies. In total, 44 companies were added to the list, including Huawei Technologies Corp. and computer chip manufacturer Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. (SMIC), which have also denied any military ties.The Lei Jun award was awarded by China's MIIT, the government agency that oversees Chinese technology and industrial policy and which, according to the US Department of Defense, helps manage China's civil-military fusion policy, in which Beijing relies on private enterprise to help develop military technology.The award is awarded once every five years to the best entrepreneurs in the private sector. The last prize, in 2019, was awarded to 100 people. Other notable CEOs who were also recognized are Ding Lei of video game company NetEase Inc, Wang Gaofei, social media company Weibo Corp. and Wang Chuanfu, from car manufacturer BYD Co.According to the Hurun Global Rich List 2021 rankings, last year Lei Jun doubled his fortune to $31.51 billion, entering the top 50 of the world's richest people.READ ON:The end of democracy in Hong Kong: Chinese regime will control candidates in legislative electionsWHO envoys to Wuhan will not publish their preliminary report on the origin of COVID-19Load-Date: March 6, 2021End of Document

Jack Ma reappeared and Alibaba's actions soaredCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 20, 2021 WednesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 298 wordsBodyJack Ma, the founding Chinese billionaire of the Alibaba trading platform, reappeared in public after nearly three months. In October last year, Ma criticized the Chinese government and then left the public scene. Nothing was known about him until now. The entrepreneur's reappearance led to a sharp up in his company's shares.Chinese financial media broadcast a video on Wednesday showing Ma giving a congratulatory speech to rural teachers as part of her foundation's awards ceremony. Following the release of the video, Alibaba's shares closed with an 8.52 percent hike on the Hong Kong stock exchange.By October 2020, the founder of the Internet giant had publicly criticized financial regulatory authorities. This gesture earned him a call from the government that thwarted the Alibaba stock market that could have raised Ma's fortune above $70 million.In late December, China's State Administration for Market Regulation announced that the company would be investigated for "suspicious monopoly practices." In addition, government actors stressed that it is worrying that technology groups are entering online lending.In his reappearance, Ma praised the management of Chinese President Xi Jinping and assured that he is "more determined than ever to help education and the public good.""China (...) has entered a new phase of development and progresses towards common prosperity," Ma said, as published by the Tianmu News information portal.The Jack Ma Foundation, aimed at aiding education, confirmed that its founder, a former English teacher, participated in the online event with teachers working in rural areas.At age 56, Ma officially retired from her group after her retirement in 2019. But it retains an undeniable influence on Alibaba and Ant Group through its stock portfolio.Load-Date: January 21, 2021End of Document

SOS Installs Second Batch of 5,000 Cryptocurrency Miners and Gives First Quarter Mining ProjectionsPR NewswireMarch 15, 2021 Monday 9:00 AM ESTCopyright 2021 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1344 wordsDateline: QINGDAO, China, March 15, 2021 BodyPR NewswireSOS Limited (NYSE: SOS) (the "Company" or "SOS") announced today that it has successfully installed its second fleet of 5,000 cryptocurrency mining rigs. Together with its prior fleet of 5,000 mining rigs, the Company expects the combined fleet to have the capacity to calculate an average of 353 Peta-Hashes per second (PH/s) for mining Bitcoin and 707 Giga-Hashes per second (GH/s) for mining Ether (ETH). These hash rates are subject to numerous factors, including down time for maintenance, reconfiguration and other variable factors that may materially impact computing performance in the future.The Company also announced that on February 24, 2021, it was awarded its first Bitcoin from successful mining activities. SOS Chairman Yandai Wang commented, "This is a significant milestone for our Company. To memorialize this event, SOS is creating a commemorative gold coin that will serve as a tangible representation of our first mined Bitcoin. We anticipate that this will be the first of many future mining successes, as we continue to execute our cryptocurrency mining strategy."The Company's board of directors also commissioned an independent review of the Company's cryptocurrency mining activities. As part of the review, payments from multiple mining pools were traced to SOS through the public Bitcoin and ETH blockchain ledgers. The review also validated SOS's control over certain electronic wallets and that the rate of Bitcoin and ETH payouts received in those wallets was generally consistent with the expected productivity of the Company's deployed fleet based on its hash rate capacity.The Company expects to generate at least 41 Bitcoins and 909 ETH in the first quarter of 2021, based on various assumptions relating to down time for its fleet, worldwide hash power and other operating conditions. SOS Chief Financial Officer Steven Li elaborated, "These expected mining results reflect only a partial quarter of operations, since our current fleet of mining rigs was only recently installed during the first quarter. Our output should grow in future quarters as we receive and install our third batch of mining rigs and have a full quarter of operations for our current rigs."These mining results do not include any financial results for the Company and do not address the Company's other, non-mining operations, such as the Company's marketing data, technology and solutions for emergency rescue services. United States generally accepted accounting principles for cryptocurrency mining are complex, emerging and uncertain. Cryptocurrencies may not be recognized as cash or cash equivalents, and mining activities may not qualify for revenue recognition. Cryptocurrencies have no inherent value, are not legal tender recognized by any governmental entity, and might not be able to be converted into fiat currencies. Investors are advised not to place undue reliance on mining results alone, without considering other financial and non-financial metrics.About SOS LimitedSOS is a high-technology company providing a wide range of services to its corporate and individual members, including marketing data, technology and solutions for emergency rescue services. Recently, SOS began rolling out its cryptocurrency mining business and plans to develop insurance and security management solutions for digital assets and cryptocurrencies. SOS transforms digital technology into data-driven operations through research and development of big data, cloud computing, Internet of Things, blockchain and artificial intelligence. The Company created an SOS cloud emergency rescue software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform with three major product categories: basic cloud (medical rescue card, car rescue card, financial rescue card, mutual assistance rescue card), cooperative cloud (information rescue center, intelligent big data, intelligent software and hardware), and information cloud (News Today, E-Commerce Today).

(the "Company" or "Besi") (Euronext Amsterdam: BESI; OTC markets: BESIY, Nasdaq International Designation), a leading manufacturer of assembly equipment for the semiconductor industry, today announced its results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2020.Key Highlights Q4-20• Revenue of ‚¬ 109.7 million, up 1.3% versus Q3-20 and above guidance. Up 18.7% versus Q4-19 primarily due to higher shipments for mobile applications to Asian subcontractors• Orders up 65.8% versus Q3-20 and 56.5% versus Q4-19 due to broad based demand increase across Besi's end-user markets, particularly mobile and automotive applications• Gross margin of 58.3% declined 2.5 points versus Q3-20 due primarily to adverse forex influences. Up 2.0 points versus Q4-19 primarily due to a more favorable product mix and increased labor efficiencies• Net income grew to ‚¬ 44.6 million, an increase of ‚¬ 10.6 million versus Q3-20 and ‚¬ 10.9 million versus Q4-19. Similarly, Besi's net margin rose to 40.7% versus 31.3% in Q3-20 and 36.5% in Q4-19• Excluding tax benefits recognized in each of Q4-20 and Q4-19, net income declined by ‚¬ 0.6 million, or 1.8%, versus Q3-20 but increased by ‚¬ 11.3 million, or 51.1%, versus Q4-19. Net margin decreased slightly to 30.4% in Q4-20 versus 31.3% in Q3-20 but increased by 6.5 points versus Q4-19• Net cash increased to ‚¬ 198.7 million, up ‚¬ 40.0 million (+25.2%) versus September 30, 2020Key Highlights FY 2020• Revenue of ‚¬ 433.6 million increased by ‚¬ 77.4 million, or 21.7%, primarily as a result of improved industry conditions, higher shipments for mobile applications due to new 5G product cycle and increased investment by Chinese customers• Orders of ‚¬ 472.1 million grew ‚¬ 123.4 million (+35.4%)• Gross margin reached 59.6%, up 3.8 points versus 2019 primarily due to Besi's strong advanced packaging market position, a more favorable product mix and increased labor efficiencies• Net income of ‚¬ 132.3 million grew ‚¬ 51.0 million (+62.7%).

Excluding such benefits, net income was ‚¬ 33.4 million and ‚¬ 22.1 million in Q4-20 and Q4-19, respectively.Richard W. Blickman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Besi, commented:"In 2020, Besi's results rebounded strongly with revenue increasing by 21.7% to reach ‚¬ 433.6 million and net income rising by 62.7% to reach ‚¬ 132.3 million. In addition, orders of ‚¬ 472.1 million increased by 35.4% versus last year as an industry recovery took hold in the fourth quarter of 2019 and accelerated in the second half of 2020. Besi's results were even more impressive considering the multiple headwinds faced and organizational challenges posed by the global COVID-19 pandemic, increased trade tensions between the US and China, decreased shipments to automotive end-user markets and an approximate 8% decrease in the value of the US dollar versus the euro in the second half of the year.Besi's revenue and order growth this year benefited from improved industry conditions, increased shipments for mobile applications due to a new 5G smart phone product cycle and increased investment by Chinese customers. Profit growth was aided by higher revenue levels and a gross margin expansion of 3.8 points associated with Besi's strong advanced packaging market position and more favorable product mix. It was also aided by relatively stable fixed production headcount levels which helped drive labor efficiencies. Year over year operating expenses grew by only 1.7% versus 2019 despite strong top line growth due to continued structural cost reduction initiatives and reduced corporate travel and overhead associated with the pandemic and the shift to the work at home economy. As a result, net margins rose from 22.8% in 2019 to 30.5% in 2020.Q4-20 results exceeded expectations with revenue and net income reaching ‚¬ 109.7 million and ‚¬ 44.6 million, respectively, increases of 18.7% and 32.3% versus Q4-19. Revenue exceeded guidance as the industry upturn gained momentum and demand growth broadened across Besi's end-user markets. Of note, Q4-20 orders grew by 65.8% sequentially to reach ‚¬ 157.3 million, a record level for a quarter which is typically our weakest of the year. Bookings growth was fueled primarily by strong demand for high-end and mid-range smart phones by Asian subcontractors, a resurgence of demand from European automotive IDMs and incremental capacity purchases for cloud infrastructure applications. Net income growth of ‚¬ 10.9 million versus Q4-19 primarily reflected higher gross margins as a result of increased labor efficiencies as well as a 7.5% reduction in operating expenses, both of which more than offset unfavorable headwinds from a weaker dollar versus the euro. As a result, net margins grew to 30.4% versus 23.9% in Q4-19 excluding favorable deferred tax benefits recognized in each respective period.We ended the year with a solid liquidity base consisting of cash, cash equivalents and deposits aggregating ‚¬ 598.7 million, or ‚¬ 8.22 per basic share. Further, Besi's net cash of ‚¬ 198.7 million increased by ‚¬ 68.4 million, or 52.5%, versus year end 2019. Given profits earned in 2020, continued strong cash flow generation and our solid financial position, we propose to pay a cash dividend of ‚¬ 1.70 per share for approval at Besi's 2021 AGM. The proposed distribution is the eleventh consecutive annual dividend paid and reflects a pay-out ratio relative to net income of 94%.Looking ahead, we estimate that Q1-21 revenue will increase by 30-40% versus Q4-20 with gross margin ranging between 58% and 60%. Baseline operating expenses are anticipated to increase by 15-20% versus the ‚¬ 23.3 million realized in Q4-20 primarily due to higher variable sales-related expenses and product development activity. Total operating expenses are expected to increase by approximately 50-55% versus Q4-20 primarily due to approximately ‚¬ 10 million of non-cash, share based compensation expense.We maintain a favorable outlook as we enter 2021. Our positive stance is reinforced by our Q4-20 results and by the expanded capex budgets of our principal customers. In addition, orders received to date in Q1-21 exceed total bookings for all of Q4-20. This represents another sign of the current strength in customer demand. The principal question is the slope of the industry trajectory this year given the spread of new COVID-19 variants and the emergence of component shortages and transportation constraints within global supply chains.Longer term, we are optimistic about Besi's prospects given our strong performance during the last industry downturn and the current pandemic and favorable secular growth drivers. Anticipated growth will be driven primarily by 5G network expansion and feature/functionality upgrades, continued investment in cloud computing infrastructure and artificial intelligence applications, advances in electric vehicle production and autonomous driving and significant investment by the Chinese government to build out its semiconductor production capacity. In addition, we see IDMs more actively engaged in the deployment of next generation processes than the last investment cycle. In this regard, we have seen increased focus by memory manufacturers on high-speed, high-accuracy flip chip production versus traditional wire bonding solutions and more engagement on the topic of hybrid bonding for the development of next generation applications. Our hybrid bonding joint development agreement with Applied Materials holds significant promise to expand our addressable market and increase our share of wallet at Besi's leading IDM customers."Fourth Quarter Results of Operations‚¬ millionsQ4-2020Q3-2020ÎQ4-2019ÎRevenue109.7108.3+1.3%92.4+18.7%Orders157.394.9+65.8%100.5+56.5%Book to Bill Ratio1.40.9+0.51.1+0.3Besi's Q4-20 revenue increased by 1.3% versus Q3-20 and was higher than prior guidance (flat to down 15%) as the industry upturn accelerated during the quarter with particular growth in customer demand for mobile and cloud infrastructure applications. Versus Q4-19, revenue increased by 18.7% primarily due to higher shipments for mobile applications to Asian subcontractors.Orders of ‚¬ 157.3 million rose 65.8% versus Q3-20 and 56.5% versus Q4-19 due to broad based bookings increase across Besi's primary end-user markets, particularly mobile and automotive applications. Per customer type, IDM orders increased ‚¬ 33.9 million, or 77.6%, versus Q3-20 and represented 49% of total orders. Subcontractor orders increased by ‚¬ 28.5 million, or 55.7%, versus Q3-20 and represented 51% of total orders.‚¬ millionsQ4-2020Q3-2020ÎQ4-2019ÎGross Margin58.3%60.8%-2.556.3%+2.0Operating Expenses23.323.9-2.5%25.2-7.5%Financial Expense, net3.83.2+18.8%3.3+15.2%EBITDA45.546.5-2.2%31.9+42.6%Besi's gross margin of 58.3% in Q4-20 decreased by 2.5 points versus Q3-20 primarily due to adverse forex influences resulting from a sharp decline of the USD versus EUR and, to a lesser extent, to a less favorable product mix. Versus Q4-19, gross margin increased by 2.0 points primarily due to Besi's strong advanced packaging position, more favorable product mix and increased labor efficiencies associated with lower fixed Asian production headcount.Q4-20 operating expenses declined by ‚¬ 0.6 million (-2.5%) versus Q3-20 and ‚¬ 1.9 million (-7.5%) versus Q4-19. The year over year decrease was primarily due to a (i) ‚¬ 1.7 million reduction of travel and overhead costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic and (ii) ‚¬ 1.1 million decrease in R&D expenses, primarily related to increased R&D capitalization associated with new product development activity.Financial expense, net, increased by ‚¬ 0.6 million (+18.8%) versus Q3-20 primarily due to Besi's issuance in August of ‚¬ 150 million of 0.75% Convertible Notes due 2027.‚¬ millionsQ4-2020*Q3-2020ÎQ4-2019*ÎNet Income44.634.0+31.2%33.7+32.3%Net Margin40.7%31.3%+9.436.5%+4.2Tax Rate-21.2%12.4%-33.6-43.9%+22.7* Includes deferred tax benefits of ‚¬ 11.2 million and ‚¬ 11.6 million in Q4-20 and Q4-19, respectively.

Excluding deferred tax benefits in Q4-20 and Q4-19, net income declined by ‚¬ 0.6 million, or 1.8%, versus Q3-20 but increased by ‚¬ 11.3 million, or 51.1%, versus Q4-19. Versus Q4-19, the increase was primarily due to significantly higher revenue and gross margin levels realized and lower operating expenses principally as a result of strategic cost control initiatives.Full Year Results of Operations‚¬ millionsFY 2020FY 2019ÎRevenue433.6356.2+21.7%Orders472.1348.7+35.4%Gross Margin59.6%55.8%+3.8Operating Income149.991.9+63.1%Net Income132.381.3+62.7%Net Margin30.5%22.8%+7.7Tax Rate *3.8%-4.1%+7.9* Effective tax rates in 2020 and 2019 were 12.0% and 10.8%, respectively, excluding ‚¬ 11.2 million and ‚¬ 11.6 million of deferred tax benefits in each of Q4-20 and Q4-19. Excluding such benefits, Besi's net income and net margin would have been ‚¬ 121.1 million and 27.9% in 2020 and ‚¬ 69.7 million and 19.6% in 2019.Besi's revenue increased by ‚¬ 77.4 million, or 21.7%, in 2020 versus 2019. The increase reflects improved industry conditions post the pandemic outbreak, increased shipments for mobile applications due to a new 5G smart phone product cycle and increased investment by Chinese customers. Similarly, orders increased by 35.4% versus 2019. In 2020, bookings by IDMs and subcontractors represented approximately 45% and 55%, respectively, of Besi's total orders versus 61% and 39%, respectively, in 2019.Besi's operating income of ‚¬ 149.9 million grew by 63.1% year over year primarily due to (i) significant revenue growth and (ii) a gross margin expansion of 3.8 points associated with Besi's strong advanced packaging market position, more favorable product mix and increased productivity as lower Asian fixed headcount levels helped drive labor efficiencies. In addition, operating expenses increased by only 1.7% versus 2019 due to ongoing cost reduction efforts and lower travel and overhead expenses as a result of the pandemic. As a consequence, Besi's net income of ‚¬ 132.3 million increased ‚¬ 51.0 million, or 62.7% while net margins grew by 7.7 points to reach 30.5%.Financial Condition‚¬ millionsQ42020Q32020Î  Q42019Î  FY 2020FY2019Î  Total Cash and Deposits598.7564.5+6.1%408.4+46.6%598.7408.4+46.6%Net Cash and Deposits198.7158.7+25.2%130.3+52.5%198.7130.3+52.5%Cash flow from Ops.51.760.9-15.1%36.3+42.4%162.0120.1+34.9%At the end of Q4-20, cash and deposits aggregated ‚¬ 598.7 million, an increase of 46.6% versus year end 2019 primarily as a result of the issuance of ‚¬ 150 million of Convertible Notes due 2027 and significantly increased profitability versus 2019. Net cash and deposits grew to ‚¬ 198.7 million, an increase of ‚¬ 40.0 million (+25.2%) compared to Q3-20 and ‚¬ 68.4 million (+52.5%) versus year end 2019. During the quarter, Besi generated cash flow from operations of ‚¬ 51.7 million which was used to fund (i) ‚¬ 8.3 million of share repurchases, (ii) ‚¬ 5.4 million of capitalized development spending and (iii) ‚¬ 1.6 million of capital expenditures.During Q4-20, ‚¬ 8.0 million principal amount of the 2016 Convertible Notes were converted into 401,354 ordinary shares. As a result, the principal amount outstanding of the 2016 Convertible Notes decreased to ‚¬ 110.0 million.Share Repurchase ActivityDuring the quarter, Besi repurchased 197,923 of its ordinary shares at an average price of ‚¬ 41.98 per share for a total of ‚¬ 8.3 million. In 2020, a total of 0.5 million shares were purchased at an average price of ‚¬ 38.05 per share for a total of ‚¬ 17.8 million. Cumulatively, as of December 31, 2020, 3.5 million shares have been purchased under the current ‚¬ 125 million share repurchase program at an average price of ‚¬ 24.05 per share for a total of ‚¬ 84.8 million. At year end 2020, Besi held approximately 5.7 million shares in treasury at an average cost of ‚¬ 16.43, equal to 7.3% of its shares outstanding.Dividend for 2020Given its earnings, cash flow generation and prospects, Besi's Board of Management has proposed a cash dividend of ‚¬ 1.70 per share for the 2020 year for approval at its AGM on April 30, 2021. The proposed dividend reflects a pay-out ratio of 94%, will be payable from May 7, 2021 and represents an increase of 68.3% versus 2019.Outlook Based on its December 31, 2020 backlog and feedback from customers, Besi forecasts for Q1-21 that:• Revenue will increase by 30-40% versus the ‚¬ 109.7 million reported in Q4-20.• Gross margin will range between 58-60% versus the 58.3% realized in Q4-20.• Baseline operating expenses are expected to increase by 15-20% from ‚¬ 23.3 million in Q4-20 primarily due to higher variable sales-related expenses and product development activity.• Total operating expenses are expected to increase by approximately 50-55% versus Q4-20 primarily due to approximately ‚¬ 10 million of non-cash, share based compensation expense.Composition Supervisory BoardBesi proposes two changes to the composition of its Supervisory Board at its upcoming Annual General Meeting of Shareholders to be held on April 30, 2021 ("2021 AGM") due to the retirement of two of its current members.The Supervisory Board proposes to nominate Dr Laura Oliphant to be appointed as a Supervisory Board member for a four-year term at the 2021 AGM. Ms Oliphant has served in an advisory capacity to Besi's Supervisory Board since August 2020. In addition, the Supervisory Board proposes to nominate Ms Elke Eckstein to be appointed as a Supervisory Board member for a four-year term with effect as of September 1, 2021. Ms Eckstein (56) currently serves as CEO and President of ENICS Group Electronics, an electronic manufacturing services company based in ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland, a position she has held since 2019. Prior thereto, she served in senior management positions at a variety of global semiconductor, photonics and electronics firms in Germany, USA, France and Taiwan, including WeidmÃ¼ller Group, Osram AG, Global Foundries, AMD, Altis Semiconductor, Infineon AG and Siemens AG. Ms Eckstein is considered independent for the purposes of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code.Ms Mona ElNaggar intends to resign her position as a member of the Supervisory Board prior to the end of her current term to pursue other interests after 9 years of service. Her resignation will become effective at such time that Ms Eckstein's appointment as a Supervisory Board member becomes effective. In addition, Mr Douglas Dunn, Vice Chairman of the Supervisory Board, will not seek re-appointment for another term upon the expiration of his current two-year term after twelve years of service.If the proposed appointments are approved at the 2021 AGM, the diversity of the Supervisory Board will increase, with female representation increasing from 20% to 40%.Investor and media conference callA conference call and webcast for investors and media will be held today at 4:00 pm CET (10:00 am EST).

Wu Lien-teh, the doctor who stopped an epidemic thanks to Google's mask and doodle honorsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 10, 2021 WednesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 574 wordsBody              Wu Lien-teh went on to history as one of the pioneers in the use of the hub cover for epidemic control.            Wikkicommons Wu Lien-teh went down in history as one of the pioneers in the use of the hub for epidemic control.       If there has been a leading object in this global covid-19 pandemic is the mask.But what is the origin of the also known as barbijo or hubs as a resource to help curb epidemics?One of the theory points to the times of the so-called Manchurian plague, which affected much of China in the early 20th century.One of the doctors who led the fight against this disease was Wu Lien-teh, and is considered one of the precursors ofusing the cap for medicalprocedures,especiallythe mask N-95.For that reason, Google decided to dedicate its doodle to it on Wednesday, on the anniversary of his birth.Wu was born on March 10, 1879 in the Penang region of Malaysia.He was one of the leading physicians of the health system at the time of Emperor Puyi of the Qing dynasty and decided to use the mask to prevent the spread of the virus that caused the plague.And for his contributions to epidemic management and control, in 1935he was a candidate for the Nobel Prize in Medicine, the first of his country.The Plague of ManchuriaWu studied medicine at Emmanuel College, Cambridge and lived in London until 1904, when he returned to his country. • Why the Japanese wearing masks long before the appearance of covid-19In 1907 he was invited by the Chinese government to work in the service of the Qing dynasty, who was in power.At the age of three, a series of deaths were recorded for unknown reasons in the region adjoining the city of Harbin, and that's when Wu began the work for which he would be recognized.According to his biography and the obituary published by the specialized journal The Lancet in 1960, the year he died, the doctor identified several problems while visiting the sites where plague patients were being cared for."There were homeless-looking sick people, coughing and spitting blood. No one was carrying protection,"the obituary says.According to the document, half of the doctors and nurses attending to the emergency had died from a problem that no one had taken into account and which Wu detected when performing the autopsy of one of the deceased: the virus spread through the air. And it had a lethality close to 100%.                The N95 mask has become one of those used during the covid-19 pandemic.            Getty Images The N95 mask has become one of those used during the covid-19 pandemic.       It was there that he came up with the idea of using a cloth hub top, which became the precursor to the N-95 mask, one of the most widely used, especially by medical personnel, during the covid-19 pandemic.But it wasn't the only move he took: he also isolation the infected, created a shift list for nurses and doctors, fumigating the places of care, and finally recommended social estating in medical centers.He also managed to trace the origin of the disease:emerged among the groundhog hunters, who had spread from the furs hung in their homes.In just under three months, Wu managed to control the epidemic.The doctor lived for years in China, until in 1939 he returned to his country, where he died in 1960.You can now receive notifications from BBC News Mundo.

Here's a way to detect if facial recognition systems used your photosCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 1, 2021 MondayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1108 wordsBodyWhen tech companies created facial recognition systems, which are quickly re-shaping government surveillance and undermining personal privacy, they may have been helped by an unexpected source: your face.Businesses, universities and government laboratories have used millions of images collected from a jumble of online sources to develop the technology. Now, researchers have created an online tool, Exposing.AI, that allows people to search for their old photos in many of these image collections.The tool, which pairs Flickr images (an online shared photo service), provides a window into the huge amounts of data needed to create a wide variety of artificial intelligence technologies, from facial recognition to online chatbots."People should know that some of their most intimate moments have been used as weapons," said one of its creators, Liz O'Sullivan, Chief Technology Officer at Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, a group dedicated to defending civil rights and privacy.O'Sullivan helped create Exposing.AI along with Adam Harvey, a Berlin-based researcher and artist.Systems that use artificial intelligence don't magically become smart. They learn by identifying patterns in the data generated by humans: photos, voice recordings, books, Wikipedia articles, and all kinds of other materials. Technology is improving all the time, but it can learn human biases against women and minorities.People may not know that they are contributing to the education of artificial intelligence. For some, this is a curiosity. To others, it creates enormous fear. Besides, it can be illegal. A 2008 illinois law, the Biometric Information Privacy Act, imposes financial fines if scans of residents' faces are used without their consent.In 2006, Brett Gaylor, a documentary filmmaker from Victoria, British Columbia, uploaded photos of his honeymoon to Flickr, a popular service at the time. Nearly fifteen years later, thanks to an early version of Exposing.AI provided by Harvey, Gaylor discovered that hundreds of those photos had reached several datasets that were perhaps used to train facial recognition systems around the world.Flickr, a platform that has been purchased and sold by many companies over the years and is now owned by the SmugMug shared photo service, allowed its users to share their photos under a license known as Creative Commons. This license, common on websites, meant that others could use photos with certain restrictions, which may have been ignored. In 2014, Yahoo, owner of Flickr at the time, used many of these photos in a dataset that aimed to help work on machine vision.Gaylor, 43, wondered how his photos might have bounced from place to place. He was later told that the photos perhaps contributed to surveillance systems in the United States and other countries, and that one of those systems was used to track Uighur people in China."My curiosity became horror, " he admitted.In a way, what's behind the photos of a honeymoon that served to create surveillance systems in China is a story of unintended consequences... unexpected or unexpected.Years ago, artificial intelligence researchers from major universities and technology companies began bringing together digital photos from a variety of sources, including photo sharing services, social media,dating sites like OkCupid and even cameras installed in college playgrounds. Then they shared those photos with other organizations.It was just the norm for investigators. They just needed data to power their artificial intelligence systems, so they shared what they had. This used to be legal.One example was MegaFace, a dataset created by university of Washington professors in 2015, without the owners of the photos they incorporated into their huge reserve knowing or consenting. Teachers posted it online so others could download it.According to a request for public records made by The New York Times, companies and government agencies around the world have downloaded MegaFace more than 6000 times. These entities include a U.S. defense contractor, Northrop Grumman; In-Q-Tel, the CIA's investment arm; ByteDance, the parent company of the TikTok social media app; and Chinese surveillance company Megvii.Researchers created MegaFace for use in an academic competition that sought to stimulate the development of facial recognition systems. It wasn't for commercial use. However, only a small percentage of those who downloaded MegaFace participated publicly in the competition."We are not in the position of discussing third-party projects," said Victor Balta, a spokesman for the University of Washington. "MegaFace has been dismantled and MegaFace data is no longer distributed."Some have downloaded the data and used facial recognition systems. Last year, commerce blacklisted Megvii after the Chinese government used its technology to monitor the country's Uighur population.The University of Washington lowered MegaFace in May, and other organizations have deleted other datasets. However, copies of these files could be anywhere, and they are likely feeding new research.O'Sullivan and Harvey spent years trying to create a tool that could expose the use of all that data. It was harder than they expected.They wanted to accept someone's photo and, through facial recognition, tell the person at that moment how many times their face had been in one of those datasets. However, they were concerned that this tool might fall into the wrong hands: stalkers, businesses, and nation-states."The potential damage seemed too great," said O'Sullivan, who is also vice president of responsible artificial intelligence at Arthur, a New York company that helps businesses manage the behavior of artificial intelligence technologies.In the end, they were forced to limit the way people were going to look in the tool and the results it would produce. Today, the tool is not as effective as you would like. However, researchers were concerned that they would not be able to expose the scale of the problem without making it worse.Exposing.AI doesn't use facial recognition. Locate photos only if you already have a way to point them out online with, say, an internet address. People can only search for photos that have been posted on Flickr and need flickr information; a username, tag, or internet address that can identify those images (this provides appropriate security and privacy protections, according to researchers).Although the above limits the usefulness of the tool, this is still a revelation. Flickr images make up a significant part of facial recognition datasets that have passed back and forth on the internet, including MegaFace.Load-Date: February 2, 2021End of Document

China considers limiting exports of rare earths and vital minerals to u.S. technology industryCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 16, 2021 TuesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 199 wordsBodyChina is considering limiting exports to the United States of rare earths, vital minerals for the technology industry, which could harm the U.S. defense sector, the British newspaper Financial Times (FT) reports today.According to the economic journal, which cites sources participating in government consultations, the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology last January proposed greater control over the production and export of 17 of these minerals, a market that China controls by about 80%.The FT points out that China is thus examining whether these restrictions could affect European and US companies and, in particular, whether they will impact technologies vital to the production of sophisticated weaponry, including the Us Air Force's 'F-35' fighter jet.The "F-35s" depend on these minerals to power the electricity system, says the British economic daily, who adds that in a report by the US Congress, each device needs 417 kilograms of these minerals.These possible measures by Beijing, the FT points out, correspond to the deterioration of relations between China and the United States, aggravated by the emergence of a technological war between the two countries.Load-Date: February 17, 2021End of Document

Most recently, basically showsBeijing ordering Ant to overhaul lucrative parts of its business after accusing it of "turning a blind eye" to regulatory issues in the latest official broadside at Ma's online empire.The comments from Ma sparked a meeting with financial regulators that are now looking to regulateAnt Group further, requiring the company to create a separate holding company to meet government regulation and capital adequacy, CNBC reported.The regulatory crackdown on Chinese "tech stalwarts" such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE: (BA)) is favorable for the so-called FAANG stocks, according to Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives.Ant was last month poised for a public listing that would have valued it at more than US$300 billion, before regulators intervened and scuttled the IPO.On Sunday,Ant Group, the parent company ofAliPay, was severely reprimanded by the Chinese authorities: the financial group ofAlibaba founder Jack Ma is forced to restructure its operations. While it stopped short of directly asking for a breakup of the company, the central bank stressed that Ant needed to "understand the necessity of overhauling its business" and come up with a timetable as soon as possible.Coronavirus alarm in France after 2,500 attend illegal raveThe organisers of the party are still being sought, local police said, and an investigation has been launched. Officials in the country reportedly warned against holding large New Year's Eve celebrations.Ant Group,Alibaba's sister company, was almost carved up by the Chinese authorities: the creator ofAliPay is forced to restructure its operations.Ant Group, which started out as a payments service forAlibaba's e-commerce platform Taobao, has since expanded to offer insurance and investment products to its hundreds of millions of users in mainland China."Its growth would slow a lot", said Francis Chan, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst in Hong Kong.China last week intensified its scrutiny of the twin pillars of billionaire Ma's internet domain when it also kicked off an investigation into alleged monopolistic practices at Ant affiliate Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.Bloomberg estimated the restructuring will knock Ant's value below $153 billion, effectively erasing the past two years of mammoth gains.Authorities also blasted Ant for sub-par corporate governance, disdain toward regulatory requirements and engaging in regulatory arbitrage.The valuation of the nonpayment businesses, including wealth management and consumer lending, could be slashed by as much as 75 percent, Chan said. Meanwhile, The Guardian reports that a combination of these measures have taken more than United States dollars 10 billion (~RM40.5 billion) offJack Ma's personal fortune, which has dropped him down into second place of list of China's richest individuals.Load-Date: January 4, 2021End of Document

China presents health passport for international travelCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 9, 2021 TuesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 382 wordsBodyChina has launched a digital passport for its citizens, with which they will be able to demonstrate their state of health by traveling to or from abroad, which could contribute to a greater opening of Chinese borders.According to government sources, the "health certificate for international travel" is a smartphone app that shows and verifies vaccination history and the results of citizen covid tests (PCR and antibodies).The system aims to "boost the global economic recovery and facilitate border crossing," a foreign ministry spokesman said, without explaining whether other countries intend to recognize the Chinese certificate.So far the application is not mandatory and is reserved for the Chinese."The passport will offer greater convenience in travel as China and other countries conclude mutual recognition agreements for health certificates," state news agency Xinhua said.The certificate, which will also be available on paper, could be the world's "coronavirus health passport," the agency said.The United States and the United Kingdom study adopting similar systems. The European Commission is due to present the idea of a "green passport" on 17 March, but the issue divides the 27 EU countries.The Chinese app includes a confidential QR code that will allow each country to obtain information about travelers' health, Xinhua reported.Codes are already needed in China to give access to national transport and many public spaces. They show that the citizen has not been in contact with a person who is a confirmed case of coronavirus or if he traveled to a place where, for example, many contagions were recorded.Since March 2020, China has only authorized the entry of Chinese into its territory and a limited number of foreigners. It has also greatly reduced international flights.Among foreigners, only diplomats, businessmen or persons with residence and work visas can enter the country under certain conditions.All travelers, both Chinese and foreign, must comply with a quarantine of at least 14 days in a hotel on their arrival, with the expenses in charge of each person.The launch of the digital health passport suggests the possibility, in the medium term, of widespread use by foreigners and a partial suspension of travel restrictions to enter or leave the country.Load-Date: March 10, 2021End of Document

Jack Ma is swapping drawings with his biggest fanCNN WireFebruary 8, 2021 Monday 1:44 PM GMTCopyright 2021 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 565 wordsByline: By Michelle Toh, CNN BusinessDateline: (CNN) Body             Two of Asia's biggest names in tech, Masayoshi Son and Jack Ma, are keeping in touch through personal drawings.Son, the CEO of SoftBank,opened up about some of his recent exchanges with the Alibaba co-founder during an earnings presentation Monday, saying that the two billionaires remained in contact after Ma mostly disappeared from public view for several months.Alibaba has long been the crown jewel of SoftBank's investment portfolio. And Son and Ma are famously close - the Japanese entrepreneur invested $20 million in Alibaba over 20 years ago, turning that bet into one that was worth $60 billion when Alibaba went public in 2014.But "[we're] not always [talking] about the business," Son said in response to questions about the Chinese regulatory crackdown on Alibaba and its affiliate, Ant Group. Ma "likes to draw," and has "sent me many drawings," the Japanese tycoon said.Son added that he usually responds with creations of his own, including sometimes before turning in for the night. "Thirty minutes or so, before I go to bed, I draw some drawings ... [and] show him."Alibaba has suffered a crisis of confidence in recent months as it faces scrutiny from Chinese regulators. The stock dropped 25% late last year, though it's recovered some ground in early 2021.The saga started last fall, when Ant Group was preparing for what would have the world's largest initial public offering. Then Ma accused authorities of stifling innovation and blasted China's banks for having a "pawn shop" mentality. Within days, regulators summoned Ma and Ant executives to a meeting and then shelved the IPO altogether.Since then, the landscape has worsened for Alibaba and other Chinese tech firms, with regulators announcing an antitrust investigation into Alibaba. Ma kept quiet and canceled an appearance at a high-profile event before briefly reemerging last month, appearing in an online video where he spoke to teachers in China.Son has referred to Ma as a lifelong "friend and comrade," and previously said that before the coronavirus pandemic, the two had dinner every month to catch up on work and life. Both men were on the boards of each other's companies until last year."[SoftBank] continues to be Alibaba's largest shareholder and Alibaba remains our most important investment asset," Son wrote in a company annual report last July.Asked about the regulatory risk on Monday, Son dismissed concerns, arguing that such moderation is healthy."Those are necessary regulations, necessary laws," he told reporters. "I think what they are discussing right now is something that has already been done in US [and] European countries, and that's not exceeding what we've been seeing in [those] countries."Son also used Alibaba as a case study for his own success on Monday, calling it a "golden egg" that had been laid by the "goose" of SoftBank.

Jim Banks, Lee Carter, Mark Penn, Carl RoessnerBodyMARIA BARTIROMO, MORNINGS WITH MARIA HOST: Welcome back. Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Wednesday, February 3. Your top stories right now, 7 a.m. on the east coast. The surprise from Seattle, Jeff Bezos stepping down as Amazon CEO. A closer look this morning at who will replace him and the company's fourth quarter results, which were much better than expected. Amazon not the only tech giant posting strong earnings. We've got the details on Alphabet's record revenue, why the stock is up 7.5 percent right now on the parent of Google.Then battling big tech, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has his own plan to take on the social media giants' censorship and how they're censoring political candidates. Plus President Biden defending his record number of executive actions. We're looking at a close zeroing in on the latest efforts to reverse all of the Trump era policies coming out of this administration. Indiana Congressman Jim Banks to react coming up.Markets are higher. We continue to see this firmer tone on day 3, another big rally at the start of trading. Dow Industrials right now up 30 points. The Nasdaq up 102. Three-quarters of 1 percent higher on Nasdaq and the S&P 500 up 15 points on top of yesterday's broad rally. That was boosted by stimulus, earnings news, vaccine optimism. At the end of the day the Dow Industrials were up 475 points, one and two-thirds percent. The Nasdaq up 1.5 percent with a gain of 210 points, and the S&P higher by 52 yesterday at 4 o'clock on Wall Street.Living in high luxury. We zero in on one of the hottest pieces of Tampa real estate this morning as the city gets ready to host Super Bowl 55 this weekend. Mornings with Maria is live right now.European markets this morning also stronger. Take a look. All the indices are up with the DAX Index in Germany best performer up almost 1 percent on the DAX Index. In Asia overnight stocks were higher with the exception of China. The Shanghai Composite down about half a percent. We did have some weaker than expected Purchasing Manager's Indexes out of China, and that did dampen some of the gains that we saw early in the session.Now some of the top stories that we are watching this morning. Amazon's Jeff Bezos is stepping down as the company's CEO. He will leave the helm of the company he founded 27 years ago. Amazon is now worth $1.6 trillion. Wow. Bezos will transition to the role of Amazon's Executive Chairman during the company's third fiscal quarter. That starts in July. He is handing over the reigns to Andy Jassy, the current Chief Executive of Amazon Web Services. He will replace Bezos as Amazon's CEO.Amazon's shares are higher this morning after the company reported record sales in the fourth quarter. A $100 billion quarter, fourth quarter profit beating expectations. The stock up one and a third percent this morning after a buffo (ph) year of gains.Newly-appointed Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, is calling for a meeting of the regulatory agencies. The SEC, Securities and Exchange Commission, Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Reserve and others will meet as early as tomorrow to discuss the recent market volatility surrounding GameStop. The SEC already says it plans a review of the actions of brokerage firms that restricted investors' ability to trade those volatile stocks.Meanwhile, President Joe Biden signing three more executive orders on immigration yesterday. They include establishing a task force to reunite families who were separated at the U.S.-Mexico border. He's reviewing current asylum policies and directing the Department of Homeland Security to revisit the Trump administration's public charge rule. All this as Democrats take the first steps toward advancing the president's trillion dollar coronavirus relief package without Republican support. The Senate voting to proceed to the budget resolution necessary to reconciliation. That will allow Democrats to pass an eighth (ph) package with just a simple majority.House impeachment managers, meanwhile, laying out their case on former President Donald Trump in a brief filed yesterday. The Democrat managers laid out the legality of their case saying that Trump was not exempt from impeachment just because he's no longer in office. They went on to say that there is no, quote, "January exception to impeachment." In response, Trump's legal team is denying that he sparked the Capitol Hill riot and that it is unconstitutional to impeach a former office holder. The impeachment trial is happening, expected to begin next week.And some more good news on the vaccine front to report, Pfizer and BioNTech planning to deliver 200 million doses - additional doses of the vaccine to the United States by May of this year. That's earlier than the initial forecast, which was for July deliveries. This welcomed news coming as states struggle with vaccine shortages right now. Pfizer and BioNTech have delivered 29 million dosages of - as of January 31 so far.Time for the Word on Wall Street. Top investors watching your money this week, and joining me right now is the Co-founder and Chief Economist of Cornerstone Macro, Nancy Lazar, and the Fitz-Gerald Group Principal, Keith Fitz-Gerald, is here. Great to see you both. Thank you much for being here. Happy Wednesday.Keith, kicking it off with you, pretty big shake up in the technology world. Jeff Bezos says he's stepping down as Amazon CEO. He will transition to executive chairman in the third quarter of 2021, handing the reigns over to current Amazon Web Services CEO, Andy Jassy. People were surprised when they came out with their earnings and announced this news. The retailer announced fourth quarter earnings yesterday and its first $100 billion quarter. Keith, your reaction to all of this? Obviously Jeff Bezos going out on top with $100 billion quarter.KEITH FITZ-GERALD, THE FITZ-GERALD GROUP PRINCIPAL: He's going out in style and then some. To think -(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Yes.FITZ-GERALD: -- he was such a conservative, small, humble guy when he started this thing. He's still a humble guy from everything I know about him. This is interesting to me because AWS, about 52 percent or so of Amazon, it's clearly the path forward for the company. I worry, though, that this is a move of strategic misdirection. I worry about the strategic implications in light of the climate in Washington and the political sort of vitriol that's going around on both sides of the fence. You know, so I think this is a move we all knew was coming. It's not necessarily something that wants me to - makes we want to jump into the stock at the moment, but again a good transition, solid new incoming CEO, and I think very good things ahead for Amazon.BARTIROMO: Well it's interesting because, yes, the cloud business is the majority here in terms of the revenue and yet you're taking on the web services guy to run the overall company. Is that -(CROSSTALK)FITZ-GERALD: Yes.BARTIROMO: -- is that the concern that you're referring to? Yes, OK.FITZ-GERALD: Well that's -(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: That's a good point.FITZ-GERALD: -- exactly it because the data is very different from the retail model. This is clearly all about the consumer, yet AWS seems to be going in a different direction, so I worry a little bit about that. It's clearly not what we thought, so -(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: OK.FITZ-GERALD: -- there's something else going on there.BARTIROMO: All right, we will keep watching that. Nancy, let's talk macro for a second. We've got the jobs report coming out on Friday, the first jobs report of the new year. The economy expected to add 50,000 jobs and the unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 6.7 percent. Nancy, I was reading your most recent report, and you've been very bullish on the consumer and certainly on growth, but you say things have begun to turn a little wavy. January may have been a weak spot. Tell us about it.NANCY LAZAR, CORNERSTONE MACRO CO-FOUNDER & CHIEF ECONOMIST: Well you've seen a shift down in employment. Obviously you had that decline in December. 50 sounds like - is just an OK number for January, so you've seen a little bit of a shift down in jobs, and the consumer has - consumer confidence has been a little bit depressed, particularly in the month of January.But the whole - the whole key over the past year has been to look ahead. And so, you've had a lull in jobs, lull in consumer confidence, but looking ahead as you've highlighted the news on the vaccine is very encourage, the decline of the number of - third number of decline in COVID cases. The consumer has a great balance sheet, but this is a lull before we see a real strong pick up in consumer spending as we get through this COVID - this COVID crisis.So near-term maybe a little bit of a lull, but 7 percent consumer spending as we move in the back half of the year is a real possibility, potentially even stronger than that. And increasingly it looks like some of the strength is going to continue into 2022, you know, with the delay in getting the vaccines rolled out you have more and more pent up demand that will not just help here in 2021 but also 2022. So the job outlook is going to get just even stronger.The COVID industries will as we move through the back half of the year will start to hire people again. We've already seen Delta, for example, announce that they were going to bring back some pilots this summer. And so, you have whole other bucket of the economy, the COVID-hit industries, that will help to support the job market as you go into the back half of the year. So the unemployment rate may be it stabilizing today as you say, but by the end of the year could the unemployment rate be back below 5 percent? Sure. Next year could it be back below 4 percent? We think so.BARTIROMO: Oh, that's good news. All right, so are you still looking at growth of potentially as high as 7 percent for 2021? And Nancy, talk to us about the impact of the dollar. Your recent note talking about a stable dollar and what you're expecting from inflation. We've seen some of these commodities, Nancy. You've got iron ore up, orange juice up, you know, all of the sort of fundamental things that are used in, for example, building a home and, you know, industrial metals are up. So what's your take on inflation and the dollar, and how does that play into things, Nancy?LAZAR: Well with the - with the COVID crisis there definitely has been a hit to the supply chain, disrupting the movement of goods around the country. And so, that has created some upward pressure on prices, but that's where this - that's where this recent stability, at least we think, it's starting to stabilize at maybe a little bit premature, but we do think the dollar is starting to stabilize and that's really important. And it's stabilizing because of the somewhat softer news you've seen out of China.As you mentioned, it's stabilizing because Europe's stumbling a little bit when it comes to the vaccine, that the stability and the dollar will help ease some of these commodity prices pressures and you've already actually started to see it with iron ore actually stabilizing, copper stabilizing.And so, there is this huge inflation wall of worry, we think it's just that, a wall of worry. That the underlying backdrop in the United States is likely to stay lower longer. And this stability in the dollar increases the odds that that does indeed -- that does indeed happen.And so the GDP growth outlook is pretty strong, 6 percent right now is our current forecast, but 7 percent plus, particularly in the back half of the year as the economy starts to open up. And I would emphasis plus, it could even -- it could even be strong -- stronger than that.But, so I don't think inflation is a problem, there's one right now, too much slack too. We've been very focused on productivity which is kind of, you know, an important but kind of boring topic when it comes to inflation, but the productivity backdrop and you're seeing it in the corporate profit cycle, what Amazon has done and what other companies are doing in investing in their businesses to make them more productive. The digital economy is huge; I loved your robot story earlier.BARTIROMO: Yes.LAZAR: And so productivity is a -- is an important inflation headwind.BARTIROMO: Yes, and technology is imbedded in so many industries so, you know, you're going to see growth, right Keith, from these industries in a number of areas, not just sort of big tech?Real quick, we've got to jump Keith.FITZ-GERALD: That is the point of the next 10 years. Absolutely.BARTIROMO: That's right.FITZ-GERALD: Any business that is not involving technology gets left behind.BARTIROMO: Right. And Nancy has written about this so much. Nancy Lazar, Keith Fitz-Gerald great to see you both. Thank you so much. Have a great day.LAZAR: Have a good day. You too.FITZ-GERALD: Thank you (ph).BARTIROMO: Thank you for the world on Wall Street. All right, much more ahead this morning. Coming up Indiana Congressman Jim Banks is here to talk about the flurry of executive orders, President Biden's new action on immigration.Next hour former Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow stopping by, giving us his take on the economy, the state of the stimulus and Senator Elizabeth Warren's plan for all these new taxes, like a wealth tax.Plus luxury listing, we're giving you a tour of a multi-million dollar home which took its design from one very famous architect.Joining the conversation all morning long this morning Dagen McDowell and Lee Carter, we're going to get back to this fantastic panel and the ladies when we come back. You're watching "Mornings with Maria" live on Fox Business. Stay with us.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: There's a lot of talk, with good reason, about the number of executive orders that I have signed. I'm not making new law, I'm eliminating bad policy.What I'm doing is taking on the issues that 99 percent of them (ph) that the president, the last President of the United States, issued executive orders that I thought were counterproductive to our security, counterproductive to who we are as a country, particularly in -- in -- in the air of immigration.(END VIDEO CLIP)DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX NEWS HOST: That was President Joe Biden's speaking out yesterday, defending his flurry of executive orders. He signed three more actions on immigration creating a task force to reunite separated families, also ending the asylum cooperation agreements with El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.Joining me now, Indiana Congressman, House Armed Services Committee and Intelligence Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee Member Jim Banks. Congressman, what do you make of these actions yesterday, because based on the language of President Biden is as if everything that he's doing is for the good of the nation? Is it?REP. JIM BANKS (R-IN): Well first of all, this is an unprecedented number of executive actions by a president in just the first couple of weeks in office circumventing Congress. And yes, there's been a lot of talk about, well, President Trump did it too. But President Trump signed four executive orders in his first 10 days versus 33 by Joe Biden. And that's a dangerous precedent.But when we get into these immigration executive actions yesterday, this is also a dangerous path forward. I mean, keep in mind that under President Trump in some places at the border we saw illegal border crossings decline by 94 percent and the actions by the Obama -- Obama -- or the Biden administration yesterday will return us to the years of -- of Obama and Bush where we had floods illegals coming across the border.We can't afford that in American, we need to -- we need to take a stronger look at what worked during the Trump administration and not make the mistakes that the Biden administration appears that they're going to make from the outset.BARTIROMO: Yes. Congressman, you know, Dagen's right. I mean, you know, the administration keeps coming out saying things like, well we're just undoing bad policy, we're not just trying to undo Donald Trump.But look at this one policy that I've been focused on this morning and that is that Secretary of State Antony Blinken is confirming the administration intends to suspend and terminate the safe third country asylum deals that the Trump administration brokered with El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala. Why do that?You know, this was a place where people could wait and they brokered this deal that these illegals can wait in the country that they come from. This is what former White House Senior Advisor Stephen Miller was talking about when we spoke about immigration on "Sunday Morning Futures" on Sunday. Here's his reaction, I've got to get yours after this. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)STEPHEN MILLER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE SENIOR ADVISOR: You deliberately take areas where the border patrol professionals said we need border barriers and you halt the construction of those barriers. You're going to get more illegal immigration. You're also going to put our border agents in harms ways.As for suspending all immigration enforcement in addition to undermining American workers and taxpayers, it would result in 12,000 criminal aliens at least per month being released back into U.S. communities out of our prisons and jails and state and local law enforcement that otherwise would have been picked by ICE. This isn't Republican or Democrat or liberal or conservative, this is just fundamental common sense.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Congressman, obviously the Biden administration does not see it that way.BANKS: The Biden administration appears hell bent on creating a humanitarian crisis not solving one. And that -- that's what these agreements with these countries did. I mean, the Trump administration negotiated these agreements as there was -- there were caravans of tens of thousands of illegals who were coming to the border to enter the United States illegally. This is going to create more of a humanitarian crisis not solve it.BARTIROMO: Yes. What about the stimulus talks, what can you tell us? Senate Democrats planning to move forward with or without the Republicans on a $1.9 trillion package, what do you think?BANKS: Well, $1.9 trillion in spending that's going to bankrupt my daughters generation and their future in America even further. On top of the $15 minimum wage, Maria, you consider what that would do to small businesses and restaurants all over America who are struggling already.This is going to put more and more restaurants and small businesses out of business permanently, we can't afford it. But to your point, you're right, what's happening this week passing a parody budget and enacting the reconciliation process in Congress will allow Democrats to do this in an entirely partisan way. I had to laugh a little bit --BARTIROMO: Wow.BANKS: I read a story from 2017 where Chuck Schumer was lambasting Republicans for using the reconciliation process which he said was not the right way to pass legislation, it wasn't good for America and now today these hypocritical Democrats are doing exactly what they attacked Republicans for using in 2017 to pass --BARTIROMO: Yes.BANKS: -- the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.BARTIROMO: Well, that's -- yes -- that's true, that is a joke. Look, what about the China Policy, this is one that we haven't heard anything from the administration, State Department Spokesperson Ned Price said yesterday that the Biden administration wants to be quote "in lockstep with other allies of the United States before entering talks with the Chinese government."Biden has not spoken to Chinese President Xi Jinping since taking office, Congressman, but look I know Xi called Biden to congratulate him early on but I mean what are we -- what are we going to see on the China Policy? --BANKS: We'll see.BARTIROMO: -- He still has not said anything about China's role, the CCPs role in the Coronavirus.BANKS: Yes, the story that you're referring to is actually astonishing and arguably President Trump's most important accomplishment was rallying the rest of the world to confront China and President Biden wants to return to the leading from behind era of the Obama years and the China appeasement policies. We can't afford to go backwards, we need to move forward.BARTIROMO: Well, it's very disturbing, Congressman, we'll be watching and spotlighting in. Thank you, sir. Congressman Jim Banks. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis takes on big tech. DeSantis is proposing a fine for any company that removes candidates from social media platforms during an election. This coming on the heels of President Trump's suspension from Twitter, Facebook and other sites weeks before the election.Dagen, your reaction to this? It's specifically he's looking at this as election interference. You remember right before the election Twitter would -- would not allow the "New York Post" to be on Twitter to report their findings on Hunter Biden.MCDOWELL: Indeed. And that was kind of the first tip of the hat of that we knew how aggressively these large technology companies would censor conservative speech and candidates or work to promote those on the left.Ron DeSantis' proposal probably won't go very far, but it -- it actually will fine and a technology a daily fine of $100,000 if a candidate their social media account is taken down. But, this applies to the state of Florida.It probably doesn't have much impact nationwide on these companies, but Governor DeSantis smartly, maybe with an eye to 2024 is keeping the attention on the social media censorship that we've seen by these large -- these four large technology companies that were a threat to the Democrats based on that 450 page report from Jerry Nadler that we saw just in October. They saw them as a threat, a monopolistic threat in, you know, just a few months ago. But, now if they're on the side of the left and the Democrats I guess it's all good.BARTIROMO: Yes. It's all good if you're competitor is getting censored I guess. Lee, what do -- what do you make of this proposal from Ron DeSantis and is this going to have an impact? You know the world we're living with all of this censorship, Lee, how are you reading this from speaking to and polling various constituents?LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT OF MASLANSKY & PARTNERS: I'm reading this by as a move by Ron DeSantis to make a symbolic move. I think he is tackling some of the issues that are most important to Americans across the board.And in Florida you're seeing he's tackling COVID in really, really smart ways, that's most important people. He's tackling the economy by having low taxes and continuing to keep things open, he's doing that. And now he's addressing this idea of everybody should have a voice, we're going to protect free speech.And so while I agree with Dagen, this might not have real legs or real impact, it does symbolically show there is an important conversation to be had about censorship, about making sure that every single person here has a voice and about our first amendment right to free speech.And I think because he's addressing these things he's setting himself very well to have a more nationwide platform in 2024. He's kind of quietly going about doing his job in Florida and this might be the first sort of tip of the hat that he's looking beyond just what it means for his home state.BARTIROMO: Yes, and look Florida, Florida is soaring. People are moving there, the growth numbers are coming up and the mortality rates on COVID are actually better than what we're seeing here in -- in New York.CARTER: That's exactly right.BARTIROMO: We'll take a break. When we come back, how Americans feel about the power -- yes -- well, we want to get Mark Penn's ideas on this as well. How do Americans feel about the power of big tech. Mark Penn is here with the result of a recent poll he did on social media. We'll get into it.And then counting down to Super Bowl Sunday, football fans expected to spend a pretty penny this year on all the gear. We'll tell you all about when we come back. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Wednesday, February 3. Check out markets this half and hour. We are looking at a firmer tone once again. Dow Industrials off of the highs of the morning but still up 7 points. The Nasdaq strong with a gain of 80 points this morning, and the S&P higher by 12.25. This after stocks finished up broadly yesterday in a very strong rally boosted by stimulus, earnings, vaccine optimism. Dow Industrials were up almost 500 points at the close, 475 higher. The Nasdaq was up better than 200 points at the close, 1.5 percent, and the S&P higher by 52 yesterday on Wall Street.This morning the momentum continues although we are looking at the averages come off of the best levels of the day, particularly in Europe. Take a look at European indices. Former European Central Bank President, Mario Draghi, accepting a mandate to form a new governed in Italy. The FT100 now struggling to stay positive. It's up just one point. The CAC Quarante in Paris is up 13, and the DAX Index is higher by 73. All of the indices off of the best levels of the morning.Asian markets mostly higher with the exception of China. China's Purchasing Manager's Index coming in slightly weaker than expected. The number measures the country's services sector activity. The Shanghai Composite, the one weak spot over night down 1.5 to 1 percent.Meanwhile, Amazon shelling out millions after being accused of stealing drivers' tips. Laruen Simonetti with this story. Lauren -LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: I know, Maria, Amazon has agreed to pay $61.7 million to settle the allegations. Now according to the Federal Trade Commission what Amazon did was lower the pay of drivers without telling them and used tip money to make up the difference. The money that's being paid by Amazon to the FTC now being used to compensate the drivers affected.Well this deal could be worth a lot of peanuts. The Wall Street Journal that Kraft Heinz is nearing a deal to sell Planters, the peanut people, to Hormel Foods, and the deal could value the brand at around $3 billion. Hormel currently owns SKIPPY Peanut Butter, and the deal could be finalized as early as next week.The pandemic shaping up to be a Super Bowl buzz kill. The National Retail Federation says only 28 percent of people plan on attending a party for the big game, and that is the lowest since this survey began. As for how much we'll spend, about $74 each or a total $13.9 billion on everything from snacks to jerseys, even new televisions, but whether you watch solo or at a gathering we're still going to eat a lot of chicken wings. The National Chicken Council estimates a record 1.42 billion wings will be eaten on Sunday, and I will be one of those people watching the game solo.Apple is facing a problem facing millions across the globe. How do you unlock your iPhone without taking off your face mask? Well they can do it now, but there's a catch. You also have to be wearing and Apple WatchSo, Apple is testing new iOS software that will allow an iPhone to communicate with synced Apple watch when the phone is raised to use facial I.D. When authentication is completed the iPhone will unlock and the watch will vibrate. The feature will reportedly be introduced as part of Apple's iOS 14.5 update. Apple shares up about a quarter this morning.You know, facial recognition just never works for me, Maria, I haven't used it in years. I just disabled it, mask or not.BARTIROMO: Well, it's -- it's funny that it's not really facial recognition with the face mask on, it's just the connection with your watch.SIMONETTI: I know.BARTIROMO: The connection with your watch to your phone. It's a good idea actually on their part. Lauren, thank you. We are zeroing in another part of big tech and that is the censorship part.A new poll from Harris shows 59 percent of Americans say the Capitol Hill riots are being used as an excuse to silence voices on the right, 41 percent say that the reaction is a legitimate response to the violence we saw on January 6.That same poll shows 59 percent think internet and social media platforms have too much power over America's free speech. Only 10 percent said that there's too little power, with 31 percent saying that it's just about the right -- the right amount.Joining me right now is former Senior Advisor to the Clintons, MDC Partner CEO and the president and managing partner of the Stagwell Group Mark Penn. Mark, it's great to see you, thanks for being here.MARK PENN, CEO OF MDC PARTNERS: Good morning.BARTIROMO: So, what was your big takeaway from your most recent polling?PENN: Well, I think the big takeaway is exactly what you hit, most people think tech companies have too much power now and that there's going to have to be some kind of regulation of that power when it comes to speech.I think everyone on the poll condemned the violence at the Capitol, but they do think, as you -- as you pointed out, almost 60 percent believe that it's being used as an excuse to clamp down on free speech.BARTIROMO: Yes, because now, Mark, what do you hear the buzz words win Washington, you're hearing domestic terrorism, they're trying to put everybody in this bucket of being a domestic terrorist if you say something that may question any of their narratives. I mean, this is a very dangerous thing, what we're hearing now about domestic terrorism.PENN: Well, I think you see in the poll, while -- while people did want action taken against President Trump with narrow majorities, most people now upon reflection say hey it was wrong for the Hunter Biden story not to play. It's wrong for senators to be taken off or squelched. They do think the tech companies have gone too far. Maybe they need regulation.I personally think we need something like an internet commerce commission, I need -- we need -- think we need a group of experts that can keep up with technology, how it's effecting people and call balls and strikes here to make sure that things are fair. Because our technology system is as important as our election system in terms of needing to have integrity.BARTIROMO: Yes, that's right. And -- and -- and this system, this industry is a lot more dangerous or dominant than it was back in 1996 when the telecom act first went in place and gave them that liability that they can't be sued, Section 230.So, I want to bring Lee Carter in here, because the same poll, Mark, also showed that there's a bit of divide in how these platforms are being viewed with the censorship decisions.Lee, 51 percent of responders said that the social media is exercising good judgment in excluding voices from their platforms, can you believe that? Forty-nine percent saying that they're simply playing partisan politics. Lee, jump in here, give us your reaction.CARTER: I mean in my opinion it just shows how divided we are, based on where you sit is how you're going to view this reaction by social media companies, you're either going to say it's appropriate or not if it agrees with your world view.And so, I think it can both be true that people believe that, you know, social media has gone too far and people also can blame Trump for what happened. I don't think that's an either or, but I think the technology companies really need to be careful right now, because they are -- I mean, it's going to be really popular to regulate them, it's going to be really popular to come down hard on them, when you look at how people use free speech.And I'm curious, you know, Mark, if you were going to be advising these companies as -- as a -- as a corporate advisor, because I know you do that as well, what would you tell them on how to prepare for what's about to come?PENN: Well, I -- I do think that any company and tech companies have to balance the right of free speech with their obligation to remove genuinely objectionable content or content that promotes violence.But, that means having a standard, it may not be as broad as the first amendment, but it's much closer to it than some of what we're seeing and it means having an appeal mechanism, a notice and an ability for people to get back on platforms.Right now it's wild west of companies making decisions without any real information to people and not wanting to explain those decisions, and I think that's raised real questions here. As you see people think the tech companies have too much power, that they're concerned that we're going to have to have regulation, and I think in the - back in '96 when we put this clause into effect we also put the voluntary rating system into effect because at that time we were mostly concerned about the entertainment industry. Now we're concerned about the tech industry, and it's either going to be voluntary or it's going to have to be regulated, but I don't think it can stay the way it is.BARTIROMO: So you - so you think that we will see regulation then, Mark? Do you think they will be able to roll back Section 230 or they won't do it because the Democrats are in control?PENN: Well I think Section 230 may come under legal attack. It may turn out to be an unconstitutional law that Congress has made that abridges free -(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Yes.PENN: -- speech. I do think that you're going to see some litigation really around that, and back in '96 and I was working with President Clinton during that time, the idea was that these platforms would be open. We never imagined that the platforms would be used to restrict pure political speech.BARTIROMO: Yes. Yes, absolutely. Let me switch gears before you go, Mark. Super Bowl 55 taking place this weekend in Tampa, Florida. It's the biggest day of the year for football certainly, but it also has become the biggest day for advertising. NBC will have four spots in the big game. Wow, that's a big deal. What kind of trends are you seeing when it comes to Super Bowl advertising this year, Mark?PENN: Well we're certainly seeing advertising advertise new kinds of services. That's like our Vroom app, for example, it's a new way, you know, to purchase cars or new ways to get jobs. We also do the Super Bowl advertising for the NFL itself, and it shows the kind of spirit I think that the country has right now, but we also represent some advertisers who said, you know what, this year maybe I'm going to wait. I'm going to wait a little bit this year. I'm uncertain about the mood. I expect we'll see a lot of people advertising unity. The country wants to come together. If you're doing a Super Bowl spot this year you don't want to be divisive. You don't want to be out of tone. You either want to bring I think some of these new services to people or tap into this mood where people want to come together.BARTIROMO: Yes, that makes a lot of sense. We'll see about that. Mark, it's great to see you. Thanks very much.PENN: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Mark Penn joining us this morning. Coming up, the surge goes south. The Wall Street bent stocks (ph), seating walls on wall (ph) yesterday as Janet Yellen gets set to talk with regulators over the market madness. We're going to take a look. And then luxury listing. We are giving you a tour of a multimillion dollar home which took its design from one very famous architect. Stay with us on that. You're watching Mornings with Maria live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.The future of trading, the CEO of Robinhood, Vlad Tenev, calling for real- time settlement in U.S. equity trading. Right now there is a two-day settlement system, this coming after the market frenzy last week. The trading app coming under serious strain raising more than $3 billion.Joining me right now is the former CEO of E*Trade and Lefteris Acquisition CEO, Carl Roessner. Carl, it's good to have you today, thanks very much for being here. What are your thoughts on first what took place last week? Where do you come at in all of this in terms of the GameStop and the resulting restrictions on trading?CARL ROESSNER, FORMER E*TRADE CEO AND LEFTERIS ACQUISITION CEO: Well, good morning, Maria, and thank you for having me on this morning, I really appreciate it. Look, a lot has happened over the last week or two that has really started to shine a light on some important developments. Right (ph).First and foremost I think the retail trader and investor has never had the type of access ease (ph) of execution, the ease with which to interact with the markets, and the ease with which to take care of their financial well being, right, through some financial technologies, you know fabulous technology that's come in through the FinTech sector you know and in my life as CEO at Lefteris, we've looked at a lot of these companies and it's really some powerful technology.I think one of the issues that you're starting to see, and you mentioned it with T+2 settlement is the front end and the interaction and the user experience and user interface has become so powerful and so fast but the backend, all of the settlement procedures and going through even up to the physical securities that we have to deal with, there's a disconnect between those two.And I think the backend definitely has to start to catch up. So, I think the company that went through this had some issues; they had some issues in terms of the way that they front their customers in terms of their purchases of securities. So, there was a little bit of a -- an extension of credit issue, there were demands from the you know NFCC when they saw the volumes and just the unbelievable volatility that was taking place.So, you have a lot that went on there --BARTIROMO: Right.ROESSNER: -- but I think you know that -- that's the individual problem and the thing that the company itself needs to really take a look at, analyze, learn from, and help others learn from but then you have to take a look at the entirety of the system which I believe what their CEO started to try to adjust last night.BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean we're trying to get ahead of it to better understand what this means in terms of the regulatory framework, right. I mean because now we've got Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen planning to meet with key financial regulatory agencies this week in response to the recent market volatility involving GameStop and AMC and all those other companies.This meeting could take place as early as tomorrow, coming after prices surge and shortage stocks were influenced by a group of investors on the online platform, Reddit, Carl. What do you think comes out of this? How does regulation change and is that going to be a new -- a game-changer for the financial services industry in general?ROESSNER: So, what I -- I would put this in my hope category, right? What I hope happens, I mean, Secretary Yellen is just an unbelievable store of knowledge and she's an absolutely brilliant woman, so I think if anybody can sort of help us get to the bottom of this and steer this through, I think taking a very pragmatic approach she can do just that, but I think when you take a look at what usually happens on the Hill and in these meetings there's some kind of a vilification or there's something that takes place that we need to point a finger.That's not the case with, you know, the settlement process and the overall regulation of the securities industry. What we need is for people to actually take a step back and look at the entirety of the system. How do we make sure that clearing system, the settlements system, market making, all of the rest stays up with the speed of the technology and the ease of use that's being provided today in the marketplace.So it's a holistic approach. It's definitely not going to happen in one day, and what I would hate to see happen is something comes down that penalizes the retail investor because they look at it as, you know, something that needs to be stopped and this is bad or this is - that's not what's happened here. You're watching the democratization -(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Yes.ROSSNER: -- that, you know, E-Trade started in 1992, right? So this has been coming for a long time.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: That's right.ROSSNER: I think those walls and barriers are coming down, and they're coming down across -(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Oh yes.ROSSNER: -- different categories. You see it even in the alt space, right? Alternative securities and other products are being made available -(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Right.ROSSNER: -- to the right types of investors online now, right? So it's -(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: That's right. Yes, and even -(CROSSTALK)ROSSNER: -- a holistic problem, Maria. It's not just a -(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Yes. Even private equity assets being - you know, being made available to retail investors who might want to play in those areas. Karl, you're absolutely right. I was there. I had a front row seat when E-Trade came on board and when you saw a real democratization of information thanks for me and many others in terms of the birth of the individual investor revolution, so I'm with you. I totally agree that would be a step back if we were to see that.ROSSNER: Yes.BARTIROMO: Karl, we'll see you soon. Thank you, sir. Karl Rossner joining us. Coming up, the life of luxury. We are taking you on a tour of a Florida mansion inspired by one very famous architect. It's right here right after the break.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Everybody wants a piece of Florida these days. A one-of-a-kind Tampa Bay waterfront home just entered the market ahead of this weekend's Super Bowl and Cheryl Casone has more on this beautiful home. Cheryl, good morning.CHERYL CASONE, FBN ANCHOR: Oh, good morning Maria from sunny Tampa. I had to say it. Look, they're having a record year for real estate sales here in the Tampa Bay area. Let me show you this home.This is an open bay view of a $7.4 million Frank Lloyd Wright inspired home, Sol Fleischman, the architect, he's very -- actually very famous down here. It was built in 2008, we're heading inside, but as you can see there's the master bath -- bedroom, excuse me. It's four bedrooms, its four and half bath, it's got a three car garage.The home itself, Maria, is almost 6,000 square feet and it's -- we're going to go inside right now, because it really is beautiful. And as the light is coming up and the sun's coming up here in Tampa it's actually pretty stunning. It's got a den, a library, a media room and as we carefully step inside and we don't trip our camera, here's the wet bar to my right, I want to show this, this is the wet bar that comes with it.And again, all of these floor to ceiling windows for the entire home, around the entire circumference of the home, it's about a 20,000 square foot lot. It's in a gated community. I'll tell you what, Maria, what the agents are telling me down here, they can't keep up with demand.Oh, by the way, if you want the Steinway piano, it's coming with the home for $7.4 million, Maria, because actually you just -- frankly you can't move the thing out. And then this is the master dining room, as you can see. I love this fixture of this -- this -- fixture right above me and then you've got a 12 seat dining room. Again, all of this on the Bay, Maria. It really is beautiful.We're going to be here all day showing our viewers what it's like to live in luxury in Tampa. Back to you.BARTIROMO: I love it. I love it. Cheryl, we'll be watching your reports throughout the day. Cheryl Casone in Tampa. Stay with us, Larry Kudlow is here next hour, other side of this break. Back in moment.Load-Date: February 3, 2021End of Document

WHO team visits 2nd Wuhan hospital in virus investigationAssociated Press InternationalJanuary 30, 2021 Saturday 10:20 AM GMTCopyright 2021 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 492 wordsByline: EMILY WANG FUJIYAMA and ZEN SOO, Associated PressDateline: WUHAN, China BodyWUHAN, China (AP) — Members of a World Health Organization team investigating the origins of the coronavirus pandemic visited another Wuhan hospital that had treated early COVID-19 patients on their second full day of work Saturday.Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital was one of the first in the Chinese city to deal with patients in early 2020 suffering from a then-unknown virus and is a key part of the epidemiological history of the disease.“Just back from visit at Jinyintan hospital, that specialised in infectious diseases and was designated for treatment of the first cases in Wuhan," Dutch virologist Marion Koopmans said in a post on Twitter. “Stories quite similar to what I have heard from our ICU doctors.”Zoologist Peter Daszak of the U.S. group EcoHealth Alliance, who is a member of the team, said in a tweet that the visit was an “important opportunity to talk directly” with medics who were fighting the virus at the critical time.The team’s first face-to-face meetings with Chinese scientists took place on Friday, before the experts who specialize in animal health, virology, food safety and epidemiology visited another early site of the outbreak, the Hubei Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine Hospital.The Geneva-based WHO said late Thursday on Twitter that its team plans to visit hospitals, markets like the Huanan Seafood Market that was linked to many of the first cases, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, and laboratories at facilities including the Wuhan Center for Disease Control.“All hypotheses are on the table as the team follows the science in their work to understand the origins of the COVID19 virus,” WHO tweeted. It said the team had already requested “detailed underlying data” and planned to speak with early responders and some of the first patients.The mission has become politically charged, as China seeks to avoid blame for alleged missteps in its early response to the outbreak.A single visit by scientists is unlikely to confirm the virus’s origins. Pinning down an outbreak’s animal reservoir is typically an exhaustive endeavor that takes years of research including taking animal samples, genetic analysis and epidemiological studies.One possibility is that a wildlife poacher might have passed the virus to traders who carried it to Wuhan. The Chinese government has promoted theories, with little evidence, that the outbreak might have started with imports of frozen seafood tainted with the virus, a notion roundly rejected by international scientists and agencies.A possible focus for investigators is the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Tuesday, January 19th. Your top stories right now, 8:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast.Parler fighting another day. New details as the company's website comes back, but the app is still banned from Google and Apple app stores.It comes amid the latest example of Twitter censorship admission. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)VIJAYA GADDE, HEAD OF LEGAL POLICY AND TRUST, TWITTER: We've seen violence unfold as a result of either misleading information or coded rhetoric.We do feel like it is -- it is -- this is our global approach.(END VIDEO CLIP)Former Georgia Congressman Doug Collins is here weighing in on the free speech battle coming up.And then headed to The Hill. Janet Yellen among President-elect Joe Biden's nominees who will face their nomination hearing today. What she says about big spending and what it could mean for the country's mounting debt and your wallet. We will preview her testimony coming up.Former Trump 2020 campaign senior adviser Mercedes Schlapp is here this morning on the incoming administration's plans to reverse President Trump's America first policies.Markets this morning are higher. We are at the highs of the morning right now after markets were closed yesterday for the Martin Luther King, Jr., Day. The Dow Industrials up better than 200 points right now, the Nasdaq up better than 100 points, and the S&P 500 higher by 62.5.Of course, we are in the middle of the fourth quarter earnings reporting season. Earnings in focus with the big banks reporting this morning. Bank of America issued mixed results. They beat on the earnings per share but they missed expectations slightly on revenue. The stock is lower this morning.Goldman Sachs beat on both the top and the bottom line with quarterly results. The stock is jumping, up better than 2.5 percent on Goldman, up almost $8 a share.And then there's streaming giant Netflix, which will release its numbers after the market close today. The stock is up going into its report.MORNINGS WITH MARIA is live right now.European markets this morning higher. Take a look. Fractional moves pretty much across the board. The FT 100 up eight, the CAC quarante in Paris up five and the DAX index in Germany higher by 36. In Asia overnight, stocks finished mostly higher. The best performer in Asia overnight was Hong Kong. The Hang Seng index up 2.75 percent. As you see, the Shanghai composite was lower.Now some of the top stories that we are watching this morning.President-elect Joe Biden is set to reverse some of President Trump's immigration policies on his first day in office. We are expecting a string of executive orders in the first 10 days in office. His sweeping proposal would o provide a path to citizenship for 11 million people living in the country illegally. Those under the DACA program would be on the shortest path to censorship. This overhaul will still need to clear Congress' approval.Meanwhile, the incoming administration is rejecting President Trump's plan to lift bans on travel into the United States from Europe, the U.K. and Brazil. These restrictions were put in place last spring by President Trump to stop the spread of the coronavirus. The president's order, however, lifts the ban on January 26th, next week. The same day all travelers must present a negative test or proof of recovery from COVID-19 to enter the U.K. Joe Biden is reversing that.Parler taking the first steps to come back. The social media platform teams up with a Russian- owned technology company in order to make its website reachable again. While the social media platform is still unavailable, visitors to the website can now see a message from Parler CEO John Matze, who says he expects service to be restored soon. Matze was with me last week on this program. He said that the company will eventually need to build its own infrastructure to prevent further shutdowns and not be reliant on big tech like Amazon.Twitter's latest censorship admission, meanwhile. A new video leaked by Project Veritas showing a top Twitter executive heard saying that Twitter will continue to purge accounts that it deems to be pushing conspiracy theories. The social media platform has eliminated more than 70,000 accounts in the wake of Capitol Hill riots as Twitter believers it is are arbiter of truth despite all the hate on Twitter. Twitter has confirmed the authenticity of that leaked video.Office Depot will be a stock to watch today certainly. The company is rebuffing the unsolicited takeover bid from Staples citing regulatory risks. The offer was for more than $2 billion. "The Journal" this morning is reporting that Office Depot is open to a sale of its retail and consumer facing e-commerce operations or a joint venture. Office Depot shares are lower on the news as its rejecting this Staples bid.Big tech censorship the new top story.In a new clip leaked by Project Veritas, and verified by Twitter, Twitter giants legal head says its crackdown on alleged conspiracy theorists is part of a, quote, global approach.Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)VIJAYA GADDE, HEAD OF LEGAL POLICY AND TRUST, TWITTER: Beyond deamplification, we are going to -- conspiracy theories -- we are going to be permanently suspending those accounts. Whether we believe Trump's tweets are inciting violence and having real world harm. I think we've seen that, in fact, they are since coming back from the timeout to deescalate the situation in other places around the world where we've seen violence unfold as a result of either misleading information or coded rhetoric. So, a lot of our learnings here have come from other markets. So, in that sense, you know, we do feel like it is -- it is - this is our global approach.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: This as competitor Parler gets partially back online. Founder John Matze telling Fox News this week that he expects the app to be back by the end of this month.Joining me right now is former Georgia Congressman and former House Judiciary Committee ranking member, Doug Collins.Also joining the conversation all morning long is Dagen McDowell and Mark Matson.Great to see everybody this morning.Doug Collins, it is a pleasure to see you, as always. Thanks for being here.What do you think is going on here? I mean you've got Twitter deciding it is the arbiter of truth and knocking out whoever -- whatever users they believe that they don't agree with.DOUG COLLINS (R), FORMER GEORGIA CONGRESSMAN: Well, Maria, good morning.It's -- you know, it's just a continuation and now they're just out in the open with it. We've been talking about this, you and I and -- on this show and others for a long time, they really only want to censor those that they don't agree with. That's the whole liberal mindset, unfortunately, that Twitter has developed as they view agree -- if we agree with what you're thinking, if not, we're not so sure. Except the problem is they have a little bit of a consistency problem. When you want to talk about conspiracy theories, number one, it's who decides what a conspiracy theory is. What about the Iranian leadership who want to wipe Israel off the map and have anti-Semitism? Is -- this is just not a normal pattern of conduct if you're truly being a true arbiter.The problem they have is, is they're protected by what they call Section 230, which was never intended -- the original writers of the Section 230 section that they depend on never intended for them to become an editorializing body. They expected them to be a platform in which these views are put out there. Never do they decide what is right and what is wrong. But now they're just out in the open with it and they're being fed by what has happened over the last little bit to make sure that they can actually remove competitors as well. So this is very concerning, especially with conservatives --BARTIROMO: Yes.But, you know, I mean the fact that they're out in the open with it saying, yes, we're going to continue this purge, we're going to take out conservatives. Even, as you said, the Ayatollah Khomeini is still tweeting. He's on Twitter saying death to America and that's still there. But the fact that they are out in the open with it, clearly admitting that they are taking a side, they are not bulletin boards, as was the case and the expectation back when Section 230 was put in the Telecommunications Act in 1996, which protects them from lawsuits.Shouldn't 230 be rolled back at this point? They're admitting it where we're taking a side, we're not a bulletin board. So, wouldn't that be enough to move this ball forward in the Congress?COLLINS: It should be. Look, for those on the left or the Democrats who think that what's happening right now is good, let me just warn you, everything goes in a cycle here and for now what Twitter believes to be wrong, what happens in six months if they believe that the other side is wrong and they get that arbiter.Let me just say this, though, Section 230 needs to be removed. They need (INAUDIBLE) platform.But let me also say this. Section 230 also provides the outlet to actually go after Twitter and these others right now because it does not protect editorializing. It does not protect -- it does not get into slander liable laws. It does not get into that area. Sections 230 was there to protect a platform such as Twitter, FaceBook or others from people who comment or from others in which they're not censoring or they're not editorializing. When they take the step over to become a news agency, and that's what they've done, then they have taken themselves out of 230.I'm of the opinion that the Department of Justice and others could actually go after them under the current Section 230 because they're not covered by that under the actions that they're doing.BARTIROMO: Yes, it's a great point.Dagen McDowell, jump in here.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: Doug, I had that very conversation with some folks over the weekend about now that they've kind of -- that some of these tech companies, Twitter and the like, have broken that wall, and they've revealed that they are deciding who can be on the platform and who can't, that it's not -- that they are editorial entities, if you will, that that Section 230 does not cover them in the broad way that you might expect.That being said, do you think that these tech companies are kind of playing a little game with the Democrats who are now in control, in power in the House and the Senate and the White House of like, oh, we'll sensor as long as you don't role back completely that Section 230 protection?COLLINS: Dagen, I think you're exactly seeing -- look, this -- this admission by Twitter is not the first one. Remember the videos that we have from Google. Remember the outrage of the last election. This has been going on for a while. It's just been doing it undercover.But you make a great point. And this is something I want to continue to bring out because I received a call about a year and a half ago from one of the authors of that -- one of the authors that actually had put in Section 230, who was a member of Congress at the time, and they were furious. They were saying, this is not what this section's about and that the DOJ could go after them right now.So this -- let's take a new (INAUDIBLE) obviously look at what they're doing, and that is trying to soften their image with the Democrats who are now in control, but yet they're censoring conservative speech. We should not be allowed -- now, speech that is -- that is out of the realm of hateful and terroristic, those are things that we -- none of us agree with and those also have their place outside of this focus. We've already had that in the normal dialogue.But this is an area in which they have just decided that if you believe differently than we do, we're going to take you off of our platform. And that is when they have become just like Fox or CBS other any of the other major networks because they have become an entity in which they are news publications.Let's don't call them platforms. Let's call them what they are. They've become news agencies and information department (ph).BARTIROMO: Yes. Yes, that's right. And they are creators of content.COLLINS: Yes.BARTIROMO: That is completely against what Section 230 was supposed to be.I want to switch gears, Doug. I want to ask you about rolling back President Trump's policies. We know all the success President Trump had. But Joe Biden is planning to take immediate action on executive actions following his inauguration tomorrow.Here's what Lindsey Graham told me -- his transition team outlined plans to rejoin the Paris climate change agreement, extended eviction and foreclosure restrictions, end the travel ban on majority Muslim countries, asking Congress to offer legal status to an estimated 11 million people. These are the executive orders that we're hearing he will take from his aides.Here's what Lindsey Graham told me on "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES" about the Biden and the incoming administration's priorities.Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): They're going to roll back border security at the border and you see the caravans beginning to form now. They're going to raise your taxes. They're going to impose regulations on the economy. They're going to try to make D.C. a state. They're going to try to implement parts of the green new deal and Medicare for all through budget reconciliation.I've got a fight on my hands.Here's what I think Republicans need to do, work with Biden where we can, maybe on infrastructure, but fight like hell turning America into a socialized nation.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: What do you think, Congressman? I mean I know you're hoping the new administration turns their attention to major bipartisan issues, but you heard what Lindsey Graham said.COLLINS: Yes, they're not. I mean, look, he's got a -- he's got to spend at least the first part of his days, you know, doing what he calls is the reversal of the Trump era.The problem is, is the Trump era, especially on border control and other things like that, actually was good, you know, for our border. We're seeing a shutdown. And we're seeing what is really concerning to me, especially on that immigration front. You're already seeing the caravan coming forward. We've relived this nightmare before. This is -- this is something that we knew. And the -- and the constriction at the border to where we could actually make a safe, secure effort (ph), where you're not sending people and giving them false hope is something that we need to -- everybody in America needed to be aware of.So it's really concerning that you're going off, it seems like, really far on this -- this darn left -- this turn to a leftward bent up front. But if he really, truly wants to get anything done and have lasting impact that doesn't hurt the country. And that's where I believe this immigration policy, I believe this climate policy and others will actually hurt our country. Then you'll have to turn back to the realities that he has a very narrow window in Congress, he has a very narrow majority and one in which that I don't think the American people are going to stand for.BARTIROMO: Yes.COLLINS: But it is concerning to see this concern, especially at the border. As somebody whose dealt with that border situation, this is not good and people need to understand, it's not fair to raise those poor people's hopes in middle central America that if they leave everything they can automatically be grand a full life in America. And he knows that's not true.BARTIROMO: Yes.COLLINS: And that's false hope.BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, look, the higher taxes as well. Kamala Harris said her number one priority when she gets in office is going to be to reverse Donald Trump's tax cut plan. We'll see what that does to the economy. So, of course, we're going to be watching all of this in the coming couple years.Doug Collins, good to see you this morning. Thank you, sir.We will be right back.COLLINS: Great to see you all.BARTIROMO: Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Well, welcome back. We've got a pretty good rally underway this morning on Wall Street. Take a look. Dow Industrials up 200 points right now, Nasdaq up 101 and the S&P higher by 26. Global markets starting 2021 on a strong note as investors are looking toward a potential pandemic end with vaccine distribution.One of the big star of the previous year certainly were SPACs, that is special purpose acquisition companies, raising over $70 billion in 2020.My next guest is at the helm of Golden Falcon Acquisition, a SPAC that focuses on fintech companies. Last month Golden Falcon raised its IPO cost to $300 million. It has been a great success.Joining me right now is the CEO of Goldman Falcon Acquisition Corp, CEO Makram Azar.Makram, it's great to see you this morning. Thanks very much for being here.You know, we're getting a lot of bank earnings out this morning, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs. And, of course, we're focused on those capital markets. One of the things that really drove capital markets was SPACs and IPOs.Tell me about capital markets action and what you've seen in that regard.MAKRAM AZAR, CEO, GOLDEN FALCON ACQUISITION CORP.: Good morning, Maria. Thanks for having me on your show. It's good to see you.Yes, the capital markets have been really, really strong at the back end of last year and they continued so far this year. Particularly in stocks, as you probably noticed, there were 53 SPACs raised in the first couple weeks of January, which is over 20 percent of all the SPACs raised last year, which was a record in itself. There were 84 billion actually raised last year in SPACs, there were already 15 billion raised so far in January.So, tremendous, you know, demand continues to go into the SPAC space. And that's really driving the market on the SPAC side.TMT -- actually I'm not only focused on fintech, but also TMT has been a huge beneficiary of that. As you probably saw last year, there were 19 tractions in TMT, 19 SPACs actually, and around 15 billion done in terms of deals in the TMT space on your side of the Atlantic.What we are doing is we're focusing actually on this side of the Atlantic, in Europe, where there's only a fraction of the number of SPACs looking for deals here, only three or four. We're one of them. We're the first mover in TMT and fintech. And while it's a bit overcrowded in the U.S. now, you have over 270 SPACs looking for deals, it's really virgin territory here in Europe while, you know, there are tremendous opportunities, great European champions that would deserve to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and that's what we want to offer them.So the market continues to be very, very strong.BARTIROMO: Yes. The -- the -- yes.AZAR: Go ahead.BARTIROMO: This is a great point that you're making and I'm glad you brought up TMT. I know you know a lot about TMT, that's telecom, media and technology. You've worked in that -- on those industries many -- for much of your career.Looking at fintech, looking at TMT, Makram, do you think the valuations are getting ahead? I mean, look, TMT, certainly technology has been the best performing industry for over a year now. Are you worried that valuations are getting away from you, getting too expensive?AZAR: Yes, no, not yet if you compare it, for example, this time to the end of the '90s, early 2000s, we're still very far away from those valuations. I think the earnings this time around are much stronger. You know, a lot of companies in the TMT space are benefiting from the pandemic. You know, the work from home phenomenon, sort of the media companies, with their streaming services, et cetera, all of that is benefiting TMT companies. And I think, you know, the valuations are going high, but they're still --BARTIROMO: Yes.AZAR: You know, much lower than we've seen in the past. And I think, you know, it's warranted. The valuations for that sector is still warranted given the backdrop of the pandemic and having winds in their (INAUDIBLE).BARTIROMO: Makram, we've got to jump. But, real quick, does the European economy feel better to you, the ECB meeting this week, real quick, Makram, we only have a couple of seconds.AZAR: It's not starting super well, but I think it's looking much better in the second quarter. The U.K. has vaccinated four million people. They're on a track to vaccinate 15 million by the middle of February. So a quarter of the adult population.BARTIROMO: OK.AZAR: I think we -- we're looking up for Q2, but it's starting a little bit slow because of the (INAUDIBLE).BARTIROMO: OK. I see.Makram, it's great to see you this morning, sir, thank you.Makram Azar.We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Katie Couric taking sides, facing backlash over comments she made about President Trump and his supporters.Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KATIE COURIC: I also think some of them are believing the garbage that they are being fed 24/7 on the Internet, by their constituents --BILL MAHER, HOST, "REAL TIME WITH BILL MAHER": Yes.COURIC: And they bought into this big lie. And the question is, how are we going to really almost deprogram these people who have signed up for the cult of Trump.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: Wow!Dagen McDowell, deprogram people is what Katie Couric is saying. And their new thing is calling it the big lie. No mention of the real big lie of Russia collusion that we were fed for four years. Your reaction?MCDOWELL: Those people on -- in -- on the left, in the media are one of the reasons that people don't trust what anyone has to say because the lies they were told year after year literally over decades. And so it -- that would be laughable what Katie Couric said if it was so doggone frightening because what you're seeing, it's not just the dismissal of the way that -- the reason that what 74 million Americans voted for President Trump, was it for his policies, because, again, you now see the left in coordination with big technology companies, Apple, Google, Amazon, and Twitter, censoring people. So where does it end?Do these people on the left, these liberal media elites, do they think that they should basically be in control of thought? That they should be in control of all of our speech? Because I've said this before and Sim Strassel wrote about it on Friday, now that it looks like these big tech companies, these monopolies, are working in coordination with the government, or even at the -- a direction of people in the government, they now open themselves up to major lawsuits, on constitutional grounds, on antitrust grounds. So where does it end?I'm glad Katie Couric has the -- the high ground here. Maybe she should, you know, start the church of -- church of Katie.BARTIROMO: Well, it's just unbelieve to me that anybody could speak like this in America, with the freedoms that we enjoy, and the special country that this is in terms of independence on freedom, to actually say you want to reprogram people and eliminate anybody for their thoughts and their beliefs. It's actually quite extraordinary.MCDOWELL: Yes, and she's -- and she's talking about anyone who voted for Trump as if they're in a cult. And she believes it clearly. I don't think that she was trying to be clever.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: But who's going to --BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: Who's really going to be in control of all of our speech and our thoughts? Who's going to police -- who's going to tell us what we ought to think and say and believe --BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: And read? Because, remember, those Trump -- we heard this before, all of those Trump voters, they were racist, bigot, Nazi, hayseed (ph), red neck, deplorables, bitterly clinging to their guns and Bibles.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: We've heard it all before. But now this has taken another step where it puts our First Amendment rights in danger, freedom of speech in danger.BARTIROMO: Yes. And they're doing it by capturing one phrase, calling it the big lie, as if it's a lie that we saw irregularities in the election, which is not. And the real big lie was Russia collusion for four years. And we have not seen any mea culpas from all of these news organizations, quote/unquote, that have told us for four years that Trump colluded with Russia and actually Congress missed the entire China threat.Mark Matson, your thought, real quick before we go to a break.MARK MATSON, PRESIDENT AND CEO, MATSON MONEY: Yes, Maria, this is reminiscent of George Orwell's 1984. And it's un-American at its core. America's about free speech. It's about the freedom of the press and freedom of thought. And they're trying to shut down (INAUDIBLE). They're actually trying to brainwash people, deprogramming them, means you have to brainwash them into something else, and it's absolutely deplorable and -- from every American that loves freedom of speech and freedom of thought, we should -- you know, do what Martin Luther King did, we should peacefully, you know, demonstrate and let it be known. And through peaceful resistance. This is -- this is America. This isn't -- this isn't Russia.BARTIROMO: Yes.MATSON: Totalitarian is Russia or China.MCDOWELL: The -- the left --BARTIROMO: Well, it's not --MCDOWELL: The left is acting like that their speech will never get censured.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: And as we all know, the reason you heard from Angela Merkel, because eventually they come for you. Now is the time for everyone to stand up for speech that they dislike, even hate, because that is what America is built on, a freedom of expression and a freedom of speech.BARTIROMO: Right. Yes, and I'll say this once more, where's Jack Ma? A lot of people are wondering where he is and some people believe he is in some kind of a reeducation camp, a reeducation place where he is getting educated about embracing authority. That feels a lot more like communist China than America what you just heard from Katie Couric.We're going to take a break.When we come back, Trump 2020 campaign senior adviser Mercedes Schlapp has a thing or two to say about that as well. She'll also discuss President Trump's legacy and what policies Joe Biden is already looking to reverse.Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Tesla has begun delivery of its China made Model Y.Cheryl Casone with the details right now.Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that's right, Maria, the milestone coming after the company broke ground on its Shanghai factory just two years ago. It now has the capacity to build half a million cars per year at this facility. Billing the vehicles locally in China allows Tesla to avoid shipping costs and import duties. The Chinese government has set the ambitious goal of having electric vehicles account for 20 percent of all auto sales by 2025.Let's take a look at the stock in the pre-market. It's slightly pulled back just a bit, but still up about 1.5 percent.First Lady Melania Trump yesterday released a good-bye message ahead of tomorrow's departure from the White House.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MELANIA TRUMP, FIRST LADY: My fellow Americans, it has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as first lady of the United States.I ask every American to be an ambassador of Be Best, to focus on what unites us, to raise above what divides us, to always choose love over hatred, peace over violence, and others before yourself.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: And as you heard, she mentioned her Be Best initiative and she also talked about her work with veterans.Well, anyone who was looking to get an early tax refund and pay off some bills, you might be out of luck. The IRS says it is delaying the start of the 2021 tax season until February 12th. The IRS also urging Americans to file their taxes electronically this year as the agency deals with the backlog of nearly 7 million unprocessed paper returns, Maria, from last year.And those are your headlines.Back to you.BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl, thank you so much.Meanwhile, this. Thousands of Honduran migrants headed toward the United States border and the incoming administration telling them now is not the time to come to the United States because they will not immediately get into the country.This as Joe Biden is planning to unveil a sweeping immigration bill tomorrow, providing an eight year path to citizenship for an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants.Joining me right now is former senior adviser to the Trump 2020 campaign, former White House senior adviser for strategic communicates, and Republican strategist, Mercedes Schlapp.Mercedes, it's good to see you this morning. Happy New Year to you. Thanks for being here.MERCEDES SCHLAPP, FORMER TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN SENIOR ADVISER: Great to see you, too, Maria. Happy New Year.BARTIROMO: So your reaction to what we will see from the incoming administration. Joe Biden wants to make that citizenship real for the DACA recipients.SCHLAPP: Well, quite frankly, I think what you're seeing is the taking down of the America first policy that President Trump championed, and moving towards an America last policy. And so, in essence, I think, that when you see Joe Biden, for example, making the decision to not move forward with the pipeline, which we know would cost -- cost jobs, it would lead to less energy independence here in the United States, when you see Joe Biden taking actions, for example, in this sweeping immigration legislation that he's putting forward, which I'm sure will not include border security components to it. Something that President Trump and our administration did do.We tried for a long time to work with Democrats to help come up with a comprehensive immigration bill that would include border security, as well as resolve the issue of the DACA recipients. But now you're talking about legalizing 11 million, which sends a direct signal to the countries in central America, to Guatemala, Honduras. You're already seeing the caravans coming our way because they're saying Joe Biden needs to keep his promises that when we get to the United States, let the floodgates open.BARTIROMO: What other policies do you think that an incoming administration is going to look at to reverse that you find most problematic? I mean we've talked a lot about President Trump's stance on China, the U.S.-China policy is something certainly we are going to be focused on very much, knowing what we know now about China. But what other policies do you wonder or question and worry about that could reverse course?SCHLAPP: Well, I think one of his first actions as well is rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement, which, as we know, is incredibly problematic. We've seen research in cases where you would lose jobs here in America because of signing the Paris Climate Accords. As we know, this is a bailout to China, it's a bailout to India. They want -- India, for example, wants billions and billions of dollars in foreign aid in order to make changes to reduce carbon emissions. China, for example, they don't have to comply with the Paris Climate Accords. That's problematic because at the end of the day we are paying more than our fair share, once again putting the United States in a position that it's all about globalism, not about taking care of American workers here in the United States.I think that's incredibly problematic, Maria. You're already starting to see these dictators, for example, in -- the dictator in North Korea basically saying that we're going to continue with missile testing. We'll see Iran again feel very emboldened to threaten Israel. Why? Because we know that there's weak leadership in America. They know there's weak leadership in America and they're going to take advantage of it, including China.BARTIROMO: What about what we're doing and what we're seeing in terms of big tech, Mercedes. Senator Josh Hawley has found a new publisher for his book after Simon & Schuster just dropped him following the assault on the Capitol.Mercedes, your reaction to what we're seeing with Twitter not only banning President Trump, but saying this is going to go on a long time. They're going to be purging anybody they don't agree with, frankly. And then you've got somebody like a Senator Hawley, Senator Cruz, who simply wanted an investigation into the irregularities that occurred on election night.SCHLAPP: Yes. And let's remember that it was Democrats back in 2000, 2004, 2016 where you had Democrats object to the election certification. That is a legal recourse. That's a legal process that these senators and house members are able to bring up. They are able to object to these election certification.BARTIROMO: Right.SCHLAPP: For the Democrats, they've made it a point to try to bully, to force these members to resign. That in and of itself is undemocratic. It's not what our system is made up to do.Ted Cruz, Josh Hawley, these House members, they all have the right to object and bring up these questions.The biggest concern I have is when big tech and other, I would say, leftist media outlets are basically saying you can't even bring up the word "election fraud," you can't bring up the word "voting irregularities."BARTIROMO: Yes.SCHLAPP: As Americans, we have every right to ask questions, to inquire about the election integrity --BARTIROMO: Yes.SCHLAPP: And try to resolve these issues that we see are very problematic in some of these states.BARTIROMO: Yes.SCHLAPP: Unfortunately, as conservatives, as Republicans, we are being silenced. It starts with Donald Trump. It will end with the everyday American who simply want to have their voices heard.BARTIROMO: Yes. Like I keep saying, this is more reminiscent of communist China than anything else.Alan Dershowitz was with me on Sunday. He said he will represent any Harvard alum who gets their degree revoked. Harvard -- there are some groups at Harvard saying, we're going to -- we're going to, you know, take back your degree if you had anything to do with President Trump.You, yourselves, may very well feel it. Former communication staffers of the president reportedly facing difficulty getting jobs after leaving the White House. Is there any truth to that, Mercedes?SCHLAPP: You know, I -- fortunately for us, many of our campaign staffers, they've been able to get jobs. They're very talented young men and women. Those who worked very hard for this president, both in the administration and also on the campaign trail, at the end of the day, the corporations are making a big mistake if they're going to be targeting Trump officials. These men and women sacrificed their time. They honorably served our nation. They put an agenda that really helped Americans prosper. They put an agenda in place that made it tough -- and being tough against China.BARTIROMO: Yes.SCHLAPP: There is some really great work that we've done. Sadly, I would say, that those two hours in the Capitol, those thugs basically destroyed the legacy and much of the work that we've done. So we're going to make sure that we're able to talk about the president's accomplishment and also bring to light what this leftist agenda that Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and these Democrats Senate leaders are going to push forward in the next four years, which I think is going to be very problematic and a wake-up call to Americans.BARTIROMO: What do you want to say, real quick, only a couple seconds here, what do you want to say about President Trump's legacy, Mercedes.SCHLAPP: Look, I'm proud that I worked in his administration. I also worked on his campaign. One thing about President Trump is that he taught us to be fighters. He talked about the importance of it is about America first, it is about American workers and American families.BARTIROMO: Yes.SCHLAPP: That we have the opportunity to succeed. We want to keep America strong and we are not going to bow down to the globalist tides that we're going to see moving forward under a Biden administration. And for -- first and foremost, we must continue to protect our First Amendment. We must continue to ensure that we are able to speak freely and not be censored by big tech.BARTIROMO: Absolutely.Mercedes, it's good to see you this morning. We, of course, will keep a spotlight on all of this.SCHLAPP: Good to see you.BARTIROMO: Mercedes Schlapp joining us there.Coming up, the future of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, now in the hands of the incoming administration. Will shareholders ever get paid? We'll discuss that and the banking sector overall when we come back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Well, the largest originators of mortgages, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, what is the future? The Trump administration is leaving their fate now to the incoming Biden administration. The last minute moves will allow Fannie and Freddie to retain more capital but will fall short of reprivatizing these companies and paying shareholders who lost everything under the Obama administration.Joining me right now is American Continental Group Analytics Managing Partner David Metzner.David, it's great to have you this morning. Thanks very much for joining us.What is your view of where Fannie and Freddie are right now and whether or not they will ever go back to being shareholder owned and public companies as opposed to being government sponsored entities?DAVID METZNER, MANAGING PARTNER, ACG ANALYTICS: Thank you, Maria, for having me here today.I have to say, it is amazing that the Trump administration could restructure the Middle East but could not restructure the GSEs. I mean that -- that is a footnote in their total control and power over the GSEs.This -- this last letter agreement that Secretary Mnuchin signed with the regulator has left a lot of people unhappy. As you said, shareholders are unhappy. But also the progressive housing groups are unhappy. And the National Realtors are unhappy.And, really, the three interests are aligned. And until -- the criticism originates in the fact that until government is recognized as being paid back, the balance sheets of Fannie and Freddie will not be built (ph) capital for 11 years. And what that means is, there won't be access to the kind of housing that America needs.And when the risk is on the taxpayers, Fannie and Freddie act conservatively and don't take risk. And so until the -- until the shareholders are able to recognize the value of their shares, the enterprises will not be able to raise the kind of capital they need to take on more risk and protect the taxpayers.BARTIROMO: Well, let's not forget what took place here. Under the -- under President Obama, the Obama administration took money from Fannie and Freddie and used it for other things, like Obamacare. And shareholders of Fannie and Freddie feel like they were robbed. They want to be paid and they feel that they should be private companies again. Has the incoming administration said anything about this? Are you expecting any change?METZNER: Well, it has -- has -- no, I'm not. I think this document that we saw last week is very, very curious. I think the next steps we're going to see -- the document encourages a settlement because while it lets it -- it lets the enterprises rebuild capital, they're all -- they also rebuild their so-called liquidation preference, which is their senior preferred shares. That means there's not an incentive for the private sector to contribute more capital to the restructuring.The key element we're looking for over the next few months, the Supreme Court will rule in Collins v Mnuchin. We think that the shareholders will be vindicated in early May in that ruling and that the government shares will be deemed paid back and there will be a negotiated settlement where the shareholders will see their stakes restored to their proper value and will be able to participate --BARTIROMO: OK.METZNER: Will be able to participate in the restructuring.BARTIROMO: All right.Real quick, David, before you go. We are watching bank earnings all morning this morning. What's your take on the industry right here? Charles Schwab just reported. Goldman Sachs better than expected. Anything to say about financials in general, David, real quick?METZNER: I just want to say that it's a great time to be in the banking business. You know, that is your partner. You have huge stimulus coming into consumers. I would be, you know, I -- I'm looking for them to do over -- overperform and outperform analysts' expectations due to the great -- due to the help of the fed and the help of the stimulus package.BARTIROMO: OK. Right. OK.David, it's good to see you this morning. Thank you, sir.David Metzner.We'll be right back. Stay with us. With the buzz right after this.BARTIROMO: Well, welcome back.It is time for the "Morning Buzz." Getting up close to dinosaurs from the safety of your car? The Jurassic Qwest Exhibition at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, is featuring over 70 prehistoric creatures, some as large as 50 feet.Dagen, through the pandemic we are seeing more and more experiences involving cars. You got drive-in movies, concerts, political rallies. Now dinosaurs. You can even get COVID tested in a drive through.MCDOWELL: I love this. If I was in Cali, I would certainly go out in Pasadena at the Rose Bowl. It's kind of a traveling show. But you see that? There's an individual -- a human wearing what appears to be a velociraptor costume. I would love to have that in New York City. Can you -- you know, you can't defend yourself in the street, but if you're -- if you're crazy enough, people will run away from you. I think that velociraptor costume might do it.BARTIROMO: Mark.MATSON: Well, who doesn't love dinosaurs. I have an eight-year-old and a four-year-old and we would definitely do the tour back to the Jurassic through -- with our car. You know, but it's also an interesting analogy for investors, because, you know, the future is largely random and unpredictable.BARTIROMO: Yes.MATSON: And so investors should lay off of trying to predict it. And if you don't believe me, the dinosaurs were wiped out by an asteroid, ask them.Load-Date: January 19, 2021End of Document

CSIS: 'Vaccine Diplomacy Is Biden's First Test in Southeast Asia'Targeted News ServiceJanuary 29, 2021 Friday 9:00 AM  ESTCopyright 2021 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1091 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Center for Strategic and International Studies issued the following commentary by Gregory B. Poling, senior fellow for Southeast Asia and director of the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative, and Simon Tran Hudes, research associate for the CSIS Southeast Asia Program, entitled "Vaccine Diplomacy Is Biden's First Test in Southeast Asia":* * *Southeast Asian nations continue to seek help from international partners to cope with the coronavirus pandemic, particularly in securing access to vaccines. China is eagerly answering the call. The United States, by contrast, has been a non-factor in the region's early vaccine diplomacy. This absence fuels a false narrative that a battered and insular United States cannot help lead the world out of this crisis. It also heightens fears that some Southeast Asian governments could find Chinese vaccines their only options, at least for a while, and that Beijing might take advantage of this fact to demand onerous political or economic concessions.From January 11 to 16, Foreign Minister Wang Yi of China toured four countries in the region: Myanmar, Indonesia, Brunei, and the Philippines. Since October, he has visited every country in Southeast Asia except Vietnam. At each of his stops, Wang coupled promises of Chinese vaccine access with other foreign policy priorities, including advancing major projects under China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which have been stalled amid the pandemic.In his visit to the Philippines, Wang promised half a million doses of Covid-19 vaccines along with $1.3 billion in loans and $77 million in grants for infrastructure projects. China has pledged billions of dollars for infrastructure investment in the Philippines since President Rodrigo Duterte came to office in 2016, but almost none of those projects have gotten off the ground.In Indonesia, Wang reaffirmed Beijing's commitment to help Indonesia become a manufacturing hub for Chinese vaccines. Indonesia has already received 3 million doses of the Chinese-made Sinovac vaccine and enough raw materials to produce 15 million more. During his visit, Wang signaled China's readiness to speed up completion of the Jakarta-Bandung high speed railway, a landmark BRI project. Wang also came away with an initial agreement on internet security and technology cooperation.In Myanmar, Wang promised to provide 300,000 doses of coronavirus vaccine. The day before his visit, Myanmar and China agreed to conduct a feasibility study on a railway project linking Mandalay with the port of Kyaukphyu, which is being developed by China. The railway is a critical component of an envisioned China-Myanmar Economic Corridor connecting Yunnan Province to the Indian Ocean by road, rail, and pipeline.This diplomatic push by China, coming just days before Joe Biden was inaugurated as president on January 20, seemed in part timed to preempt any shifts in U.S. policy toward Southeast Asia. It certainly helped remind regional governments that Beijing has an outsized role to play in their early access to vaccines. The same is true of infrastructure investment, which is of particular importance to governments struggling to jumpstart economies devastated by the pandemic.Southeast Asia does have alternative vaccine options, but those are proving harder to come by. Most governments in the region are pursuing a diverse supply, both to ensure sufficient doses as quickly as possible and to avoid the political pitfalls of overreliance on Beijing. The Philippines recently approved emergency use of Pfizer's vaccine (though it has not actually secured any doses) and finalized deals for 50 million doses of U.S.-developed vaccines from Novavax and Moderna, 30 million of India's Covavax, and 20 million doses of UK-based AstraZeneca's vaccine. The story is similar in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. Vietnam, Singapore, and Thailand are further hedging their bets by developing domestic vaccines. Vietnam, the furthest along, has two candidates. Its Nanocovax vaccine may be ready to deliver to the general public in the second half of 2021, while Covivac is slated to begin stage one trials next month. But with the United States, Europe, and other wealthy countries claiming the lion's share of preorders for Pfizer and Moderna, Sinovac is the first vaccine to get into arms in most of Southeast Asia, likely to be followed by AstraZeneca.Washington cannot dictate where private U.S. companies should sell vaccines. And with the coronavirus pandemic raging at home, the Biden administration must focus on addressing domestic needs first. That gives China a significant advantage in the emerging "vaccine diplomacy" that will color the next phase of competition for influence in the region. But publics across Southeast Asia evince a strong preference for U.S. and European vaccines, especially since the news that Sinovac trials in Brazil showed an efficacy of just 50.4 percent. Johnson & Johnson's forthcoming single-shot vaccine can be stored at normal refrigeration temperatures and, assuming sufficient efficacy, offers great promise for vaccination efforts beyond urban centers.In a very positive sign, Secretary of State Antony Blinken has committed to support the World Health Organization-led COVAX facility, which will help purchase and distribute vaccines to developing countries. The U.S. government could also support regional efforts like the Asian Development Bank's Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility (APVAX). Southeast Asian governments will need access to all the options on the table, and many still in development, to overcome Covid-19 without falling into an unhealthy overreliance on China's goodwill.China may have been first out of the gate in much of Southeast Asia, but the region's vaccination campaigns will require years of support from international partners. The United States, alongside Australia, India, Japan, and Europe, can and should play a leading role. For Washington, that means supporting global and regional vaccination efforts like COVAX and APVAX while prepping direct support programs to launch when the United States has overcome the crisis at home. By doing so, the Biden administration can kill two birds with one stone. It can reassert U.S. international leadership by delivering public goods to partners in need. And it can ensure Southeast Asian governments have the leverage to say "no" if Beijing makes vaccine access dependent on other concessions.[Category: Political][Category: ThinkTank1]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7367923 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: January 29, 2021End of Document

We must make time to understand international injusticeThe California Aggie: University of California, DavisFebruary 19, 2021 FridayUniversity WireCopyright 2021 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: OPINION; Pg. 1Length: 913 wordsBodyStaying informed on other countries' affairs is as important as knowing about those in your home countryFor most of us, life hasn't felt quite right for some time-we have a global pandemic to thank for that, not to mention relentless updates on former President Donald Trump, from insurrection to impeachment. But the chaos of the current moment extends beyond COVID-19, and beyond the US. If you've recently read the news or been online, you've likely seen an article, or at the very least an Instagram post, about the adversities being faced in several countries right now.In India, farmers are protesting against recent legislation that deregulates the agricultural sector. The government is minimizing its role, easing protections and leaving farmers vulnerable to exploitation by corporations who would end up with more control over the market. As protests turned violent in January, the state shut off the internet in several areas, preventing activists from communicating with each other and the rest of the world. The protests, which began at a smaller scale in August-eventually leading to the largest protest in modern history in November-continue today, not only in India, but worldwide.Nearby, Myanmar's democratically-elected leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, is on house arrest after a military coup. The military, who happens to have backed Suu Kyi's opposition in the election, cites unproven claims of fraudulent voting as their reason for taking control of the state. Anti-coup protests have remained peaceful, but there is worry that protests will turn violent as the coup persists and activists and democratic officials urge civilians to "gather in millions" to fight for democracy.And in China, Uighurs, an ethnic minority in the country, have been forced into concentration camps since 2014. The Chinese government has built hundreds of so-called "re-education" camps where Uighurs are being interned and indoctrinated, supposedly to crack down on terrorism in the area. Reports of mass sterilization of Uighur women and other inhumane treatment in the camps led the U.S. to accuse China of genocide in January, but the government has made no apparent effort to stop maliciously repressing Uighurs while the world watches.These are some of the biggest international events being reported on right now-if this is the first you're hearing of any of them, it might be time for a Google search or two. But even for those of us who recognize these stories, how much do we actually know? Do we just read headlines? Do we keep up to date on developments? Are we discussing with peers?Many of us make time to understand what's happening in the U.S., but not everyone treats world news with the same significance. The events discussed above and those of similar importance in other countries, may seem disconnected from your life or your community. But there is more similarity between the news in the U.S. and that of countries across the globe than you might think.In India, farmers and Indians of other professions and varying social classes are coming together to protest an unfair system that will favor rich corporations at the expense of already underserved farmworkers. They are standing up against systematic mistreatment of people in their country-not so different from Black Lives Matter protests in the U.S., where the Black community and allies are fighting against police brutality and other social injustices faced by Black Americans.And in Myanmar, false claims of voting fraud have proven to be a real threat to their democracy. Not long ago, our former president fabricated similar allegations which led to several baseless court cases attempting to overturn the results and, despite what the Senate votes indicate, unprecedented civil unrest. Although U.S. civilians remain in power, some consider the incidents of the past few months to be evidence of the decline of American democracy.But regardless of how close to home these events might be, they should matter to us. While there are currently no internment camps in the U.S., Uighurs in China deserve our attention and our anger-if genocide was happening so publicly in our country, we would want other nations to be aware, and where possible, take action.Even if we do care about international news, it's not necessarily our fault for not knowing what's going on all the time-we are so barraged with new information about the state of affairs in the U.S. alone that it can be difficult to keep tabs on other nations. And to a certain extent, the media controls what news we see and how often we see it. But it is our responsibility to seek out important information whether it's handed to us or not, global press included.That being said, the news can take its toll. That is why it is vital to consume media consciously-not only by not believing everything you see and doing your own research beyond an Instagram graphic, but by choosing when and what you catch up on. It's ok to log off when you need a break. When you return, however, don't just skim news notifications. Read the whole article, click on the hyperlink or listen to a podcast.As college students, The Editorial Board understands that the second new information comes to light isn't always when you have free time to dig into another country's complex government policies or social issues. But we also believe that if you care about something, you make time for it. And you should care about injustice.Written by: The Editorial BoardLoad-Date: February 23, 2021End of Document

Jack Ma, founder of Alibaba, reappears with video message 3 months laterCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 20, 2021 WednesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 980 wordsBodySome said he was in custody; others, who simply kept quiet. Either way, Alibaba's founding billionaire, Jack Ma, was "missing" 88 days to thisday, which had fueled speculation about his whereabouts behind his frictions with the Chinese government.The entrepreneur recorded a speech, published today by the local press, in which he greets a hundred rural teachers from the Asian country selected for an award given by his foundation, to which he assures that "whenthe epidemic is over, we will meet again."In the video, posted on the portal of a newspaper in his native province, Zhejiang (east), Ma makes no mention of his situation, although he does claim that in "the last six months" - a period that includes the nearly three months he has been away from the spotlight - he has remained "active", participating in the process of selecting teachers for the award.Ma had measured during the last two decades under Beijing, which favored the development of the digital economy and allowed the sector to grow without too many regulations.He managed to become The Richest Man in China and elevated his conglomerate - focused mainly on e-commerce - to the category of giant, with a valuation of about $700 billion.In recent months, however, his apparent status as untouchable appears to have faded, not only given as the great visible face of private sector development in the Asian giant but also as a member of the Communist Party ( PCCh).#Alibaba founder Jack Ma Yun @JackMa, the English teacher turned entrepreneur, met with 100 rural teachers from across the country via video link on Wednesday. "We'll meet again after the [COVID-19] epidemic is over," he said to them: report pic.twitter.com/oj2JQqZGnI— Global Times (@globaltimesnews) January 20, 2021ANT, CAUSING ITS FRICTIONS WITH BEIJING The reason for the end of his good tune with Beijing seems to have a name: Ant Group, Alibaba's 'fintech',in which Ma holds no executive position but of which he is the top shareholder.The company, operator of Alipay, China's most widely used electronic payments platform, was to star in the largest IBRO in history in November 2020, but 36 hours before its stock market debut Chinese regulators forced it to suspend it after publishing the draft of much more restrictive regulations for the sector.Days earlier, Ma had given a controversial speech in which he was highly critical of Beijing's strategy of minimizing risks in the financial system and with traditional banks, which he said continue to be managed as "pawnshops."That was the last time, to this day, that the billionaire appeared publicly.Since then, despite Ma and Ant's apparent attempts to calm the waters, regulators and the official press have repeatedly criticized the way the sector operates, ensuring that it tricks young people into over-indebtedness or shielding behind the concepts of innovation and technology to enter the banking business without subjecting the regulations they are to comply with.Some experts speculated on the possibility that Ma would already know the content of that newregulation and that he was trying to force a renegotiation of terms through public criticism, something not overly common in such a high-profile figure in China.The entrepreneur was not only known for his corporate activity or for his multiple lectures but for his predilection for cameras, having recorded his own kung fu movie or appeared on a stage disguised as Michael Jackson during a company event.Alibaba Group founder Jack Ma made his first public appearance since October in an online video praising China's teachers https://t.co/dXtAcj0iKD pic.twitter.com/bEdThNl261— Reuters (@Reuters) January 20, 2021ALIBABA SHOOTS IN THE BAG AFTER ITS REAPPEARANCE In these three months, international press and social media have speculated that Ma was in detention, that the authorities had banned him from leaving the country, and even that Beijing was planning to nationalize Alibaba, which he opened an antitrust investigation into.Rumors about Ma's whereabouts grew in November after he did not take part as a jury on the television show 'The Heroes of Business in Africa', founded by himself and in which he was replaced by another executive at the firm.In recent years, some of China's best-known figures have "disappeared" after committing crimes or having disputes with the authorities and then reappearing months later, such as the popular actress Fan Bingbing, of which nothing was known for several months in 2018 following a tax evasion case.However, last week, sources aware of the situation had explained to Efe that Ma was trying to maintain a "low profile" and that he was "fine",while calling the aforementioned rumours "unfounded."Meanwhile, the official media has remained silent while other reports pointed to Beijing's alleged orders not to give further media coverage to the skies against Alibaba.On Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter, Jack Ma's reappearance was not now among the 50 most debated topics, indicating that either netizens have not given importance to the news or that, as has happened on other issues in the past, it is a deliberate action on the heavily censored social network.However, when searching for"Ma Yun"- the entrepreneur's Chinese name - there are messages and news about his return to the public arena.To whom the news did sit well is Alibaba's investors - Ma left his presidency in 2019, twenty years after founding it - whose shares lost 18% of its value since the last time it was seen and which today, after the reappearance, more than 8.5% were revalued.However, according to Bloomberg's list of billionaires, Ma is no longer China's richest man: his fortune would have been reduced by about $10 billion to $52.9 billion,now ranked fourth behind the heads of the drinking company Nongfu Spring and the tech companies Tencent and Pinduoduo, rivals of Alibaba.Load-Date: January 21, 2021End of Document

America's Sailing Cup: the naval battle of the worldCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 30, 2021 SaturdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 925 wordsBodyIn the Gulf of Hauraki, in Auckland, New Zealand, three AC 75-class sailboats, the new Formula One yachting,battle during these weeks to resolve what will be, between 6 and 23 March, the defiant of the venue (Emirates Team New Zealand) for the most coveted title of this activity: the America's Cup in its 36th. Edition. If team investments reached $50 million at the turn of the century, that figure has doubled. There are at least 150 people for each campus among its drivers, crew members and technical camp who have joined for several years to fine-knit Luna Rossa (Italy), American Magic (USA) and Ineos (Britain), all backed by futuristic technology. The AC75 class represents the return of monoheds, but with pioneering technology. It uses two huge appendages that, when lifting the 7,500 kg of the case above water, resemble the wings of an aircraft. Each team has powerful sponsors and are commanded by tycoons from their respective countries. Sophistication in the America's Cup has come from afar, since that first edition in 1851 when a Ship of the Yacht Club of New York challenged and defeated fifteen rivals, propping up by the British crown, in the waters of the Isle of Wight. The competition remained closed to Americans and The British for more than a century,until they admitted Canada's entry in 1962 and thereafter from other countries. What the Americans did not "admit" was the defeat, which they just suffered in 1983 against Australia in Newport. Since then, the America's Cup – where the winner takes the famous "Jarra of the 100 Guineas" and chooses the venue of the next edition – also added switzerland and New Zealand to his list of winners. The alleged sportsmanship of those times succumbed to constant allegationsof espionage, even a few months ago, when New Zealand unthrew out an alleged plot - kicked out several contractors – and denounced a hacker attack on its technological secrets. In 2003, Larry Ellison's Oracle was offered information (case design, navigation techniques) from his rival "One World" in exchange for $2.5 million. He was denounced. The New Zealanders achieved the first of their triumphs in 1995 and defended the Cup five years later in Auckland, the home that now returns. There they defeated the Italian "Luna Rossa", sponsored by Prada and prepared by the famous Argentine designer Germán Frers. With popularity in its country only comparable to the All Blacks, an Emirates New Zealand ship triumphed again in 2017, in Bermuda waters, defeating Oracle. Now the ship is called "Te Rehutai" and its list of sponsors has just expanded with chinese government investment through China Sports Group, in figuresnot widespread, but which can exceed $20 million. If it's investment, New Zealand – which represents the Royal NZ Yacht Squadron - is not short of anything. The team's employer is Matteo de Nora, the heir to a family empire that, from Italy, was built around the chemical industry. De Nora was born in New York City, travels with a Swiss passport and resides in Monaco but his heart is in New Zealand and sailing. He decided to bet there in 2003. "I saw from my own ship the 2003 disaster with the Swiss from Alinghi and I told myself that would never happen again, with the mast broken and several crew members falling into the water," he recalled. There he deposited $450,000, which would be the first of his investments in team New Zealand, where he currently appears as a patron alongside technical chief Grant Dalton. Also from the chemical industry comes James Martin Ratcliffe, the patronof the British team Ineos, the owner of the UK's greatest fortune. His fortune amounts to 12 billion euros, he owns 60% of the ineos petrochemical and in recent years has become one of the most renowned characters in world sport: he has the main cycling team, investments in F-1 and football, and he put together the "circus" around athlete Eliud Kipchoge in Vienna , when this was the first man to run a marathon below two hours. Ratcliffe summoned Ben Ainslie, Britain's most laureate athlete in Olympic yachting competitions, for the Ineos crew, even if it was Ainslie himself who denounced the "fracking" of one of his employer's companies. Prada and Pirelli are the main sponsors of Luna Rossa. Patrizio Bertelli – the husband of Miuccia Prada and ceo of the firm Prada - is the headof the team, based in Sicily, who will reach the final at the beginning of the century. Pirelli applied components of his tires to parts of the ship that touch the water and provide greater speed. And the United States to regain dominance of the Cup bets on the "American Magic",whose technological design was made by Airbus: its technicians work on aeronautical and hydronaval optimization, controls and even virtual reality. Enrolled by the Yacht Club of New York, such as those founding times, his bosses are two other millionaires: "John "Hap" Faut and Doug DeVos. This is President of Amway as Fauth made his fortune in the agricultural and aerospace businesses. The pandemic forced numerous adjustments in preparations – mandatory quarantine for all foreigners within the first fortnight of their arrival – but now the provisions are more relaxed and the public is allowed access to follow the regattas. If the America's Cup was ever a redoubt of tycoons who invested for a particular taste – such as Thomas Lipton, the Tea Lord in the late 19th century, it is now large corporations that surround the teams,seeking a makeover through the great global coverage and glamour that the Cup gives them.Load-Date: January 31, 2021End of Document

Fire Protection System Market to Cross $70B by 2027, Global Market Insights, Inc.; Some of the major fire protection system market players are Honeywell International, Viking Group, ENCORE FIRE PROTECTION, Viking Automatic Sprinkler Company, Victaulic, Siemens, Securiton, SCHRACK SECONET, Schneider Electric, Robert Bosch, Raytheon Technologies, NAPCO SECURITY TECHNOLOGIES and Johnson Controls International PLC.PR NewswireFebruary 24, 2021 Wednesday 5:00 AM ESTCopyright 2021 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1165 wordsDateline: SELBYVILLE, Del., Feb. 24, 2021 BodyPR NewswireGlobal Market Insights, Inc. has recently added a new report on the fire protection systems market, whichestimates the market valuation for fire protection systems will cross US $70 billion by 2027. The growing demand for wireless fire protection systems, owing to connected fire alarm systems that send alerts in real-time to smartphones and smartwatches, thereby reducing the damage to property, is driving the market growth. The rise in the development of smart buildings and homes is also propelling market growth as governments are implementing guidelines and regulations for installing fire protection systems.The fast spread of the coronavirus across the globe has affected the market negatively with a reduction in sales. Governments across the globe have restricted trade and implemented lockdowns to reduce the effect of the virus, resulting in the gradual decline in market revenues. Several market players had to briefly suspend the production of fire protection systems and components during the initial quarters of 2020.Request for a sample of this research report at https://www.gminsights.com/request-sample/detail/4951 The rise in population, increasing demand for home & building, and rising government support to enhance awareness by implementing regulations and guidelines are expected to boost the fire protection systems market. The residential segment is expected to witness growth over the forecast timeline. The rise in residential fire accidents, property damage, and loss of life is increasing the demand for fire protection systems.The fire protection systems in the Asia Pacific are expected to grow with a high CAGR during 2021 to 2027, owing to growing industrialization and urbanization in the region. Countries, such as Japan, China, and India, are implementing several building codes and guidelines for the fire safety of the structures, which is positively impacting the market.Thefire protection systems market players are emphasizing on strategic acquisitions, product launches, and partnerships to fortify their position. For instance, in June 2018, Johnson Controls launched a fire protection system in the Middle East, Autocall. This system was introduced for its application in small as well as large projects in industries including chemical and oil & gas.Some major findings in the fire protection systems market report include:Growing government regulations and standards to improve the safety of individuals and industrial, residential and commercial property during fire outbreak are increasing the installation of the fire protection systems across the sectors.Integration of AI and IoT into wireless fire detection systems to enhance the overall capability of the systems remotely is driving the market. IoT allows the connected fire alarm systems to send signals and alerts in real-time to smart devices, such as mobile phones and smartwatches, preventing fire injury and accidents, thereby increasing market growth.Increasing number of fire accidents due to lack of fire protection systems at heritage sites is propelling the demand for these fire protection systems. For instance, in 2019, National Cultural Heritage Administration (NCHA) reported around six fire accidents at heritage buildings and sites. To overcome similar issues, the Chinese government has started deploying fire protection systems as prevention measures which is positively impacting the industry growth.Some of the major players operating in the fire protection systems industry are Johnson Controls International PLC, Fire Suppression Limited, Napco Security Technologies, Schrack Seconet AG, Honeywell International Inc., Siemens AG, Robert Bosch GmbH, Halma PLC, Hochiki Corporation, Schneider Electric, and Viking Group Inc.Request for customization of this research report at https://www.gminsights.com/roc/4951Partial chapters of report table of contents (TOC):Chapter 2.

The Chinese company is following in the footsteps of Tesla (TSLA 725.90, +20.24, +2.9%), which delivered 180,570 units in the fourth quarter.Separately, shares of T-Mobile US (TMUS 131.70, -3.15, -2.3%) are down in-line with the broad market after disclosing a data breach that may have affected 200,000 customers.14:35 ETDow -509.98 at 30096.44, Nasdaq -226.80 at 12661.49, S&P -66.91 at 3689.16[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages are consolidating their modest bounce off lows at the moment; the S&P 500 (-1.78%) is the worst performer in terms of percentage losses.S&P 500 constituents Paycom Software (PAYC 425.11, -27.14, -6.00%), Stanley Black & Decker (SWK 169.11, -9.45, -5.29%), and Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG 1318.50, -68.21, -4.92%) pepper the bottom of the standings. This morning, BofA Securities downgraded SWK to Underperform (Sell equivalent) on intensifying competition and worries about its MTD Products business.Conversely, specialty apparel company L Brands (LB 39.78, +2.59, +6.96%) is one of the better-performing names today.14:00 ETDow -456.74 at 30149.68, Nasdaq -193.34 at 12694.95, S&P -56.37 at 3699.7[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages are all now separated by less than 0.1% in today's declines with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (-1.50%) and S&P 500 (-1.50%) tied at the bottom.Gold futures settled $51.50 higher (+2.7%) to $1,946.60/oz, pushing back above the $1,900 psych level as equities took a tumble to start the new year.The U.S. Dollar Index stands little changed to this point at $89.92.13:30 ETDow -499.78 at 30106.64, Nasdaq -214.46 at 12673.83, S&P -64.11 at 3691.96[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continued to pare session-worst losses in the last half hour with the DJIA (-1.63%) now down a hair less than 500 points.A look inside the Dow Jones Industrial Average shows that Coca-Cola (KO 52.41, -2.43, -4.43%), Boeing (BA 205.04, -9.02, -4.21%), and Travelers (TRV 136.16, -4.21, -3.00%) are underperforming. KO and BA are lower following morning sell side downgrades, while TRV and insurance names in general post modest losses; we'd point out that this morning, mortgage insurer Genworth Financial (GNW 2.73, -1.05, -27.78%) and China Oceanwide announced that the two parties hadn't extended their December 31, 2020 deal "end date."Conversely, pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA 41.04, +1.16, +2.91%) sits atop the index, aided by reports that Haven, the Amazon, Berkshire, JPMorgan Chase healthcare JV, would disband at the end of the month after 3 years in business.12:55 ETDow -692.89 at 29913.53, Nasdaq -323.00 at 12565.29, S&P -89.83 at 3666.24[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 (-2.4%) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (-2.3%) opened the new year at incremental all-time highs, but both indices are currently down more than 2.0% amid widespread profit-taking interest. The Nasdaq Composite (-2.5%) and Russell 2000 (-2.1%) are also down more than 2.0%.Contributing to the positive start was Tesla (TSLA 722.48, +16.81, +2.4%) reporting record Q4 deliveries, expansionary December manufacturing PMIs out of the eurozone and Asia, and general buying momentum. The advance was short-lived with investors currently looking at a disappointing picture ahead of tomorrow's Senate election runoff in Georgia.Every sector in the S&P 500 is trading in negative territory, including real estate (-3.0%), industrials (-3.0%), information technology (-2.8%), and communication services (-2.6) at the bottom of the standings. The energy sector (-0.6%) is showing relative outperformance despite the decline in oil prices ($47.57, -0.94, -1.9%).Generally, investors are de-risking and seeking shelter in traditional safe-haven assets like Treasuries and the U.S. dollar. The 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 0.91% after touching 0.95% earlier today, and the dollar index trades flat after being down as much as 0.6%.The CBOE Volatility Index has spiked 22.9% to 27.95 amid increased hedging interest to protect against further equity weakness.In M&A activity, FLIR Systems (FLIR 51.95, +8.11, +18.5%) agreed to be acquired by Teledyne (TDY 356.94, -25.05, -8.9%) in a cash and stock deal valued at $8.0 billion. Magellan Health (MGLN 93.49, +10.65, +12.9%) agreed to be acquired by Centene (CNC 60.60, +0.57, +0.9%) for $95 per share, or a total enterprise value of $2.2 billion, in cash.Reviewing today's economic data:Total construction spending increased 0.9% in November (Briefing.com consensus 0.9%) after increasing a revised 1.6% (from 1.3%) in October. Total private construction spending rose 1.2% m/m and total public construction spending decreased 0.2%.The key takeaway from the report is that residential construction spending showed strength for another month as mortgage rates remained low, supporting demand for homes outside urban areas.The December IHS Markit Manufacturing PMI increased to 57.1 from 56.5 in November. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 713/2417. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1196/2556.12:30 ETDow -623.08 at 29983.34, Nasdaq -288.88 at 12599.41, S&P -80.10 at 3675.97[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is trading lower by 2.1% amid increased de-risking efforts. Attention is starting to shift to the Senate election-runoff in Georgia tomorrow.Current polls indicate the races are too close to predict, but there is some speculation that the two Democrats could win the seats based on the average of the polls right now. If that happens, the Democrats would have the majority with President-elect Biden's vote.Solar stocks are reacting favorably to this potential outcome, evidenced by the gains in stocks like Azure Power (AZRE 44.40, +3.63, +8.9%) and First Solar (FSLR 101.53, +2.61, +2.6%). We don't want to speculate too much on the broad market reaction until the results are clear, but it was worth reminding readers.12:00 ETDow -614.72 at 29991.7, Nasdaq -213.18 at 12675.11, S&P -70.01 at 3686.06[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is trading at fresh session lows with a 1.8% decline, which is comparable to the declines in the Dow (-2.0%), Nasdaq (-1.6%), and Russell 2000 (-1.6%).Looking at some key analyst recommendations on this down day, AT&T (T 29.14, +0.38, +1.3%) was upgraded to Outperform from Mkt Perform at Raymond James, and Morgan Stanley (MS 68.62, +0.09, +0.1%) was upgraded to Overweight from Equal Weight at Barclays.Separately, China's Global Times is reporting that the Chinese government may require U.S. companies doing business in China to reveal links to the U.S. military. The report was published a few minutes before the recent downtick in the market.Over in Europe, the major indices closed on a higher note despite the specter of tightened lockdown measures. Germany's DAX increased 0.1%, UK's FTSE increased 1.8%, and France's CAC increased 0.7%. The Europe Stoxx 600 advanced 0.7%.11:30 ETDow -498.54 at 30107.88, Nasdaq -157.93 at 12730.36, S&P -52.42 at 3703.65[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is off session lows (-1.7%) with a current 1.4% decline in a tactical bounce. Every sector in the benchmark index is trading lower, including nine that are down at least 1.0%.Growth concerns are not at the root of selling since Treasuries are trading little changed and growth stocks are down alongside value stocks. In addition, global stocks traded higher following expansionary manufacturing PMIs for December out of the eurozone and Asia.Instead, investors appear to be taking profits to begin the year, having avoided any taxes they would have had to pay this year if they sold last Thursday. Now they can wait a whole year to pay taxes on today's profits.11:00 ETDow -449.66 at 30156.76, Nasdaq -114.38 at 12773.91, S&P -41.57 at 3714.5[BRIEFING.COM] The market has weakened amid widespread selling pressure that has taken the S&P 500 down 1.1% to around the 3715 level.Despite the intraday weakness, two areas of relative strength include the S&P 500 materials sector (+0.2%) and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (+1.8%). The material space is benefiting from higher metal prices while the chip space is benefiting from broad-based buying interest.Notable chip gainers include AMD (AMD 94.76, +3.04, +3.3%), Taiwan Semi (TSM 112.56, +3.52, +3.2%), and Cree (CREE 110.60, +4.70, +4.4%). It's worth noting that the PHLX is trading at fresh all-time highs.10:25 ETDow -235.16 at 30371.26, Nasdaq -10.14 at 12878.15, S&P -17.47 at 3738.6[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is trading at session lows with a 0.5% decline amid losses in nine of its 11 sectors. Influential weakness is coming from the communication services (-1.1%) and information technology (-0.4%) sectors.Namely, shares of Apple (AAPL 130.86, -1.81, -1.3%), Microsoft (MSFT 220.22, -2.22, -1.0%), Amazon (AMZN 3225.50, -31.43, -1.0%), and Facebook (FB 270.23, -2.99, -1.1%) are down at least 1.0% on no specific news catalysts. Given their mega-cap sizes, their losses have been meaningful drags on the major indices today.The one mega-cap exception is Tesla (TSLA 742.90, +37.2, +5.3%), which is rallying 5% to fresh record highs after reporting record Q4 deliveries. It's outsized gain is helping limit the decline in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (-0.1%).10:00 ETDow -98.01 at 30508.41, Nasdaq +0.46 at 12888.75, S&P -6.47 at 3749.6[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is currently down 0.1%, while the Russell 2000 trades higher by 0.3%.Just in, total construction spending increased 0.9% m/m in November (Briefing.com consensus +0.9%) on the heels of an upwardly revised 1.6% increase (from +1.3%) in October.Separately, the December IHS Markit Manufacturing PMI increased to 57.1 from 56.5 in November.09:40 ETDow -39.62 at 30566.8, Nasdaq -7.58 at 12880.71, S&P -2.23 at 3753.84[BRIEFING.COM] The major indices opened the session in the green but have recently slipped into the red. The S&P 500 is down 0.1%, the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%.An early look at the S&P 500 sectors shows the information technology (-0.4%) and real estate (-0.4%) sectors as laggards, while the energy (+0.9%) and materials (+0.9%) sectors outperform in early action.Longer-dated Treasuries are trending lower, pushing those yields higher. The 2-yr yield is flat at 0.12%, while the 10-yr yield is up three basis points to 0.95%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.4% to 89.57.

Currently, the S&P 500 futures trade 16 points, or 0.4%, above fair value at around the 3760 level.Besides momentum, positive factors this morning include Tesla (TSLA 719.20, +13.53, +1.9%) reporting record Q4 deliveries, expansionary manufacturing PMIs for December out of the eurozone and Asia, and healthy M&A activity. The Europe Stoxx 600 is currently up 1.5%.One area of relative weakness is the U.S. dollar, which is down 0.4% to 89.56 against a basket of six foreign currencies amid expectations for an economic recovery overseas.08:50 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: +15.90.

Regional Manufacturing PMI surveys showed the seventh consecutive month of expansion in Australia, eighth consecutive month of expansion in China, and the highest reading in Japan's Manufacturing PMI since April 2019.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +61.80.The S&P 500 futures trade 18 points, or 0.5%, above fair value to begin the new year, as buying interest carries over from last year's strong finish amid no specific news catalysts. Notably, the U.S. dollar continues to weaken against foreign currencies, which has benefited global stocks and U.S. multinational companies.Specifically, the U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.5% to 89.51, and is trading at its lowest level since April 2018, largely due to continued expectations for improved economic growth overseas following another round of encouraging manufacturing PMIs for December out of the eurozone and Asia.The data has overshadowed news that Germany is aiming to extend lockdown measures through the end of January, and that the UK and Japan are also thinking about tightening lockdown restrictions. Separately, Tesla (TSLA 720.58, +14.91, +2.1%) is providing strong support after reporting record-setting Q4 deliveries.In U.S. data, investors will receive the IHS Markit Manufacturing PMI for December at 9:45 a.m. ET and Construction Spending for November (Briefing.com consensus 0.9%) at 10:00 a.m. ET.U.S. Treasuries trade little changed.

WTI crude futures are down 0.5% to $48.25/bbl.In U.S. Corporate news:Tesla (TSLA 720.58, +14.91): +2.1% after reporting it produced 179,757 units and delivered 180,570 units in the fourth quarter. MGM Resorts (MGM 31.68, +0.17): +0.5% amid news that it's aiming to acquire British sports betting company Entain for about $11 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal.Airbnb (ABNB 150.06, +3.26): +2.2% after the stock was initiated with a Buy rating by at least five research firms.Reviewing overnight developments:Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region began the week on a mostly higher note.

South Korea President Moon Jae-in's approval rating fell to a record low of 34.1%.Major European indices trade on a firmly higher note despite the release of mostly weaker than expected Manufacturing PMI readings from regional economies.

The Nasdaq Composite (+0.1%) and Russell 2000 (-0.3%) underperformed today, but the Nasdaq managed to eke out a gain.For most of the day, the S&P 500 traded virtually unchanged amid a lack of conviction from buyers and sellers. Buying interest, however, increased noticeably shortly after the early close of the Treasury market at 2:00 p.m. ET on no specific news catalyst, which was symptomatic of reduced market participation.The advance was led by the financials (+1.3%), utilities (+1.6%), real estate (+1.3%), and health care (+1.1%) sectors with gains over 1.0%; conversely, the energy (-0.8%) and consumer discretionary (-0.02%) sectors ended the session in the red.The latest weekly report for initial and continuing claims showed initial claims decrease by 19,000 to 787,000 (Briefing.com consensus 800,000) and continuing claims decline to their lowest level since March at 5.219 million. The market didn't react to the data, nor to much of anything today, really.On the coronavirus front, daily U.S. coronavirus hospitalizations and deaths hit new highs on Wednesday, the faster-spreading variant of the coronavirus was recorded in California, San Francisco will reportedly extend its stay-at-home and quarantine-after-travel orders indefinitely, and vaccination efforts in the U.S. are running behind schedule.Recapping the moves in the Treasury market, the 2-yr yield decreased one basis point to 0.12% (-145 bps in 2020), and the 10-yr yield decreased one basis point to 0.92% (-100 bps in 2020). The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 89.93. WTI crude futures decreased 0.3%, or $0.12, to $48.27/bbl (-21.5% in 2020).Reviewing Thursday's economic data:Initial claims for the week ending December 26 decreased by 19,000 to 787,000 (Briefing.com consensus 800,000). Continuing claims for the week ending December 19 decreased by 103,000 to 5.219 million.That's the lowest level of continuing claims since March, yet the key takeaway and harder-hitting reality is that initial claims were just 220,000 in the same period a year ago while continuing claims were just 1.728 million.Looking ahead, investors will receive Construction Spending for November and the IHS Markit Manufacturing PMI for December on Monday when the market reopens for the new year.Nasdaq Composite +43.6% YTDRussell 2000 +18.4% YTDS&P 500 +16.3% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +7.3% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1843/1269. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1739/2010.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: January 4, 2021End of Document

The Chinese company is following in the footsteps of Tesla (TSLA 725.90, +20.24, +2.9%), which delivered 180,570 units in the fourth quarter.Separately, shares of T-Mobile US (TMUS 131.70, -3.15, -2.3%) are down in-line with the broad market after disclosing a data breach that may have affected 200,000 customers.14:35 ETDow -509.98 at 30096.44, Nasdaq -226.80 at 12661.49, S&P -66.91 at 3689.16[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages are consolidating their modest bounce off lows at the moment; the S&P 500 (-1.78%) is the worst performer in terms of percentage losses.S&P 500 constituents Paycom Software (PAYC 425.11, -27.14, -6.00%), Stanley Black & Decker (SWK 169.11, -9.45, -5.29%), and Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG 1318.50, -68.21, -4.92%) pepper the bottom of the standings. This morning, BofA Securities downgraded SWK to Underperform (Sell equivalent) on intensifying competition and worries about its MTD Products business.Conversely, specialty apparel company L Brands (LB 39.78, +2.59, +6.96%) is one of the better-performing names today.14:00 ETDow -456.74 at 30149.68, Nasdaq -193.34 at 12694.95, S&P -56.37 at 3699.7[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages are all now separated by less than 0.1% in today's declines with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (-1.50%) and S&P 500 (-1.50%) tied at the bottom.Gold futures settled $51.50 higher (+2.7%) to $1,946.60/oz, pushing back above the $1,900 psych level as equities took a tumble to start the new year.The U.S. Dollar Index stands little changed to this point at $89.92.13:30 ETDow -499.78 at 30106.64, Nasdaq -214.46 at 12673.83, S&P -64.11 at 3691.96[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continued to pare session-worst losses in the last half hour with the DJIA (-1.63%) now down a hair less than 500 points.A look inside the Dow Jones Industrial Average shows that Coca-Cola (KO 52.41, -2.43, -4.43%), Boeing (BA 205.04, -9.02, -4.21%), and Travelers (TRV 136.16, -4.21, -3.00%) are underperforming. KO and BA are lower following morning sell side downgrades, while TRV and insurance names in general post modest losses; we'd point out that this morning, mortgage insurer Genworth Financial (GNW 2.73, -1.05, -27.78%) and China Oceanwide announced that the two parties hadn't extended their December 31, 2020 deal "end date."Conversely, pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA 41.04, +1.16, +2.91%) sits atop the index, aided by reports that Haven, the Amazon, Berkshire, JPMorgan Chase healthcare JV, would disband at the end of the month after 3 years in business.12:55 ETDow -692.89 at 29913.53, Nasdaq -323.00 at 12565.29, S&P -89.83 at 3666.24[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 (-2.4%) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (-2.3%) opened the new year at incremental all-time highs, but both indices are currently down more than 2.0% amid widespread profit-taking interest. The Nasdaq Composite (-2.5%) and Russell 2000 (-2.1%) are also down more than 2.0%.Contributing to the positive start was Tesla (TSLA 722.48, +16.81, +2.4%) reporting record Q4 deliveries, expansionary December manufacturing PMIs out of the eurozone and Asia, and general buying momentum. The advance was short-lived with investors currently looking at a disappointing picture ahead of tomorrow's Senate election runoff in Georgia.Every sector in the S&P 500 is trading in negative territory, including real estate (-3.0%), industrials (-3.0%), information technology (-2.8%), and communication services (-2.6) at the bottom of the standings. The energy sector (-0.6%) is showing relative outperformance despite the decline in oil prices ($47.57, -0.94, -1.9%).Generally, investors are de-risking and seeking shelter in traditional safe-haven assets like Treasuries and the U.S. dollar. The 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 0.91% after touching 0.95% earlier today, and the dollar index trades flat after being down as much as 0.6%.The CBOE Volatility Index has spiked 22.9% to 27.95 amid increased hedging interest to protect against further equity weakness.In M&A activity, FLIR Systems (FLIR 51.95, +8.11, +18.5%) agreed to be acquired by Teledyne (TDY 356.94, -25.05, -8.9%) in a cash and stock deal valued at $8.0 billion. Magellan Health (MGLN 93.49, +10.65, +12.9%) agreed to be acquired by Centene (CNC 60.60, +0.57, +0.9%) for $95 per share, or a total enterprise value of $2.2 billion, in cash.Reviewing today's economic data:Total construction spending increased 0.9% in November (Briefing.com consensus 0.9%) after increasing a revised 1.6% (from 1.3%) in October. Total private construction spending rose 1.2% m/m and total public construction spending decreased 0.2%.The key takeaway from the report is that residential construction spending showed strength for another month as mortgage rates remained low, supporting demand for homes outside urban areas.The December IHS Markit Manufacturing PMI increased to 57.1 from 56.5 in November. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 713/2417. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1196/2556.12:30 ETDow -623.08 at 29983.34, Nasdaq -288.88 at 12599.41, S&P -80.10 at 3675.97[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is trading lower by 2.1% amid increased de-risking efforts. Attention is starting to shift to the Senate election-runoff in Georgia tomorrow.Current polls indicate the races are too close to predict, but there is some speculation that the two Democrats could win the seats based on the average of the polls right now. If that happens, the Democrats would have the majority with President-elect Biden's vote.Solar stocks are reacting favorably to this potential outcome, evidenced by the gains in stocks like Azure Power (AZRE 44.40, +3.63, +8.9%) and First Solar (FSLR 101.53, +2.61, +2.6%). We don't want to speculate too much on the broad market reaction until the results are clear, but it was worth reminding readers.12:00 ETDow -614.72 at 29991.7, Nasdaq -213.18 at 12675.11, S&P -70.01 at 3686.06[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is trading at fresh session lows with a 1.8% decline, which is comparable to the declines in the Dow (-2.0%), Nasdaq (-1.6%), and Russell 2000 (-1.6%).Looking at some key analyst recommendations on this down day, AT&T (T 29.14, +0.38, +1.3%) was upgraded to Outperform from Mkt Perform at Raymond James, and Morgan Stanley (MS 68.62, +0.09, +0.1%) was upgraded to Overweight from Equal Weight at Barclays.Separately, China's Global Times is reporting that the Chinese government may require U.S. companies doing business in China to reveal links to the U.S. military. The report was published a few minutes before the recent downtick in the market.Over in Europe, the major indices closed on a higher note despite the specter of tightened lockdown measures. Germany's DAX increased 0.1%, UK's FTSE increased 1.8%, and France's CAC increased 0.7%. The Europe Stoxx 600 advanced 0.7%.11:30 ETDow -498.54 at 30107.88, Nasdaq -157.93 at 12730.36, S&P -52.42 at 3703.65[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is off session lows (-1.7%) with a current 1.4% decline in a tactical bounce. Every sector in the benchmark index is trading lower, including nine that are down at least 1.0%.Growth concerns are not at the root of selling since Treasuries are trading little changed and growth stocks are down alongside value stocks. In addition, global stocks traded higher following expansionary manufacturing PMIs for December out of the eurozone and Asia.Instead, investors appear to be taking profits to begin the year, having avoided any taxes they would have had to pay this year if they sold last Thursday. Now they can wait a whole year to pay taxes on today's profits.11:00 ETDow -449.66 at 30156.76, Nasdaq -114.38 at 12773.91, S&P -41.57 at 3714.5[BRIEFING.COM] The market has weakened amid widespread selling pressure that has taken the S&P 500 down 1.1% to around the 3715 level.Despite the intraday weakness, two areas of relative strength include the S&P 500 materials sector (+0.2%) and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (+1.8%). The material space is benefiting from higher metal prices while the chip space is benefiting from broad-based buying interest.Notable chip gainers include AMD (AMD 94.76, +3.04, +3.3%), Taiwan Semi (TSM 112.56, +3.52, +3.2%), and Cree (CREE 110.60, +4.70, +4.4%). It's worth noting that the PHLX is trading at fresh all-time highs.10:25 ETDow -235.16 at 30371.26, Nasdaq -10.14 at 12878.15, S&P -17.47 at 3738.6[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is trading at session lows with a 0.5% decline amid losses in nine of its 11 sectors. Influential weakness is coming from the communication services (-1.1%) and information technology (-0.4%) sectors.Namely, shares of Apple (AAPL 130.86, -1.81, -1.3%), Microsoft (MSFT 220.22, -2.22, -1.0%), Amazon (AMZN 3225.50, -31.43, -1.0%), and Facebook (FB 270.23, -2.99, -1.1%) are down at least 1.0% on no specific news catalysts. Given their mega-cap sizes, their losses have been meaningful drags on the major indices today.The one mega-cap exception is Tesla (TSLA 742.90, +37.2, +5.3%), which is rallying 5% to fresh record highs after reporting record Q4 deliveries. It's outsized gain is helping limit the decline in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (-0.1%).10:00 ETDow -98.01 at 30508.41, Nasdaq +0.46 at 12888.75, S&P -6.47 at 3749.6[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is currently down 0.1%, while the Russell 2000 trades higher by 0.3%.Just in, total construction spending increased 0.9% m/m in November (Briefing.com consensus +0.9%) on the heels of an upwardly revised 1.6% increase (from +1.3%) in October.Separately, the December IHS Markit Manufacturing PMI increased to 57.1 from 56.5 in November.09:40 ETDow -39.62 at 30566.8, Nasdaq -7.58 at 12880.71, S&P -2.23 at 3753.84[BRIEFING.COM] The major indices opened the session in the green but have recently slipped into the red. The S&P 500 is down 0.1%, the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%.An early look at the S&P 500 sectors shows the information technology (-0.4%) and real estate (-0.4%) sectors as laggards, while the energy (+0.9%) and materials (+0.9%) sectors outperform in early action.Longer-dated Treasuries are trending lower, pushing those yields higher. The 2-yr yield is flat at 0.12%, while the 10-yr yield is up three basis points to 0.95%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.4% to 89.57.

Notably, the U.S. dollar continues to weaken against foreign currencies, which has benefited global stocks and U.S. multinational companies.Specifically, the U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.5% to 89.51, and is trading at its lowest level since April 2018, largely due to continued expectations for improved economic growth overseas following another round of encouraging manufacturing PMIs for December out of the eurozone and Asia.The data has overshadowed news that Germany is aiming to extend lockdown measures through the end of January, and that the UK and Japan are also thinking about tightening lockdown restrictions. Separately, Tesla (TSLA 720.58, +14.91, +2.1%) is providing strong support after reporting record-setting Q4 deliveries.In U.S. data, investors will receive the IHS Markit Manufacturing PMI for December at 9:45 a.m. ET and Construction Spending for November (Briefing.com consensus 0.9%) at 10:00 a.m. ET.U.S. Treasuries trade little changed.

The Nasdaq Composite (+0.1%) and Russell 2000 (-0.3%) underperformed today, but the Nasdaq managed to eke out a gain.For most of the day, the S&P 500 traded virtually unchanged amid a lack of conviction from buyers and sellers. Buying interest, however, increased noticeably shortly after the early close of the Treasury market at 2:00 p.m. ET on no specific news catalyst, which was symptomatic of reduced market participation.The advance was led by the financials (+1.3%), utilities (+1.6%), real estate (+1.3%), and health care (+1.1%) sectors with gains over 1.0%; conversely, the energy (-0.8%) and consumer discretionary (-0.02%) sectors ended the session in the red.The latest weekly report for initial and continuing claims showed initial claims decrease by 19,000 to 787,000 (Briefing.com consensus 800,000) and continuing claims decline to their lowest level since March at 5.219 million. The market didn't react to the data, nor to much of anything today, really.On the coronavirus front, daily U.S. coronavirus hospitalizations and deaths hit new highs on Wednesday, the faster-spreading variant of the coronavirus was recorded in California, San Francisco will reportedly extend its stay-at-home and quarantine-after-travel orders indefinitely, and vaccination efforts in the U.S. are running behind schedule.Recapping the moves in the Treasury market, the 2-yr yield decreased one basis point to 0.12% (-145 bps in 2020), and the 10-yr yield decreased one basis point to 0.92% (-100 bps in 2020). The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 89.93. WTI crude futures decreased 0.3%, or $0.12, to $48.27/bbl (-21.5% in 2020).Reviewing Thursday's economic data:Initial claims for the week ending December 26 decreased by 19,000 to 787,000 (Briefing.com consensus 800,000). Continuing claims for the week ending December 19 decreased by 103,000 to 5.219 million.That's the lowest level of continuing claims since March, yet the key takeaway and harder-hitting reality is that initial claims were just 220,000 in the same period a year ago while continuing claims were just 1.728 million.Looking ahead, investors will receive Construction Spending for November and the IHS Markit Manufacturing PMI for December on Monday when the market reopens for the new year.Nasdaq Composite +43.6% YTDRussell 2000 +18.4% YTDS&P 500 +16.3% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +7.3% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1843/1269. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1739/2010.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: January 4, 2021End of Document

The Chinese company is following in the footsteps of Tesla (TSLA 725.90, +20.24, +2.9%), which delivered 180,570 units in the fourth quarter.Separately, shares of T-Mobile US (TMUS 131.70, -3.15, -2.3%) are down in-line with the broad market after disclosing a data breach that may have affected 200,000 customers.14:35 ETDow -509.98 at 30096.44, Nasdaq -226.80 at 12661.49, S&P -66.91 at 3689.16[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages are consolidating their modest bounce off lows at the moment; the S&P 500 (-1.78%) is the worst performer in terms of percentage losses.S&P 500 constituents Paycom Software (PAYC 425.11, -27.14, -6.00%), Stanley Black & Decker (SWK 169.11, -9.45, -5.29%), and Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG 1318.50, -68.21, -4.92%) pepper the bottom of the standings. This morning, BofA Securities downgraded SWK to Underperform (Sell equivalent) on intensifying competition and worries about its MTD Products business.Conversely, specialty apparel company L Brands (LB 39.78, +2.59, +6.96%) is one of the better-performing names today.14:00 ETDow -456.74 at 30149.68, Nasdaq -193.34 at 12694.95, S&P -56.37 at 3699.7[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages are all now separated by less than 0.1% in today's declines with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (-1.50%) and S&P 500 (-1.50%) tied at the bottom.Gold futures settled $51.50 higher (+2.7%) to $1,946.60/oz, pushing back above the $1,900 psych level as equities took a tumble to start the new year.The U.S. Dollar Index stands little changed to this point at $89.92.13:30 ETDow -499.78 at 30106.64, Nasdaq -214.46 at 12673.83, S&P -64.11 at 3691.96[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continued to pare session-worst losses in the last half hour with the DJIA (-1.63%) now down a hair less than 500 points.A look inside the Dow Jones Industrial Average shows that Coca-Cola (KO 52.41, -2.43, -4.43%), Boeing (BA 205.04, -9.02, -4.21%), and Travelers (TRV 136.16, -4.21, -3.00%) are underperforming. KO and BA are lower following morning sell side downgrades, while TRV and insurance names in general post modest losses; we'd point out that this morning, mortgage insurer Genworth Financial (GNW 2.73, -1.05, -27.78%) and China Oceanwide announced that the two parties hadn't extended their December 31, 2020 deal "end date."Conversely, pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA 41.04, +1.16, +2.91%) sits atop the index, aided by reports that Haven, the Amazon, Berkshire, JPMorgan Chase healthcare JV, would disband at the end of the month after 3 years in business.12:55 ETDow -692.89 at 29913.53, Nasdaq -323.00 at 12565.29, S&P -89.83 at 3666.24[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 (-2.4%) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (-2.3%) opened the new year at incremental all-time highs, but both indices are currently down more than 2.0% amid widespread profit-taking interest. The Nasdaq Composite (-2.5%) and Russell 2000 (-2.1%) are also down more than 2.0%.Contributing to the positive start was Tesla (TSLA 722.48, +16.81, +2.4%) reporting record Q4 deliveries, expansionary December manufacturing PMIs out of the eurozone and Asia, and general buying momentum. The advance was short-lived with investors currently looking at a disappointing picture ahead of tomorrow's Senate election runoff in Georgia.Every sector in the S&P 500 is trading in negative territory, including real estate (-3.0%), industrials (-3.0%), information technology (-2.8%), and communication services (-2.6) at the bottom of the standings. The energy sector (-0.6%) is showing relative outperformance despite the decline in oil prices ($47.57, -0.94, -1.9%).Generally, investors are de-risking and seeking shelter in traditional safe-haven assets like Treasuries and the U.S. dollar. The 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 0.91% after touching 0.95% earlier today, and the dollar index trades flat after being down as much as 0.6%.The CBOE Volatility Index has spiked 22.9% to 27.95 amid increased hedging interest to protect against further equity weakness.In M&A activity, FLIR Systems (FLIR 51.95, +8.11, +18.5%) agreed to be acquired by Teledyne (TDY 356.94, -25.05, -8.9%) in a cash and stock deal valued at $8.0 billion. Magellan Health (MGLN 93.49, +10.65, +12.9%) agreed to be acquired by Centene (CNC 60.60, +0.57, +0.9%) for $95 per share, or a total enterprise value of $2.2 billion, in cash.Reviewing today's economic data:Total construction spending increased 0.9% in November (Briefing.com consensus 0.9%) after increasing a revised 1.6% (from 1.3%) in October. Total private construction spending rose 1.2% m/m and total public construction spending decreased 0.2%.The key takeaway from the report is that residential construction spending showed strength for another month as mortgage rates remained low, supporting demand for homes outside urban areas.The December IHS Markit Manufacturing PMI increased to 57.1 from 56.5 in November. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 713/2417. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1196/2556.12:30 ETDow -623.08 at 29983.34, Nasdaq -288.88 at 12599.41, S&P -80.10 at 3675.97[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is trading lower by 2.1% amid increased de-risking efforts. Attention is starting to shift to the Senate election-runoff in Georgia tomorrow.Current polls indicate the races are too close to predict, but there is some speculation that the two Democrats could win the seats based on the average of the polls right now. If that happens, the Democrats would have the majority with President-elect Biden's vote.Solar stocks are reacting favorably to this potential outcome, evidenced by the gains in stocks like Azure Power (AZRE 44.40, +3.63, +8.9%) and First Solar (FSLR 101.53, +2.61, +2.6%). We don't want to speculate too much on the broad market reaction until the results are clear, but it was worth reminding readers.12:00 ETDow -614.72 at 29991.7, Nasdaq -213.18 at 12675.11, S&P -70.01 at 3686.06[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is trading at fresh session lows with a 1.8% decline, which is comparable to the declines in the Dow (-2.0%), Nasdaq (-1.6%), and Russell 2000 (-1.6%).Looking at some key analyst recommendations on this down day, AT&T (T 29.14, +0.38, +1.3%) was upgraded to Outperform from Mkt Perform at Raymond James, and Morgan Stanley (MS 68.62, +0.09, +0.1%) was upgraded to Overweight from Equal Weight at Barclays.Separately, China's Global Times is reporting that the Chinese government may require U.S. companies doing business in China to reveal links to the U.S. military. The report was published a few minutes before the recent downtick in the market.Over in Europe, the major indices closed on a higher note despite the specter of tightened lockdown measures. Germany's DAX increased 0.1%, UK's FTSE increased 1.8%, and France's CAC increased 0.7%. The Europe Stoxx 600 advanced 0.7%.11:30 ETDow -498.54 at 30107.88, Nasdaq -157.93 at 12730.36, S&P -52.42 at 3703.65[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is off session lows (-1.7%) with a current 1.4% decline in a tactical bounce. Every sector in the benchmark index is trading lower, including nine that are down at least 1.0%.Growth concerns are not at the root of selling since Treasuries are trading little changed and growth stocks are down alongside value stocks. In addition, global stocks traded higher following expansionary manufacturing PMIs for December out of the eurozone and Asia.Instead, investors appear to be taking profits to begin the year, having avoided any taxes they would have had to pay this year if they sold last Thursday. Now they can wait a whole year to pay taxes on today's profits.11:00 ETDow -449.66 at 30156.76, Nasdaq -114.38 at 12773.91, S&P -41.57 at 3714.5[BRIEFING.COM] The market has weakened amid widespread selling pressure that has taken the S&P 500 down 1.1% to around the 3715 level.Despite the intraday weakness, two areas of relative strength include the S&P 500 materials sector (+0.2%) and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (+1.8%). The material space is benefiting from higher metal prices while the chip space is benefiting from broad-based buying interest.Notable chip gainers include AMD (AMD 94.76, +3.04, +3.3%), Taiwan Semi (TSM 112.56, +3.52, +3.2%), and Cree (CREE 110.60, +4.70, +4.4%). It's worth noting that the PHLX is trading at fresh all-time highs.10:25 ETDow -235.16 at 30371.26, Nasdaq -10.14 at 12878.15, S&P -17.47 at 3738.6[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is trading at session lows with a 0.5% decline amid losses in nine of its 11 sectors. Influential weakness is coming from the communication services (-1.1%) and information technology (-0.4%) sectors.Namely, shares of Apple (AAPL 130.86, -1.81, -1.3%), Microsoft (MSFT 220.22, -2.22, -1.0%), Amazon (AMZN 3225.50, -31.43, -1.0%), and Facebook (FB 270.23, -2.99, -1.1%) are down at least 1.0% on no specific news catalysts. Given their mega-cap sizes, their losses have been meaningful drags on the major indices today.The one mega-cap exception is Tesla (TSLA 742.90, +37.2, +5.3%), which is rallying 5% to fresh record highs after reporting record Q4 deliveries. It's outsized gain is helping limit the decline in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (-0.1%).10:00 ETDow -98.01 at 30508.41, Nasdaq +0.46 at 12888.75, S&P -6.47 at 3749.6[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is currently down 0.1%, while the Russell 2000 trades higher by 0.3%.Just in, total construction spending increased 0.9% m/m in November (Briefing.com consensus +0.9%) on the heels of an upwardly revised 1.6% increase (from +1.3%) in October.Separately, the December IHS Markit Manufacturing PMI increased to 57.1 from 56.5 in November.09:40 ETDow -39.62 at 30566.8, Nasdaq -7.58 at 12880.71, S&P -2.23 at 3753.84[BRIEFING.COM] The major indices opened the session in the green but have recently slipped into the red.

The 2-yr yield is flat at 0.12%, while the 10-yr yield is up three basis points to 0.95%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.4% to 89.57.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +61.80.The S&P 500 futures trade 18 points, or 0.5%, above fair value to begin the new year, as buying interest carries over from last year's strong finish amid no specific news catalysts. Notably, the U.S. dollar continues to weaken against foreign currencies, which has benefited global stocks and U.S. multinational companies.Specifically, the U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.5% to 89.51, and is trading at its lowest level since April 2018, largely due to continued expectations for improved economic growth overseas following another round of encouraging manufacturing PMIs for December out of the eurozone and Asia.The data has overshadowed news that Germany is aiming to extend lockdown measures through the end of January, and that the UK and Japan are also thinking about tightening lockdown restrictions.

The Nasdaq Composite (+0.1%) and Russell 2000 (-0.3%) underperformed today, but the Nasdaq managed to eke out a gain.For most of the day, the S&P 500 traded virtually unchanged amid a lack of conviction from buyers and sellers. Buying interest, however, increased noticeably shortly after the early close of the Treasury market at 2:00 p.m. ET on no specific news catalyst, which was symptomatic of reduced market participation.The advance was led by the financials (+1.3%), utilities (+1.6%), real estate (+1.3%), and health care (+1.1%) sectors with gains over 1.0%; conversely, the energy (-0.8%) and consumer discretionary (-0.02%) sectors ended the session in the red.The latest weekly report for initial and continuing claims showed initial claims decrease by 19,000 to 787,000 (Briefing.com consensus 800,000) and continuing claims decline to their lowest level since March at 5.219 million. The market didn't react to the data, nor to much of anything today, really.On the coronavirus front, daily U.S. coronavirus hospitalizations and deaths hit new highs on Wednesday, the faster-spreading variant of the coronavirus was recorded in California, San Francisco will reportedly extend its stay-at-home and quarantine-after-travel orders indefinitely, and vaccination efforts in the U.S. are running behind schedule.Recapping the moves in the Treasury market, the 2-yr yield decreased one basis point to 0.12% (-145 bps in 2020), and the 10-yr yield decreased one basis point to 0.92% (-100 bps in 2020). The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 89.93. WTI crude futures decreased 0.3%, or $0.12, to $48.27/bbl (-21.5% in 2020).Reviewing Thursday's economic data:Initial claims for the week ending December 26 decreased by 19,000 to 787,000 (Briefing.com consensus 800,000). Continuing claims for the week ending December 19 decreased by 103,000 to 5.219 million.That's the lowest level of continuing claims since March, yet the key takeaway and harder-hitting reality is that initial claims were just 220,000 in the same period a year ago while continuing claims were just 1.728 million.Looking ahead, investors will receive Construction Spending for November and the IHS Markit Manufacturing PMI for December on Monday when the market reopens for the new year.Nasdaq Composite +43.6% YTDRussell 2000 +18.4% YTDS&P 500 +16.3% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +7.3% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1843/1269. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1739/2010.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: January 4, 2021End of Document

The S&P 500 (-1.5%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (-1.3%), Nasdaq Composite (-1.5%), and Russell 2000 (-1.5%) declined between 1.3-1.5%. The S&P 500 and Dow briefly set all-time highs at the open.The short-lived positive open was attributed to Tesla (TSLA 729.77, +24.10, +3.4%) reporting record Q4 deliveries, expansionary December manufacturing PMIs out of the eurozone and Asia, M&A activity, and positive momentum. Tesla, foreign equities, and acquired companies still had positive outings, but the positive momentum in the broader market quickly dissipated.There weren't any specific selling catalysts, suggesting investors came back from the holidays ready to take profits while others preferred to hold off until the outcome of the Senate election runoffs in Georgia tomorrow. Selling was widespread with ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finishing in negative territory.Influential weakness came out of the information technology (-1.8%) and industrials (-2.6%) sectors, although the real estate (-3.3%) sector was the weakest link. The energy sector (+0.1%) eked out a slim gain despite lower oil prices ($47.59/bbl, -0.68, -1.4%).Hedging interest to protect against further downside was manifested in the four-point increase in the CBOE Volatility Index (26.97, +4.22, +18.6%), while safe-having positioning brought Treasury yields down from intraday highs.The 2-yr yield finished flat at 0.12%, and the 10-yr yield finished flat at 0.92% after touching 0.95% in the morning. The U.S. Dollar Index finished flat after being down 0.6% intraday.In M&A activity, FLIR Systems (FLIR 52.24, +8.41, +19.2%) agreed to be acquired by Teledyne (TDY 362.39, +10.80, +13.0%) in a cash and stock deal valued at $8.0 billion. Magellan Health (MGLN 93.64, +10.80, +13.0%) agreed to be acquired by Centene (CNC 62.09, +2.06, +3.4%) for $95 per share, or a total enterprise value of $2.2 billion, in cash.Reviewing Monday's economic data:Total construction spending increased 0.9% in November (Briefing.com consensus 0.9%) after increasing a revised 1.6% (from 1.3%) in October. Total private construction spending rose 1.2% m/m and total public construction spending decreased 0.2%.The key takeaway from the report is that residential construction spending showed strength for another month as mortgage rates remained low, supporting demand for homes outside urban areas.The December IHS Markit Manufacturing PMI increased to 57.1 from 56.5 in November.Looking ahead, investors will receive the ISM Manufacturing Index for December on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +1.5% YTDRussell 2000 +1.5% YTDS&P 500 +1.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +1.3% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 911/2188. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1570/2147.15:30 ETDow -472.24 at 30134.18, Nasdaq -218.08 at 12670.21, S&P -64.42 at 3691.65[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is trading lower by 1.8%, and the Russell 2000 is trading lower by 1.5%.One last look at the S&P 500 sectors shows real estate (-3.0%), industrials (-2.7%), and information technology (-2.1%) down more than 2.0%, while the energy sector (-0.2%) is the only sector down less than 1.0%.WTI crude futures settled lower by 1.4%, or $0.68, to $47.59/bbl.15:00 ETDow -499.09 at 30107.33, Nasdaq -228.39 at 12659.9, S&P -65.39 at 3690.68[BRIEFING.COM] The rebound effort is losing traction with the S&P 500 back down 2.0% after cutting its decline to about 1.3% a short time ago.In the electric vehicle space, NIO (NIO 53.09, +4.36, +8.9%) shares have climbed 9% after it reported that December deliveries increased 121.0% yr/yr to 7,007 vehicles. The Chinese company is following in the footsteps of Tesla (TSLA 725.90, +20.24, +2.9%), which delivered 180,570 units in the fourth quarter.Separately, shares of T-Mobile US (TMUS 131.70, -3.15, -2.3%) are down in-line with the broad market after disclosing a data breach that may have affected 200,000 customers.14:35 ETDow -509.98 at 30096.44, Nasdaq -226.80 at 12661.49, S&P -66.91 at 3689.16[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages are consolidating their modest bounce off lows at the moment; the S&P 500 (-1.78%) is the worst performer in terms of percentage losses.S&P 500 constituents Paycom Software (PAYC 425.11, -27.14, -6.00%), Stanley Black & Decker (SWK 169.11, -9.45, -5.29%), and Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG 1318.50, -68.21, -4.92%) pepper the bottom of the standings. This morning, BofA Securities downgraded SWK to Underperform (Sell equivalent) on intensifying competition and worries about its MTD Products business.Conversely, specialty apparel company L Brands (LB 39.78, +2.59, +6.96%) is one of the better-performing names today.14:00 ETDow -456.74 at 30149.68, Nasdaq -193.34 at 12694.95, S&P -56.37 at 3699.7[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages are all now separated by less than 0.1% in today's declines with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (-1.50%) and S&P 500 (-1.50%) tied at the bottom.Gold futures settled $51.50 higher (+2.7%) to $1,946.60/oz, pushing back above the $1,900 psych level as equities took a tumble to start the new year.The U.S. Dollar Index stands little changed to this point at $89.92.13:30 ETDow -499.78 at 30106.64, Nasdaq -214.46 at 12673.83, S&P -64.11 at 3691.96[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continued to pare session-worst losses in the last half hour with the DJIA (-1.63%) now down a hair less than 500 points.A look inside the Dow Jones Industrial Average shows that Coca-Cola (KO 52.41, -2.43, -4.43%), Boeing (BA 205.04, -9.02, -4.21%), and Travelers (TRV 136.16, -4.21, -3.00%) are underperforming. KO and BA are lower following morning sell side downgrades, while TRV and insurance names in general post modest losses; we'd point out that this morning, mortgage insurer Genworth Financial (GNW 2.73, -1.05, -27.78%) and China Oceanwide announced that the two parties hadn't extended their December 31, 2020 deal "end date."Conversely, pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA 41.04, +1.16, +2.91%) sits atop the index, aided by reports that Haven, the Amazon, Berkshire, JPMorgan Chase healthcare JV, would disband at the end of the month after 3 years in business.12:55 ETDow -692.89 at 29913.53, Nasdaq -323.00 at 12565.29, S&P -89.83 at 3666.24[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 (-2.4%) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (-2.3%) opened the new year at incremental all-time highs, but both indices are currently down more than 2.0% amid widespread profit-taking interest. The Nasdaq Composite (-2.5%) and Russell 2000 (-2.1%) are also down more than 2.0%.Contributing to the positive start was Tesla (TSLA 722.48, +16.81, +2.4%) reporting record Q4 deliveries, expansionary December manufacturing PMIs out of the eurozone and Asia, and general buying momentum. The advance was short-lived with investors currently looking at a disappointing picture ahead of tomorrow's Senate election runoff in Georgia.Every sector in the S&P 500 is trading in negative territory, including real estate (-3.0%), industrials (-3.0%), information technology (-2.8%), and communication services (-2.6) at the bottom of the standings. The energy sector (-0.6%) is showing relative outperformance despite the decline in oil prices ($47.57, -0.94, -1.9%).Generally, investors are de-risking and seeking shelter in traditional safe-haven assets like Treasuries and the U.S. dollar. The 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 0.91% after touching 0.95% earlier today, and the dollar index trades flat after being down as much as 0.6%.The CBOE Volatility Index has spiked 22.9% to 27.95 amid increased hedging interest to protect against further equity weakness.In M&A activity, FLIR Systems (FLIR 51.95, +8.11, +18.5%) agreed to be acquired by Teledyne (TDY 356.94, -25.05, -8.9%) in a cash and stock deal valued at $8.0 billion. Magellan Health (MGLN 93.49, +10.65, +12.9%) agreed to be acquired by Centene (CNC 60.60, +0.57, +0.9%) for $95 per share, or a total enterprise value of $2.2 billion, in cash.Reviewing today's economic data:Total construction spending increased 0.9% in November (Briefing.com consensus 0.9%) after increasing a revised 1.6% (from 1.3%) in October. Total private construction spending rose 1.2% m/m and total public construction spending decreased 0.2%.The key takeaway from the report is that residential construction spending showed strength for another month as mortgage rates remained low, supporting demand for homes outside urban areas.The December IHS Markit Manufacturing PMI increased to 57.1 from 56.5 in November. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 713/2417. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1196/2556.12:30 ETDow -623.08 at 29983.34, Nasdaq -288.88 at 12599.41, S&P -80.10 at 3675.97[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is trading lower by 2.1% amid increased de-risking efforts. Attention is starting to shift to the Senate election-runoff in Georgia tomorrow.Current polls indicate the races are too close to predict, but there is some speculation that the two Democrats could win the seats based on the average of the polls right now. If that happens, the Democrats would have the majority with President-elect Biden's vote.Solar stocks are reacting favorably to this potential outcome, evidenced by the gains in stocks like Azure Power (AZRE 44.40, +3.63, +8.9%) and First Solar (FSLR 101.53, +2.61, +2.6%). We don't want to speculate too much on the broad market reaction until the results are clear, but it was worth reminding readers.12:00 ETDow -614.72 at 29991.7, Nasdaq -213.18 at 12675.11, S&P -70.01 at 3686.06[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is trading at fresh session lows with a 1.8% decline, which is comparable to the declines in the Dow (-2.0%), Nasdaq (-1.6%), and Russell 2000 (-1.6%).Looking at some key analyst recommendations on this down day, AT&T (T 29.14, +0.38, +1.3%) was upgraded to Outperform from Mkt Perform at Raymond James, and Morgan Stanley (MS 68.62, +0.09, +0.1%) was upgraded to Overweight from Equal Weight at Barclays.Separately, China's Global Times is reporting that the Chinese government may require U.S. companies doing business in China to reveal links to the U.S. military. The report was published a few minutes before the recent downtick in the market.Over in Europe, the major indices closed on a higher note despite the specter of tightened lockdown measures. Germany's DAX increased 0.1%, UK's FTSE increased 1.8%, and France's CAC increased 0.7%. The Europe Stoxx 600 advanced 0.7%.11:30 ETDow -498.54 at 30107.88, Nasdaq -157.93 at 12730.36, S&P -52.42 at 3703.65[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is off session lows (-1.7%) with a current 1.4% decline in a tactical bounce. Every sector in the benchmark index is trading lower, including nine that are down at least 1.0%.Growth concerns are not at the root of selling since Treasuries are trading little changed and growth stocks are down alongside value stocks. In addition, global stocks traded higher following expansionary manufacturing PMIs for December out of the eurozone and Asia.Instead, investors appear to be taking profits to begin the year, having avoided any taxes they would have had to pay this year if they sold last Thursday. Now they can wait a whole year to pay taxes on today's profits.11:00 ETDow -449.66 at 30156.76, Nasdaq -114.38 at 12773.91, S&P -41.57 at 3714.5[BRIEFING.COM] The market has weakened amid widespread selling pressure that has taken the S&P 500 down 1.1% to around the 3715 level.Despite the intraday weakness, two areas of relative strength include the S&P 500 materials sector (+0.2%) and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (+1.8%). The material space is benefiting from higher metal prices while the chip space is benefiting from broad-based buying interest.Notable chip gainers include AMD (AMD 94.76, +3.04, +3.3%), Taiwan Semi (TSM 112.56, +3.52, +3.2%), and Cree (CREE 110.60, +4.70, +4.4%). It's worth noting that the PHLX is trading at fresh all-time highs.10:25 ETDow -235.16 at 30371.26, Nasdaq -10.14 at 12878.15, S&P -17.47 at 3738.6[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is trading at session lows with a 0.5% decline amid losses in nine of its 11 sectors. Influential weakness is coming from the communication services (-1.1%) and information technology (-0.4%) sectors.Namely, shares of Apple (AAPL 130.86, -1.81, -1.3%), Microsoft (MSFT 220.22, -2.22, -1.0%), Amazon (AMZN 3225.50, -31.43, -1.0%), and Facebook (FB 270.23, -2.99, -1.1%) are down at least 1.0% on no specific news catalysts. Given their mega-cap sizes, their losses have been meaningful drags on the major indices today.The one mega-cap exception is Tesla (TSLA 742.90, +37.2, +5.3%), which is rallying 5% to fresh record highs after reporting record Q4 deliveries. It's outsized gain is helping limit the decline in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (-0.1%).10:00 ETDow -98.01 at 30508.41, Nasdaq +0.46 at 12888.75, S&P -6.47 at 3749.6[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is currently down 0.1%, while the Russell 2000 trades higher by 0.3%.Just in, total construction spending increased 0.9% m/m in November (Briefing.com consensus +0.9%) on the heels of an upwardly revised 1.6% increase (from +1.3%) in October.Separately, the December IHS Markit Manufacturing PMI increased to 57.1 from 56.5 in November.09:40 ETDow -39.62 at 30566.8, Nasdaq -7.58 at 12880.71, S&P -2.23 at 3753.84[BRIEFING.COM] The major indices opened the session in the green but have recently slipped into the red.

Hong Kong internet firm blocked website over security lawAssociated Press Financial WireJanuary 14, 2021 Thursday 11:36 AM GMTCopyright 2021 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 547 wordsByline: ZEN SOO, Associated PressDateline: HONG KONG BodyHONG KONG (AP) — A Hong Kong internet service provider on Thursday said it had blocked access to a pro-democracy website to comply with the city’s national security law.In a statement emailed on Thursday, Hong Kong Broadband Network said that it had disabled access to HKChronicles, a website which compiled information on “yellow” shops that had supported the city's pro-democracy movement and released personal information and pictures of police and pro-Beijing supporters as part of a doxxing effort during anti-government protests in 2019.“We have disabled the access to the website in compliance with the requirement issued under the National Security Law. The action was taken on 13 Jan PM,” the company said.The chief editor of the site, Naomi Chan, said in a post last week that users in Hong Kong reported the site as inaccessible. Chan accused telecoms companies such as SmarTone, China Mobile Hong Kong, PCCW and Hong Kong Broadband Network of blocking the website.China Mobile Hong Kong and SmarTone did not immediately comment.

Hong Kong internet firm blocked website over security lawAssociated Press InternationalJanuary 14, 2021 Thursday 11:36 AM GMTCopyright 2021 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 547 wordsByline: ZEN SOO, Associated PressDateline: HONG KONG BodyHONG KONG (AP) — A Hong Kong internet service provider on Thursday said it had blocked access to a pro-democracy website to comply with the city’s national security law.In a statement emailed on Thursday, Hong Kong Broadband Network said that it had disabled access to HKChronicles, a website which compiled information on “yellow” shops that had supported the city's pro-democracy movement and released personal information and pictures of police and pro-Beijing supporters as part of a doxxing effort during anti-government protests in 2019.“We have disabled the access to the website in compliance with the requirement issued under the National Security Law. The action was taken on 13 Jan PM,” the company said.The chief editor of the site, Naomi Chan, said in a post last week that users in Hong Kong reported the site as inaccessible. Chan accused telecoms companies such as SmarTone, China Mobile Hong Kong, PCCW and Hong Kong Broadband Network of blocking the website.China Mobile Hong Kong and SmarTone did not immediately comment. A PCCW spokesman said it had no comment on the matter.“Naomi Chan hereby denounces ISPs that cooperate with the Chinese and Hong Kong government to restrict the citizens’ right and freedom to access information,” Chan said in a post on HKChronicles dated Jan. 7.Chan advised Hong Kongers to “make early preparations to counter future Internet blockage at a larger scale, and to face the darkness before dawn.”The move to block HKChronicles has intensified concerns that Beijing is asserting more control over the city and breaking its promise of letting the former British colony maintain separate civil rights and political systems for 50 years after the communist-ruled mainland took over in 1997.It has also prompted fears that internet freedoms in Hong Kong could be curtailed, akin to the “Great Firewall of China,” a system of internet censorship on the mainland which blocks foreign search engines and social media platforms like Google, Facebook and Twitter and scrubs the internet of keywords deemed sensitive by the Chinese government.Glacier Kwong, a digital rights and political activist based in Germany, wrote in a Twitter post last week that Hong Kong has “abused legal procedures and other means to hinder the freeflow of info online” in the last 18 months.“The Hong Kong government is stifling Hong Kong people’s freedom on the Internet,” she wrote in another tweet. “An open Internet has always been the cornerstone of freedom in a place.

Billionaire Jack Ma reappears 3 months after his frictions with BeijingCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 20, 2021 WednesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 920 wordsBodySome said he was in custody; others, who simply kept quiet. Either way, Alibaba's founding billionaire, Jack Ma, was "missing" 88 days to this day, fueling speculation about his whereabouts behind his frictions with the Chinese government.Trump's daughter announces her marriage on her last day at the White House      Read more   The entrepreneur recorded a speech, published today by the local press, in which he greets a hundred rural teachers from the Asian country selected for an award given by his foundation, to which he assures that "when the epidemic is over, we will meet again".In the video, posted on the portal of a newspaper in his native province, Zhejiang (east), Ma makes no mention of his situation, although he does claim that in "the last six months" - a period that includes the nearly three months he has been away from the spotlight - he has remained "active", participating in the process of selecting teachers for the award.Ma had measured during the last two decades under Beijing, which favored the development of the digital economy and allowed the sector to grow without too many regulations.The first 12,840 doses of the anticovid vaccine arrive in Panama      Read more   He managed to become The Richest Man in China and elevated his conglomerate - focused mainly on e-commerce - to the category of giant, with a valuation of about $700 billion.In recent months, however, his apparent status as untouchable appears to have faded, not only given as the great visible face of private sector development in the Asian giant but also as a member of the Communist Party ( PCCh).ANT, CAUSING ITS FRICTIONS WITH BEIJINGThe reason for the end of his good tune with Beijing seems to have a name: Ant Group, Alibaba's 'fintech', in which Ma holds no executive position but of which he is the top shareholder.The company, operator of Alipay, China's most widely used electronic payments platform, was to star in the largest IBRO in history in November 2020, but 36 hours before its stock market debut Chinese regulators forced it to suspend it after publishing the draft of much more restrictive regulations for the sector.Days earlier, Ma had given a controversial speech in which he was highly critical of Beijing's strategy of minimizing risks in the financial system and with traditional banks, which he said continue to be managed as "pawnshops."That was the last time, to this day, that the billionaire appeared publicly.Since then, despite Ma and Ant's apparent attempts to calm the waters, regulators and the official press have repeatedly criticized the way the sector operates, ensuring that it tricks young people into over-indebtedness or shielding behind the concepts of innovation and technology to enter the banking business without subjecting the regulations they are to comply with.Some expertsspeculated that Ma already knew the content of this new regulation and that he was trying to force a renegotiation of terms through public criticism, something not overly common in such a high-profile figure in China.The entrepreneur was not only known for his corporate activity or for his multiple lectures but for his predilection for cameras, having recorded his own kung fu movie or appeared on a stage disguised as Michael Jackson during a company event.ALIBABA SHOOTS IN THE BAG AFTER ITS REAPPEARANCEIn these three months, international press and social media have speculated that Ma was in detention, that the authorities had banned him from leaving the country, and even that Beijing was planning to nationalize Alibaba, which he opened an antitrust investigation into.Rumors about Ma's whereabouts grew in November after he did not take part as a jury on the television show 'The Heroes of Business in Africa', founded by himself and in which he was replaced by another executive at the firm.In recent years, some of China's best-known figures have "disappeared" after committing crimes or having disputes with the authorities and then reappearing months later, such as the popular actress Fan Bingbing, of which nothing was known for several months in 2018 following a tax evasion case.However, last week, sources aware of the situation had explained to Efe that Ma was trying to keep a "low profile" and that he was "fine," while calling the aforementioned rumours "unfounded."Meanwhile, the official media has remained silent while other reports pointed to Beijing's alleged orders not to give further media coverage to the skies against Alibaba.In Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter,Jack Ma's reappearance was not now among the 50 most debated topics, indicating that either netizens have not given importance to the news or that, as has happened to other issues in the past, it is a deliberate action on the heavily censored social network.However, when searching for "Ma Yun" - the entrepreneur's Chinese name - there are messages and news about his return to the public arena.To whom the news has been well seated is Alibaba's investors - Ma left his presidency in 2019, twenty years after founding it - whose shares lost 18% of their value since the last time he was seen and which today, after the reappearance, more than 8.5% were revalued.However, according to Bloomberg's list of billionaires, Ma is no longer China's richest man: his fortune would have been reduced by about $10 billion to $52.9 billion, now ranked fourth behind the heads of the drinking company Nongfu Spring and the tech companies Tencent and Pinduoduo, rivals of Alibaba.By Victor EscribanoLoad-Date: January 21, 2021End of Document

Everything published about Covid-19The visit of these ten WHO experts, confirmed monday by China, is delicate to Beijing, eager to rule out any responsibility for an epidemic that is virtually eradicated in the country but continues to wreak havoc in other parts of the world."According to the schedule currently planned, they will travel by plane from Singapore to Wuhan on 14 January," Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for the Chinese Chancellery, said at a press conference.QuarantineChina requires all passengers from abroad to be quarantined for two weeks at a hotel upon arrival. This rule should apply to WHO researchers, although it was not formally confirmed.Experts should have arrived last week, but a last-minute problem over authorizations to enter Chinese territory delayed his arrival.China announced yesterday that they were arriving on Thursday, but had not given any further details.Researchers are not on a mission to point out those responsible, but to try to understand how an animal's coronavirus could be transmitted to humans to avoid a new similar pandemic."It's about understanding the origins of the pandemic, not finding a responsible one," said WHO Director of Health Emergency Issues Michael Ryan, cited by the AFP news agency.DelegationThe delegation was composed of scientists from Denmark, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Australia, Russia, Vietnam, Germany, the United States, Qatar and Japan.China acknowledges that the virus was first detected in Wuhan, but states that it may appear and move from an animal to a person elsewhere in the country or the world.Marion Koopmans, one of the participants in the WHO mission, told Chinese television CGTN that the team is "open to all hypotheses.""I don't think we should rule anything out, but it's important to start at the site, obviously in Wuhan, where there was a big epidemic," he added.NEWSLETTER 9AM From Monday to Friday, the selection of our editors of the most relevant information for each day.

COVID-19 vaccines: Common solution, not competitionPR NewswireJanuary 15, 2021 Friday 9:01 AM ESTCopyright 2021 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 461 wordsDateline: BEIJING, Jan. 15, 2021 BodyPR NewswireA news report by China.org.cn on China's COVID-19 vaccines: At the end of 2020, one of China's self-developed COVID-19 vaccines was granted conditional approval for general use by the National Medical Products Administration. Previously, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain had already greenlit the vaccine. After China's official approval, over a dozen countries from different continents signed purchase agreements with China for the vaccine.Since the initial outbreak, scientists around the world have been working to develop an effective vaccine. Various approaches have been adopted, such as mRNA vaccines, inactivated vaccines and adenovirus vector vaccines. The mRNA vaccine jointly developed by Pfizer and BioNTech was approved in the U.K. and U.S. in December 2020. The adenovirus vector vaccine developed by Oxford-AstraZeneca has not long since been rolled out. China's recently approved vaccine is inactivated, which is a mature technique, thus making it relatively safe. Without special requirements for transportation or storage, the vaccine's cost is lower, meaning it is more affordable.Recent news on the virus mutating makes achieving herd immunity via vaccination all the more important. As such, the Chinese government has promised to provide vaccines free of charge to all Chinese people.The approval and future use of China's inactivated vaccine has been made possible only through international cooperation. The phase 3 clinical trials, for instance, were conducted in countries including the UAE and Argentina. Now China is speeding up vaccine production, working to make them a global public good, while being more accessible and affordable. In the future, China will actively provide vaccines to developing countries, including through donations, which is in line with China's joining of COVAX.Many foreign media outlets have continued to link vaccine development with political purposes, and have disparaged China's vaccines. In fact, research and development into COVID-19 vaccines is not a case of companies or countries competing against one another. Faced with the virus, humanity should work together to seek solutions to this common challenge.Any effective vaccine would mark a victory for global public health and all humanity. China will continue to work with other countries on vaccine development, share knowledge and experience in fighting the pandemic, and overcome the challenge.China Mosaichttp://www.china.org.cn/video/node_7230027.htmCOVID-19 vaccines: Common solution, not competitionhttp://www.china.org.cn/video/2021-01/15/content_77119558.htm View original content to download multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/covid-19-vaccines-common-solution-not-competition-301209137.htmlSOURCE China.org.cnCONTACT: Ni Jingjing, +86-10-8882-8131, pr@china.org.cnLoad-Date: January 15, 2021End of Document

US freezes TikTok sale indefinitely to Oracle and WalmartCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 10, 2021 WednesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 406 wordsBodyThe plan orchestrated by former U.S. President Donald Trump to force the sale of TikTok's U.S. operations to a group of investors including Oracle and Walmart is postponed indefinitely.As the Wall Street Journal advances citing sources familiar with the situation, the Administration of the current representative, Democrat Joe Biden, has initiated a broad review of his predecessor's efforts in office to address potential security risks arising from multiple Chinese technology.In fact, the potential sale of TikTok's operations has been in limbo since last fall. Both the company and its parent company, China's ByteDance, got courts to deny White House lawsuits, through executive orders, to ban app downloads from U.S. platforms, such as Apple's App Store or Google Play. The WSJ indicates that conversations between ByteDance representatives and US Homeland Security officials continue, especially with regard to data security and how to prevent the Chinese government from accessing the information TikTok collects from its U.S. users. At the moment, however, Biden's government is not expected to make an imminent decision on this matter. The U.S. Foreign Investment Committee (Cfius) and TikTok shuffle possible formulas to resolve this situation, including using a trusted third party to manage application data without requiring a direct sale. In this way, any final agreement will probably be different from the one shuffled last September as the platform no longer faces the threat of imminent closure.Remember that, at the time, Oracle planned to take a 12.5% stake in a new entity named TikTok Global, based in the US, that would provide a secure cloud service for the data of users of the popular application. For its part, Walmart agreed to purchase 7.5% of that entity in addition to getting multiple agreements to provide e-commerce, payments and other services to the new company.In a joint statement, Oracle and Walmart announced that TikTok Global and US ByteDance investors, including Sequoia Capital, General Atlantic and Coatue, planned to create an educational initiative to provide an artificial intelligence-driven online video curriculum to deliver a variety of subjects. They also emphasized that TikTok Global would pay "more than $5 billion in new U.S. Treasury taxes" but without specifying for what period of time or offering more details about it.commentsforum0WhatsApp  Facebook  Twitter  Linkedin       Load-Date: February 11, 2021End of Document

All Rights ReservedSection: MARKET RESEARCH REPORTSLength: 2372 wordsBodyNew York, Jan.  14, 2021  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Reportlinker.com announces the release of the report "Big Data & Data Analytics Market in National Security & Law Enforcement: 2020-2026" - https://www.reportlinker.com/p06007734/?utm_source=GNW 62% and reach $17.27 billion by 2026.The use of big data and data analytics by Homeland Security, Defense, Public Safety organizations and intelligence agencies is on the rise, mostly because the world is becoming more digital and connected. This is creating new opportunities, not only for data collection and storage, but also for intelligence processing, exploitation, dissemination, and analysis. Big data and data analytics technologies can increase the investigative capabilities of intelligence organizations in many relevant aspects, including: war on crime & terror, defense from cyber-attacks, public safety analytics, disaster and mass incident management, and development of predictive capabilities. All fields of Intelligence benefit from big data growth including Osint Market, Sigint Market, Cyber defense activities, financial investigations.Direct threats to the national security and public safety of countries are on the rise and have evolved from large-scale nation-to-nation conflicts to more pinpointed and contained conflicts. These threats, such as lone-wolf attacks, terrorism, natural disasters, organized crime, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and cybercrime have changed the way nations are dealing with their national security issues. These new security threats and risks to the national safety of nations will force homeland security and public safety organizations to adopt new technologies and systems that are better equipped to deal with more advanced modes of operations as well as the massive amounts of data that they generate and can be used against them.As governments and agencies adopt new technologies as part of their digital modernization programs    from automation to AI to 5G-enabled edge devices they all understand that the success of these efforts depends upon fueling this digital infrastructure in a secure manner with the vast flow of data available from external sources, internal systems, and connected sensors and platforms. Whoever is able to reach data superiority and leverage (big) data will gain critical advantages. Therefore, big data and data analytics have become a cornerstone for operations for intelligence, police, first responders, military and even border control operations for the last years. These organizations have all been dealing with data collection, analysis, and dissemination for years. However, today, advanced big data analytics as well as AI is changing the way they are monitoring, gathering, and analyzing sources and transforming them into a much more data-driven, precise, and efficient organization.The big data and data analytics Market in Homeland Security, National Security and Public Safety market are boosted by the following drivers:• The increased use of smartphones, wearables, and other smart connected devices (cars, machines, IoT, etc.), which will continue to create enormous amounts of information that Homeland Security and Public Safety organizations can use to their advantage, mostly in Sigint (signal intelligence) related activities.• Technological advancements in data collection, storage, analytics, and visualization, which will allow organizations to increase the amount of data they generate, as well as to produce more actionable intelligence to support real-time decision making.• Increased investment in data analysis and visualization capabilities by Homeland Security and Public Safety organizations, which act as a major catalyst for the implementation of big data and data analytics solutions.• As governments and agencies adopt new technologies as part of their digital modernization programs    from automation to AI to 5G-enabled edge devices they all understand that the success of these efforts depends upon fueling this digital infrastructure in a secure manner with the vast flow of data available from external sources, internal systems, and connected sensors and platforms. Whoever is able to reach data superiority and leverage (big) data will gain critical advantages.• In 2018 Palantir won a lawsuit against the U.S. Army to enforce the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994. The law requires the U.S. federal government to consider commercially available software before attempting to start custom-developing projects on its own. The outcome of the lawsuit has transformed the way in which the U.S. military purchases software on behalf of its soldiers and services members. It should be mentioned that the court's ruling and the ensuing shift in government procurement affects the entire U.S. federal government, not only military.• The adoption of cloud technology by governmental agencies, which will also act as a stimulus towards analytics implementation. Given that most organizations do not have the in-house infrastructure to support big data analytics, several of them must turn to cloud solutions, which will make the use of data analytics easier.• The cost of cloud data storage, which continues to decrease and encourage a move to the cloud.• The growing generation of data-aware and data professionals    HLS data scientists.• The rise of state-of-the-art attack technologies (e.g., cyber-warfare, encrypted communication, cyber-crime, chemical warfare agents, and GPS jammers) as well as other advanced techniques employed by terror organizations (such as, ISIS and state-sponsored terror groups) and other 21st century criminals, which make it harder for Homeland Security and Public Safety organizations to track them down. Big data and data analytics is one of the preferred ways to deal with this new reality.• Increased lone-wolf attacks, cyber-attacks, data fraud, deepfake & fake news activities have put an emphasis on the need of homeland security and national security agencies to create stronger big data and data analytics capabilities.• Direct threats to country-level national security and public safety are on the rise and have evolved from large-scale nation-to-nation conflicts to more pinpointed and contained ones. These threats, such as terrorism, natural disasters, organized crime, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and cybercrime have changed the way nations are dealing with national security issues.• The new security threats and risks to national safety will force Homeland Security and Public Safety organizations to adopt technologies that are better equipped to deal with advanced operations. These Intelligence systems generate massive amounts of data and may increase the big data market and data analytics market in Homeland Security and Public Safety.• A growing number of countries increase monitoring of citizen activities claiming enforcement of public order. Countries such as Russia, Turkey and China are expected to increase investments in big data gathering and intelligence gathering for internal security on vast amount of people. While civil liberties are under threat, Intelligence organizations budgets are on the rise not only in these countries, but also in other countries that were perceived as more liberal and face internal terror threats.This market report, covering Homeland Security big data and data analytics, is a valuable resource for executives interested in Big Data Intelligence markets. It has been explicitly customized for potential investors, big data companies, Intelligence agencies as well as security and government decision makers, to enable them to benchmark business plans, as well as identify business opportunities, emerging technologies, market trends, and risks.Questions answered in this market report include:• What will be the big data market size in Homeland Security and Public Safety in 2019-2026?

Homeland Security and Intelligence agencies are taking part in the fight to mitigate COVID-19 and are utilizing big data analytics to do so. Geo-location and other mobile phone tracking technologies are only of some of the big data technologies that are being used globally by these agencies as part of a larger strategy of people tracking & tracing to mitigate the pandemic. According to our analysis, there are four different approaches or levels of surveillance that governments have chosen to implement, while using personal data at different levels to keep track of their citizens. In most countries, homeland security & public safety agencies are taking part in these operations.Singapore    using Bluetooth technologyThe "TraceTogether" app, which needs to be downloaded by the citizens, uses Bluetooth to track nearby phones (without location tracking), keeps local logs of those contacts, and only uploads them to the Ministry of Health when the user chooses/consents, presumably after a diagnosis, so those contacts can be alerted. Moreover, Singapore plans to open-source the app and has mentioned that they won't save personal data for an extended period of time (most likely over 14 days). It should be mentioned that the UK government is developing a similar app for their use.Germany    using mobile network dataThe cellular carrier Deutsche Telekom has shared location data with the government to analyze trends and big data insight, not specific movements. In general, data from cell phone carriers was used in an aggregated, anonymized format to make sure no privacy issues were broken.South Korea    using Geo-location dataUsing Geo-locating data, the government texts people to let them know if they were in the vicinity of a diagnosed individual. The information conveyed can include the person's age, gender, and detailed location history.China    using Geo-location data along with additional mass surveillance technologiesThe surveillance mechanisms are the most pervasive and draconian. In addition to the use of their mass video surveillance (CCTV) systems, the government also utilizes the widespread apps Alipay and WeChat. These apps now include health codes    green, yellow, or red    set by the Chinese government. This health status is then used in hundreds of cities (and soon nationwide) to determine whether people are allowed to ride the subway, take a train, enter a building, or even exit a highway.Read the full report: https://www.reportlinker.com/p06007734/?utm_source=GNWAbout ReportlinkerReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution.

Outlook on the Robot End-Effector Global Market to 2026 - Featuring ABB, Zimmer Group and Schunk Among Others - ResearchAndMarkets.comBusiness WireMarch 2, 2021 Tuesday 2:47 PM GMTCopyright 2021 Business Wire, Inc.Length: 813 wordsDateline: DUBLIN BodyThe "Robot End-Effector Market - Growth, Trends, COVID-19 Impact, and Forecasts (2021 - 2026)" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.The robot end-effector market is projected to attain a CAGR of approximately 15% over the forecast period (2021 - 2026).Companies Mentioned• ABB Group• DESTACO Europe GmbH• Zimmer Group• Schunk GmbH• J. Schmalz GmbH• Robotiq Inc• KUKA Robotics Corporation• Weiss Robotics GmbH & Co. KG• Piab AB• Bastian Solutions, Inc.Key Market TrendsGrippers to have Significant Market Share• Food Industry is among the largest end-user industry segment to embrace grippers. Keeping food industry automation needs in strategic target to develop the solutions, Piab introduced piSOFTGRIP, a novel vacuum-based soft gripping tool in June 2019 which handles unpackaged, fresh, and delicate food items without crushing them.• In March 2019, Schunk released its EGL-C long-stroke gripper through which it is aiming to achieve comprehensive human-robot collaboration. The gripper is designed to achieve high gripping forces while complying with global safety standards.• 3D printed grippers are gaining popularity, especially in the packaging industry. For instance, Carecos Kosmetic GmbH faced an issue with its packaging process and solved it with 3D plastic grippers. The company initially used aluminum gripper that cost more than USD 11,500 per part and needed six weeks to execute a changeover. But with 3D printed plastic grippers, it was able to economically produce small batches.• The safety of the robots and the surrounding environment is slowly coming into the forefront for the industries. Keeping such emerging trends in the product development strategies, University at Buffalo has developed a two-fingered dynamic gripper that could contribute to better grasping as well as improve safety for robots that work around people. The design of the robotic hand enables it to absorb energy from impacts during collisions.• According to the International Federation of Robotics (IFR), growth in installed base of operational robots is forecasted to increase the market for grippers.Asia Pacific to Witness the Highest Growth• Rapid growth in modernization & industrialization across the region and most of the production industries shifting towards automation of their process methods to reduce the workforce drive the market's growth in the Asia-Pacific region. Additionally, there is increasing deployment of collaborative robots in the electronics, automotive, and other sectors to increase productivity.• Industry 4.0, the newest industrial revolution, has boosted the development of new technologies, like collaborative robots; AI-enabled robots have enabled industries to use robots to increase efficiency, eliminate errors, and streamline many processes. Increased workplace safety and enhanced production capabilities have further encouraged industries to invest in robotic systems.• The presence of countries with high investments and initiatives in the technological automation area has aided in adopting robots in the region. Japan can be regarded as one of the leaders in the employment of robotics and automation in the production processes with the highly developed robotic sector and automation technologies.• According to the latest IFR report published in 2019, Japan stands second globally, with 55.2 thousand annual installation industrial robots after China, with 154 thousand yearly installations. The country is also the largest manufacturer of industrial robots catering to 52% of the global demand.• The Chinese Government launched the "Made in China 2025" policy. This has arisen as a notable focus across the country's entire manufacturing community to remain the largest manufacturing sector.Key Topics Covered:1 INTRODUCTION2 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY3 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY4 MARKET DYNAMICS4.1 Market Overview4.2 Market Drivers4.2.1 Automation of Industrial Operations4.3 Market Restraints4.3.1 Difficulty in Integration with Existing Processes and Operations4.5 Industry Value Chain Analysis4.6 Assessment of Impact of COVID-19 on the Market5 MARKET SEGMENTATION5.1 Type5.1.1 Grippers5.1.2 Clamps5.1.3 Suction Cups5.1.4 Other Types5.2 End User Industry5.2.1 Automotive5.2.2 Food & Beverage5.2.3 E-Commerce5.2.4 Pharmaceutical5.2.5 Other End User Industries5.3 Geography5.3.1 North America5.3.2 Europe5.3.3 Asia Pacific5.3.4 Rest of the World6 COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE6.1 Company Profiles*6.1.1 ABB Group6.1.2 DESTACO Europe GmbH6.1.3 Zimmer Group6.1.4 Schunk GmbH6.1.5 J.

These Two Catalysts Are Pushing Crypto Markets To New HighsAmerican Banking and Market NewsFebruary 8, 2021 MondayCopyright 2021 American Banking and Market News All Rights ReservedLength: 592 wordsBodyBitcoin And Tesla, The EV-Crypto CrossoverBitcoin (BTC ) made headlines this morning when it surged to set a new all-time. The new high which was just shy of $45,000 comes exactly one month after the last record-setting high was reached. Oddly, Bitcoin made headlines again with the aid of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA ) when the EV leader announced a major purchase. Tesla, under the guidance of its visionary and eccentric CEO Elon Musk, revealed it had purchased $1.5 billion worth of the world s leading cryptocurrency as it readies itself to accept Bitcoin payments. According to the filing, the company will begin accepting Bitcoin  in the near future. Tesla says it may or may not liquidate the Bitcoin upon acceptance which opens the door to trading gains and losses in the coming quarters. The move was foreshadowed by a Tweet made by musk just a week earlier. He talked the coin up as  on the verge of getting broad acceptance by conventional finance people. In our opinion, if it wasn't already the move by Tesla will help spur it along. Tesla surged more than 2.0% following the announcement but that move is more to do with China s rising EV sales than the BTC purchase. China reported this morning that auto sales rose by 25.7% in the country with sales led by EV . Bitcoin, on the other hand, surged more than 13% because of and in the wake of the Tesla purchase. The move created a very large white candle that broke the coin out to a new all-time high and set it up for another $7,150 in gains or 16.25% upside. And we think that estimate is conservative . Ethereum Futures Begin Trading At The CMENot only is the breadth of cryptocurrency adoption widening but so is the depth. That can be seen in many places ranging from the growing market share seen in some of the alt-coins and also in the mainstream acceptance of a widneing number of coins. Hence the move seen today in Ethereum (ETH ). Ethereum futures began trading on the CME this morning to little fanfare. The new contract, worth 50 Ether, is a cash-settled trade just like the CME s Bitcoin futures. For those of you that remember, the 2018 peak in Bitcoin (and all of cryptocurrency) prices was very nearly coincident with the launch of CME Bitcoin futures. While historical performance has great bearing on future price action those expecting Ethereum to see the same bearishness should take caution . Not only were the market conditions in 2018 vastly different than they are now there is not the specter of regulation and specifically Chinese regulation hanging over the market. Yes, the launch of Bitcoin futures was coincident with the top in cryptocurrency prices but it was not the cause of it. The Chinese government began a series of regulatory crackdowns in late 2017 and early 2018 that triggered the sell off. The bulk of the Bitcoin mining capacity was in China at the time and all those miners with their millions in Bitcoin flooded to the exits. Things are different now. Ethereum: The Technical OutlookEthereum prices spiked more than 6.0% on Monday but this move is more to do with Bitcoin and Elon Musk (not to mention the growing value locked into Ethereum defi contracts) than it does with the CME futures. CME traders going short are already felling pain with the price of Ethereum not only moving up but very near the all-time high and begin led higher by Bitcoin. Now that price action is back above the $1,700 level a retest of the $1,763 all-time high  will likely come very soon. Once that level is broken a move up to the $1900 to $2,000 range is expected.Load-Date: February 8, 2021End of Document

Dow Jones Rises To Record High As Tesla Buys Bitcoin; Market Rally Warning SignsInvestor's Business DailyFebruary 8, 2021Copyright 2021 Investor's Business Daily, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: STOCK MARKET TODAYLength: 2242 wordsByline: ED CARSONBodyhttps://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/stock-capital-hill-redSky-01-shutter.jpgThe Dow Jones rose to record highs Monday, along with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite, though they pared morning gains slightly. Tesla stock rose on a big Bitcoin purchase even as the Chinese government looks into various quality claims.The House gave final approval Friday night to a budget resolution that paves the way for President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus plan. Coronavirus vaccinations have picked up the pace, crossing another milestone, as new Covid cases keep falling.Apple stock, Walt Disney, JPMorgan Chase, Nike and Caterpillar are five Dow Jones giants in or near buy points.Tesla Bitcoin NewsTesla has bought $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin, it disclosed in an SEC filing. The EV maker said it plans to start accepting Bitcoin for payment soon.The Bitcoin price surged to a record high around $44,000 on the Tesla news. CEO Elon Musk has signaled his support for Bitcoin, along with a slew of tweets touting the cryptocurrency Dogecoin.Tesla stock rose 2% intraday.Earlier, China's market regulator and four government agencies met with Tesla regarding growing customer complaints about quality, ranging from battery fires, sudden acceleration and over-the-air update failures. They warned Tesla to operate within the law.Also, the China Passenger Car Association said made-in-China Tesla sales came in at 15,484 in January. That apparently includes Tesla Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. That's down from November and December, though that could reflect some Model 3 production being shipped to Europe.Nio, Xpeng Motors, Li Auto and BYD Co. have already released January production and sales figures.Overall China electric vehicle production was 154,000 in January, up 477% vs. a year earlier, CPCA said. Retail sales leapt 299% to 130,000.Nio rose solidly Monday while Xpeng and Li Auto fell slightly.On Sunday, China released official rules to stop monopolistic behavior among internet firms and platforms. The rules will limit sharing of consumer data and forging alliances or subsidizing services to crush smaller rivals. Draft guidelines were unveiled last November as regulators began a crackdown, especially on Alibaba. Alibaba stock is recovering from that crackdown, while others such as Pinduoduo have risen sharply.  BABA stock, JD.com and PDD stock fell slightly.In a related note, Vipshop said market regulators have determined it violated competition rules and have levied a 3 million yuan fine. VIPS stock was little changed.3 Enterprise Software Leaders Near Buy Points Ahead Of EarningsThe stock market rally is looking strong, buoyed by generally strong earnings and Biden stimulus progress. The indexes are at record highs with several new breakouts. Growth stocks overall had powerful week, with software, IPOs, cyclicals, China names and more big winners. Several chip stocks ran into trouble, but the sector did rise.But the market is getting increasingly extended, among other warning signs.Disney earnings are on tap Thursday night, but Apple, JPMorgan and Caterpillar stock have already reported while Nike isn't due for more than a month.Apple stock and Tesla stock are on IBD Leaderboard. CAT stock and VIPS stock are on SwingTrader.Congress Fast Tracks Biden StimulusThe House voted Friday night to provide formal, final approval to a budget resolution fast tracks the $1.9 trillion Biden stimulus proposal. The 219-209 party-line House vote came after the Senate approved the resolution early Friday, with Vice President Kamala Harris casting the tiebreaker vote. The House had already approved the budget resolution on Wednesday, but had to OK the Senate's largely symbolic changes.The budget resolution means a Biden stimulus plan can pass with a bare majority, instead of needing 60 Senate votes to avoid a filibuster. Democratic lawmakers will start crafting the actual stimulus legislation soon, with final passage possible by late February.Because of Democrats' narrow majorities, the Biden stimulus plan could be slimmed down even without any Republican votes. Negotiating with moderate Democrats could also win over some centrist GOP senators.President Biden cited Friday's weak jobs report as a reason to swiftly pass his stimulus plan. That thinking is one reason why the stock market rally had a solid session. He's already signaled he's willing to lower the income limits on new direct stimulus check, but he's insisting that each check be $1,400.Biden did concede Friday that a $15 minimum wage is unlikely to be included in the stimulus. A budget reconciliation bill is only supposed to include tax and spending items. It's also supposed to be deficit neutral over 10 years.Dow Jones TodayThe Dow Jones rose 0.5% intraday, hitting a record high. The S&P 500 advanced 0.4% and the Nasdaq composite 0.6%, both also hitting all-time levels in the morning.Join IBD experts as they analyze actionable stocks in the stock market rally on IBD Live.Coronavirus NewsCoronavirus cases worldwide reached 106.82 million. Covid-19 deaths topped 2.33 million.Coronavirus cases in the U.S. have hit 27.61 million, with deaths above 475,000.Meanwhile, new Covid cases and hospitalizations continue to fall sharply, while deaths are now clearly trending lower.Roughly 2.1 million Americans got a coronavirus vaccine shot on Saturday, topping two million for the first time. That cleared Friday's then-record mark of 1.8 million. On Sunday, about 1.5 million vaccinations took place, in line with the seven-day average.Just over 32 million have received at least one shot of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, with 9.4 million getting both shots.More coronavirus vaccines are on the way, Johnson & Johnson and Novavax requesting FDA emergency approval late last week and AstraZeneca likely to follow in the coming weeks. The J&J vaccine is a one-shot treatment.The Chicago and San Francisco school districts have reached tentative deals with teachers unions to resume in-classroom schooling, amid growing outcry from parents. President Biden said in a Sunday interview that it's time for schools to open "safely," adding that new ventilation systems should be installed. He said the CDC will outline school reopening guidelines, perhaps as soon as Wednesday.Beyond the educational benefits for students, schools reopening would likely spur many parents, especially mothers, to rejoin the workforce.Stock Market RallyThe stock market rally raced back from the prior week's sell-off back to all-time highs for the S&P 500, Nasdaq and small-cap Russell 2000. The Dow Jones came within a whisker of record levels. Biden stimulus progress and generally positive earnings reports fueled the market rally rebound.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 3.9% in last week's stock market trading. The S&P 500 index rose 4.65%, the Nasdaq composite 6% and the Russell 2000 7.8%.Among the best ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF jumped 8.1% last week, while the Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ETF leapt 9%.  The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF rallied 8.1%. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF climbed 3.8%, but stalled after Monday.Read The Big Picture every day to stay in sync with the market direction and leading stocks and sectors.Breakout Watch: Stock With 539% Gain Enters New Buy ZoneDow Jones Stocks Near Buy PointsWhile growth investors tend to focus on tech and other traditional growth areas, why look at five Dow Jones stocks? Apple is still a growth name, if mature. Disney stock has been rallying on Disney+ and other streaming hopes. Caterpillar and JPMorgan are economic cyclical plays, along with Disney and Nike, that are rallying with hopes for a post-pandemic economic recovery.More broadly, these stocks, with their heft and different sectors, can offer diversity to a portfolio of highflying IPOs and other volatile growth names.IBD Stock Of The Day: Is This Covid-19 Play Ready For Another Big Run?Apple StockApple stock rebounded 3.6% last week to 136.76, rebounding from its 10-week line and finding support at its 21-day exponential moving average. Investors could buy AAPL stock now, but it's close to reclaiming the official 138.89 buy point from a cup-with-handle base. Also, 145.19 could be an alternate entry from a short consolidation above and below the buy point. Finally, investors could use a short trend line from that mini-consolidation, though that Apple stock entry would likely be close to 138.89.Apple Car buzz heated up last week, with reports that the tech giant is close to a manufacturing deal with Hyundai-Kia on an Apple-branded electric car. But a late Friday report said those talks had stalled, with Apple still considering other automakers. Hyundai said overnight that it's not in talks with Apple.Apple stock fell slightly Monday.Nike StockNike stock jumped 8.6% last week to 145.11, rebounding above the 50-day and 10-week line. Actionable right now, shares of the athletic apparel and shoe giant are close to a 148.05 flat-base buy point. NKE stock edged lower Monday.Caterpillar StockCAT stock jumped 5.6% to 193 last week, rebounding from its 50-day line and a prior short consolidation. On Tuesday, Caterpillar stock cleared its 21-day line and a short trend line, offering a buying opportunity that's still viable. The construction and mining equipment giant has been consolidating for a few weeks that could eventually be a flat base. There is an existing 200.27 three-weeks-tight entry.CAT stock rose slightly Monday.JPMorgan StockJPMorgan stock leapt 7.2% to 137.98 last week, still within reach of its 10-week line. JPM stock is nearing 142.85 buy point from a cup-with-handle base going back to January 2020. JPMorgan stock rose slightly Monday.The 10-year Treasury yield is at 2020 highs, while short-term rates are still rock bottom. That widening yield spread is good news for banks' core business of borrowing short and lending long.Disney StockDisney stock rallied 7.7% last week to 181.15, rebounding from its 10-week line. DIS stock jumped nearly 5% Monday, rising above a 183.50 flat-base buy point, according to MarketSmith analysis.But buying ahead of Disney earnings on Thursday is risky.In the upcoming Disney earnings report, Disney+ subscription growth and other streaming news may continue to be the catalyst for DIS stock. On other fronts, such as theme parks and movie studios, that will require the economy to open up as coronavirus vaccinations hit a critical mass.Stock Market Rally AnalysisLast week's rebound was surprising. After the prior week's sharp losses, more selling, sideways action or a modest bounce seemed more likely. But the stock market rally had other ideas.Unfortunately, by running back go and beyond the old highs, the Nasdaq is once again looking extended. It's 7.4% above its 50-day moving average. When that's 6% or higher, the odds of a pullback are relatively high. Now, the Nasdaq certainly can become more extended. It closed 8.2% above its 50-day line on Jan. 25, just before that week's losses. In late August, the Nasdaq became increasingly extended, finally closing 11.6% over the 50-day on Sept. 2.But the more extended the Nasdaq gets above its 50-day line, the greater the risk that the ultimate pullback will be substantial. After Sept. 2, the Nasdaq tumbled in the next three sessions closing below its 50-day line. The composite continued to slide in the September correction.Other warning signs are out there.While the stock market rally's broad-based gains are a positive, there can be too much of a good thing. On Friday, 70% of all stocks are above their 50-day and 200-day lines. That's unusually high.Meanwhile, investor leverage is high. Margin debt is rising at the fastest pace in seven years, but skyrocketing call options suggest exposure is increasing even more rapidly.Big Picture: Market Hits New Highs; Why Investors Cannot Relax NowWhat Investors Should DoDespite those warning signals, the bottom line is that the stock market rally is still healthy, with the major indexes and leading stocks in great shape.So you don't need to be defensive, but be cautious about new purchases.New buys just before a pullback often will run into trouble, forcing investors to quickly cut losses.At the beginning of a stock market rally, investors might rush to build exposure, much like an old-style Black Friday, with a well-researched shopping list in hand. In the current environment, you need to be more selective, going through the aisles for some limited buys, if any. In fact, you might want to "return" some of your stocks to the market, taking partial profits or cutting laggards or losers.Are you comfortable with your current level of exposure, and which stocks you're holding?Have a game plan for your stocks, so you'll know what to do in various circumstances. Continue to go through screens, building your watch lists. Investors should always be preparing for new buys, and the process also helps you see which market groups and segments are leading.Please follow Ed Carson on Twitter at @IBD_ECarson for stock market updates and more.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch Being Bought By The Top Mutual FundsFive Stocks Racing Past Buy PointsWhy This IBD Tool Simplifies TheSearchFor Top StocksBest Growth Stocks To Buy And WatchIBD Digital: Unlock IBD's Premium Stock Lists, Tools And Analysis TodayFutures: Rally Hits Record High, As Bitcoin Surges On Tesla NewsLoad-Date: February 10, 2021End of Document

Global stocks rise as Wall Street braces for more turbulenceCNN WireFebruary 1, 2021 Monday 10:16 AM GMTCopyright 2021 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 495 wordsByline: By Rob McLean, Laura He and Hanna Ziady, CNN BusinessDateline: NEW YORK / HONG KONG / LONDON (CNN Business) BodyNEW YORK / HONG KONG / LONDON (CNN Business) --  Global stocks and US futures advanced Monday as Wall Street prepared for what could be another week of rocky trading fueled by small investors on Reddit. Silver futures surged as online attention shifted to the precious metal.Dow futures were last up 177 points, or 0.6%, reversing course from a 0.8% tumble earlier. S&P 500 futures were up 0.8%, while Nasdaq futures climbed nearly 1%. European markets opened with gains, while major Asian indexes advanced.Some investors are once again turning their attention to vaccine rollouts and a stimulus deal in the United States, chief global markets strategist at Axi, Stephen Innes, wrote in a research note Monday. "Risk is trying to regain its footing but Covid vaccine efficacy concerns and the Reddit Red Raider [are] still on investors' minds," he added.US markets are coming off of their worst week since October. Investors were captivated by stock moves spurred by traders coordinating their buys on a message board called WallStreetBets. The Reddit forum sent GameStop, AMC and other heavily shorted stocks skyrocketing, roiling markets and crushing some hedge funds that had bet against the stocks.Questions about whether President Joe Biden's proposed $1.9 trillion stimulus package can actually get passed, along with uncertainty over the coronavirus vaccine rollout, also kept investors on edge. "The good thing is that most market forecast anticipates a smaller package that happens sooner," said Innes.Global markets moved higher on Monday. London's FTSE 100 gained 0.6% in early morning trade. Germany's DAX was 1.1% higher, while France's CAC 40 was up 0.9%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng finished 2.2% higher, while South Korea's Kospi rose 2.7%. Japan's Nikkei gained 1.6% and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 0.8%. China's Shanghai Composite added 0.6%. The country's manufacturing activity expanded in January, a closely watched private survey showed Monday --- albeit at the slowest pace in seven months. Recent survey data from the Chinese government showed similar slow growth in manufacturing and services activity. It's a sign that fresh coronavirus outbreaks in the country may be hampering the recovery of the world's second largest economy, though not derailing it entirely. Meanwhile, there were signs of Redditors targeting precious metals. Silver futures surged as much as 8.5% to above $29 late Sunday, touching five-month highs. That follows a 6% rally last week.Retail sites warned customers over the weekend they could not meet skyrocketing demand for silver bars and coins. And "#silversqueeze" is trending on Twitter.Silver producers jumped in Asia as futures for the precious metal surged. China Silver Group soared nearly 30% in Hong Kong, for example. Chinese silver futures also jumped nearly 9% in Shanghai.-- Anneken Tappe and Matt Egan contributed to this report.TM & © 2021 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Dozens of Hong Kong pro-democracy leaders arrestedUPIJanuary 5, 2021 Tuesday 11:07 PM ESTCopyright 2021 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 667 wordsByline: DARRYL COOTEDateline: Jan. 5 BodyAuthorities in Hong Kong have arrested dozens of pro-democracy politicians and opposition leaders in an early morning sweep Wednesday on accusations of subverting a draconian national security law Beijing imposed on the former British colony in the summer, according to posts on social media.Lo Kin-hei, chairman of the Hong Kong Democratic Party, said upwards of 50 people who participated in last year's pro-democracy primary in Hong Kong have been arrested."I lost count already," he said via Twitter. "Very likely over 40 or even 50."The Democratic Party confirmed former lawmakers James To, Andrew Wan, Lam Cheuk Ting, Wu Chi Wai, Tiffany Yuen and Gary Fan were among those arrested.Kwok Ka Ki, one of four lawmakers dismissed in November, announced his arrest on Twitter."Being arrested for sedition for taking part in democracy," he said.The majority of those arrested participated in primaries for September's Legislative Council election that democratic politicians held in an effort to whittle candidates down to ensure they could elect at least 35 people to secure a majority in the Legislative Council.Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam postponed the election a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic after 12 pan-democratic politicians, including prominent activist Joshua Wong, were disqualified from running.The Hong Kong government said the disqualification was because the politicians wouldn't uphold the Basic Law, which Beijing had on the last day of June amended with a new national security law that criminalizes acts of secession, sedition, subversion, terrorism and working with foreign agencies to undermine the national security of China.Beijing's Hong Kong Liaison Office said the pro-democracy primaries were "illegal.""With the support of external forces, opposition groups and leaders deliberately planned to hold this so-called primary election, which is a serious provocation to the current electoral system, a serious violation of the fairness and justice of the Legislative Council election and a serious damage to the legitimate rights and interest of other candidates," the liaison office said in a statement.A post Wednesday on the official Twitter account for Wong, who is serving more than a year in prison for his role protests in 2019, said police raided his house Wednesday morning "for allegedly violating the nationals security law ... as he took part in the primary election last year."Maya Wang, senior China researcher at Human Rights Watch, said the arrests remove "the remaining veneer of democracy in the city.""Beijing once again has failed to learn from its mistakes in Hong Kong: that repression generates resistance, and that millions of Hong Kong people will persist in their struggle for their right to vote and run for office in a democratically elected government," she said in a statement.Hong Kong Watch said, "Beijing is once again undermining Hong Kong's democracy &amp; breaching its obligations under the Sino-British Joint Declaration," which returned Hong Kong to Chinese rule in 1997."The International community must respond with Magnitsky sanctions and other punitive measures demonstrating that an attack on democracy has consequences," it said in a statement.The arrests are expected to be condemned by Western nations, including the United States, which has imposed punitive measures against the Hong Kong and Chinese governments over their repression of pro-democracy protests in the former British colony.Antony Blinken, whom President-elect Joe Biden picked to be his secretary of state, described Wednesday's arrests in a tweet as "an assault on those bravely advocating for universal rights.""The Biden-Harris administration will stand with the people of Hong Kong and against Beijing's crackdown on democracy," he said.Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., a member of the Senate select committee, condemned the arrests in a statement, saying, "these despicable raids expose the Chinese Communist Party for the cowardly dictators they are."Load-Date: January 6, 2021End of Document

Tesla injects power into bitcoin with a thousand 500 mddCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 9, 2021 TuesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 658 wordsBodyTesla invested $500 million in bitcoin and plans to start accepting it as payment in one of the highest-profile backups in the cryptocurrency sector by a major U.S. company.The electric car manufacturer's revelation caused the cryptocurrency to record an uptick to reach an all-time high of $44,100, expanding its 50 percent increase so far this year. Analysts attribute the metheoric uptick to the growing enthusiasm of institutional investors seeking returns in the era of low interest rates.In a regulatory presentation, Tesla yesterday reported buying bitcoins after changing its investment policy last month to "diversify and maximize" its cash yields.For years Tesla had a lack of liquidity as it invested heavily in the development of its electric vehicles. Although its finances have already improved, bitcoin investment still accounts for about 8 percent of the $19.4 billion it had in cash and liquid assets by the end of December, according to the presentation.The group indicated that it expects to accept bitcoin as a form of payment for its products, although at the outset it will be "limited", adding that it will be able to sell digital assets in strong currency once payments are processed.Elon Musk, founder of Tesla, has been a vocal advocate of digital social media assets, particularly dogecoin, on which he said it was the "people's cryptocurrency." In December, he wrote on his Twitter account that bitcoin was his "security word," in what was in appearance a joke.Robyn Denholm, an Australian telecommunications executive who replaced Musk as chairman of Tesla's board of directors in 2018, is the head of the audit committee that approved the change in the company's investment policy. The change allows Tesla to invest "a portion" of its cash in "alternative reserve assets, including digital assets and gold bars."The automaker is the latest consumer-oriented company to venture into cryptocurrency markets, after PayPal; however, digital currencies remain highly volatile and are risky to maintain due to frequent hacking and fraud, as well as difficulties in transferring them to cash."We believe that our bitcoin holdings are very liquid. However, digital assets may be subject to volatile market prices, which can be unfavourable at any time we want or need to liquidate them," Tesla said yesterday."This is a move that potentially changes the game for the use of bitcoin from a transaction perspective," said Dan Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities.Ives added that Tesla's announcement can prompt other companies to make similar decisions given the growing interest in digital currencies."Investors and other industry analysts will be watching this closely to see if other corporations follow Tesla's example on this path to cryptocurrencies or, on the other hand, it's still a group that contains a few names that makes this strategic leap around bitcoin."Eric Turner, vice president of market intelligence at data firm and messari cryptocurrency research, said, "I think we'll see an acceleration of companies looking to use bitcoins now that Tesla took the first step.""One of the world's largest companies now owns bitcoins and therefore all investors with Tesla (or even an S&P; 500 fund) will also have exposure," he added.Tesla is the last company to add bitcoins toits treasury following similar moves made by Square, the twitter-led payment company, Jack Dorsey, and the U.S. software firm MicroStrategy.With information from: ReutersRegulatorsChinese government officials met with Tesla representatives in response to growing consumer reports of battery fires, unexpected accelerations, and software update failures.ConsumersChina's State Administration for Market Regulation urged the company to operate in accordance with Chinese law and to protect consumer rights.AssemblyTesla builds Model 3 electric sedans and Model Y sports vehicles in its Shanghai factory; in January it sold 15,484 cars made in China.Load-Date: February 10, 2021End of Document

Preliminary gold production for the fourth quarter of 2020 increased 16% to 138,220 ounces compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.Preliminary 2020 gold production at Lamaque exceeded guidance despite a three-week shutdown in early Spring related to government-mandated COVID-19 operating restrictions. The strong performance at Lamaque was partially offset by lower labour availability impacting leach pad flow rates at Kisladag during the second quarter. Kisladag finished the year with strong fourth-quarter gold production, driven by improving heap leach performance.The Company also announced today that Steve Reid has been appointed Chair of the Board, replacing George Albino, who will remain on the Eldorado Board as a Director. Steve Reid has served as a Director on the Eldorado Board since May 2013. He has over 40 years of experience in the mineral resource industry.

Before joining Goldcorp, Mr. Reid spent 13 years at Placer Dome in numerous corporate, mine management and operating roles.06:00BNTX BioNTech and Pfizer (PFE) study shows its vaccine elicits antibodies that neutralize SARS-CoV-2 with a mutation associated with rapid transmission (93.69 )Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech SE (BNTX) announced results from an in vitro study conducted by Pfizer and the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) that shows the antibodies from people who have received the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine effectively neutralize SARS-CoV-2 with a key mutation that is also found in two highly transmissible strains. The results were published on the preprint server bioRxiv and are available here.Rapidly spreading variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, initially in the United Kingdom and South Africa. These variants have multiple mutations in their spike or S glycoproteins, which are key targets of virus neutralizing antibodies. Though these two rapidly spreading viruses are different, they share the N501Y mutation, which is located in the receptor binding site of the spike protein and results in the virus's spike protein binding more tightly to its receptor. It has been shown to infect mice more efficiently.iTo determine if sera of people who had received the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine could neutralize SARS-CoV-2 with the N501Y mutation, a virus with this substitution was generated in UTMB's laboratory. The sera of 20 participants from the previously reported Phase 3 trial neutralized the virus with the mutation as well as they neutralized virus without the mutation. While the virus tested in this experiment did not include the full set of spike mutations found on the rapidly spreading strains in the U.K. or South Africa, neutralization of virus with the N501Y mutation by the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine-elicited human sera is consistent with preserved neutralization of a panel of 15 pseudoviruses bearing spikes with other mutations found in circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains. This indicates that the key N501Y mutation, which is found in the emerging U.K and South Africa variants, does not create resistance to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine induced immune responses. Pfizer, BioNTech, and UTMB are encouraged by these early, in vitro study findings. Further data are needed to monitor the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine's effectiveness in preventing COVID-19 caused by new virus variants. If the virus mutates such that an update to the vaccine is required to continue to confer protection against COVID-19, we believe that the flexibility of BioNTech's proprietary mRNA vaccine platform is well suited to enable an adjustment to the vaccine.06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- Markets trade higher ahead of US jobs reportThe global equity markets are mostly higher with US futures pointing to modest gains to begin the day.

SRP-9001 is an investigational gene transfer therapy intended to deliver its micro-dystrophin-encoding gene to muscle tissue for the targeted production of the micro-dystrophin protein.At 12 weeks post-treatment compared to baseline, the study met its primary biological endpoint of micro-dystrophin protein expression (P<0.0001). Participants who received SRP-9001 (n=20) had mean micro-dystrophin expression of 28.1%, as measured by western blot. Accompanying secondary biological endpoints including vector genome copies per nucleus, percent positive fibers, intensity, and reduction in creatine kinase (exploratory) were also met.In the primary functional endpoint, SRP-9001-treated participants showed an increase in NSAA total score compared to placebo at 48 weeks; however, the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.37). At every time point measured, the cohort of SRP-9001 treated participants outperformed the placebo group, and, at 48 weeks, participants in the treatment group demonstrated a statistically significant increase of 1.7 points in NSAA total score compared to baseline (P=0.009), while participants in the placebo group saw an increase of 0.9 points on the NSAA total score compared to baseline, which was not statistically significant (n=21, P=0.1411).In the pre-specified analysis by age-group, by which the randomization was stratified, participants aged 4-5 years at time of treatment with SRP-9001 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in NSAA total score versus the age-matched placebo cohort, achieving a 4.3-point improvement on NSAA at 48 weeks post-treatment from baseline.The results from Study 102 reinforce the "favorable" safety and tolerability profile of SRP-9001, with no new safety signals identified.16:16WRAPX Closing Stock Market SummaryEach of the major indices closed at record highs on Thursday in a momentum trade led by the technology stocks. The Nasdaq Composite outperformed with an impressive 2.6% gain, followed by solid gains in the Russell 2000 (+1.9%), S&P 500 (+1.5%), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%).Risk sentiment broadened out to nine of the 11 S&P 500 sectors. The information technology (+2.7%), consumer discretionary (+1.8%), energy (+1.5%), and financials (+1.5%) sectors were the best-performing sectors; conversely, the utilities (-1.3%) and consumer staples (-0.3%) sectors closed lower.Investors bought yesterday's dip in the broader technology space and continued to bid up shares of Tesla (TSLA 816.04, +60.06, +7.9%), which was upgraded to Sector Perform from Underperform at RBC Capital Mkts after the firm conceded it was wrong about the stock.In addition, the oft-repeated recovery narrative was on display after Democrats flipped both Senate seats in Georgia yesterday, giving them slim majority in the Senate, and the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index rose to a better-than-expected 57.2% in December (Briefing.com consensus 54.7%) from 55.9% in November.The projected Democratic majority in the Senate contributed to the continued selling pressure in longer-dated Treasuries amid the possibility for more fiscal stimulus. These respective yields moved higher.The 10-yr yield increased three basis points to 1.07%, while the 2-yr yield was flat at 0.14%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 89.84. WTI crude futures increased 0.5%, or $0.24, to $50.81/bbl.In other corporate news, shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA 45.26, +2.23, +5.2%) rose 5% after beating top and bottom-line estimates, while DXC Technology (DXC 28.91, +2.46, +9.3%) received an acquisition proposal from French IT firm Atos for reportedly more than $10 billion.Reviewing Thursday's economic data:The ISM Non-Manufacturing Index rose to 57.2% in December (Briefing.com consensus 54.7%) from 55.9% in November. The dividing line between expansion and contraction is 50.0%. The December reading reflects a faster pace of expansion than the prior month, and it is the seventh consecutive reading above 50.0%.The key takeaway from the report is that the Employment Index, which dipped below 50.0%, blemished an otherwise solid snapshot of the services sector in December.Initial claims for the week ending January 2 decreased by 3,000 to 787,000 (Briefing.com consensus 752,000). Continuing claims for the week ending December 26 decreased by 126,000 to 5.072 million.The key takeaway from the report is that initial claims are still coming in at a stubbornly high level, which sends a poor signal about the state of the labor market.The U.S. trade deficit widened to $68.1 billion in November (Briefing.com consensus -$67.1 billion) from an unrevised $63.1 billion in October.The key takeaway from the report is that it showed another increase in exports and imports, indicating an uptick in global trade.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Employment Situation Report for December, Consumer Credit for November, and Wholesale Inventories for November on Friday.Russell 2000 +6.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +1.4% YTDNasdaq Composite +1.4% YTDS&P 500 +1.3% YTD16:14AIRG Airgain reports preliminary Q4 revenue inline with consensus; also announces acquisition of NimbeLink (17.19 -0.08)Co reports in-line preliminary Q4 revenue of $12.8 mln vs. the $12.82 mln S&P Capital IQ consensus.

Senior-friendly apps: Making technology more accessiblePR NewswireJanuary 8, 2021 Friday 9:01 AM ESTCopyright 2021 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 523 wordsDateline: BEIJING, Jan. 8, 2021 BodyPR NewswireA news report by China.org.cn on China's recent campaign for bridging the digital divide for the elderly: Starting this January, many popular Chinese apps and websites such as WeChat, Taobao and Douyin will be redesigned to make them more senior-friendly.These redesigns are aimed at solving challenges faced by the elderly in using new intelligent technologies. Specifically, the measures include: launching senior-friendly products with accessible and easy-to-use interfaces; and improving the accuracy of dialect-recognition systems to allow the elderly who can't speak Mandarin to use voice commands. Also, on apps set to "senior mode," there will be no mobile ads, or any design that lures people into extra payments; and people over 65 will be able to reach a customer services representative over the phone without the need to follow overly complicated voice prompts or input text via keypad. According to reports, 115 websites and 43 apps are planning to roll out custom features and barrier-free designs for the elderly this year.Many have described these new changes as truly heartwarming.Nowadays, people in China use their cellphones for everything: Ordering taxis, making payments, booking train tickets and ordering takeaway. However, among the 274 million senior cellphone users in China, nearly 140 million don't have internet access or never enjoyed the benefits of a smartphone. As smart technology becomes increasingly widespread, the elderly can sometimes run into problems. For example, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a "health code" is required to enter many public places in China. However, this has made it difficult for many senior citizens to get around if they don't know how to use a smartphone or the "health code." Therefore, recently, the call for solving the difficulties that the elderly face when using smart technology has become stronger in China.Making websites and apps more senior-friendly is a new campaign initiated by the Chinese government to help the elderly bridge the digital divide, which responds to the needs of the people.In China, a country that values respect for one's elders, these measures demonstrate the tradition of caring for the elderly. In the context of an ageing population, China hopes to improve services for the elderly through these thoughtful and timely policies to let them share in the fruits of the booming digital economy.If China's app-based and smart technology innovations that have attracted world's attention reflect the "speed" of development, these redesigns and custom measures reflect the "warmth" of policies. Improving technologies, changing ways of thinking and adjusting policies to provide custom solutions for the elderly shows human-centered care in tune with the demands of the times and society.China Mosaichttp://www.china.org.cn/video/node_7230027.htmSenior-friendly apps: Making technology more accessiblehttp://www.china.org.cn/video/2021-01/08/content_77094282.htm View original content to download multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/senior-friendly-apps-making-technology-more-accessible-301203293.htmlSOURCE China.org.cnCONTACT: Ni Jingjing, +86-10-8882-8131, pr@china.org.cnLoad-Date: January 8, 2021End of Document

Artificial Intelligence Market with COVID-19 Impact in Homeland Security & Public Safety - 2020-2025; Artificial Intelligence in Homeland Security and National Security Market is Growing. Artificial intelligence (AI) is likely one of the most dramatic technological game changers of this era with the potential to transform the way homeland security, public safety and national security organizations conduct their operations.GlobeNewswireJanuary 14, 2021 Thursday 1:20 AM PTCopyright 2021 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: MARKET RESEARCH REPORTSLength: 1637 wordsBodyNew York, Jan.  14, 2021  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Reportlinker.com announces the release of the report "Artificial Intelligence Market with COVID-19 Impact in Homeland Security & Public Safety - 2020-2025" - https://www.reportlinker.com/p06007735/?utm_source=GNW  Nearly every aspect of national security could be shaped by artificial intelligence, as AI has applications for defense, intelligence, homeland security, diplomacy, surveillance, cybersecurity, information, and economic tools of statecraft.AI is a system's ability to correctly interpret external data, to learn from such data, and to use those learnings to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible adaptation. Technology platforms and solutions for Artificial Intelligence in Homeland Security, National Security, Law Enforcement and Public Safety market can be divided into 3 main technological markets    hardware, software and services and 4 technological sub-markets    machine learning, natural language processing, robotics & expert systems and machine vision & hearing.Homeland Security and National Security organizations are mandated with "keeping their country safe", including anything to do with potential threats to the nation, ranging from border security to cybersecurity. As they routinely handle large amounts of data, the shift from using tools and technologies to gather, capture and analyze "big data" to the use of artificial intelligence technologies that rely on automated, data-driven, or algorithmic learning procedures was inevitable.Douglas Maughan, former Cybersecurity Division Director at U.S. Homeland Security Advanced Research Project Agency, described the role of AI as:"AI technology is increasingly providing us with new knowledge and informing our actions. Fueled by sensors, data digitization, and ever-increasing connectedness, AI filters, associates, prioritizes, classifies, measures, and predicts outcomes, allowing the Federal government to make more informed, data-driven decisions."Many national security organizations across the globe have already taken steps toward further R&D and implementation of AI and machine learning technologies into their various operations. Among homeland security operations that would receive significant operational improvements using AI and machine learning technologies are:• Border security and Customs• Emergency response• Prevention of domestic terrorism• Critical infrastructure protection• Government intelligence agencies• LEAs & 1st responders• Other national security, public safety and homeland security organizationsThe "Artificial Intelligence Market in Homeland Security, Public Safety & National Security: 2020-2025" report forecasts that this industry's revenues will grow at a 2019-2025 CAGR of 18.5%. The use of AI and machine learning by homeland security, defense, public safety organizations and intelligence agencies is on the rise, mostly because the world is becoming more digital and connected. This is creating new opportunities, not only for data collection and storage, but also for intelligence processing, exploitation, dissemination, and analysis. Artificial intelligence technologies can increase the investigative capabilities of intelligence organizations in many relevant aspects, including: war on crime & terror, defense from cyber-attacks, public safety analytics, disaster and mass incident management, and development of predictive capabilities. All fields of Intelligence benefit from AI growth including Big Data & Data Analytics Market, Osint Market, Sigint Market, Cyber defense activities, financial investigations.This market report, covering homeland security and national security AI, is a valuable resource for executives interested in AI, machine learning and big data intelligence markets. It has been explicitly customized for potential investors, AI companies, big data companies, intelligence agencies as well as security and government decision makers, to enable them to benchmark business plans, as well as identify business opportunities, emerging technologies, market trends, and risks.Questions answered in this market report include:• What will be the AI market size in homeland security, public safety and national security in 2019-2025? What will the relevant trends be during that time?• Which submarkets in this field provide attractive business opportunities?• Which countries are expected to invest most in AI capabilities within homeland security, public safety and national security organizations?• Which distinctive data sources will be used by homeland security, public safety and national security agencies and which technologies will be needed in order to exploit them?• Which market sectors are estimated to make greater use of artificial intelligence capabilities?• What are the AI and machine learning in homeland security, public safety and national security market drivers and inhibitors?The report focuses on artificial intelligence spending in the Homeland Security, Public Safety and National Security market by analyzing 4 key independent aspects.

Artificial intelligence techniques are well-suited for tracking, controlling and forecasing the spread of COVID-19 around the world. Homeland Security and Intelligence agencies are taking part in the fight to mitigate COVID-19 and are utilizing big data analytics and AI to do so. Geo-location and other mobile phone tracking technologies are only of some of the AI technologies that are being used globally by these agencies as part of a larger strategy of people tracking & tracing to mitigate the pandemic. According to our analysis, there are four different approaches or levels of surveillance that governments have chosen to implement, while using personal data at different levels to keep track of their citizens. In most countries, homeland security & public safety agencies are taking part in these operations.Singapore    using Bluetooth technologyThe "TraceTogether" app, which needs to be downloaded by the citizens, uses Bluetooth to track nearby phones (without location tracking), keeps local logs of those contacts, and only uploads them to the Ministry of Health when the user chooses/consents, presumably after a diagnosis, so those contacts can be alerted. Moreover, Singapore plans to open-source the app and has mentioned that they won't save personal data for an extended period of time (most likely over 14 days). It should be mentioned that the UK government is developing a similar app for their use.Germany    using mobile network dataThe cellular carrier Deutsche Telekom has shared location data with the government to analyze trends and big data insight, not specific movements. In general, data from cell phone carriers was used in an aggregated, anonymized format to make sure no privacy issues were broken.South Korea    using Geo-location dataUsing Geo-locating data, the government texts people to let them know if they were in the vicinity of a diagnosed individual. The information conveyed can include the person's age, gender, and detailed location history.China    using Geo-location data along with additional mass surveillance technologiesThe surveillance mechanisms are the most pervasive and draconian. In addition to the use of their mass video surveillance (CCTV) systems, the government also utilizes the widespread apps Alipay and WeChat. These apps now include health codes    green, yellow, or red    set by the Chinese government. This health status is then used in hundreds of cities (and soon nationwide) to determine whether people are allowed to ride the subway, take a train, enter a building, or even exit a highway.Read the full report: https://www.reportlinker.com/p06007735/?utm_source=GNWAbout ReportlinkerReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution.

WHO researchers look for clues in Wuhan marketCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 31, 2021 SundayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 481 wordsBodyA World Health Organization team investigating the origin of the coronavirus pandemic visited the fish market in China's Wuhan city associated with many of the early contagions on Sunday.Team members visited Huanan Fish Market for about an hour in the afternoon. One of them made a positive thumb gesture when reporters asked him how the trip was going.In December 2019, there was an outbreak of the virus in that market. Scientists thought at the time that the virus could come from wild animals sold on the market. Since then the market has been largely dismissed as the source of the epidemic, but could throw clues as to how it expanded so quickly."Visit to a very important place today, the first wholesale market and Huanan Fish Market right now,'" tweeted Peter Daszak, zoologist of the AMERICAN group EcoHealth Alliance and a member of the WHO delegation." Very informative and critical for our joint teams to understand the epidemiology of Covidwhen it began to spread at the end of 2019''.Also that day, team members were seen walking through areas of Baishazhou Market, one of the city's largest fresh produce markets, surrounded by a large entourage of Chinese officials and representatives. The site was Wuhan's food distribution center during the city's 76-day confinement last year.The entourage, which brings together experts in veterinary medicine, virology, food security and epidemiology, has now visited two hospitals that were at the center of the initial outbreak: Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital and Hubei Hospital for Western Medicine and Integrated China.On Saturday they also visited an exhibition in a museum dedicated to the initial history of The Covid-19.The mission has acquired political connotations because China is trying to avoid responsibility for alleged errors in its initial response to the outbreak.A single visit by scientists is unlikely to confirm the origin of the virus. Reducing the outbreak to an animal reserve is often an exahusive task that takes years of research with animal sample analysis, genetic testing, and epidemiological studies.One possibility is that a hunter could have spread the virus to traders, who in turn took it to Wuhan. The Chinese government has fueled theories, with little evidence, that the virus could have started with imported frozen fish, an idea flatly rejected by scientists and international agencies.NEWSLETTER 9AM From Monday to Friday, the selection of our editors of the most relevant information for each day.

A Mexican social network?CE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 15, 2021 FridayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 657 wordsBodyJanuary 15, 2021 President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has addressed at several of his recent morning conferences the issue of the suspension of Donald Trump's Twitter and Facebook accounts.It seems that this has affected him so much that yesterday he said he will take the issue of "censorship" on social media to the next G20 meeting and even that his government will explore the idea of launching a Mexican social network."We care a lot about freedom," López Obrador explained last Wednesday. "That's why it's a topic (creating a Mexican social network) that's going to be addressed by us (...) to guarantee freedom and to ensure that there is no censorship in Mexico."It is striking that the President has been so interested in this issue in the wake of the suspension of Trump's accounts. And if your concern were exclusively freedom, it is difficult to understand your repeated complaints about the work of the media and the denuesto of newspapers and journalists in their mornings, as well as their threat to end the National Institute of Access to Information.But if you're serious about your decision to launch a national social network, here's something to comment on.First, that the only country that has done this seriously has been the People's Republic of China. And not to guarantee freedom, but quite the opposite. It is well known that in July 2009 – after the riots in Urumchi – the Chinese government closed access to Twitter, Facebook and other social networks, and launched its own network, Weibo, to replace them.In 2012, users were forced to use their real names in Weibo, which is patrolled by hundreds of censors to prevent the dissemination and dissemination of data affecting the image of the Chinese Communist Party.A famous case was the crash of a Ferrari 458 Spider, a car that cost a million dollars, driven by a student named Ling Gu,son of Ling Jihua, thechief adviser to then-President Hu Jintao. The vehicle was going at such a speed that when it hit the barrier of a bridge on the Beijing peripheral, it split in two. A companion of young Ling was paralyzed for life.Images of the crash – a march 2012 early morning – began flooding Weibo. But by dawn, any reference to the facts, including rumors about the driver's identity, had been erased from the network.I don't know where we'd go if social media control were left to the "national states," as López Obrador wants. The above case shows that governments, especially when they have no counterweights, can become true censors. We already lived that in Mexico in the years of priista authoritarianism, when the covers of newspapers and the content of radio and television news were reviewed in The Governorate.In addition, one has to wonder whether the country has no other priorities, at the moment of the pandemic, than to create a national social network. Do you have a remote idea of what that would cost?According to Zach Ferres,a technology specialist, only the computer part of a social network is expensive. "Just to give perspective," he wrote on the KillerStartups.com site, "writing a million lines of computer code can cost between $20 million and $40 million. This includes salaries from programmers, analysts, editors, designers and project managers. Facebook has about 60 million lines of code. And that's just its main site (...) And even if you can afford the cost ofbuild the site, then you have to attract users, which costs a lot of money through marketing tasks. Facebook has spent billions of dollars to get its users."It seems that this has not been taken into account, nor that many of the governments of the G20 countries expressed their displeasure with the takeover of the Capitol by Trump's supporters,which was the reason for suspending the accounts of the US president. Among them, German Chancellor Angela Merkel,famous for a phrase that has been highly quoted in networks these days: "Freedom of expression has its limits." Load-Date: January 16, 2021End of Document

Cuba agrees with US that there was no interference from the island in the 2020 electionsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 17, 2021 WednesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 302 wordsBodyCuba coincided wednesday with an official U.S. report revealing that the island's government did not interfere in the 2020 presidential election, dismissing accusations by former President Donald Trump about an alleged interference of the island in U.S. elections.U.S. Justice and Homeland Security departments released an official report Tuesday in which they noted "public statements," in reference to accusations made by Trump, "according to which foreign governments, including Venezuela, Cuba, or China (...) manipulated the vote count thanks to their control over electoral infrastructure.""The investigations showed that they are not credible," the U.S. authorities said, stressing that no foreign country managed to manipulate the outcome of the elections in which Democrat Joe Biden was victorious.The director of the United States at the Cuban chancellery, Carlos Fernández de Cossío, reacted on Twitter: "It is confirmed by the Us government itself, in the face of slander spread in that country for propaganda and defamation purposes.""It is false that Cuba has interfered or tried to interfere in the US election," he wrote.Eugenio Martínez, director of Latin America and the Caribbean of the chancellery, added that "the capacity and frequency with which we lie in US politics is an aberration.""There is no data to prove this lie about Cuba," he said on his Twitter account.However, the official US report did signal electoral interference linked to the Russian, Chinese and Iranian governments.This Wednesday, Russia demined that information."This report is incorrect, baseless and without evidence," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the press."Russia did not meddle in the previous election" of 2016, which led to Donald Trump's victory "and did not meddle in the 2020 election," he said.cb/ka/yoLoad-Date: March 18, 2021End of Document

Would It Benefit Consumers to Break Up Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google?Newsweek.comJanuary 8, 2021 Friday 1:16 PM ESTCopyright © 2021 Newsweek Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 2363 wordsByline: Scott ReevesHighlight: "Privacy is a huge concern," said Jason Boyce. "Amazon has a 360-view of every shopper with no oversight. No one is putting limits on the data the company collects. We can no longer hope for the best and trust in the libertarian utopia tech giants want us to believe in."BodyIs it possible to live without Amazon, Apple, Facebook and GoogleSure.It's also possible to live without Advil.But who would want to?The tech giants have become such a vital part of everyday life that it's difficult to imagine life without them. But critics question the social and economic cost of reliance on major Internet companies. Some call for antitrust action to break their dominance, while others believe doing so would undercut U.S. economic strength and give China an edge.Big Tech presents a problem for critics and a challenge for effervescent optimists."Privacy is a huge concern, Jason Boyce, founder of Avenue7Media, co-author of The Amazon Jungle and a former Marine Corps captain, told Newsweek. "Amazon has a 360-view of every shopper with no oversight. No one is putting limits on the data the company collects. We can no longer hope for the best and trust in the libertarian utopia tech giants want us to believe in."He said Amazon has "mastered capitalism," and now it's time for Congress to open the market to competition."I'm not anti-capitalist. I want 10 Amazons—not one," the co-founder of Dazadi.com and eight-figure Amazon seller said. "Now it's up to Congress to ask if what Amazon has done is good for the United States. I say it's a problem and we need to make sure Amazon pays its taxes, halts anti-competitive practices and stops collecting every bit of data on Americans."Boyce said Amazon's growing market dominance could lead to higher prices and lower service in the future because it has no direct competitor and faces no imminent threat."Next, Amazon plans to move into healthcare," he said. "There will be some good coming out of it, but do we want Amazon to know everything about our health?"Like millions of others, Boyce said he has an Amazon Prime account."I have two kids, my wife works and we order from Amazon all the time," he said. "I'd like a good alternative, but it doesn't exist."Convenience appears to be Big Tech's killer app.Many who share privacy concerns and some who simply dislike big business have developed work-arounds in an effort to protect their personal information. In what some may see as a paradox, venture capitalists are backing new technology companies that boost independently owned shops in a retail world upended by Amazon.A Promise UnfulfilledMedia critic A.J. Liebling once quipped, "Freedom of the press is guaranteed only to those who own one."Internet websites reduced the cost of publishing, created a platform for a plethora of voices and expanded the potential audience beyond any newspaper publisher's dream. But critics believe the Internet's promise is largely unfulfilled, and has morphed into what can be a tool of ruthless marketing or oppression if data routinely gathered by Internet companies is used by third parties, including governmental agencies.In 2019, Facebook agreed to pay about $643,000 to the United Kingdom's Information Commissioner's Office after the social media company allowed Cambridge Analytica to use data from as many as 87 million people worldwide for political advertising without their consent.In The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, Shoshana Zuboff argues that companies like Facebook and Google make huge sums of money by capturing, organizing, analyzing and selling the personal information they collect from users of their sites (at no cost to the companies) to advertisers.The tradeoff: Free services in exchange for personal information."Each time a user queries Google's search engine," Zuboff writes, "the system simultaneously presents a specific configuration of a particular ad, all in the fraction of a moment that it takes to fulfill a search inquiry."This, the retired Harvard Business School professor argues, reduces individuals to little more than accessories, crushing the dream of quick and easy access to information for all.In Liberty From All Masters, author Barry Lynn argues that Amazon, Google and Facebook have developed the power to manipulate the flow of news, information and commerce in the U.S., establishing autocratic control threatening democracy and individual liberty.Lynn argues that common carrier laws previously required "any corporation that controlled access to a vital service" to treat "every person who depended on that monopoly the same."But he believes "neoliberal reactionaries" in the administrations of President Ronald Reagan and President Bill Clinton eroded such protections and allowed major online companies to build unprecedented power and wealth by "delivering to each of us different information, different prices and different services."Lynn argues that while Americans say they are concerned about liberty and personal privacy, many routinely disclose key personal information to major online companies, allowing them to develop targeted marketing plans based on location, education, income, occupation, age, race, sex—you name it.That may sound like shrewd, computer-aided marketing, but such "platform monopolists" as Lynn calls them, can "manipulate" Americans "to a degree that no previous private power, in any nation, have ever come close to achieving."Tradeoffs: The Alpha and Omega of LifeThe optimistic view: Life is filled with tradeoffs.The car, for example, increased personal mobility, led to the creation of suburbs, construction of new highways, good jobs – and about 38,000 traffic fatalities a year, smog in major cities, and a major driver of global warming through carbon emissions."Every tech innovation will create new winners and losers," Manish Shah, CEO of Miami Beach-based Tollbooth Strategy told Newsweek. "While it's hard to believe how Google or Amazon could be dethroned, remember that Microsoft is losing relevance. But with billions in the bank, Big Tech can fight back – and they always do."He said an up-and-coming tech innovator can challenge Big Tech only if its business model allows it to go viral, such as Facebook or Airbnb. This reduces the need for massive infusions of capital to finance growth, but it also leaves the company vulnerable to an upstart offering a better idea and providing greater efficiency.Amazon appears to be safe, at least for now, because its business requires huge warehouses, a massive supply chain and a top-notch distribution network staffed by a large workforce. In a similar manner, a new company would find it next to impossible to match Apple's image, design, production and marketing."For users, the trouble with Big Tech is that they're not easy to avoid and we are all captive to them," Shah said. "If you have an Android or Apple cell phone, you're locked into the company and they know everything about you. Same for Google searches."Increasing Calls To Break Up Big TechThe proposed break up of Amazon, Facebook and Google is often compared with the dismantling of Standard Oil in 1911 under the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890. But critics say that's an invalid comparison because the Internet giants compete in a world market while Standard Oil dominated a much smaller industrial-age America.China is developing stiff competitors to U.S. firms, including Alibaba, perhaps the world's largest online commerce company; Baidu, an Internet service company; Huawei, a telecommunications and consumer electronics company; and Tencent, an Internet services and entertainment company.Setting aside concerns about intellectual property theft, the Chinese companies, like their U.S. counterparts, gather huge amounts of personal data that, if coupled to artificial intelligence, could become an unrivaled marketing powerhouse—or Big Brother on steroids.Does it make sense for the U.S. to break up some of its leading companies while China supports its tech leaders—especially when critics say there's little distinction between the Chinese government and the nation's industry?Either way, the U.S. might be at a distinct disadvantage if major Internet companies were broken up. Facebook and Google provide services many consumers want at no or little cost. The counter argument is that free services are simply enticements to draw users in while gathering personal data to improve marketing or sell to others.Amazon offers good prices and informs users when lower prices may be available elsewhere. Many consumers are willing to pay for convenience, a desire that led to the creation of companies like DoorDash and Uber. If nothing else, Amazon saves trips to the Post Office to mail Christmas presents.But it raises another question: Are Americans willing to trade privacy for convenience?An Antiquated Tool? Anti-trust might be an antiquated tool in the digital age. A federal consent decree signed in 1956 ended years of legal wrangling between the U.S. government and the Bell System. The company wasn't broken up. Instead, Bell was ordered to license its patents to other firms.The transistor, laser and solar cell led to commercialization of personal computers, fiber optics and solar power, largely by other companies. Fiber optic technology provides the backbone of the Internet, allowing for high-speed downloads and allowing Netflix and other streaming companies to flourish.The Federal Communication Commission's 1971 decision to open AT&T's monopoly in long-distance and business service to competition is often seen as the Big Bang of modern telecommunications. MCI was the first beneficiary. In a world of unlimited nationwide calls and service centers based in India, many young people can't imagine a world where price once made long distance calls rare and kept conversations clipped.But WorldCom, then one of the largest telecommunications companies, went bankrupt in 2002 after it cooked the books to create the illusion of continued growth and inflate its market cap to about $175 billion. CEO Bernard Ebbers was sentenced to 25 years in prison and CFO Scott Sullivan drew a 5-year term.In the 1990s, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) investigated Microsoft to determine if the company sought to monopolize the personal computer market. The FTC quickly ended its investigation, but the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) revived the case in 1998.After a trial, a federal judge ruled that Microsoft had violated the Sherman Antitrust Act and ordered the company to be broken up. Microsoft won on appeal. The DOJ then set aside efforts to break up the company. In return, Microsoft agreed to share some technology with other companies.Some economists argued that antitrust laws stifle innovation and therefore hurt consumers. Others questioned the wisdom of filing antitrust cases against companies that dominate a market sector, but don't coerce anyone to buy their products or services. Critics believe the decision created the conditions for the later dominance of Apple and Google.The term "creative destruction," or dismantling of established practices and businesses through innovation, was minted by Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter in 1942 to describe new manufacturing techniques that increase productivity and drive down prices.The continued emergence of new companies has shaped the Internet in the past, but is Big Tech now unassailable?Eons ago—at least by Internet time—Yahoo pummeled rival search engines, including Alta Vista, GoTo, Infoseek, WebCrawler, Excite, Lycos and Ask Jeeves. Google finished the job and made Yahoo largely irrelevant.Would breaking up Google by making search separate from AdSense, Google Wallet, Google Maps, Google Drive, Google Chrome, Google Docs, Google Play and YouTube make one's proclivities more secure? Many think so, and an increasing number of people who no longer want to deal with Big Tech are adopting alternatives to the Internet behemoths.It's not quite the digital age version of fleeing to Walden Pond, because most don't seek to escape the world, but they do wish to negotiate the internet on their own terms, not those of billion-dollar companies.The Upstarts Faire.com seeks to provide small businesses, makers of clothing, specialty food and other hand-crafted items with a means to extend their marketing reach in a world where Amazon dominates online sales, while the COVID-19 pandemic has forced major retailers, including Century 21, Lord & Taylor, Brooks Brothers, J. Crew and GNC, into bankruptcy.The idea has clicked. Faire.com has expanded sales and attracted venture capital backing.DuckDuckGo doesn't compile user search information like Google Search. The company states, "Your data shouldn't be for sale. At DuckDuckGo, we agree." The company said it blocks advertising trackers and keeps user search data private. A search for stick vacuum cleaners, black tea and Raymond Chandler's mystery novels turns up merchants and websites other than Amazon.Users who want to avoid Gmail might take a look at ProtonMail, an encrypted service. Proton's service is free and it makes money by selling upgrades and additional storage.Online sales have crushed many independent bookstores. Bookshop.org gives the little guy a way to compete against Amazon."Bookshop is an online bookstore with a mission to financially support local, independent bookstores," the company said. "As more and more people buy their books online, we wanted to create an easy, convenient way for you to get your books and support bookstores at the same time."It's a daunting task in view of Barnes & Noble's difficulties in competing with Amazon— and so far Bookshop.org appears to be working.Those seeking to avoid Google's ancillary offerings might take a look at Mozilla Firefox and TomTom Mobile. Those seeking to escape the operating systems of Apple and Microsoft Windows use alternatives including Ubuntu, a Bantu word often translated as "humanity", or Linux, a Unix-based open-source operating system.Escaping Facebook might be harder, particularly for those hooked on Whatsapp and Instagram, but Telegram and Signal are gaining followers. Those who have had it with Twitter are taking a long look at Parler, Rumble, Mastadon, Gab, Amino and Peeks.So far, none of the alternatives appear to pose an immediate threat to Big Tech.But somewhere, there's a Steve Jobs-like kid in his garage thinking, "Hey, let me whip up a little creative destruction."Link to ImageGraphic amazon warehouse EnglandCHRIS J RATCLIFFE/AFP via Getty ImagesWorkers prepare customer orders for dispatch as they work around goods stored inside an Amazon fulfilment centre in England on November 15, 2017.

Sputnik V: departed the fourth airline flight to Moscow to look for coronavirus vaccinesCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 11, 2021 ThursdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 970 wordsBodyThe fourth flight of Aerolíneas Argentinas bound for Russia to bring to the country a new departure of Sputnik V departed on Wednesday at 23 o'am from Ezeiza,in a context in which the Government bets on a progressive normalization in the delivery of doses produced in Moscow over the next few days.The president of the flag company, Pablo Ceriani,had announced on his Twitter account that the departure of the "Flight AR1064 of Argentine Airlines bound for Russia is confirmed for today" and added that "the fourth of those operations is very important to deal with the Covid-19".                              "The Buenos Aires-Moscow route is the longest non-stop route made so far. This operation requires important logistical work in coordination with actors from both countries. All our energy is set to accomplish this task," Ceriani saidThe airline holder also uploaded to the social network Twitter the video of the take-off of the plane that goes in search of doses of vaccines against the coronavirus:   Sputnik V: the plane that travelled to Russia  As in the previous cases, the aircraft is an Airbus 330-200 and the return from the Russian capital is scheduled for next Friday after noon. This time, he will carry the AR1064 nomination, LV GIF license plate, on his one-way trip, and the AR1065 for return from the Russian capital, which will be realized tomorrow.The crew consists of commanders Fernando Carlos Castillo, Julio Luis Carballada, Gastotón Miguel Altoe Daniel and Ariel Gustavo Mota, and co-pilots Gerardo Hertor Terenzani, Hugo Martín Batisteza, Tomás Fabián Magyari, Francisco Javier Obregón, Roberto Walter Casañe and José María Aguer. They are added to 8 crew members, among mechanics, cargo dispatchers and technicians.    Argentine airlines against coronavirus  Altoe Daniel said it is "a satisfaction for the whole family of Aerolíneas Argentinas this new trip, more in this case in the midst of a pandemic that plagues everyone.""It's the state flag line and we're always willing to do whatever it takes for situations like this.  We already repatriated Argentinians who were outside and now we bring the vaccines"against the coronavirus,"he expanded to the press.   How many coronavirus vaccines will reach Argentina and when  On the vaccines he said that "it is about 14 tons,10 of which will be in the hold and the rest in the cabin accommodated between the seats."He estimated that the flight would be back on Friday around 14 local time, as planned, and revealed that "there is snow forecast in Moscow by the time we arrive, but we are prepared for that contingency."As with the other three trips, this new flight to Moscow is directly realized - without technical stopovers - under the name of "ferry", that is, when the aircraft is empty, only with its cabin crew and even maintenance and cargo technicians, as the case may be.The voyage is also carried out by 10 crewmembers, between pilots and co-pilots, who will alternate to the command of the ship, who are added dispatchers, technicians and cargo personnel, to reach 18 people.Cargo time in Moscow,based on previous experiences, should not take more than five hours, so the aircraft would be able totake off from the Russian capital after midnight on Thursday, and your arrival in Buenos Aires is scheduled for Friday, between 14 and 15.   Coronavirus vaccines in Argentina  The first of the flights carrying a vaccine line arrived in Argentina on 24 December last, with 300,000 doses,while the second on 16 January with the same amount, while the third arrived in Ezeiza on Thursday, January 28, with 240 thousand doses, of which 20 thousand were destined for Bolivia.The arrival of new doses of Sptunik V in Argentina adds to the advances in the negotiation for the purchase of the vaccine produced by the company Sinopharm.Yesterday, Health Minister Ginés González García met with China's ambassador to Argentina, Zou Xiaoli, as part of these negotiations.Sources from the Ministry of Health told Télam that "there is a very advanced negotiation for the purchase of vaccines but there is a lack of signatures from the Chinese government and the authorization of the Anmat,which analyses the information sent in recent weeks by Thepharm company."Also yesterday, the Government "emergencyly" authorized the vaccine produced by the Serum Institute of India following the recommendations of the Anmat."No serious adverse events were presented and no significant differences in the effectiveness of the different age groups involved in clinical trials were identified," the resolution authoritative of the vaccine, published in the Official Gazette, indicated.The vaccine has already been approved by twelve health authorities in several countries, in addition to India.In addition, the Government is awaiting the arrival of vaccines prepared by the Covaxglobal fund this month after new commitments were made last week to acquire more doses to ensure coverage of the population over the age of 18.The official objective is to achieve the arrival of the 30 million doses of Sputnik V; more than 22 million doses of AstraZeneca and the 2.2 million covax fund (global initiative for access to coronavirus vaccines,which is promoted by the World Health Organization),as confirmed by González García in his exhibition last Wednesday in Deputies.In addition, last week the Secretary of Quality in Health, Arnaldo Medina, had ensured that those 22 million doses of the vaccine developed by Oxford and AstraZeneca will be added in the next 60 days two additional inds of 580 thousand, which will arrive between February and March.Meanwhile, negotiations with Pfizer were suspended, although officials consulted by Télam stressed that the relationship was never broken, especially with the company's representatives on national territory.Load-Date: February 12, 2021End of Document

Global stocks rise as Wall Street braces for more turbulenceCNN WireJanuary 31, 2021 Sunday 11:35 PM GMTCopyright 2021 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 504 wordsByline: By Rob McLean, Laura He and Hanna Ziady, CNN BusinessDateline: (CNN) Body             Global stocks and US futures advanced Monday as Wall Street prepared for what could be another week of rocky trading fueled by small investors on Reddit. Silver futures surged as online attention shifted to the precious metal.Dow futures were last up 177 points, or 0.6%, reversing course from a 0.8% tumble earlier. S&P 500 futures were up 0.8%, while Nasdaq futures climbed nearly 1%. European markets opened with gains, while major Asian indexes advanced.Some investors are once again turning their attention to vaccine rollouts and a stimulus deal in the United States, chief global markets strategist at Axi, Stephen Innes, wrote in a research note Monday. "Risk is trying to regain its footing but Covid vaccine efficacy concerns and the Reddit Red Raider [are] still on investors' minds," he added.US markets are coming off of their worst week since October. Investors were captivated by stock moves spurred by traders coordinating their buys on a message board called WallStreetBets. The Reddit forum sent GameStop, AMC and other heavily shorted stocks skyrocketing, roiling markets and crushing some hedge funds that had bet against the stocks.Questions about whether President Joe Biden's proposed $1.9 trillion stimulus package can actually get passed, along with uncertainty over the coronavirus vaccine rollout, also kept investors on edge. "The good thing is that most market forecast anticipates a smaller package that happens sooner," said Innes.Global markets moved higher on Monday. London's FTSE 100 gained 0.6% in early morning trade. Germany's DAX was 1.1% higher, while France's CAC 40 was up 0.9%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng finished 2.2% higher, while South Korea's Kospi rose 2.7%. Japan's Nikkei gained 1.6% and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 0.8%.China's Shanghai Composite added 0.6%. The country's manufacturing activity expanded in January, a closely watched private survey showed Monday - albeit at the slowest pace in seven months. Recent survey data from the Chinese government showed similar slow growth in manufacturing and services activity. It's a sign that fresh coronavirus outbreaks in the country may be hampering the recovery of the world's second largest economy, though not derailing it entirely.Meanwhile, there were signs of Redditors targeting precious metals. Silver futures surged as much as 8.5% to above $29 late Sunday, touching five-month highs. That follows a 6% rally last week.Retail sites warned customers over the weekend they could not meet skyrocketing demand for silver bars and coins. And "#silversqueeze" is trending on Twitter.Silver producers jumped in Asia as futures for the precious metal surged. China Silver Group soared nearly 30% in Hong Kong, for example. Chinese silver futures also jumped nearly 9% in Shanghai.<em>-- Anneken Tappe and Matt Egan contributed to this report.</em>                      By Rob McLean, Laura He and Hanna Ziady, CNN Business         TM & © 2021 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

This is the all-tech city that Japan will build at the foot of Mount FujiCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 28, 2021 SundayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 493 wordsBodyAs a woven city, Toyota's project in Japan at the foot of Mount Fuji has been christened. It is a city that will be built on a plot of 175 hectares, where the automotive company had the Higashi factory.Woven City is the name of this plan, presented at CES Las Vegas in 2020 and which is considered the "prototype of the future where all ecosystems are connected".The beginning of the work took place last Tuesday. Woven Planet Holdings, Toyota's company in charge of mobility development projects, is in charge of the execution of this city."Woven City is a project that will demonstrate a human-centered approach to community development. In toyota's shift from an automobile manufacturer to a mobility company, the project will bring new technology to life in a real-world environment in a wide range of areas, including automated driving, personal mobility, robotics and artificial intelligence (AI). It is expected to provide a number of opportunities for companies and researchers around the world," the company said in a statement.That's what the smart city will be like.With the concept of a woven city, its streets will be intertwined and will be of three types: for pedestrians, for those who use personal mobility vehicles and for automatic driving vehicles. The goods will go down an underground track.This city is projected to start with 360 people (with projection to reach 2,000), especially older adults, families with children and inventors, because the project is expected to serve to experiment with social problems and thus find them an answer."The city is expected to be fully sustainable, with buildings built mainly from wood, to minimize the carbon footprint, using traditional Japanese carpentry techniques in combination with robotic production methods. The roofs will be covered with photovoltaic panels in order to obtain solar energy, which will be added to that generated by the hydrogen fuel cells. Toyota's idea is to intertwine nature with the urban environment, using endemic vegetation and hydroponic crops," the company said in a pronouncement.Projection of what the woven city (Woven City) that Toyota plans to build in Japan would look like. (Courtesy of Toyota/)"Housing will be equipped with the latest human assistance technologies, such as home robotic systems that assist in everyday tasks. Households will have sensor-based AI systems to monitor their occupants' health status, take care of their basic needs and improve their day-to-day lives, giving the opportunity to deploy connected technologies comprehensively and reliably safely," he added.Scope recalled that the woven city is one of the plans that are promoted to change the concept of housing and mobility. "Connected city projects multiply around the world, especially in North America and China, with GAFA (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon) on the one hand and the Chinese government on the other, along with local giants Huawei, Tencent and Alibaba."

Smartphone users spent a lot of money on apps this ChristmasStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeJanuary 2, 2021 SaturdayUniversity WireCopyright 2021 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: HI TECH; Pg. 1Length: 373 wordsByline: Sandy MccarthyBodySuch was the severity of the action that merely 74 out of the top 1,500 games on theApp Store in China were left unscathed, while the rest were pulled. As per a research firm Qimai, some of the apps that have been affected by the sweep include NBA2K20 and Assassin's Creed Identity by Ubisoft. Worldwide spending on both Apple's App Store and Google Play passed United States dollars 100 billion (RM403 billion) in a single year for the first time ever in November.The report notes that Apple had initially kept the deadline as June end this year for the game publishers to submit a government-issued license number that allows users to make in-app purchases.Now, as both Android andApple comply with the Chinese law, they have to remove many unlicensed apps from their respectiveapp stores. A Wall Street Journal report said that theapp stores of the company are subject to local rules and sometimes receive requests to delete some apps. As per 9to5Mac, theoriginal deadline for obtaining the license for developers was the end of July 2020 and since many were still unable to do so, it was extended up to December 31.In the past few months,Apple has been clamping down aggressively on apps that were listed on theApp Store in China without a valid license from the Chinese government.Brexit: Boris Johnson's father applies for French citizenshipUK lawmakers approved a post-Brexit trade deal on Wednesday, just a day before the end of the EU-UK transition period. In Scotland, which voted strongly in 2016 to remain, Brexit has bolstered support for separation from the U.K.On the other hand, entertainment apps were able to generate most revenue outside of games onApple'sApp Store and Google's platform. In 2019, the total spending was around $303 million which roughly translates into 34.6% year-over-year growth.WhileApple says it has a thorough system of checks to ensure components used in its products are produced in an ethical manner, a new report claims that well knownApple supplier Lens Technology uses forced labour comprised of Uighur Muslim workers in China. The apps were subsequently removed. This is reportedly the largest single-day purge of apps from theApp Store.The company last commented on the matter on 21 December.Load-Date: January 3, 2021End of Document

2020 MANDA ROUNDUP - THE DEALS SHAPING DERIVATIVES MARKETSStates News ServiceFebruary 5, 2021 FridayCopyright 2021 States News ServiceLength: 4127 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the Futures Industry Association (FIA):Transactions hint at continued exchange consolidation, the rising value of data, ESG's growth and other trendsBy MarketVoice staffIt was a busy year for dealmakers in the capital markets sector even in the midst of a global pandemic.Several multi-billion-dollar deals were wrapped up in 2020, including Morgan Stanley's acquisition of eTrade, the London Stock Exchange Group's acquisition of Refinitiv, and SandP Global's merger with IHS Markit. There were also many smaller deals as banks, brokerages, exchanges and technology vendors looked for ways to accelerate their growth. Young fintech companies also saw a flurry of fundraising and mergers among firms specializing in institutional-grade solutions for trading cryptocurrencies.Six deals from 2020 had particular importance to derivatives markets because they embodied broader trends transforming the industry. Those trends include consolidation among exchanges, the rising value of data and analytics, the popularity of "do it yourself" trading platforms, the surge of interest in environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing and cryptocurrencies, and the decision by the Chinese government to allow foreign banks to take control of their joint ventures in the domestic brokerage industry.The European exchanges were particularly active in 2020, with two very different strategies. Euronext and SIX followed the traditional path, buying Borsa Italiana and Bolsas y Mercados Espanoles, respectively, to increase their share of European securities and derivatives markets. LSE went in the opposite direction, divesting Borsa Italiana in order to win regulatory approval for its acquisition of Refinitiv, and sending a clear signal that it saw higher returns in data and analytics. Similarly, Deutsche Borse made two deals to expand into trading technology and shareholder services, and it made a small investment in a fintech to deepen its participation in the ESG trend.On the other side of the Atlantic, Cboe pursued both strategies, extending its footprint in the equities markets but also buying two small technology companies to expand its data services. Cboe also completed the acquisition of EuroCCP, a deal first announced in 2019 that will provide the foundation for its plans to enter the European equity derivatives markets.Among banks and brokers, there was only one large deal Morgan Stanley's acquisition of E*Trade. But there were plenty of smaller deals. One trend that stood out was investments by venture capital firms in technology platforms geared to the rapidly rising number of active individual traders. The other noteworthy trend was the investments made by several international banks to take control of their joint ventures in China's brokerage industry. Those moves became possible only after China relaxed its rules on foreign ownership.Morgan Stanley E*TradeIn February, Morgan Stanley announced an agreement to acquire E*Trade, one of the largest brokerages in the US, in an all-stock transaction valued at $13 billion. The deal was the largest by a US bank since the financial crisis of 2008 and created a new powerhouse in brokerage and wealth management.A key attraction for Morgan Stanley was the opportunity to bring in more than 5 million customer accounts and $360 billion in assets. In addition, E*Trade's focus on retail investors and active individual traders will complement Morgan Stanley's traditional investment banking business and its financial advisory service for high net-worth individuals.As it turned out, the timing of the deal worked out well for Morgan Stanley. The explosion in retail participation in trading that was triggered by the pandemic led to huge growth in the online brokerage industry. By July, E*Trade's retail business had grown to 6 million accounts and $400 billion in assets.The acquisition of E*Trade also gave Morgan Stanley one of the most popular platforms for equity options trading, the fastest growing segments of the US listed derivatives markets. The foundation for that business was E*Trade's 2016 acquisition of OptionsHouse, a Chicago-based options broker, for $725 million, and it has only grown in value over the last year as the pandemic prompted millions of people to open brokerage accounts and try their hands at trading. The number of derivatives trades on E*Trade's platform jumped to 220,000 per day during the first half of 2020, more than double the total for the entire previous year.Euronext Borsa ItalianaThe European exchange landscape saw a big shakeup in 2020 with the sale of Borsa Italiana by the London Stock Exchange Group to Euronext, the rapidly growing group of exchanges centered in Paris and Amsterdam.LSE said in late 2019 that it saw Borsa Italiana as a strategic asset and it had no intention of selling the Milan-based exchange, which it acquired back in 2007. But in order to win European regulatory approval for a massive $27 billion acquisition of data and infrastructure provider Refinitiv, LSE had to divest the Italian exchange.Euronext beat out two other European exchange groups Deutsche Borse and SIX Group in the bidding for Borsa Italiana, which owns a stock exchange, a derivatives exchange, a bond trading platform and a clearinghouse. Key to Euronext's success was the support of two Italian financial institutions, Cassa Depositi e Prestiti and Intesa Sanpaolo, that agreed to become strategic investors in the combined group.For both sides, the bulk of the value in the deal was in the combination of stock markets, but the consolidation of their listed derivatives businesses added to the attraction. Euronext ranks as the second largest derivatives exchange in continental Europe, with 175.6 million futures and options traded in 2020. The merger with Borsa Italiana, which had 25.1 million futures and options traded in 2020, will allow Euronext to bring more contracts onto its trading platform and strengthen its ability to compete with other exchanges in the region, particularly in the equity derivatives business.SandP Global IHS MarkitIn November, SandP Global announced its plan to merge with IHS Markit in an all-stock deal that values IHS Markit at $44 billion. The deal one of the world's biggest acquisitions announced in 2020 will bring together two of the largest providers in the increasingly competitive market of financial analytics and information.SandP is widely known for its ratings and index businesses, but it has also been carving out its place in the world of financial information, becoming the third-largest global market data provider behind Bloomberg and Refinitiv.In 2015, its predecessor company McGraw Hill Financial acquired data and research provider SNL Financial for $2.23 billion. Since then, SandP Global has made several deals to build out its data products, including the 2018 acquisitions of supply chain data provider Panjiva and artificial intelligence company Kensho Technologies. IHS Markit will be SandP Global's largest acquisition to date.IHS Markit itself was created from the $13 billion merger four years ago of IHS, an information provider that caters to a variety of industries, and financial information and technology provider Markit. Markit provides a range of pricing and reference data for financial assets and derivatives, including credit default swaps and collateralized loan obligations, as well as trade processing technology for OTC derivatives.SandP Global said that the two companies have highly complementary products. For instance, both provide data and analytics related to the energy market and oil and gas assets. SandP Global Platts is the main provider of benchmark prices for key raw materials, including oil and refined products, while IHS Markit's maritime products include ship tracking, port data and information on trade flows. Other complementary assets include the data science capabilities of Kensho Technologies with IHS Markit's Data Lake, a catalogued platform that unites IHS Markit's vast data sets.The deal marks the latest round of consolidation among data providers looking to scale as demand for data and analytics surges in the increasingly computerized financial markets. In September 2020, Intercontinental Exchange completed its acquisition of US mortgage data provider Ellie Mae for $11 billion. In January 2021, EU competition regulators formally approved London Stock Exchange's $27 billion takeover of Refinitiv.Miami International Minneapolis Grain ExchangeIf ever there was an odd couple in the world of exchange mergers, this was it. Miami International Holdings, the parent of the MIAX family of options exchanges, announced in August that it had struck a deal to acquire the Minneapolis Grain Exchange for a combination of cash and stock.MGEX is one of the oldest futures exchanges in the world, having been founded in 1881 as a marketplace for wheat. But in recent history it has been eclipsed by other exchanges and remains limited to a handful of agricultural futures contracts with a relatively tiny amount of trading volume.MIAX is far younger, having executed its first trade in 2012, and growing much more rapidly. Until recently it was wholly focused on electronic trading of equity options in the US. Last year it had more than 827 million contracts traded, making it the fourth largest among US options markets and the 15th largest derivatives exchange in the world.So why would a fast-growing financial exchange want an old-school commodity exchange? The answer is that the acquisition gives MIAX access to the futures markets, which in the US is subject to a different set of rules and regulations than the securities markets. MGEX is registered with the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission as both a "Designated Contract Market" and as a "Derivatives Clearing Organization". As a result, the deal gives MIAX the ability to use the Minneapolis exchange's regulatory status to quickly roll out new futures contracts.For example, MIAX has been able to use MGEX as the springboard for futures on SPIKES, its proprietary volatility index. That index is based on the prices of options traded on MIAX's exchanges, which captured almost 12% of all US equity options trading in 2020.Bitcoin futures are also a potential addition. Through the acquisition MIAX inherited an agreement between MGEX and Bitnomial, an exchange backed by a group of firms including Coinbase Ventures, Digital Currency Group and Jump Capital. Bitnomial received CFTC approval in April 2020 to offer bitcoin futures with physical delivery, and it is planning to clear those contracts through the MGEX clearinghouse.The potential for MIAX to use the MGEX clearinghouse for new products such as futures on volatility indices and bitcoin creates some challenges for its clearing members, which are used to participating only in agricultural markets. To address those concerns, MGEX has modified its rules to provide clearing members with more separation between the different pools of risk. Whether that separation is sufficient to satisfy the old guard remains to be seen.SGX BidFXSingapore is the third-largest trading center in the global foreign exchange market, trailing only London and New York. For the Singapore Exchange, that presents a huge opportunity, and in 2020 the exchange took a big step in that direction with the acquisition of BidFX, an institutional FX trading platform, for $128 million.BidFX originally was a subsidiary of TradingScreen, the trading system vendor, before it was spun off in 2017. SGX acquired a 20% stake in the company in March 2019, and then bought out the remaining 80% from the other shareholders last year. BidFX counts hedge funds, asset managers and regional bankers among its clients, and its trading volume has set records in recent quarters.SGX already has a thriving FX futures business based on Asian currency pairs, but that's just a drop in the bucket compared to the over-the-counter market. According to the Bank for International Settlements, the FX market is the largest financial market in the world, with average daily turnover in the OTC market amounting to $6.6 trillion per day in traded volume. By comparison, exchange-traded FX derivatives volume accounts for about 2% of the volume in the OTC market.The acquisition of BidFX provides SGX with an entry point into the global OTC FX market and an opportunity to establish a one-stop venue for OTC and futures, with pre-trade data and analytics, trade execution and post-trade clearing."The future of FX lies in the ability for market participants to benefit from price discovery, liquidity and transparency for both OTC and listed futures trading, in a single unified venue," the bourse's CEO Loh Boon Chye said in a statement when the deal was announced."With BidFX as part of the SGX Group, we can now serve a wider FX community with more comprehensive solutions and enhanced distribution capabilities, while bringing together the two growing and mutually-reinforcing pools of liquidity," Loh said.Ion BroadwayION Group, one of the top software providers in the derivatives and commodities markets, announced in February 2020 an agreement to buy 85% of Broadway Technology, a specialist provider of electronic trading systems for fixed income and foreign exchange markets.ION's move on Broadway was the latest in a long series of acquisitions. The companies that it has acquired, in whole or in part, include Fidessa, MarketFactory, DealLogic, FFastFill, Reval, OpenLink and Acuris. Those acquisitions have helped make ION one of the most widely used vendors in the financial technology industry.This time, however, ION's ambitions ran into an obstacle when the UK Competition and Markets Authority launched an investigation into the deal's potential impact on competition. The CMA noted that ION was "by far the largest supplier" of trading software to banks and market makers in the fixed income markets, giving it "significant bargaining power" with its customers.ION ultimately was able to gain approval, but only after agreeing to sell Broadway's fixed income business to a group of private equity firms led by Tyler Moeller, Broadway's chief executive and co-founder. ION retained Broadway's FX business, which consists of technology related to order management and market connectivity.Other noteworthy dealsJanuaryNinjaTrader, a provider of trading software and brokerage services for retail traders of futures, received a majority growth investment led by Long Ridge Equity Partners, a private equity firm, with participation from DRW Venture Capital, the venture capital arm of DRW Holdings. The Denver-based brokerage said the investment would help accelerate its goal of providing institutional-grade tools for retail traders around the world. Twelve months later, the company announced a move into futures clearing with the acquisition of TransAct Futures, a non-clearing futures commission merchant based in Chicago.FebruaryGTS, a proprietary trading firm based in New York, announced the completion of its acquisition of Barclays' automated options trading unit. As part of the transaction, which originally was announced in December 2019, approximately 40 Barclays personnel became full-time GTS employees. GTS said the unit provides price quotes in more than 735,000 individual securities across 13 options exchanges, and trades approximately 2% of all exchange-traded equity options volume in the US.Cryptocurrency custody firm BitGo expanded its footprint in the digital securities marketplace via the acquisition of Harbor, a security token platform. Harbor's subsidiaries include a broker-dealer regulated by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and a transfer agent supervised by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.Nasdaq acquired OneReport, a privately held provider of corporate ESG data management and reporting services. The move bolstered Nasdaq's ESG reporting and workflow solutions.Cboe acquired real-time risk analytics firm Hanweck Associates. The move added to Cboe's Information Solutions segment to offer more insight into trade data including portfolio optimization, risk management and execution services. Cboe also acquired portfolio management platform FT Options to help provide greater insight into balance sheet risks for its customers.MarchMorgan Stanley received approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission to take a majority stake in its China securities joint venture, Morgan Stanley Huaxin Securities Company, by increasing its holding from 49% to 51%. The joint venture, which is based in Shanghai, engages in underwriting of stocks and bonds and proprietary trading of bonds.AprilBitGo acquired institutional-grade digital asset management platform Lumina. The move further expanded BitGo's cryptocurrency products and services, allowing clients to access reporting around taxable events and possible tax liabilities, among other things. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.Investment research provider Morningstar acquired research and data provider Sustainalytics. Morningstar had been a minority owner of Sustainalytics since 2017 and purchased the remaining stake. The deal helps Morningstar offer more information on ESG criteria across various asset classes.BMO Financial Group acquired Clearpool Group, a New York-based provider of algorithmic and electronic trading services and an independent agency broker-dealer operating in the US and Canada. The transaction delivered new capabilities to BMO's electronic trading platform. Clearpool remains a separate brand under BMO Financial Group as well as a separate broker-dealer.MayCoinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency trading and custody platforms, acquired crypto prime brokerage platform Tagomi in May. The acquisition bolstered Coinbase services for proprietary traders and institutional investors.IHS Markit acquired Singapore-based company Catena Technologies, which specializes in regulatory trade reporting and technology services. Catena Technologies had already been a component of IHS Markit's Integrated Reporting, a global, multi-asset class service for regulatory trade reporting since 2016. IHS Markit has integrated the expertise and technology from Catena into MarkitSERV, its OTC derivatives trade processing platform.JuneSIX Group, a Switzerland-based market infrastructure provider, acquired 93% of Spanish exchange Bolsas y Mercados Espaoles for roughly $2.6 billion. The move made the combined entity the third-largest European financial market infrastructure group and the 10th largest globally by revenue. BME's subsidiaries include a derivatives exchange that traded 40.5 million futures and options in 2020.Credit Suisse increases its ownership of its securities joint venture in China from 33% to 51%, granting it control for the first time over the business. The joint venture, Credit Suisse Founder Securities, provides a range of capital markets services to clients in the domestic China market, including securities underwriting and trading.JulyStandard Chartered bought an equity stake in Cobalt, a provider of post-trade infrastructure for foreign exchange markets. Other investors in the London-based fintech include Citi, IHS Markit, and Singapore Exchange.Cboe Global Markets closed the acquisition of EuroCCP. The deal, which had been announced in December 2019, gave it control over a European clearinghouse and a stepping stone for its planned launch of a European derivatives exchange.AugustCboe Global Markets completed its acquisition of MATCHNow, the largest equities alternative trading system in Canada. Cboe said the deal would expand its geographic presence and diversify the product capabilities of its equities business.R.J. O'Brien and Associates, the Chicago-based futures brokerage, bought Lombard Forte Securities, an interdealer broker based in Dubai. RJO said the deal would broaden its geographic reach and expand its product offering into credit and equities markets.Intercontinental Exchange announced an agreement to buy Ellie Mae, which operates a technology platform for residential mortgage lending, for $11 billion. This was the third and largest deal made by ICE to extend its reach into the US mortgage industry and another example of the company's evolution beyond its roots in commodity futures trading.SeptemberDeutsche Borse announced an agreement to buy a majority interest in Quantitative Brokers, an independent provider of advanced execution algorithms and data-driven analytics for global futures, options and interest rate markets. The German exchange said the deal would reinforce its strategy of building stronger connections to institutional investors and other "buyside" market users.OctoberTP ICAP, the world's biggest interdealer broker, agreed to buy equity and corporate bond electronic trading network Liquidnet for $575 million. The deal gives TP ICAP a strong dealer-to-client trading venue in equities, and growth potential in the electronic trading of bonds and swaps in competition with companies such as Bloomberg, Tradeweb and MarketAxess.Citadel Securities reached an agreement with IMC, the Dutch proprietary trading firm, to buy its market-making business on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Citadel said the deal would reinforce its position as the largest designated market maker on the NYSE. IMC had been a designated market maker on the NYSE since 2014, when it acquired the DMM business from Goldman Sachs.DriveWealth, a US provider of API-based brokerage infrastructure, announced a $56.7 million Series C round to strengthen its technology, make strategic acquisitions, and grow the organization. DriveWealth provides the infrastructure for other fintech companies in Europe, Asia and Latin America to provide retail investors with access to the US stock market. The funding round was led by Point72 Ventures, an arm of Steve Cohen's hedge fund, and included Mouro Capital, a fund spun out from Banco Santander, and the UK venture arm of Fidelity Investments.NovemberJ.P.

DrawBridge operates managed accounts for cryptocurrency investors and offers loans using blockchain technology.

Galaxy Digital noted that the pair of acquisitions gave the firm a "strong regional hub in Chicago" and give it more connections with derivatives firms looking to enter digital asset markets.Nasdaq agreed to buy Verafin, a Canadian provider of fraud detection software, for $2.75 billion. Nasdaq said Verafin's cloud-based suite of anti-financial crime software solutions added greater depth to its existing regulatory technology services.Deutsche Borse agreed to buy an 80% stake in Institutional Shareholder Services, a data and analytics provider that advises shareholders on corporate governance issues. The German group said the deal would position it as a "leading global provider" of ESG data and analytics. Also in November, Deutsche Borse led a $15 million funding round for Clarity AI, which provides a platform for analyzing the societal and environmental impact of investment.DecemberLondon Stock Exchange Group announced that it was nearing completion of the regulatory approval process for its $27 billion takeover of financial market data and infrastructure provider Refinitiv. The deal was originally announced in August 2019.Goldman Sachs moved to take 100% ownership of its securities joint venture in China, signing an agreement to buy the 49% owned by its partner, Beijing Gao Hua Securities.Interactive Brokers added 70,000 customers and $3 billion in client equity through an agreement with Folio Financial, a digital wealth management platform founded by former US regulator Steve Wallman, to buy its self-directed retail brokerage segment.

Since October, there's nothing known about billionaire Jack Ma: where is he?CE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 4, 2021 MondayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 301 wordsBodyJack Ma, founder of the Chinese company Alibaba, has been missing since October and social media echoed several rumors about his whereabouts. The billionaire did not even say present in the final episode of a television show for entrepreneurs in which he was sworn in, so concern and mystery grow after the Chinese government began a regulatory asphyxiation to his company, which is the most economically important in that Asian country. The last time he was seen in public was when he participated in a forum in Shanghai where he lashed out in a speech against China's regulatory policy. Of course, his crusade had consequences as the initial $37 billion public offering on Ant Group, the financial arm of giant Alibaba, was suspended.According to the Reuters news agency, the Financial Times reported Friday that Jack Ma would have been replaced in the last episode of a television contest for entrepreneurs in which he participated as a jury. An Alibaba spokesman has excused the change for a "agenda problem," without wanting to comment further. Meanwhile, Jack Ma's unknown whereabouts fuel rumors on Twitter, a blocked social network in China. On China's main platform, where some of the topics of conversation are censored, the entrepreneur's name did not reach an important position on the viral list.Chinese regulators have focused on Ma's business since the October speech, prompting an antitrust investigation in Alibaba and ordering Ant to separate the lending business from the e-commerce division. "I'm sure you've been advised to keep a low profile for now," said Duncan Clark, president of beijing-based technology consultancy BDA China. "It's a unique situation, more tied to Ant's magnitude and financial regulation." Alibaba shares listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange fell 2.15% on Monday.Load-Date: January 5, 2021End of Document

In addition, global stocks traded higher following expansionary manufacturing PMIs for December out of the eurozone and Asia.Instead, investors appear to be taking profits to begin the year, having avoided any taxes they would have had to pay this year if they sold last Thursday. Now they can wait a whole year to pay taxes on today's profits.11:00 ETDow -449.66 at 30156.76, Nasdaq -114.38 at 12773.91, S&P -41.57 at 3714.5[BRIEFING.COM] The market has weakened amid widespread selling pressure that has taken the S&P 500 down 1.1% to around the 3715 level.Despite the intraday weakness, two areas of relative strength include the S&P 500 materials sector (+0.2%) and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (+1.8%). The material space is benefiting from higher metal prices while the chip space is benefiting from broad-based buying interest.Notable chip gainers include AMD (AMD 94.76, +3.04, +3.3%), Taiwan Semi (TSM 112.56, +3.52, +3.2%), and Cree (CREE 110.60, +4.70, +4.4%). It's worth noting that the PHLX is trading at fresh all-time highs.10:25 ETDow -235.16 at 30371.26, Nasdaq -10.14 at 12878.15, S&P -17.47 at 3738.6[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is trading at session lows with a 0.5% decline amid losses in nine of its 11 sectors. Influential weakness is coming from the communication services (-1.1%) and information technology (-0.4%) sectors.Namely, shares of Apple (AAPL 130.86, -1.81, -1.3%), Microsoft (MSFT 220.22, -2.22, -1.0%), Amazon (AMZN 3225.50, -31.43, -1.0%), and Facebook (FB 270.23, -2.99, -1.1%) are down at least 1.0% on no specific news catalysts. Given their mega-cap sizes, their losses have been meaningful drags on the major indices today.The one mega-cap exception is Tesla (TSLA 742.90, +37.2, +5.3%), which is rallying 5% to fresh record highs after reporting record Q4 deliveries. It's outsized gain is helping limit the decline in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (-0.1%).10:00 ETDow -98.01 at 30508.41, Nasdaq +0.46 at 12888.75, S&P -6.47 at 3749.6[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is currently down 0.1%, while the Russell 2000 trades higher by 0.3%.Just in, total construction spending increased 0.9% m/m in November (Briefing.com consensus +0.9%) on the heels of an upwardly revised 1.6% increase (from +1.3%) in October.Separately, the December IHS Markit Manufacturing PMI increased to 57.1 from 56.5 in November.09:40 ETDow -39.62 at 30566.8, Nasdaq -7.58 at 12880.71, S&P -2.23 at 3753.84[BRIEFING.COM] The major indices opened the session in the green but have recently slipped into the red.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +61.80.The S&P 500 futures trade 18 points, or 0.5%, above fair value to begin the new year, as buying interest carries over from last year's strong finish amid no specific news catalysts. Notably, the U.S. dollar continues to weaken against foreign currencies, which has benefited global stocks and U.S. multinational companies.Specifically, the U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.5% to 89.51, and is trading at its lowest level since April 2018, largely due to continued expectations for improved economic growth overseas following another round of encouraging manufacturing PMIs for December out of the eurozone and Asia.The data has overshadowed news that Germany is aiming to extend lockdown measures through the end of January, and that the UK and Japan are also thinking about tightening lockdown restrictions.

The Nasdaq Composite (+0.1%) and Russell 2000 (-0.3%) underperformed today, but the Nasdaq managed to eke out a gain.For most of the day, the S&P 500 traded virtually unchanged amid a lack of conviction from buyers and sellers. Buying interest, however, increased noticeably shortly after the early close of the Treasury market at 2:00 p.m. ET on no specific news catalyst, which was symptomatic of reduced market participation.The advance was led by the financials (+1.3%), utilities (+1.6%), real estate (+1.3%), and health care (+1.1%) sectors with gains over 1.0%; conversely, the energy (-0.8%) and consumer discretionary (-0.02%) sectors ended the session in the red.The latest weekly report for initial and continuing claims showed initial claims decrease by 19,000 to 787,000 (Briefing.com consensus 800,000) and continuing claims decline to their lowest level since March at 5.219 million. The market didn't react to the data, nor to much of anything today, really.On the coronavirus front, daily U.S. coronavirus hospitalizations and deaths hit new highs on Wednesday, the faster-spreading variant of the coronavirus was recorded in California, San Francisco will reportedly extend its stay-at-home and quarantine-after-travel orders indefinitely, and vaccination efforts in the U.S. are running behind schedule.Recapping the moves in the Treasury market, the 2-yr yield decreased one basis point to 0.12% (-145 bps in 2020), and the 10-yr yield decreased one basis point to 0.92% (-100 bps in 2020). The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 89.93. WTI crude futures decreased 0.3%, or $0.12, to $48.27/bbl (-21.5% in 2020).Reviewing Thursday's economic data:Initial claims for the week ending December 26 decreased by 19,000 to 787,000 (Briefing.com consensus 800,000). Continuing claims for the week ending December 19 decreased by 103,000 to 5.219 million.That's the lowest level of continuing claims since March, yet the key takeaway and harder-hitting reality is that initial claims were just 220,000 in the same period a year ago while continuing claims were just 1.728 million.Looking ahead, investors will receive Construction Spending for November and the IHS Markit Manufacturing PMI for December on Monday when the market reopens for the new year.Nasdaq Composite +43.6% YTDRussell 2000 +18.4% YTDS&P 500 +16.3% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +7.3% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1843/1269. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1739/2010.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: January 4, 2021End of Document

The Nasdaq Composite (-2.5%) and Russell 2000 (-2.1%) are also down more than 2.0%.Contributing to the positive start was Tesla (TSLA 722.48, +16.81, +2.4%) reporting record Q4 deliveries, expansionary December manufacturing PMIs out of the eurozone and Asia, and general buying momentum. The advance was short-lived with investors currently looking at a disappointing picture ahead of tomorrow's Senate election runoff in Georgia.Every sector in the S&P 500 is trading in negative territory, including real estate (-3.0%), industrials (-3.0%), information technology (-2.8%), and communication services (-2.6) at the bottom of the standings. The energy sector (-0.6%) is showing relative outperformance despite the decline in oil prices ($47.57, -0.94, -1.9%).Generally, investors are de-risking and seeking shelter in traditional safe-haven assets like Treasuries and the U.S. dollar. The 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 0.91% after touching 0.95% earlier today, and the dollar index trades flat after being down as much as 0.6%.The CBOE Volatility Index has spiked 22.9% to 27.95 amid increased hedging interest to protect against further equity weakness.In M&A activity, FLIR Systems (FLIR 51.95, +8.11, +18.5%) agreed to be acquired by Teledyne (TDY 356.94, -25.05, -8.9%) in a cash and stock deal valued at $8.0 billion. Magellan Health (MGLN 93.49, +10.65, +12.9%) agreed to be acquired by Centene (CNC 60.60, +0.57, +0.9%) for $95 per share, or a total enterprise value of $2.2 billion, in cash.Reviewing today's economic data:Total construction spending increased 0.9% in November (Briefing.com consensus 0.9%) after increasing a revised 1.6% (from 1.3%) in October. Total private construction spending rose 1.2% m/m and total public construction spending decreased 0.2%.The key takeaway from the report is that residential construction spending showed strength for another month as mortgage rates remained low, supporting demand for homes outside urban areas.The December IHS Markit Manufacturing PMI increased to 57.1 from 56.5 in November. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 713/2417. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1196/2556.12:30 ETDow -623.08 at 29983.34, Nasdaq -288.88 at 12599.41, S&P -80.10 at 3675.97[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is trading lower by 2.1% amid increased de-risking efforts. Attention is starting to shift to the Senate election-runoff in Georgia tomorrow.Current polls indicate the races are too close to predict, but there is some speculation that the two Democrats could win the seats based on the average of the polls right now. If that happens, the Democrats would have the majority with President-elect Biden's vote.Solar stocks are reacting favorably to this potential outcome, evidenced by the gains in stocks like Azure Power (AZRE 44.40, +3.63, +8.9%) and First Solar (FSLR 101.53, +2.61, +2.6%). We don't want to speculate too much on the broad market reaction until the results are clear, but it was worth reminding readers.12:00 ETDow -614.72 at 29991.7, Nasdaq -213.18 at 12675.11, S&P -70.01 at 3686.06[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is trading at fresh session lows with a 1.8% decline, which is comparable to the declines in the Dow (-2.0%), Nasdaq (-1.6%), and Russell 2000 (-1.6%).Looking at some key analyst recommendations on this down day, AT&T (T 29.14, +0.38, +1.3%) was upgraded to Outperform from Mkt Perform at Raymond James, and Morgan Stanley (MS 68.62, +0.09, +0.1%) was upgraded to Overweight from Equal Weight at Barclays.Separately, China's Global Times is reporting that the Chinese government may require U.S. companies doing business in China to reveal links to the U.S. military. The report was published a few minutes before the recent downtick in the market.Over in Europe, the major indices closed on a higher note despite the specter of tightened lockdown measures. Germany's DAX increased 0.1%, UK's FTSE increased 1.8%, and France's CAC increased 0.7%. The Europe Stoxx 600 advanced 0.7%.11:30 ETDow -498.54 at 30107.88, Nasdaq -157.93 at 12730.36, S&P -52.42 at 3703.65[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is off session lows (-1.7%) with a current 1.4% decline in a tactical bounce. Every sector in the benchmark index is trading lower, including nine that are down at least 1.0%.Growth concerns are not at the root of selling since Treasuries are trading little changed and growth stocks are down alongside value stocks. In addition, global stocks traded higher following expansionary manufacturing PMIs for December out of the eurozone and Asia.Instead, investors appear to be taking profits to begin the year, having avoided any taxes they would have had to pay this year if they sold last Thursday. Now they can wait a whole year to pay taxes on today's profits.11:00 ETDow -449.66 at 30156.76, Nasdaq -114.38 at 12773.91, S&P -41.57 at 3714.5[BRIEFING.COM] The market has weakened amid widespread selling pressure that has taken the S&P 500 down 1.1% to around the 3715 level.Despite the intraday weakness, two areas of relative strength include the S&P 500 materials sector (+0.2%) and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (+1.8%). The material space is benefiting from higher metal prices while the chip space is benefiting from broad-based buying interest.Notable chip gainers include AMD (AMD 94.76, +3.04, +3.3%), Taiwan Semi (TSM 112.56, +3.52, +3.2%), and Cree (CREE 110.60, +4.70, +4.4%).

Influential weakness is coming from the communication services (-1.1%) and information technology (-0.4%) sectors.Namely, shares of Apple (AAPL 130.86, -1.81, -1.3%), Microsoft (MSFT 220.22, -2.22, -1.0%), Amazon (AMZN 3225.50, -31.43, -1.0%), and Facebook (FB 270.23, -2.99, -1.1%) are down at least 1.0% on no specific news catalysts. Given their mega-cap sizes, their losses have been meaningful drags on the major indices today.The one mega-cap exception is Tesla (TSLA 742.90, +37.2, +5.3%), which is rallying 5% to fresh record highs after reporting record Q4 deliveries. It's outsized gain is helping limit the decline in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (-0.1%).10:00 ETDow -98.01 at 30508.41, Nasdaq +0.46 at 12888.75, S&P -6.47 at 3749.6[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is currently down 0.1%, while the Russell 2000 trades higher by 0.3%.Just in, total construction spending increased 0.9% m/m in November (Briefing.com consensus +0.9%) on the heels of an upwardly revised 1.6% increase (from +1.3%) in October.Separately, the December IHS Markit Manufacturing PMI increased to 57.1 from 56.5 in November.09:40 ETDow -39.62 at 30566.8, Nasdaq -7.58 at 12880.71, S&P -2.23 at 3753.84[BRIEFING.COM] The major indices opened the session in the green but have recently slipped into the red.

Notably, the U.S. dollar continues to weaken against foreign currencies, which has benefited global stocks and U.S. multinational companies.Specifically, the U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.5% to 89.51, and is trading at its lowest level since April 2018, largely due to continued expectations for improved economic growth overseas following another round of encouraging manufacturing PMIs for December out of the eurozone and Asia.The data has overshadowed news that Germany is aiming to extend lockdown measures through the end of January, and that the UK and Japan are also thinking about tightening lockdown restrictions.

The Nasdaq Composite (+0.1%) and Russell 2000 (-0.3%) underperformed today, but the Nasdaq managed to eke out a gain.For most of the day, the S&P 500 traded virtually unchanged amid a lack of conviction from buyers and sellers. Buying interest, however, increased noticeably shortly after the early close of the Treasury market at 2:00 p.m. ET on no specific news catalyst, which was symptomatic of reduced market participation.The advance was led by the financials (+1.3%), utilities (+1.6%), real estate (+1.3%), and health care (+1.1%) sectors with gains over 1.0%; conversely, the energy (-0.8%) and consumer discretionary (-0.02%) sectors ended the session in the red.The latest weekly report for initial and continuing claims showed initial claims decrease by 19,000 to 787,000 (Briefing.com consensus 800,000) and continuing claims decline to their lowest level since March at 5.219 million. The market didn't react to the data, nor to much of anything today, really.On the coronavirus front, daily U.S. coronavirus hospitalizations and deaths hit new highs on Wednesday, the faster-spreading variant of the coronavirus was recorded in California, San Francisco will reportedly extend its stay-at-home and quarantine-after-travel orders indefinitely, and vaccination efforts in the U.S. are running behind schedule.Recapping the moves in the Treasury market, the 2-yr yield decreased one basis point to 0.12% (-145 bps in 2020), and the 10-yr yield decreased one basis point to 0.92% (-100 bps in 2020). The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 89.93. WTI crude futures decreased 0.3%, or $0.12, to $48.27/bbl (-21.5% in 2020).Reviewing Thursday's economic data:Initial claims for the week ending December 26 decreased by 19,000 to 787,000 (Briefing.com consensus 800,000). Continuing claims for the week ending December 19 decreased by 103,000 to 5.219 million.That's the lowest level of continuing claims since March, yet the key takeaway and harder-hitting reality is that initial claims were just 220,000 in the same period a year ago while continuing claims were just 1.728 million.Looking ahead, investors will receive Construction Spending for November and the IHS Markit Manufacturing PMI for December on Monday when the market reopens for the new year.Nasdaq Composite +43.6% YTDRussell 2000 +18.4% YTDS&P 500 +16.3% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +7.3% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1843/1269. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1739/2010.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: January 4, 2021End of Document

The Nasdaq Composite (-2.5%) and Russell 2000 (-2.1%) are also down more than 2.0%.Contributing to the positive start was Tesla (TSLA 722.48, +16.81, +2.4%) reporting record Q4 deliveries, expansionary December manufacturing PMIs out of the eurozone and Asia, and general buying momentum. The advance was short-lived with investors currently looking at a disappointing picture ahead of tomorrow's Senate election runoff in Georgia.Every sector in the S&P 500 is trading in negative territory, including real estate (-3.0%), industrials (-3.0%), information technology (-2.8%), and communication services (-2.6) at the bottom of the standings. The energy sector (-0.6%) is showing relative outperformance despite the decline in oil prices ($47.57, -0.94, -1.9%).Generally, investors are de-risking and seeking shelter in traditional safe-haven assets like Treasuries and the U.S. dollar. The 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 0.91% after touching 0.95% earlier today, and the dollar index trades flat after being down as much as 0.6%.The CBOE Volatility Index has spiked 22.9% to 27.95 amid increased hedging interest to protect against further equity weakness.In M&A activity, FLIR Systems (FLIR 51.95, +8.11, +18.5%) agreed to be acquired by Teledyne (TDY 356.94, -25.05, -8.9%) in a cash and stock deal valued at $8.0 billion. Magellan Health (MGLN 93.49, +10.65, +12.9%) agreed to be acquired by Centene (CNC 60.60, +0.57, +0.9%) for $95 per share, or a total enterprise value of $2.2 billion, in cash.Reviewing today's economic data:Total construction spending increased 0.9% in November (Briefing.com consensus 0.9%) after increasing a revised 1.6% (from 1.3%) in October. Total private construction spending rose 1.2% m/m and total public construction spending decreased 0.2%.The key takeaway from the report is that residential construction spending showed strength for another month as mortgage rates remained low, supporting demand for homes outside urban areas.The December IHS Markit Manufacturing PMI increased to 57.1 from 56.5 in November. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 713/2417. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1196/2556.12:30 ETDow -623.08 at 29983.34, Nasdaq -288.88 at 12599.41, S&P -80.10 at 3675.97[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is trading lower by 2.1% amid increased de-risking efforts. Attention is starting to shift to the Senate election-runoff in Georgia tomorrow.Current polls indicate the races are too close to predict, but there is some speculation that the two Democrats could win the seats based on the average of the polls right now. If that happens, the Democrats would have the majority with President-elect Biden's vote.Solar stocks are reacting favorably to this potential outcome, evidenced by the gains in stocks like Azure Power (AZRE 44.40, +3.63, +8.9%) and First Solar (FSLR 101.53, +2.61, +2.6%). We don't want to speculate too much on the broad market reaction until the results are clear, but it was worth reminding readers.12:00 ETDow -614.72 at 29991.7, Nasdaq -213.18 at 12675.11, S&P -70.01 at 3686.06[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is trading at fresh session lows with a 1.8% decline, which is comparable to the declines in the Dow (-2.0%), Nasdaq (-1.6%), and Russell 2000 (-1.6%).Looking at some key analyst recommendations on this down day, AT&T (T 29.14, +0.38, +1.3%) was upgraded to Outperform from Mkt Perform at Raymond James, and Morgan Stanley (MS 68.62, +0.09, +0.1%) was upgraded to Overweight from Equal Weight at Barclays.Separately, China's Global Times is reporting that the Chinese government may require U.S. companies doing business in China to reveal links to the U.S. military. The report was published a few minutes before the recent downtick in the market.Over in Europe, the major indices closed on a higher note despite the specter of tightened lockdown measures. Germany's DAX increased 0.1%, UK's FTSE increased 1.8%, and France's CAC increased 0.7%. The Europe Stoxx 600 advanced 0.7%.11:30 ETDow -498.54 at 30107.88, Nasdaq -157.93 at 12730.36, S&P -52.42 at 3703.65[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is off session lows (-1.7%) with a current 1.4% decline in a tactical bounce. Every sector in the benchmark index is trading lower, including nine that are down at least 1.0%.Growth concerns are not at the root of selling since Treasuries are trading little changed and growth stocks are down alongside value stocks. In addition, global stocks traded higher following expansionary manufacturing PMIs for December out of the eurozone and Asia.Instead, investors appear to be taking profits to begin the year, having avoided any taxes they would have had to pay this year if they sold last Thursday. Now they can wait a whole year to pay taxes on today's profits.11:00 ETDow -449.66 at 30156.76, Nasdaq -114.38 at 12773.91, S&P -41.57 at 3714.5[BRIEFING.COM] The market has weakened amid widespread selling pressure that has taken the S&P 500 down 1.1% to around the 3715 level.Despite the intraday weakness, two areas of relative strength include the S&P 500 materials sector (+0.2%) and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (+1.8%). The material space is benefiting from higher metal prices while the chip space is benefiting from broad-based buying interest.Notable chip gainers include AMD (AMD 94.76, +3.04, +3.3%), Taiwan Semi (TSM 112.56, +3.52, +3.2%), and Cree (CREE 110.60, +4.70, +4.4%). It's worth noting that the PHLX is trading at fresh all-time highs.10:25 ETDow -235.16 at 30371.26, Nasdaq -10.14 at 12878.15, S&P -17.47 at 3738.6[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is trading at session lows with a 0.5% decline amid losses in nine of its 11 sectors. Influential weakness is coming from the communication services (-1.1%) and information technology (-0.4%) sectors.Namely, shares of Apple (AAPL 130.86, -1.81, -1.3%), Microsoft (MSFT 220.22, -2.22, -1.0%), Amazon (AMZN 3225.50, -31.43, -1.0%), and Facebook (FB 270.23, -2.99, -1.1%) are down at least 1.0% on no specific news catalysts. Given their mega-cap sizes, their losses have been meaningful drags on the major indices today.The one mega-cap exception is Tesla (TSLA 742.90, +37.2, +5.3%), which is rallying 5% to fresh record highs after reporting record Q4 deliveries. It's outsized gain is helping limit the decline in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (-0.1%).10:00 ETDow -98.01 at 30508.41, Nasdaq +0.46 at 12888.75, S&P -6.47 at 3749.6[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is currently down 0.1%, while the Russell 2000 trades higher by 0.3%.Just in, total construction spending increased 0.9% m/m in November (Briefing.com consensus +0.9%) on the heels of an upwardly revised 1.6% increase (from +1.3%) in October.Separately, the December IHS Markit Manufacturing PMI increased to 57.1 from 56.5 in November.09:40 ETDow -39.62 at 30566.8, Nasdaq -7.58 at 12880.71, S&P -2.23 at 3753.84[BRIEFING.COM] The major indices opened the session in the green but have recently slipped into the red. The S&P 500 is down 0.1%, the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%.An early look at the S&P 500 sectors shows the information technology (-0.4%) and real estate (-0.4%) sectors as laggards, while the energy (+0.9%) and materials (+0.9%) sectors outperform in early action.Longer-dated Treasuries are trending lower, pushing those yields higher. The 2-yr yield is flat at 0.12%, while the 10-yr yield is up three basis points to 0.95%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.4% to 89.57.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +61.80.The S&P 500 futures trade 18 points, or 0.5%, above fair value to begin the new year, as buying interest carries over from last year's strong finish amid no specific news catalysts. Notably, the U.S. dollar continues to weaken against foreign currencies, which has benefited global stocks and U.S. multinational companies.Specifically, the U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.5% to 89.51, and is trading at its lowest level since April 2018, largely due to continued expectations for improved economic growth overseas following another round of encouraging manufacturing PMIs for December out of the eurozone and Asia.The data has overshadowed news that Germany is aiming to extend lockdown measures through the end of January, and that the UK and Japan are also thinking about tightening lockdown restrictions. Separately, Tesla (TSLA 720.58, +14.91, +2.1%) is providing strong support after reporting record-setting Q4 deliveries.In U.S. data, investors will receive the IHS Markit Manufacturing PMI for December at 9:45 a.m. ET and Construction Spending for November (Briefing.com consensus 0.9%) at 10:00 a.m. ET.U.S. Treasuries trade little changed.

The Nasdaq Composite (+0.1%) and Russell 2000 (-0.3%) underperformed today, but the Nasdaq managed to eke out a gain.For most of the day, the S&P 500 traded virtually unchanged amid a lack of conviction from buyers and sellers. Buying interest, however, increased noticeably shortly after the early close of the Treasury market at 2:00 p.m. ET on no specific news catalyst, which was symptomatic of reduced market participation.The advance was led by the financials (+1.3%), utilities (+1.6%), real estate (+1.3%), and health care (+1.1%) sectors with gains over 1.0%; conversely, the energy (-0.8%) and consumer discretionary (-0.02%) sectors ended the session in the red.The latest weekly report for initial and continuing claims showed initial claims decrease by 19,000 to 787,000 (Briefing.com consensus 800,000) and continuing claims decline to their lowest level since March at 5.219 million. The market didn't react to the data, nor to much of anything today, really.On the coronavirus front, daily U.S. coronavirus hospitalizations and deaths hit new highs on Wednesday, the faster-spreading variant of the coronavirus was recorded in California, San Francisco will reportedly extend its stay-at-home and quarantine-after-travel orders indefinitely, and vaccination efforts in the U.S. are running behind schedule.Recapping the moves in the Treasury market, the 2-yr yield decreased one basis point to 0.12% (-145 bps in 2020), and the 10-yr yield decreased one basis point to 0.92% (-100 bps in 2020). The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 89.93. WTI crude futures decreased 0.3%, or $0.12, to $48.27/bbl (-21.5% in 2020).Reviewing Thursday's economic data:Initial claims for the week ending December 26 decreased by 19,000 to 787,000 (Briefing.com consensus 800,000). Continuing claims for the week ending December 19 decreased by 103,000 to 5.219 million.That's the lowest level of continuing claims since March, yet the key takeaway and harder-hitting reality is that initial claims were just 220,000 in the same period a year ago while continuing claims were just 1.728 million.Looking ahead, investors will receive Construction Spending for November and the IHS Markit Manufacturing PMI for December on Monday when the market reopens for the new year.Nasdaq Composite +43.6% YTDRussell 2000 +18.4% YTDS&P 500 +16.3% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +7.3% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1843/1269. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1739/2010.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: January 4, 2021End of Document

This morning, BofA Securities downgraded SWK to Underperform (Sell equivalent) on intensifying competition and worries about its MTD Products business.Conversely, specialty apparel company L Brands (LB 39.78, +2.59, +6.96%) is one of the better-performing names today.14:00 ETDow -456.74 at 30149.68, Nasdaq -193.34 at 12694.95, S&P -56.37 at 3699.7[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages are all now separated by less than 0.1% in today's declines with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (-1.50%) and S&P 500 (-1.50%) tied at the bottom.Gold futures settled $51.50 higher (+2.7%) to $1,946.60/oz, pushing back above the $1,900 psych level as equities took a tumble to start the new year.The U.S. Dollar Index stands little changed to this point at $89.92.13:30 ETDow -499.78 at 30106.64, Nasdaq -214.46 at 12673.83, S&P -64.11 at 3691.96[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continued to pare session-worst losses in the last half hour with the DJIA (-1.63%) now down a hair less than 500 points.A look inside the Dow Jones Industrial Average shows that Coca-Cola (KO 52.41, -2.43, -4.43%), Boeing (BA 205.04, -9.02, -4.21%), and Travelers (TRV 136.16, -4.21, -3.00%) are underperforming. KO and BA are lower following morning sell side downgrades, while TRV and insurance names in general post modest losses; we'd point out that this morning, mortgage insurer Genworth Financial (GNW 2.73, -1.05, -27.78%) and China Oceanwide announced that the two parties hadn't extended their December 31, 2020 deal "end date."Conversely, pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA 41.04, +1.16, +2.91%) sits atop the index, aided by reports that Haven, the Amazon, Berkshire, JPMorgan Chase healthcare JV, would disband at the end of the month after 3 years in business.12:55 ETDow -692.89 at 29913.53, Nasdaq -323.00 at 12565.29, S&P -89.83 at 3666.24[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 (-2.4%) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (-2.3%) opened the new year at incremental all-time highs, but both indices are currently down more than 2.0% amid widespread profit-taking interest. The Nasdaq Composite (-2.5%) and Russell 2000 (-2.1%) are also down more than 2.0%.Contributing to the positive start was Tesla (TSLA 722.48, +16.81, +2.4%) reporting record Q4 deliveries, expansionary December manufacturing PMIs out of the eurozone and Asia, and general buying momentum. The advance was short-lived with investors currently looking at a disappointing picture ahead of tomorrow's Senate election runoff in Georgia.Every sector in the S&P 500 is trading in negative territory, including real estate (-3.0%), industrials (-3.0%), information technology (-2.8%), and communication services (-2.6) at the bottom of the standings. The energy sector (-0.6%) is showing relative outperformance despite the decline in oil prices ($47.57, -0.94, -1.9%).Generally, investors are de-risking and seeking shelter in traditional safe-haven assets like Treasuries and the U.S. dollar. The 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 0.91% after touching 0.95% earlier today, and the dollar index trades flat after being down as much as 0.6%.The CBOE Volatility Index has spiked 22.9% to 27.95 amid increased hedging interest to protect against further equity weakness.In M&A activity, FLIR Systems (FLIR 51.95, +8.11, +18.5%) agreed to be acquired by Teledyne (TDY 356.94, -25.05, -8.9%) in a cash and stock deal valued at $8.0 billion. Magellan Health (MGLN 93.49, +10.65, +12.9%) agreed to be acquired by Centene (CNC 60.60, +0.57, +0.9%) for $95 per share, or a total enterprise value of $2.2 billion, in cash.Reviewing today's economic data:Total construction spending increased 0.9% in November (Briefing.com consensus 0.9%) after increasing a revised 1.6% (from 1.3%) in October. Total private construction spending rose 1.2% m/m and total public construction spending decreased 0.2%.The key takeaway from the report is that residential construction spending showed strength for another month as mortgage rates remained low, supporting demand for homes outside urban areas.The December IHS Markit Manufacturing PMI increased to 57.1 from 56.5 in November. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 713/2417. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1196/2556.12:30 ETDow -623.08 at 29983.34, Nasdaq -288.88 at 12599.41, S&P -80.10 at 3675.97[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is trading lower by 2.1% amid increased de-risking efforts. Attention is starting to shift to the Senate election-runoff in Georgia tomorrow.Current polls indicate the races are too close to predict, but there is some speculation that the two Democrats could win the seats based on the average of the polls right now. If that happens, the Democrats would have the majority with President-elect Biden's vote.Solar stocks are reacting favorably to this potential outcome, evidenced by the gains in stocks like Azure Power (AZRE 44.40, +3.63, +8.9%) and First Solar (FSLR 101.53, +2.61, +2.6%). We don't want to speculate too much on the broad market reaction until the results are clear, but it was worth reminding readers.12:00 ETDow -614.72 at 29991.7, Nasdaq -213.18 at 12675.11, S&P -70.01 at 3686.06[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is trading at fresh session lows with a 1.8% decline, which is comparable to the declines in the Dow (-2.0%), Nasdaq (-1.6%), and Russell 2000 (-1.6%).Looking at some key analyst recommendations on this down day, AT&T (T 29.14, +0.38, +1.3%) was upgraded to Outperform from Mkt Perform at Raymond James, and Morgan Stanley (MS 68.62, +0.09, +0.1%) was upgraded to Overweight from Equal Weight at Barclays.Separately, China's Global Times is reporting that the Chinese government may require U.S. companies doing business in China to reveal links to the U.S. military. The report was published a few minutes before the recent downtick in the market.Over in Europe, the major indices closed on a higher note despite the specter of tightened lockdown measures. Germany's DAX increased 0.1%, UK's FTSE increased 1.8%, and France's CAC increased 0.7%. The Europe Stoxx 600 advanced 0.7%.11:30 ETDow -498.54 at 30107.88, Nasdaq -157.93 at 12730.36, S&P -52.42 at 3703.65[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is off session lows (-1.7%) with a current 1.4% decline in a tactical bounce. Every sector in the benchmark index is trading lower, including nine that are down at least 1.0%.Growth concerns are not at the root of selling since Treasuries are trading little changed and growth stocks are down alongside value stocks. In addition, global stocks traded higher following expansionary manufacturing PMIs for December out of the eurozone and Asia.Instead, investors appear to be taking profits to begin the year, having avoided any taxes they would have had to pay this year if they sold last Thursday. Now they can wait a whole year to pay taxes on today's profits.11:00 ETDow -449.66 at 30156.76, Nasdaq -114.38 at 12773.91, S&P -41.57 at 3714.5[BRIEFING.COM] The market has weakened amid widespread selling pressure that has taken the S&P 500 down 1.1% to around the 3715 level.Despite the intraday weakness, two areas of relative strength include the S&P 500 materials sector (+0.2%) and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (+1.8%). The material space is benefiting from higher metal prices while the chip space is benefiting from broad-based buying interest.Notable chip gainers include AMD (AMD 94.76, +3.04, +3.3%), Taiwan Semi (TSM 112.56, +3.52, +3.2%), and Cree (CREE 110.60, +4.70, +4.4%). It's worth noting that the PHLX is trading at fresh all-time highs.10:25 ETDow -235.16 at 30371.26, Nasdaq -10.14 at 12878.15, S&P -17.47 at 3738.6[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is trading at session lows with a 0.5% decline amid losses in nine of its 11 sectors. Influential weakness is coming from the communication services (-1.1%) and information technology (-0.4%) sectors.Namely, shares of Apple (AAPL 130.86, -1.81, -1.3%), Microsoft (MSFT 220.22, -2.22, -1.0%), Amazon (AMZN 3225.50, -31.43, -1.0%), and Facebook (FB 270.23, -2.99, -1.1%) are down at least 1.0% on no specific news catalysts. Given their mega-cap sizes, their losses have been meaningful drags on the major indices today.The one mega-cap exception is Tesla (TSLA 742.90, +37.2, +5.3%), which is rallying 5% to fresh record highs after reporting record Q4 deliveries. It's outsized gain is helping limit the decline in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (-0.1%).10:00 ETDow -98.01 at 30508.41, Nasdaq +0.46 at 12888.75, S&P -6.47 at 3749.6[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is currently down 0.1%, while the Russell 2000 trades higher by 0.3%.Just in, total construction spending increased 0.9% m/m in November (Briefing.com consensus +0.9%) on the heels of an upwardly revised 1.6% increase (from +1.3%) in October.Separately, the December IHS Markit Manufacturing PMI increased to 57.1 from 56.5 in November.09:40 ETDow -39.62 at 30566.8, Nasdaq -7.58 at 12880.71, S&P -2.23 at 3753.84[BRIEFING.COM] The major indices opened the session in the green but have recently slipped into the red. The S&P 500 is down 0.1%, the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%.An early look at the S&P 500 sectors shows the information technology (-0.4%) and real estate (-0.4%) sectors as laggards, while the energy (+0.9%) and materials (+0.9%) sectors outperform in early action.Longer-dated Treasuries are trending lower, pushing those yields higher. The 2-yr yield is flat at 0.12%, while the 10-yr yield is up three basis points to 0.95%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.4% to 89.57.

The Europe Stoxx 600 is currently up 1.5%.One area of relative weakness is the U.S. dollar, which is down 0.4% to 89.56 against a basket of six foreign currencies amid expectations for an economic recovery overseas.08:50 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: +15.90.

Hong Kong Pro-Democracy Site Slams Internet Providers Over Blocked AccessCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 11, 2021 MondayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 496 wordsBody(Bloomberg) -- The editor of a pro-democracy website in Hong Kong accused internet service providers of cooperating with government agencies to block access to its content, saying they were restricting “citizens’ rights and freedom to access information.”In an online statement accessed by Bloomberg News outside of Hong Kong, the chief editor of HKChronicles.com said users located inside the city had informed her of problems connecting to the website since January 6, 2021. She said there was a misconception the publication was blocking its own users from the site.“We never prevent users from accessing our website based on their location or Internet Service Provider and we are not planning to do so in the future,” Naomi Chan said in the statement.Instead, Chan wrote, “we found that some ISPs of Hong Kong ... deliberately dropped any connection to our servers.”“Based on reports from users, the ISPs that had participated in the blocking of our website includes Smartone, CMHK, HKBN and PCCW,” the statement said.PCCW Ltd. declined to comment on the report, while SmarTone Telecommunications Holdings Ltd., HKBN Ltd. and China Mobile Hong Kong, a subsidiary of China Mobile Ltd., did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Neither the Hong Kong government or police immediately responded to emails seeking comment on Monday morning.HKChronicles.com features pro-democracy articles, documents allegations of excessive police force and regularly reveals personal information like mobile phone numbers for pro-government people, including government officials and police officers.Last week, local news website Ming Pao reported that police blocked HKChronicles.com, citing the National Security Law, without specifying which content violated the law. It attributed the news to police sources it didn’t identify.Ming Pao reported that Hong Kong police declined to comment on individual cases, but the authorities cited Article 43 of the National Security Law, which states the officers can order service providers to block access to electronic information deemed likely to constitute a crime endangering national security.The introduction of the national security law last year raised concerns among Hong Kong’s internet users that the Chinese government would cut the free flow of information the city has long enjoyed.The suite of legislation includes guidance that allows police to ask technology and telecommunications companies to delete or restrict access to information, and there are limited options for companies to resist those requests.Hours after the law was introduced big tech firms, including Microsoft Corp. and Zoom Video Communications Inc., suspended requests for data from the Hong Kong government.Along with condemning the severing of access to her website, Naomi Chan used her statement to users to “advise Hong Kongers to make early preparations to counter future Internet blockage at a larger scale, and to face the darkness before the dawn.”Load-Date: January 12, 2021End of Document

The growth is mainly due to the companies rearranging their operations and recovering from the COVID-19 impact, which had earlier led to restrictive containment measures involving social distancing, remote working, and the closure of commercial activities that resulted in operational challenges. The market is expected to reach $296.24 billion in 2025 at a CAGR of 8%.The cheese market consists of sales of cheese by entities (organizations, sole traders and partnerships) that produce cheese products (except cottage cheese) from raw milk and/or processed milk products, and cheese substitutes from soybean and other non-dairy substances. The companies in the industry package and distribute their products through various distribution channels to both individual customers and commercial establishments. The cheese market is segmented into natural cheese and processed cheese.Asia Pacific was the largest region in the global cheese market, accounting for 36% of the market in 2020. North America was the second largest region accounting for 29% of the global cheese market. Africa was the smallest region in the global cheese market.The internet of things (IoT) technology is increasingly being used to track dairy products and ensure safe product handling. IoT technology consists of a network of devices, vehicles or other items that continuously exchange data and provide insights about a process or system. This technology is being used to track ingredients being used in products. Equipment connected to the internet in trucks and storage coolers can be used to monitor dairy products and tag them with environmental conditions like temperature or location that provide information about safe product handling during transportation. For instance, the Chinese government implemented the National Food Quality Safety Traceability Platform, using IoT technology to improve quality and safety of food production supply chains.The outbreak of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has acted as a massive restraint on the cheese manufacturing market in 2020 as supply chains were disrupted due to trade restrictions and consumption declined due to lockdowns imposed by governments globally. COVID 19 is an infectious disease with flu-like symptoms including fever, cough, and difficulty in breathing. The virus was first identified in 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei province of the People's Republic of China and spread globally including Western Europe, North America and Asia. Food and beverage manufacturers depend on supply of raw materials from domestic and international suppliers. As many governments restricted the movement of goods across countries and locally, manufacturers had to halt production due to lack of raw materials. Also, restrictions on trade of non-essential goods and fear of contamination through manufacturing facilities contributed to the decline. The outbreak is expected to continue to have a negative impact on businesses throughout 2020 and into 2021. However, it is expected that the cheese manufacturing market will recover from the shock across the forecast period as it is a 'black swan' event and not related to ongoing or fundamental weaknesses in the market or the global economy.The increasing demand for local, sustainable and organic food production is expected to positively impact the cheese manufacturing market during the forecast period. Organic food production including organic dairy products places a strong emphasis on consumer health, environmental protection and animal welfare. Consumers now are becoming more concerned with how food is raised and prepared and are willing to pay a little more for something they recognize as healthy. Across Europe, there is a very high import rate (especially for fruits and vegetables) as the rate of production is far lower than the consumption demands for organic produce. For instance, according to the Soil Association, sales of organic products in the UK increased by 4.5% in 2019 to reach £2.45 billion. Similarly, sales of organic food in the US increased by 5.9% to reach $47.9 billion, according to the 2019 Organic Industry Survey. This growing demand for organic products such as cheese offers considerable opportunities for dairy products producers in both developed and developing countries, thus likely to drive the cheese manufacturing industry market during the forecast period.

Ozil bids farewell to Arsenal, joins Fenerbahce in TurkeyAssociated Press InternationalJanuary 17, 2021 Sunday 11:54 PM GMTCopyright 2021 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: SPORTS NEWSLength: 457 wordsDateline: ISTANBUL, Turkey BodyISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) — Mesut Ozil said farewell to Arsenal teammates and flew to Turkey on Sunday to join Fenerbahce in a bid to reignite a once-flourishing career that faltered in London.The former Germany midfielder, who is of Turkish descent, hasn’t played for Arsenal since March after falling out of favor with manager Mikel Arteta over concerns about the player’s work rate.“I am very excited. I’ve said I’m a Fenerbahce fan. I am very happy to be coming to Fenerbahce," Ozil said in a telephone interview with Turkish broadcaster BBO Sports. "God has granted me the chance to wear the Fenerbahce uniform as a Fenerbahce fan. I will do my best for the team.”The 32-year-old Ozil wasn’t even included in Arsenal’s Premier League squad for the season despite being one of the highest earners and has been ostentatiously tweeting his support for the team from his home during matches.Now Arsenal has managed to offload Ozil before his contract expires in June. Fenerbahce posted images of Ozil leaving London on a private jet on Sunday night.After 7½ years at Arsenal, which he joined from Real Madrid, Ozil is heading to one of the favored clubs of Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.“Welcome to your home, your country dear @MesutOzil1088," Erdogan spokesman Ibrahim Kalin tweeted.Ozil posed for photos with Erdogan in May 2018 in the run-up to the Turkish general election — prompting serious criticism from German soccer officials and antagonizing some in Germany who felt the player wasn’t fully behind the national team — while the president was an official witness at Ozil’s wedding ceremony.Fenerbahce won the last of its 19 Turkish league titles in 2014. The team has not been in the Champions League group stage since a match-fixing scandal broke in 2011.Ozil’s last match for Arsenal was in March, a week before soccer was suspended at the outbreak of the coronavirus, so he might not be match-sharp to start immediately for Fenerbahce.Ozil became ostracized by Arsenal just as Arteta was hired as manager in December 2019. The club distanced itself from Ozil standing up for Muslims in the Xinjiang province of China after he condemned the detention of more than 1 million Uighurs and other minorities in so-called re-education camps.A social media post from Ozil also denounced China for burning Qurans, closing mosques and the killing of religious scholars.Ozil's criticism of China led to Arsenal’s match being pulled from Chinese television. The Chinese government accused Ozil of being “blinded and misled” and Arsenal said “the content he expressed is entirely Ozil’s personal opinion” and stressed it was not getting involved as a club.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsLoad-Date: January 17, 2021End of Document

The chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) slurry market is expected to register a CAGR of 7% during the forecast period (2020 - 2025); The global market for chemical mechanical planarization(CMP) slurry is expected to grow significantly over the forecast period due to the increasing technological advancements in fabrication and semiconductor processes, mainly to enhance the performance of the semiconductor.GlobeNewswireJanuary 20, 2021 Wednesday 2:59 AM PTCopyright 2021 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: MARKET RESEARCH REPORTSLength: 1265 wordsBodyNew York, Jan.  20, 2021  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Reportlinker.com announces the release of the report "Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP) Slurry Market  - Growth, Trends and Forecasts (2020 - 2025)" - https://www.reportlinker.com/p06009484/?utm_source=GNW  The increasing investment in semiconductor wafer fabrication materials by manufacturers for product innovation is primarily driving the studied market growth.- The United States, Korea, Japan, China, and Singapore are some of the major semiconductor chip producers, which contribute significantly to the studied market growth in terms of consumption and investment. CMP has become a standard manufacturing process practiced by the semiconductor manufacturers to fabricate integrated circuits (IC) and memory disks. Therefore, the growing adoption of these components in markets, like IoT, automotive, and 5G, among others, may also drive the demand for the CMP slurries over the forecast period.- CMP has become a standard manufacturing process practiced by the semiconductor manufacturers to fabricate integrated circuits (IC) and memory disks. Therefore, the growing adoption of these components in markets, like IoT, automotive, and 5G, may also drive the CMP slurries' demand over the forecast period.- CMP has played a significant role in making transistors, and other interconnect devices smaller for building a new generation of chips. The growing adoption of transistors and ongoing development in the industry, down to the 5 nm node from the 14 nm node, also presents massive opportunities for the market vendors.- Asian countries play a significant role in market development, particularly China, which is also building a homegrown chip program for the adoption of local semiconductors in 70% of its products by 2025, up from 16%. Although the recent coronavirus outbreak may affect the industry's supply chain due to more long-term investment in the sector, the industry is expected to recover quickly. For instance, the National IC Investment Fund was introduced in 2014 by the Chinese government to support the semiconductor sector and raised around USD 23 to 30 billion to pay for the second phase in 2018.- The recent COVID-19 pandemic outbreak has created economic turmoil for small, medium, and large-scale industries worldwide. The virus's outbreak has also impacted the demand for smart gadgets due to nation-wide lockdowns, significantly impacting the production and supply chain of these gadgets. Furthermore, with the resumption of these gadgets' production coupled with the slowdown of the virus spread, an exponential increase in the demand for electronic gadgets is expected to open up various market opportunities for the CMP slurry at the global level.Key Market TrendsMemory Occupies the Significant Shares- Flash memory has been an essential driving force due to the increasing popularity of mobile devices with large storage requirements. Also, emerging technology such as NVM (Non-Volatile Memory), which offers better speed and durability than traditional NAND is expected to poise the memory growth. With such enhancements, the CMP process would play a significant role, which would drive the CMP slurry market.- As the NAND technology moved from 2D to 3D, additional CMP steps were added, such as channel poly CMP and staircase (or ILD) CMP. Channel poly CMP is to polish many materials simultaneously, such as SiN, oxide, and poly-Si. Therefore, it needs an individual material rate tunability to meet the final topography requirement. It is thereby increasing the demand for the CMP slurry market.- Flash memory storage has become an essential component in smartphones, not only for consumers whose demand for storage keeps increasing with content creation but also for OEMs from the bill of materials (BoM) cost perspective. The NAND flash demand has been growing exponentially, primarily driven by the growth of the average capacity in smartphones. With the increasing adoption of 5G enabled Smart Phones is expected to increase further demand for market studied in 2020.Taiwan is Expected to Emerge as a Major Player in the Market- The expanding semiconductor manufacturing in the country is mainly driving the adoption of CMP slurry in the country. According to the SEMI, a 20% increase in the purchase of semiconductor production equipment in the third quarter of 2019 helped the country regain its status as the world's biggest semiconductor equipment market in the world. In 2019, the country's semiconductor manufacturing equipment purchases during the period rose by 34% from a year earlier. Taiwan was ranked third in semiconductor equipment purchases in 2019, behind South Korea and China.- Taiwan-based TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker with a more than 50% share in the global market, is also playing a significant role in creating demand for the CMP slurries. The growing advancement in the telecom industry, due to 5G and in the automotive industry, is also fuelling the company's product demand, hence, also developing the scope for the studied market vendors. For instance, Huawei also buys Taiwanese equipment for 5G infrastructure. The company's 5G base stations are mostly equipped with TSMC semiconductors. TSMC is also a client of Cabot Microelectronics, one of the significant vendors in the studied market.- However, the company is witnessing challenges from China's decision to become more self-sufficient in semiconductor production amid its trade war with the United States. Also, the US government is urging many Taiwan companies to curb chip exports to China or Huawei.- Similarly, Taiwan itself is also investing in 5G, with its strategy for 5G rollout. Since the semiconductor manufacturing sector mainly drives the initiative, it is expected to keep up with its IC design customers' demands for different types of digital signal processors for 5G and 5G's high-frequency radio modem circuits. This is expected to bring advancement into the market studied too.Competitive LandscapeThe chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) slurry market is moderately consolidated, with top players accounted for more than 50% of the market share. The market vendors are adopting partnership strategies, product innovations to bring development to the market studied. Some of the recent development in the market are:- March 2020 - US-based ACM Research Inc. launched the Ultra SFP ap tool for advanced packaging solutions. It leverages ACM's stress-free polishing (SFP) technology and integrates it with CMP and wet-etch chambers into a single system. It is designed to save more than 80% of slurry for metal polishing in 2.5D and 3D package applications.- January 2020 - Entegris Inc, acquired Sinmat, a CMP slurry manufacturer. Sinmat's Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP) slurries are used for polishing ultra-hard surface materials, including SiC (silicon carbide) and GaN (gallium nitride). SiC and GaN are substrates utilized in the fast-growing end-markets of power electronics and advanced communications. This acquisition has enhanced the product offerings of Entegris Inc.Reasons to Purchase this report:- The market estimate (ME) sheet in Excel format- 3 months of analyst supportRead the full report: https://www.reportlinker.com/p06009484/?utm_source=GNWAbout ReportlinkerReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution.

After an unfortunate passage through Arsenal, Ozil arrives in FenerbahceCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 18, 2021 MondayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 341 wordsBodyISTANBUL (AP) — Mesut Ozil said goodbye to his Arsenal teammates and travelled to Turkey on Sunday to join Fenerbahce in an attempt to refloat a race that withered in London.The former German national team midfielder, who is of Turkish descent, had not played for Arsenal since March, falling out of favour with manager Mikel Arteta, something attributed to the player's workload."I'm very excited. I said I'm a Fenerbahce fan. I am very happy to come to Fenerbahce," Ozil said in a telephone interview with Turkish network BBO Sports. "God has given me the opportunity to wear Fenerbahce's uniform by being a Fenerbahce fan. I'll do my best for the team."Ozil, 32, was not even included on Arsenal's campus for the Premier League season despite being one of the highest-paid players and constantly showing his support for the club via Twitter from home during matches.Now, Arsenal have managed to get rid of Ozil before his contract expires in June.

The club marked its distance from the player when he supported Muslims in China's Xinjiang Province after condemning the detention of more than one million Uighurs and other minorities in what they have called a re-education camp.In a social media post, Ozil also denounced the burning of the Koran, the closure of mosques and the murder of religious professors.Ozil's criticism of China led to Arsenal's parties no more broadcasting on Chinese television. The Chinese government accused Ozil of being "blinded and deceived" and the English club stated that "the content he expressed is Ozil's personal opinion completely" and emphasized that as a team he was not involved.Load-Date: January 19, 2021End of Document

Bit Digital, Inc. Responds to False AccusationsPR NewswireJanuary 19, 2021 Tuesday 9:00 AM ESTCopyright 2021 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1767 wordsDateline: NEW YORK, Jan. 19, 2021 BodyPR NewswireBit Digital, Inc. (Nasdaq: BTBT), (the "Company"), an emerging bitcoin mining company headquartered in New York is responding to false accusations given to the marketplace. As a result of the recent dramatic rise in the price of bitcoin, with the corresponding increase in our stock price, Management is compelled to refute certain false accusations about the Company and provide an overview of our bitcoin mining operations all of which is publicly available at the SEC's websitehttp://www.sec.gov. Information is being provided so that our bitcoin mining operations can be better understood and independently verified. Our auditors have begun field work for our December 31, 2020 audit, which is expected to be filed well in advance of the April 30, 2021 due date for our Form 20-F.About bitcoin mining operations of the CompanyThe Company has actively sought to disclose the most updated operations data to our public investors and regulators.As disclosed in third quarter financial results on December 18, 2020, the Company owns a total of 40,865 miners, including 7,025 Antminer S17+, 195 Antminer S17E, 32 Antminer S17Pro, 105 Antminer S19Pro, 800 Antminer T3, 9,110 Antminer T17, 256 Antminer T17+, 2,200 Whatsminer M10, 4,125 Whatsminer M20S, 16,917 Whatsminer M21S and 100 Whatsminer M31S, spread over PRC and Texas and Nebraska in the United States.As of January 15, 2021, in Xinjiang Province we had 14,639 bitcoin miners; in Inner Mongolia Province we had 17,926 miners; in Sichuan Province we had 1,650 miners; in Yunnan Province we had 4,550 miners; in Nebraska we had 2,000 miners and in Texas we had 100 miners. However, as a common practice in the mining industry in China we may migrate our miners within the above locations on a seasonal basis depending on water and electricity availability and cost.As disclosed on Form 6-K filed on October 19, 2020, announcing first half of fiscal year 2020 financial results, during the second and third quarters of 2020, the Company had purchased 22,869 second-hand bitcoin miners from non-affiliated persons for aggregate consideration of $18,759,770. As disclosed on Form 6-K filed on December 4. 2020, the Company purchased 17,996 second-hand miners from non-affiliated persons in exchange for an aggregate of 4,344,603 restricted ordinary shares at the market price of $3.20 per share, or an aggregate of $13,902,742.After a third halving of bitcoins in May 2020, our mining strategy has been to mine bitcoins as fast and as many as possible given there are less bitcoins and a lower efficiency of mining. In view of the long delivery time to purchase new miners from miner suppliers like Bitmain and MicroBT, the Company chose to acquire second-hand miners which can be delivered in only a few weeks. Since we never purchased any brand new miners from suppliers in 2020 they would not know of the Company or of its subsidiaries.We have not signed leases for bitcoin mining facilities. In order to achieve lower utility costs, the mining facilities are maintained by our third -party suppliers. A form of hosting service contract of cloud computing devices was filed with the SEC as an exhibit on Form 20-F on July 29, 2020. The bitcoin mining facilities in China are maintained by Hong Kong suppliers. They are our host and they install the miners, provide IT consulting, maintenance and repair work on site for us.The facilities in Nebraska are maintained by Compute North, LLC. As publicly announced on September 17, 2020, Bit Digital USA, Inc., a wholly-owned U.S. subsidiary, entered into a certain agreement with Compute North, an industry leader in large-scale computing infrastructure with headquarters in Minnesota. Compute North provides bitcoin mining colocation services at their Nebraska data center and handles the management of the Company's mining equipment, which has and is expected to save the Company operating utilities and rent costs. The facilities in Texas are similarly maintained by Compute North as well.All of our miners own exclusive serial numbers (SN) distinguished from any other miners and are used for warranty control. The miners are monitored or checked by our operations and finance team at all times to determine the miners' working status. We currently have seven employees including our CEO, CSO and CFO, a Vice President of Mining Operations, a Vice President of North American operations and two accounting staff.The above data has been reviewed by our independent auditors in our publicly filed third quarter financial results. They have visited our PRC sites and are confirming inventory and conducting field work for our 2020 annual audit. As of December 18, 2020, the Company earned an aggregate of 1,331.2 bitcoins during 2020, which can be verified by third party mining pools, Huobi.Pool and Antpool which receive our mining rewards of bitcoins from the network.The mining pools provide a service that coordinates the computing power of independent mining enterprises, like ours, and allow our miners to combine our processing power, increasing the chances of solving a block and getting paid by the network. The pools use software that coordinates the pool members' hashing power, identifies new block rewards and records how much work all the participants are doing. The rewards of bitcoins contributed to a given successful mining algorithm solutions transaction are distributed by the pool operator. The reward is proportionate to our contribution to the pool's overall mining power, used to generate each block, which cannot be distorted by any individual through the bitcoin blockchain.Our rewards of bitcoins are delivered to the accounts of the Company's bitcoin wallets daily and the Company reconciles the number of rewarded bitcoins with mining pools and the custodians daily, monthly and quarterly.About the management of the CompanyIn October 2019 the Company decided to enter the bitcoin mining business as a result of a policy change of the Chinese government which decided to suspend the Company's peer to peer lending business, as well as the business of many other companies, alleging the illegal collection of public deposits. The former CEO and CFO were removed from their management positions as well as from the Board in October 2019. The Board of the Company elected the new CEO and CFO and set up the new management team in October 2019. No other former management and employees were retained and do not have any involvement in the Company's business operations, nor any voice in Management or the Board of Directors since October 2019.About the structure of the CompanyIn February 2020, the Company commenced its bitcoin mining business.On April 8, 2020 the Company acquired XMAX Chain Limited ("XMAX Hong Kong"), as a wholly-owned subsidiary in Hong Kong. XMAX Hong Kong was purchased from an unaffiliated third party. Management determined that XMAX Hong Kong was formed in March 2018. Neither Erke Huang, our CFO, nor Hong Yu, who joined our Company as Chief Strategy Officer and a director on April 19, 2020, had any prior relationship with XMAX Hong Kong.On September 1, 2020, the Company formed Bit Digital USA Inc. ("BT USA"), as a wholly-owned Delaware subsidiary in order to conduct its bitcoin mining business in the U.S.After our acquisition of XMAX Hong Kong and the formation U.S. entities for operations of bitcoin mining and the disposal of old operations of peer-to peer lending business and related legal entities, the Company is a Cayman entity with one HK subsidiary, XMAX Hong Kong and two U.S. subsidiaries, with no subsidiary or VIE legal entities in mainland China.All of the bitcoin mining operations in mainland China are conducted by XMAX Hong Kong. All utility bills and other expenses of the Company's PRC operations are paid to Hong Kong and U.S. suppliers who host our miners. As of this date, we have been advised by PRC counsel, although some provincial or local government of PRC issued special limitations to bitcoin mining operations, the bitcoin mining operations in mainland China are not prohibited by the existing PRC laws enacted by the National People's Congress and its Standing Committee and PRC administrative regulations enacted by the State Council publicly available. Notwithstanding that fact, as PRC laws and policies are subject to change, we have initiated the process of forming a subsidiary or VIE in PRC.About Financial Results of the CompanyAs announced on January 12, 2021, the Company, as a foreign issuer is not required under home country practice to publicly announce its quarterly results. However, on December 21, 2020, the Company voluntarily filed a Form 6-K for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 in order to disclose the latest developments of the Company to the public in a proactive way. Our financial results for the period ended September 30, 2020 were reviewed by our independent auditors, who also reviewed the Company's financial results for the six months ended June 30, 2020.Safe Harbor StatementThis press release may contain certain "forward-looking statements" relating to the business of Bit Digital, Inc., and its subsidiary companies.

Alibaba falls for the absence of Jack MaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 5, 2021 TuesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 213 wordsBodyThe shares of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba fell to 3% on the New York Stock Exchange, as its founder, Jack Ma, has not been seen in public in more than two months. Eventually their titles closed with a drop of 2.10% to $227.85.Ma's absence from public view comes as the Chinese government increased its regulatory pressure on Ant Group and Alibaba.Ant Group's November-planned IPO was ruled out after Chinese authorities increased its regulatory pressure on the giant fintech.The company is now back at the negotiating table to define the terms in which they will adopt important regulations that they must comply with, potentially altering their business model.Just last month an investigation was opened into the e-commerce giant's exclusivity tactics, as authorities are now investigating the company for antitrust violations.The increase in regulatory pressure on Ma's business came weeks after Alibaba's founder criticized China's financial regulatory system at a conference in Shanghai.Ma brazened China's global financial regulations as "an elderly club" and said that "we can't use yesterday's methods to regulate the future." Ma has not been seen in public and was replaced as a judge on an African entrepreneurship television show. termometro.economico@eleconomista.mx Load-Date: January 6, 2021End of Document

Will Alibaba Or Pinduoduo Stock Grow More By 2022?Benzinga.comJanuary 5, 2021 Tuesday 2:40 PM GMTCopyright 2021 Accretive Capital LLC d/b/a Benzinga All Rights ReservedLength: 453 wordsByline: Henry KhederianBodyEvery week, Benzinga conducts a sentiment survey to find out what traders are most excited about, interested in or thinking about as they manage and build their personal portfolios.We surveyed a group of over 500 Benzinga investors on whether shares of Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) or Pinduoduo (NASDAQ: PDD) stock would grow the most by 2022.Alibaba Vs. Pinduoduo StockAlibaba operates China's most-visited online marketplaces- the consumer-to-consumer driven Taobao and business-to-consumer focused Tmall.Alibaba's China marketplaces accounted for 68% of total revenues. Taobao generated revenue through advertising and other merchant data services and Tmall derived revenue from commission fees.Early in 2021, Alibaba shares are trading lower amid media reports founder Jack Ma has not made a public appearance in two months. Chinese regulators in December also launched an antitrust investigation into the company.Pinduoduo operates a competing e-commerce platform in China. The company manages a mobile platform that offers a range of products, including apparel, shoes, bags, food and beverage, electronic appliances, furniture and household goods and auto accessories.Survey SaysAt the time of publication, Pinduoduo shares are trading lower following the death of a company employee as well as overall market weakness.Around 59% of investors from our study said shares of Alibaba will grow more by 2022.Many respondents believe even as China's State Administration for Market Regulation confirmed it has started looking into Alibaba's operations, the e-commerce company will ultimately emerge from the investigation with minimal damage done to its ability to serve the Asian market.For context, the ongoing antitrust investigation into Alibaba stems from the company s policy to instruct that merchants must work either exclusively on its platform or on a rival, but can t work on both.Ma offered to give Beijing parts of his financial technology firm Ant Group in order to repair his and Alibaba's relationship with the Chinese government.Respondents suggested that even if Alibaba were forced into dropping the aforementioned merchant agreement, a vast majority of their massive customer base who are accustomed to the platform will continue to stay loyal to Alibaba s products and services.See Also: Best Index Funds.This survey was conducted by Benzinga in January 2021 and included the responses of a diverse population of adults 18 or older.Opting into the survey was completely voluntary, with no incentives offered to potential respondents. The study reflects results from over 500 adults.Photo credit: Andy Mitchell, Flickr© 2021 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice.

Milk And Butter Global Market Report 2021: COVID 19 Impact and Recovery to 2030; Major companies in the milk and butter market include Nestle; Danone; Arla Foods; MÃ¼ller Group. and Lactalis. The global milk and butter market is expected to grow from $299. 72 billion in 2020 to $316.GlobeNewswireFebruary 4, 2021 Thursday 2:30 AM PTCopyright 2021 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: MARKET RESEARCH REPORTSLength: 853 wordsBodyNew York, Feb.  04, 2021  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Reportlinker.com announces the release of the report "Milk And Butter Global Market Report 2021: COVID 19 Impact and Recovery to 2030" - https://www.reportlinker.com/p06018920/?utm_source=GNW 44 billion in 2021 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.6%. The growth is mainly due to the companies rearranging their operations and recovering from the COVID-19 impact, which had earlier led to restrictive containment measures involving social distancing, remote working, and the closure of commercial activities that resulted in operational challenges. The market is expected to reach $417.26 billion in 2025 at a CAGR of 7%.The milk and butter market consists of sales of milk and butter by entities (organizations, sole traders and partnerships) that produce processed milk products such as pasteurized milk, cream, creamery butter, sour cream and fluid milk dairy substitutes from soybeans and other non-dairy substances. The companies in the industry package and distribute their products through various distribution channels to both individual customers and commercial establishments. The milk and butter market is segmented into milk dairy and butter.Asia Pacific was the largest region in the global milk and butter market, accounting for 49% of the market in 2020. Western Europe was the second largest region accounting for 22% of the global milk and butter market. Africa was the smallest region in the global milk and butter market.The internet of things (IoT) technology is increasingly being used to track dairy products including milk and butter and to ensure safe product handling. IoT technology consists of a network of devices, vehicles or other items that continuously exchange data and provide insights about a process or system. This technology is being used to track ingredients being used in products. Equipment connected to the internet in trucks and storage coolers can be used to monitor dairy products and tag them with environmental conditions like temperature or location that provide information about safe product handling during transportation. For instance, the Chinese government implemented the National Food Quality Safety Traceability Platform, using IoT technology to improve quality and safety of food production supply chains.     .The outbreak of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has acted as a massive restraint on the milk and butter manufacturing market in 2020 as supply chains were disrupted due to trade restrictions and consumption declined due to lockdowns imposed by governments globally. COVID 19 is an infectious disease with flu-like symptoms including fever, cough, and difficulty in breathing. The virus was first identified in 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei province of the People's Republic of China and spread globally including Western Europe, North America and Asia. Food and beverage manufacturers depend on supply of raw materials from domestic and international suppliers. As many governments restricted the movement of goods across countries and locally, manufacturers had to halt production due to lack of raw materials. Also, restrictions on trade of non-essential goods and fear of contamination through manufacturing facilities contributed to the decline. The outbreak is expected to continue to have a negative impact on businesses throughout 2020 and into 2021. However, it is expected that the milk and butter manufacturing market will recover from the shock across the forecast period as it is a 'black swan' event and not related to ongoing or fundamental weaknesses in the market or the global economy.  The increasing demand for local, sustainable and organic food production is expected to positively impact the milk and butter manufacturing market during the forecast period. Organic food production including organic dairy products places a strong emphasis on consumer health, environmental protection and animal welfare. Consumers now are becoming more concerned with how food is raised and prepared and are willing to pay a little more for something they recognize as healthy. Across Europe, there is a very high import rate (especially for fruits and vegetables) as the rate of production is far lower than the consumption demands for organic produce. For instance, according to the Soil Association, sales of organic products in the UK increased by 4.5% in 2019 to reach £2.45 billion. Similarly, sales of organic food in the US increased by 5.9% to reach $47.9 billion, according to the 2019 Organic Industry Survey. This growing demand for organic products offers considerable opportunities for dairy products producers in both developed and developing countries, thus likely to drive the market during the forecast period.Read the full report: https://www.reportlinker.com/p06018920/?utm_source=GNWAbout ReportlinkerReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution.

The company competes with Ciena and others in the telecom and data-center markets.Acacia reportedly has some new customers, such as Amazon.com."We are hopeful that the new U.S. administration strives to normalize Chinese trade relations, and deal approval by the Chinese government would demonstrate good faith," Raymond James analyst Simon Leopold said in a report to clients."We doubt others will try to outbid Cisco.

SCO SECRETARY-GENERAL VLADIMIR NOROV: "STRONGER DIGITAL INTERCONNECTION MAY OPEN UP FRESH PROSPECTS FOR ECONOMIC PROGRESS BY FORMING NEW GROWING POINTS AND ENHANCING THE SCO'S INVESTMENT APPEAL"States News ServiceJanuary 13, 2021 WednesdayCopyright 2021 States News ServiceLength: 610 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: Beijing, China BodyThe following information was released by the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO):On 12 January 2020 the SCO Secretariat hosted a presentation of the Thousand Cities Strategic Algorithms (TCSA) on the topic: National Data Brain: Driving Societal Stability and Economic Revitalisation.The goal of the event was to familiarise the audience with the National Data Centre project, which is designed to create a platform to integrate data on financial, lending and tax policy. It was attended by representatives of Chinese government agencies, business circles and the diplomatic corps of the SCO family, as well as ASEAN and Arab League countries, accredited in China.In his speech at the event, SCO Secretary-General Vladimir Norov pointed out the acceleration in digital transformation during the coronavirus pandemic. He emphasised that, with their vast potential for developing digitalisation and artificial intelligence, the SCO countries are paying much attention to promoting relevant issues. Mr Norov told the audience about the regulations adopted by the SCO countries in this area, which are designed to promote digital transformation for reaching inclusive economic development in the SCO space and removing the disproportions in digital progress between cities and rural areas.Mr Norov noted that the SCO member countries are also paying much attention to developing digitisation and artificial intelligence at national levels. He emphasised the importance of China's proposals, which is one of the world's leaders in this area, at the SCO summit in November 2021. These proposals are aimed at promoting high-tech cooperation and introducing technology advancements into production. Mr Norov also emphasised the importance of the initiative by President of China Xi Jinping on holding a China-SCO forum on the digital economy in Chongqing in 2021.The SCO Secretary-General summed up his speech by saying that stronger digital interconnection may open new prospects for economic progress by forming new growing points and enhancing the SCO's investment appeal. He noted that the promotion of practical cooperation in this area meets the interests of the SCO countries by enhancing their technological competitiveness and socioeconomic wellbeing. He expressed the hope that the TCSA presentation would make a constructive contribution to the exchange of experience in using fintech solutions for central banks with a view to ensuring macroeconomic stability in the SCO countries.Chairman of the TCSA Board Zheng Zhijun reported that the company is the world's first professional organisation that helps cooperating countries create national data centres in accordance with their national interests. He believes this will facilitate sustainable economic growth and help priority economic industries become more competitive.Zheng Zhijun noted that the company has changed the methods of transmitting, storing, computing and using data and designed a logical, profitable and highly effective structure for a national central data processor. He said this digital structure could be continuously streamlined in an interactive format. Like computer and mobile telephone chips it can reduce the costs of computing capacity in processing data in geometrical progression and increase the computing potential of data on the same scale throughout the country.Zheng Zhijun noted that the digital model of the macroeconomic system has enjoyed broad recognition from experts at the World Bank, the IMF, Stanford University and Columbia University. At present, the TCSA is conducting talks on this with central governments and central banks in more than 50 countries.Load-Date: January 19, 2021End of Document

However, it is expected that the dairy food market will recover from the shock across the forecast period as it is a 'black swan' event and not related to ongoing or fundamental weaknesses in the market or the global economyThe increasing demand for local, sustainable and organic food production is expected to positively impact the dairy food market during the forecast period. Organic food production including organic dairy products places a strong emphasis on consumer health, environmental protection and animal welfare. Consumers now are becoming more concerned with how food is raised and prepared and are willing to pay a little more for something they recognize as healthy. Across Europe, there is a very high import rate (especially for fruits and vegetables) as the rate of production is far lower than the consumption demands for organic produce. For instance, according to the Soil Association, sales of organic products in the UK increased by 4.5% in 2019 to reach £2.45 billion. Similarly, sales of organic food in the US increased by 5.9% to reach $47.9 billion, according to the 2019 Organic Industry Survey. This growing demand for organic products offers considerable opportunities for dairy products producers in both developed and developing countries, thus likely to drive the market during the forecast period.Read the full report: https://www.reportlinker.com/p06018948/?utm_source=GNWAbout ReportlinkerReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution.

Trump rushes move to leave before Biden assumesCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 16, 2021 SaturdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 702 wordsBodyOutgoing U.S. President Donald Trump will leave Washington on Wednesday morning, just hours before the assumption of his successor, Democrat Joe Biden, reported US media.The Republican representative, who announced days ago that he will not be at Biden's swearing-in ceremony, will fly to his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, where he intends to settle.Still, Trump's move has already started, to the point that several images of trucks at the White House door, boxes stacked in the gardens and even employees moving paintings and busts went viral on social media.Two of these images are emblematic: in one, an employee carries a bust of former mandarian Abraham Lincoln, and in another worker, in a suit, he wears a framed photograph of what looks like an international summit.Lincoln's bustEach U.S. president uses funds from federal museums to decorate the White House to his liking, and the press at the time published that Trump himself had chosen Lincoln's bust. With the replacement of chief executive, all objects return to their respective museums.The State Department reported that Biden will spend Tuesday night at Blair House, a mansion located very close to the White House and intended to house heads of state on his official visits to Washington.This invitation is a tradition between outgoing and incoming presidents. Blair House was built in 1820 and originally functioned as the home of the eighth Surgeon General of the United States Army, Joseph Lovell, and 16 years later was bought by a close friend of President Andrew Jackson (1829–1837).Most of the images of trucks and boxes that circulated were on the Eisenhower office building on the west side of the White House.On the Twitter network there were many who celebrated the images with mostly ironic comments about Trump's departure.Biden will be in command of the American power on Wednesday, in a traditional ceremony, albeit with a virtual parade with the presence of a thousand budgeted assistants. Vice President Kamala Harris will also take on the same day.Trump's absence makes him the fourth representative who is not in his successor's oath, after John Adams did the same in 1801; John Quincy Adams - son of former President John Adams - in 1829; and Andrew Johnson, in 1869.Biden's administration foresees a thorough clean-up of the White House prior to the inauguration. According to NBC, the new cabinet estimated a budget of nearly half a million dollars for that task, including items to clean carpets and curtains.Against Chinese companiesPrior to his departure, Trump blacklisted Chinese cell phone manufacturer Xiaomi Corp. and China's third-largest oil company for its alleged military ties, increasing pressure on Beijing in President Donald Trump's last week of government.The Department of Defense added nine companies to its list of Chinese firms with military ties, including Xiaomi and state-owned aircraft manufacturer Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China (Comac).U.S. investors will have to get rid of their shares in Chinese companies that are on the military list by November this year, according to an executive order signed by Trump last November.Xiaomi said in a statement that its products are for "civil and commercial use" and assured that it is not owned or affiliated with the Chinese army and that it does not control it either."The company will take appropriate steps to protect the interests of the company and its shareholders," adds the statement, though it does notgave details on what those measures might be.Xiaomi Corp. surpassed Apple Inc. as the world's No. 3 cell phone manufacturer by sales in the third quarter of 2020, according to data from Gartner. Xiaomi's market share grew after Huawei's sales fell when it was blacklisted in the US and its phones were left without access to Google's essential services.Separately, commerce blacklisted China National Offshore Oil Corp. from economic entities.This prohibits U.S. companies from exporting or transferring technology to you unless permission has been obtained from the U.S. government.Another 60 Chinese companies were added to the list in December, including drone manufacturer DJI and semiconductor company SMIC.

WHO mission arrives in Wuhan to study the origin of coronavirusCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 14, 2021 ThursdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 354 wordsBodyA team of experts from the World Health Organization (WHO) tasked with investigating the origin of the coronavirus arrived on Thursday in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where it started the pandemic more than a year ago. The mission consists of 15 scientists from various international organizations from the US. Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Denmark, Australia, Vietnam, Germany and Qatar, which must be quarantined for two weeks. However, two of them had to stay in Singapore as they were not allowed into the country because they did not pass the health tests. Both tested positive for covid-19 antibodies. From WHO they confirmed the information by writing on social media: "The international team of 13 scientists tasked with examining the origins of the virus arrived in Wuhan, China, today (...) Two scientists are still in Singapore for testing."They explained that two of the experts tested positive for IgM antibodies (immunoglobulins M), a form of antibody that the body generates in reaction to the virus. They will now need to undergo a test again to confirm these antibodies and so-called IgG (immunoglobulins G).The arrival of the team keeps generating controversy. The visit was scheduled for last week, but was cancelled at the last minute because all necessary authorizations were missing. A few weeks ago WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he was "very disappointed" by the difficulties Beijing put on the mission. However, the Chinese government denied the accusation. "We look forward to working closely with our (Chinese) peers on this critical mission to identify the source of the virus and its route of introduction to the human population," Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus wrote on Twitter.They were tested again in #Singapore and were all negative for PCR. But two members tested positive for IgM antibodies. They are being retested for both IgM and IgG antibodies.https://t.co/3Yg9UoZ1mx— World Health Organization (WHO) (@WHO) January 14, 2021The WHO Mission entry arrives in Wuhan to study the origin of the coronavirus was first published in the Republic Journal.Load-Date: January 15, 2021End of Document| About LexisNexis | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions | Copyright © 2021 LexisNexis Page 27 of 386China, looking post-virus, to push tech autonomy at Congress  Page 30 of 386China, looking post-virus, to push tech autonomy at Congress  Page 34 of 386ZK International's Subsidiary, xSigma, Published its Roadmap and Announced Ethereum Layer 2 Plans As its DeFi Project Maintains $110 Million of Locked Value  Page 36 of 386Nanfu Wang documentary shows origin of Covid-19  Page 38 of 386Sinovac vaccine against Covid-19 arrives in Mexico  Page 40 of 386The United States blacklisted Xiaomi after the Chinese regime awarded an award to its founder  Page  of 200,000 doses of Covid CoronaVac vaccine arrive in Mexico  Page  of Jack Ma reappeared and Alibaba's actions soared  Page 45 of 386SOS Installs Second Batch of 5,000 Cryptocurrency Miners and Gives First Quarter Mining Projections  Page 60 of 386BE Semiconductor Industries N.V.
