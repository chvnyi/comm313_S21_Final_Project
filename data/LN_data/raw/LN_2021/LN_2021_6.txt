Pres Biden asks court to pause move to ban TikTok in US ASEAN TribuneFebruary 11, 2021 ThursdayCopyright 2021 ASEAN Tribune All Rights ReservedLength: 455 wordsBody 11 February 2021 (NAM News Network) President Joe Biden's administration has asked a US federal court to pause proceedings aimed at banning TikTok to allow for a fresh review of the national security threat from the popular Chinese-owned video app.The filing in a federal appeals court said the new administration had beguna review and would not for the moment press for a ban of the mobile app as sought by former president Donald Trump.The filing said the Commerce Department 'plans to conduct an evaluation of the underlying record justifying those prohibitions' sought by the previous administration of Donald Trump, which claimed TikTok posed a national security threat because of its links to the Chinese government.After the new review, the administration 'will then be better positioned todetermine whether the national security threat' from TikTok.'The Department of Commerce remains committed to a robust defense ofnational security as well as ensuring the viability of our economy andpreserving individual rights and data privacy,' the filing said.The Trump administration move to ban downloads of TikTok and its presence on online networks had been stalled amid legal challenges.In a related development, the Wall Street Journal reported the Bidenadministration has also put on hold a plan to force the sale of TikTok toAmerican investors. The Journal, citing unnamed sources, said the Biden White House had indefinitely shelved the plan to require the sale of TikTok, owned by China's ByteDance, to US tech giant Oracle with Walmart as a partner.The Journal said the new administration is in the midst of a review of datasecurity and ways to prevent the information TikTok collects on Americanusers from being accessed by the Chinese government, but that there would be no imminent move to force the sale.The White House did not directly address the report, but spokeswoman JenPsaki said: 'It's not accurate to suggest that there is a new proactive stepby the Biden White House.'Psaki added that there is a 'rigorous' review of data security of TikTok byan interagency government panel, with no timetable set.'I will note broadly speaking that we are comprehensively evaluating therisks… to US data including from TikTok and will address them in a decisiveand effective fashion,' she said.TikTok, the wildly popular app with an estimated 100 million US users, hasrepeatedly defended itself against allegations of data transfers to theChinese government, saying it stores user information on servers in theUnited States and Singapore.A tentative deal unveiled by the Trump administration would make SiliconValley giant Oracle the technology partner for TikTok and a stakeholder in anew entity to be known as TikTok Global.Load-Date: February 12, 2021End of Document

The9 Limited Reports 2020 Audited Financial ResultsPR NewswireMarch 29, 2021 Monday 7:48 PM ESTCopyright 2021 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1584 wordsDateline: SHANGHAI, March 29, 2021 BodyPR NewswireThe9 Limited (NASDAQ: NCTY) ("The9") announced that it filed its annual report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 with the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on March 29, 2021. The annual report, which contains its audited financial statements, can be accessed on the SEC's website athttp://www.sec.govas well as on the Company's investor relations website athttp://www.the9.com/en/. Shareholders may receive a hard copy of the annual report free of charge upon request.Recent Development:In January 2021, The9 entered into a share subscription and warrant purchase agreement with the holding entities of several investors including Mr. JianPing Kong in the cryptocurrency mining industry in anticipation of developing its cryptocurrency mining business with the assistance of those investors. Pursuant to the purchase agreement, The9 issued certain ordinary shares and warrants to the investors. The warrants are divided into four equal tranches, the exercisability of which are subject to the market capitalization of The9 ranging from US$100 million, US$300 million, US$500 million and US$1 billion within certain time period.Since then, The9 has been actively developing its cryptocurrency mining business, which primarily include the following:In February 2021, NBTC Limited, the wholly-owned subsidiary of The9, signed a strategic cooperation framework purchase agreement, with Shenzhen MicroBT Electronics Technology Co., Ltd., the manufacturer of WhatsMiner bitcoin mining machines. Pursuant to the agreement, NBTC Limited paid a deposit of US$1.4 million and obtained the right of first offer to purchase 5,000 WhatsMiner bitcoin mining machines from MicroBT within one year. As of today, The9 group had completed two batches of purchase and bought 922 WhatsMiner machines, with an approximate hash rate of 66PH/s. These WhatsMiner machines have already been deployed.In March 2021, NBTC Limited signed a Bitcoin mining machine purchase agreement with Bitmain Technologies Limited. Pursuant to the purchase agreement, the Company will purchase 24,000 Antminer S19j Bitcoin mining machines, which are scheduled to deliver starting from November 2021, for a total consideration of US$82.8 million payable by installments according to the agreed time schedule. The first installment of US$16.6 million had been paid.In February 2021, The9 entered into purchase agreements with five Bitcoin mining machine owners to purchase Bitcoin mining machines by issuance of its ordinary shares. Pursuant to the purchase agreements, the Company issued an aggregate of 26,838,360 Class A ordinary shares (equivalent to 894,612 ADSs) at US$0.37 per ordinary share (equivalent to US$11.18 per ADS) in exchange for 26,007 Bitcoin mining machines, with a total hash rate of approximately 549PH/S.In February 2021, The9 signed six legally binding memoranda of understanding with six Bitcoin mining machine owners to purchase Bitcoin mining machines by issuance of ordinary shares. As of today, The9 has entered into definitive purchase agreements with five Bitcoin mining machine owners and The9 has issued an aggregate of 3,832,830 ordinary shares (equivalent to 127,761 ADSs) at US$0.78 per ordinary share (equivalent to US$23.35 per ADS) in exchange for 8,489 Bitcoin mining machines, with a total hash rate of approximately 156PH/S.In March 2021, The9 signed three legally-binding memoranda of understanding with three Bitcoin mining machine owners to purchase Bitcoin mining machines by issuance of ordinary shares. According to the memoranda of understanding, The9 should issue approximately 5,883,750 ordinary shares (equivalent to 196,125 ADSs) to the sellers based on a per share price of approximately US$1.3 per Class A ordinary share (equivalent to US$38.51 per ADS) in exchange for 10,252 Bitcoin mining machines, with a total hash rate of approximately 192PH/S.In February 2021, the Company signed a framework agreement with a Filecoin mining machine vendor to purchase Filecoin mining machines for US$10 million.In February 2021, The9 entered into a standby equity distribution agreement with YA II PN, LTD., a Cayman Islands exempt limited partnership managed by Yorkville Advisor Global, LP pursuant to which The9 is able to sell up to US$100.0 million of ADSs solely at The9's request at any time during the 36 months following the date of the agreement. As of today, The9 has not started to request funding from this equity line.As of today, The9's deployed Bitcoin mining machines are contributing a total hash rate of approximately 693PH/S. Under this current hash rate, The9 is rewarded 3 Bitcoins per day. As of today, The9 has been rewarded 126 Bitcoins.Based on the Bitcoin mining machines currently owned by The9 and taking account to the mining machines purchase agreements The9 had signed, assuming The9 does not sign any new purchase agreement and assuming global hash rate does not increase, by October 2022 The9's Bitcoin mining machines are expected to contribute a total hash rate of approximately 3,558PH/S. Under this hash rate, The9 is expected to be rewarded approximately 15 Bitcoins per day. The cumulative Bitcoins reward is expected to be approximately 5,200 Bitcoins.Other than Bitcoins, the Company is also actively engaged in the mining of Filecoins. As of today, the Company has executed US$1.1 million purchase of Filecoin mining machines under the framework agreement with a Filecoin mining machine vendor. The Company will continue to purchase Filecoin mining machines based on market situation. Currently The9 owns an independent node on Filecoin blockchain and 8 Pebibyte of effective storage mining power in the Filecoin network. Assuming global hash rate does not increase, by August 2022 this 8 Pebibyte of effective storage mining power is expected to generate approximately 200,000 Filecoins for The9. However since the hash rate of the whole Filecoin network is increasing continuously, the actual reward to The9 will be less than 200,000 Filecoin. The9 will continue to invest into Filecoin mining machines according to the growth of Filecoin's market value.Convenience Currency TranslationThe translation of Renminbi (RMB) into US dollars (US$) in this press release is presented solely for the convenience of readers.

RUBIO, SCOTT, COLLEAGUES REINTRODUCE AMERICAN SECURITY DRONE ACTStates News ServiceJanuary 28, 2021 ThursdayCopyright 2021 States News ServiceLength: 667 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, D.C. BodyThe following information was released by Florida Senator Marco Rubio:U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) joined Senator Rick Scott (R-FL) and colleagues in reintroducing the bipartisan American Security Drone Act. The bill was first introduced in September 2019, and was reported out of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs in the 116th Congress.In addition to Rubio and Scott, the legislation is cosponsored by Senators Chris Murphy (D-CT), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Tom Cotton (R-AR) and Josh Hawley (R-MO)."Chinese companies routinely steal U.S. intellectual property and seek to undermine our national security," Rubio said. "The national security risks associated with Chinese manufactured drones are well known, and a number of federal agencies have already taken steps to mitigate this threat. The American Security Drone Act would make sure that American policies do not invite this malicious behavior from the Chinese Communist Party by prohibiting taxpayer dollars to be used to buy drones from Chinese companies or other foreign adversaries.""I'm proud to join my colleagues to reintroduce my American Security Drone Act, which will help protect our national security and the privacy of American citizens by prohibiting the federal government from buying drones manufactured by our adversaries," Scott said. "I've been very clear about the threat we face from technology companies controlled by Communist China, which is known for espionage and theft of technology. For too long, the United States has used taxpayer dollars to buy drones from companies backed by the Communist Chinese Government, allowing one of the United States' biggest adversaries into the most sensitive areas of our government and putting our national security at risk. There's absolutely no reason we should allow this to continue. We must pass the American Security Drone Act immediately.""In no way shape or form should we be using taxpayer dollars to purchase drones from foreign adversariesespecially countries like China that have stolen sensitive information from us in the past," Murphy said. "I'm glad to reintroduce the American Security Drone Act that bans this practice and in turn supports U.S. manufacturers and our national security.""China has stolen sensitive drone technology from America's businesses and military for years, and now sells it back to us from a dominant position in the commercial drone market," Cotton said. "Relying on drones made by our adversaries is a clear risk to our national security. This bill will ensure that all drones purchased by the U.S. government are made right here in America, or else by friendly nations that don't wish us harm.""For decades, the Chinese Communist Party and its companies have stolen America's sensitive technology and used it to boost their military and economy," Hawley said. "It has to end. We must take this common-sense step of banning the federal acquisition of drones from nations like China to strengthen our supply chains and better protect our national security."The American Security Drone Act:Prohibits federal departments and agencies from procuring certain any foreign commercial off-the-shelf drone or covered unmanned aircraft system manufactured or assembled in countries identified as national security threats, and provides a timeline to end current use of these drones.Prohibits the use of federal funds awarded through certain contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements to state or local governments from being used to purchase foreign commercial off-the-shelf drones or covered unmanned aircraft systems manufactured or assembled in a country identified as a national security threat.Requires the Comptroller General of the United States to submit a report to Congress detailing the amount of foreign commercial off-the-shelf drones and covered unmanned aircraft systems procured by federal departments and agencies from countries identified as national security threats.Load-Date: January 28, 2021End of Document

Jack Ma, Alibaba's billionaire, reappears: where have you been these months?CE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 20, 2021 WednesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 602 wordsBodyAlibaba's founding billionaire, Jack Ma, had supposedly been missing for nearly three months. The Chinese businessman had not been seen or made any public intervention since the end of October 2020. Today his long-awaited reappearance took place in a meeting with 100 rural teachers selected for an award given by his foundation. During these 88 days without news of Jack Ma, speculation about his whereabouts grew rapidly fueled by his well-known frictions with the Chinese government.Arrested or silent? The truth is that Jack Ma has not mentioned his absence when he has spoken to this group of teachers by video, although he did ensure that in "the last six months" - a period that includes the nearly three months he has been away from the spotlight - he has remained "active", participating in the process of selecting teachers for the award. He also sent them a message: "When the epidemic is over, we will meet again." The video also contains images, dated January 10, of Ma visiting a school in Tonglu County, part of Hangzhou City, Zhejiang's capital. Antitrust investigation against its subsidiary Ant GroupMa's empire was built on strong pillars: the protection of the Chinese government, which favored the development of the digital economy and allowed the sector to grow without too many regulations. He managed to become the richest man in China and elevated his conglomerate to giant status, with a valuation of about $700 billion. In recent months, however, his apparent status as untouchable seems to have faded. This month, Ma was replaced in the final episode of the reality show "The Heroes of Business in Africa", founded by himself and in which he had been a judge, and is embroiled in amid a regulatory crackdown on his empire by Beijing. In fact, in December the Chinese government launched an antitrust offensive against Alibaba Ant Group's techno-finance subsidiary, the icing on the cake for a bad year.This company, operator of Alipay, China's most widely used electronic payments platform, was to star in the largest IBRO in history in November 2020, but 36 hours before its stock market debut Chinese regulators forced it to be suspended after publishing the draft much more restrictive regulation for the sector.Days earlier, Ma had given a controversial speech in which he was highly critical of Beijing's strategy of minimizing risks in the financial system and with traditional banks, which he said continue to be managed as "pawnshops." That was the last time, to this day, that the billionaire appeared publicly.Since then, despite Ma and Ant's apparent attempts to calm the waters, regulators and the official press have repeatedly criticized the way the sector operates, ensuring that it tricks young people into over-indebtedness or shielding behind the concepts of innovation and technology to enter the banking business without subjecting the regulations they are to comply with.Its appearance animates the Stock ExchangeMa's appearance seems to have given investors peace of mind. Following the publication of the video on the portal of a newspaper in his home province, Zhejiang, the company's shares closed with an 8.52% increase on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, which had fallen by 18% since Ma's last public appearance.The appearance also caused an uptick in the shares of other major digital companies such as Tencent and Meituan, which today rose 3.74% and 9.09%, respectively. In this way, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange benchmark, the Hang Seng closed today with gains of 1.08%.Here you can watch the video of his appearance, collected by the South China Morning Post.Load-Date: January 21, 2021End of Document

SCIENTISTS PUSH BACK ON DOJ CHARGES AGAINST HARVARD PROFESSORStates News ServiceMarch 4, 2021 ThursdayCopyright 2021 States News ServiceLength: 550 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the Voice of America (VOA):By VOA Student UnionMarch 04, 2021 02:19 PMForty academics have signed a letter in support of a Harvard University professor being prosecuted by the U.S. government on charges he lied about his connections with the Chinese government.Seven Nobel Prize winners are among the dozens of scientists asking why the university is not defending Charles Lieber against the charges."Professor Lieber is one of the great scientists of his generation," the letter reads."In the name of combating economic espionage, the Department of Justice has increasingly scrutinized members of the academic community. Several of its investigations reflect a fundamental misunderstanding of modern science, in which open-source practices make discoveries available to all."Lieber, the former chair of Harvard chemistry and chemical biology department, and considered a pioneer in nanotechnology, was charged in January 2020 and indicted in July for allegedly lying about research funding while participating in China's Thousand Talents Program, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) said last year.He is accused of lying to federal authorities in 2018 and 2019 about his involvement in the program, a recruitment plan designed to attract high-level scientists to advance the China technology industry, and his affiliation with the Wuhan University of Technology (WUT)."Under the terms of Lieber's three-year contract, WUT allegedly paid Lieber a salary of up to $50,000 USD per month, living expenses of up to 1 million Chinese Yuan (approximately $158,000 USD at the time) and awarded him more than $1.5 million to establish a research lab at WUT," DOJ said in a release.Lieber faces up to five years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000."Despite his standing in the scientific community or perhaps because of it he has become the target of a tragically misguided government campaign that is discouraging U.S. scientists from collaborating with peers in other countries, particularly China," the letter supporting Lieber states. "In so doing, it is threatening not only the United States' position as a world leader in academic research, but science itself."In January, dozens of scientists signed a similar letter in support of Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Gang Chen, who was indicted on similar charges, specifically failing to disclose ties with China."We are troubled that the complaint against Professor Chen vilifies what should be considered normal academic and research activities, including promoting MIT's mission of global education," wrote the scientists in a petition on Change.org, which has garnered over 1,000 signatures of support."The USA's greatest asset for fostering innovation and attracting the brightest minds is the academic freedom and openness of American science praised throughout the world.... The persecution or burdening of scientists for their interactions and collaborations will come at a great cost of lost ingenuity and decline of our global leadership in science and technology," the petition states.Lieber has filed suit against Harvard University, saying it should pay for his legal expenses. The university has contended that it is not responsible for those costs.Load-Date: March 4, 2021End of Document

Where is Jack Ma? Tech tycoon silent as China gets tough with his businessCNN WireJanuary 4, 2021 Monday 11:58 AM GMTCopyright 2021 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 836 wordsDateline: HONG KONG/TOKYO (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG/TOKYO (CNN Business) --  Jack Ma's businesses are under enormous pressure right now. But the co-founder of China's most successful tech empire and legendary billionaire entrepreneur hasn't been heard from in months.Ma hasn't made a public appearance or social media post since late October, just over a week before a much anticipated stock market listing of Alibaba's financial affiliate, Ant Group, was blocked at the last minute by Chinese regulators.Ant Group has gone from preparing the world's largest initial public offering to being ordered to overhaul large swaths of its business. Chinese regulators have criticized the company for edging out rivals from the market and hurting consumer rights. Alibaba, meanwhile, has been probed in China for alleged monopolistic behavior. And the Wall Street Journal reported last week that Beijing was seeking to shrink Ma's empire and potentially take a larger stake in his businesses, citing Chinese officials and government advisers familiar with the matter.Ma was even absent from the finale of an African talent show he created, according to the Financial Times. The newspaper reported that Ma was replaced as a judge during the November filming of the last episode of "Africa's Business Heroes," a television contest for entrepreneurs. As recently as Oct. 12, Ma said he was looking forward to meeting the finalists during the online finale on Nov. 14.Alibaba told CNN Business on Monday that Ma "had to miss the finale due to scheduling conflict." It declined further comment on his whereabouts.Ma has kept a lower profile within China for some time now, said Duncan Clark, author of "Alibaba: The House that Jack Ma Built" and founder of investment advisory firm BDA China. He added that Beijing wants its narrative about the Ant Group IPO to dominate the public conversation --- and that the company likely knows that it won't help to have any "diversity of opinion" on the issue."But certainly it's remarkable ... the silence is somewhat deafening," he added.While Ma no longer holds executive or board level positions at either of the companies he co-founded --- he stepped down as Alibaba's executive chairman in 2019 --- he is still Alibaba's biggest individual shareholder with nearly 5% worth about $25 billion. Ant Group said in regulatory filings last year that Ma has "ultimate control" over the company, and his personal wealth was expected to balloon after the public offering. He has also frequently made public appearances to talk about his philanthropic work, which he made a major focus after retiring from Alibaba. His most recent post on Chinese social media platform Weibo, dated Oct. 17, for example, featured remarks he made at an education forum in China. Ma has also been a high profile speaker at major international events such as the World Economic Forum. It was Ma's last major appearance, though, that China tech observers suspect landed his business in hot water. At a conference in Shanghai in late October, Ma publicly criticized Chinese regulators for stifling innovation by being too risk averse."What we need is to build a healthy financial system, not systematic financial risks," he said. "To innovate without risks is to kill innovation. There's no innovation without risks in the world."Days later, Chinese regulators summoned Ma and Ant Group executives to conduct what authorities called "regulatory interviews," and the IPO was pulled. Oanda market analyst Jeffrey Halley wrote at the time that the comments "clearly didn't resonate in the halls of power in Beijing."It's not clear from official or company statements whether Ma has attended any meetings since then regarding the future of his businesses.While Ma has been out of the spotlight, his companies have made clear that they are listening to Beijing. Ant said last week that it appreciated "guidance and help" from regulators after Beijing spoke publicly about its requirements for the company. And Alibaba pledged in late December to "actively cooperate" with antitrust investigators.The potential threats to Ma's businesses aren't limited to China, either. Washington has been ratcheting up its campaign against Chinese businesses in recent weeks as the Trump administration draws to a close. And while Alibaba hasn't been specifically targeted, the company was name-checked by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo late last summer when he urged American companies to remove "untrusted" Chinese-owned technology from their digital networks.Public opinion about Ma in China, meanwhile, has turned sour. Many of the replies to Ma's October Weibo post struck a particularly negative tone. "Again it's about resources and brain mines," wrote one Weibo user, responding to Ma's use of those words to describe children in China and the need for a strong education system. "It is totally a line from a capitalist." --- Laura He and CNN's Beijing bureau contributed to this report.TM & © 2021 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Denison College Republicans host former secretary of state Mike Pompeo amidst criticismThe Denisonian: Denison UniversityMarch 24, 2021 WednesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2021 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 778 wordsByline: Aaron SkubbyBodyAARON SKUBBY, Editor-in-Chief-The Denison College Republicans hosted a Zoom webinar with former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo as part of the 2021 Ohio College Republican Federation Convention. "Pompeo was chosen because he is an extremely high profile conservative with a great deal of expertise in foreign policy and American politics. Additionally, he is a former high ranking government official which was a privilege to have on campus," DCR President Stewart Moore '22 said. Other speakers at the event, which was held at noon on March 20, included Governor Mike DeWine, Senate candidates Josh Mandel and Jane Timken, and author J.D. Vance. However, "the only cost incurred by the school was Mr. Pompeo," Moore specified.The Denison College Republicans did not specify how much was paid to Pompeo. The club was granted $40,599.27 for an annual speaker by the Denison Campus Governance Association.As soon as Pompeo's speech was announced, many Denison students were critical of the event on social media.Farah Farah '22 made an Instagram post that said "It doesn't go beyond me that Denison's 'commitment' to anti-racism coincides with the same semester College Republicans want to host a shameless explicitly fascist Secretary of State, and spending student money to do so. At what point is the hypocrisy going to stop? We should never expect this school to listen to its students of color and expect their neoliberal co-opting of radical academic and activist work to produce substantive change. White supremacy continues uninterrupted, and hosting Pompeo is, without question, an embodiment of this institutional disregard."The event was announced only the day prior to occurring, which Moore says was due to "a number of logistical issues with getting Pompeo planned and approved during our reallocation process for this semester. I had hoped that our organization would have had more time to advertise but that wasn't the reality of the situation."During the presentation, which was a "webinar" style Zoom call, Pompeo talked about his experiences in foreign policy as well as his beliefs on domestic politics, with time to answer questions. Pompeo spoke of his experiences working in North Korea, Israel, and Vietnam, among others. Some students asked questions about cyber security and the growing influence of Russia in Europe.Much of Pompeo's discussion of domestic politics was prompted by a student submitted question, which was read by Moore. "We have a lot of issues on campus with identity politics being weaponized against conservatives. Why is this ideology around purely identity a dangerous thing not only for the United states but really for the world?", the question asked.Pompeo spoke against movements for racial justice such as the 1619 Project and the Black Lives Matter movement. "The 1619 project is all wet, we didn't have this founding based on something that was racist," he said. "We had a founding that was based on traditional Judeo-Christian values."Pompeo also implied that the Chinese government was involved in the Black Lives Matter movement. "We know that there aren't differences between whites and blacks, but when you take an organization that uses that name Black Lives Matter as cover, that is deeply marxist, then the marxists in China are going to dig on that," he said.Pompeo talked too about what he perceives as the challenges facing young conservatives, particularly on college campuses. "I know there's times that it can be difficult. I know who occupies the faculty positions at so many of our campuses across America," he said. Pompeo encouraged young conservatives to be "pipe hitters," and fight for conservative values across America.Farah continued to express his issues with Pompeo being hosted by Denison."I don't put it past the College Republicans to have the inability to empathize or perceive how students on campus may feel to their actions and sponsorships; an organization of majority white men draped in their racial, gender and socioeconomic privilege where they have no incentive to serve or support a greater Denison community," he said."Mind the fact that he served as the CIA director, an organization bent to destroy the Global South or that he served under Trump, an unabashed fascist, Pompeo is on the record describing 'multiculturalism' as the antithesis to the United States," Farah continued."How can you host an 'anti-racism' task force while allowing a demagogue's right hand man to be invited to campus? Denison cannot have it both ways and allowing the track record of Republicans to continue uninterrupted proves how empty the platitudes are to the Denison community," Farah said.Load-Date: March 25, 2021End of Document

Asia Pacific High Speed Connector Market Forecast to 2027 - COVID-19 Impact and Regional Analysis - ResearchAndMarkets.comBusiness WireMarch 15, 2021 Monday 5:00 PM GMTCopyright 2021 Business Wire, Inc.Length: 667 wordsDateline: DUBLIN BodyThe "Asia Pacific High Speed Connector Market Forecast to 2027 - COVID-19 Impact and Regional Analysis By Product and Application" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.According to this report the market is expected to reach US$ 2,128.62 million by 2027 from US$ 1,037.51 million in 2019. The market is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 9.7 % from 2020 to 2027.The report provides trends prevailing in the APAC high speed connector market along with the drivers and restraints pertaining to the market growth. Surging developments in network services such 5G network and features such as high-speed, flexile, tiny, waterproof connector are the major factor driving the growth of the APAC high speed connector market. However, expensive and technical issues hinder the growth of APAC high speed connector market.In case of COVID-19, APAC is highly affected specially the India. China has significantly large number of electronics and semiconductor manufacturing industry with numerous manufacturers operating and supporting several industries across the globe. The Chinese high speed connector market players have observed tremendous impact on respective business during Q1 of 2020, which have reflected stiff decline in revenue generation, which resulted in loss in China as well as APAC high speed connector market. In addition, China accounts for the significantly higher number of national and international manufacturers which demand high speed connector.The lockdown measures and physical distancing norms imposed by the Chinese government during Q1 has reflected huge fall in demand for the high speed connector, which ultimately resulted in decimation in revenue generation in the high speed connector market. Japan and India are the other two countries that have large number of electronics and semiconductor manufacturers as well as end users.

We've got the latest in the fight for free speech online.Plus, making the best out of an embarrassing moment. The lawyer turned cat hoping to make a profit on his now viral moment and it's making a buzz this morning. We're going to tell you all about it.MORNINGS WITH MARIA is live right now.Taking a look at the markets this morning. Your -- U.S. futures are indicated higher by 168 points on the Dow.The European markets are pretty much mixed at this point but hovering around the flat line there. The FTSE is up 10. The CAC is down 2, the DAX index down nine.In Asia overnight the Shanghai closed for the Lunar New Year with all other major markets seeing some green. The Hang Seng leading the pack up nearly 2 percent in the session.And a brutal winter storm is wreaking havoc from the south to the northeast.Cheryl Casone's got more on that.Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: That is right, Jackie.Well, the weather being blamed for the deaths of four people so far across three different states.Let's start in North Carolina where overnight a tornado tore through parts of the state. Rescue teams are now searching for missing people there.Now to Texas, which is seeing the worst winter storm in decades. Nearly four million across the lone star state are without power this morning as they deal with unprecedented cold and ice storms. Overnight in Dallas, people were seen sleeping in their cars as they tried to keep warm. This as they're urging people there to stay home and get off of the roads.And the freezing weather in Texas boosting oil prices this morning. The contract up more than a quarter of a percent right now. Oil wells and refineries are shut down.Well, President Joe Biden heading to Wisconsin today, one of his first official trips since becoming commander in chief. The president expected to make the case for his nearly $2 trillion coronavirus relief plan in a town hall tonight.Parler is back. The social media platform returning to the Internet after more than a month's absence. Its 20 million users can begin posting starting next week. Its return coming after the platform was suspended by Amazon Web Services, Google and Apple following the Capitol Hill riot. Parler says its new platform is based on, quote, robust, sustainable, independent technology.And New York Governor Cuomo Andrew -- excuse me, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo playing the blame game for nursing home coronavirus deaths. In a press conference yesterday, he said that the state didn't cover up the deaths but admits he should have moved faster to release information. He also said the DOJ's state legislature both requested a report at the same time and it literally put a pause, he said, on answering lawmakers.Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is there anything that you personally apologize for it?GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): We did not do a good enough job in providing information. I take total responsibility for that. The void we created furthered the confusion.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Well, an attorney general's report found the nursing home deaths were nearly double than what was reported by the State Department of Health. Cuomo blamed nursing home staff for bringing COVID into the facilities. Senator Jessica Ramos tweeted this, at no point did the administration notify the legislature about a DOJ investigation. People died and Cuomo lied. Then he had the gall to write a book. Lawmakers are now pushing to strip Cuomo of his emergency authority, Jackie.And those are your headlines.DEANGELIS: Wow! Thanks so much for that, Cheryl. Really -- really appreciate it.Meantime, we're watching those winter storms and they are battering the lone star state and also shutting down green energy. Rolling outages across Texas levying millions without power. The state's grid operator saying that it lost roughly 34,000 megawatts of power with natural gas and cold-fired power plants off-line. The plummeting temperature also freezing wind turbines, pushing wholesale power prices to their $9,000 per hour cap.Joining me now, former energy secretary under President Trump, Dan Brouillette.Sir, welcome and good morning to you.DAN BROUILLETTE, FORMER ENERGY SECRETARY UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP: Good morning, Jackie, great to be with you.DEANGELIS: And great to be with you.The previous administration focused on making America energy independent. It was a priority. And, in fact, it was a goal that was achieved. And now we're seeing this administration put the priority and focus on green energy. But what's happening in Texas right now is sort of the perfect storm, right, showing where alternative energy can fall short and why we need more of a balance and we need to still rely on regular energy as we've seen in it the past decades.BROUILLETTE: That's exactly right, Jackie.What we're seeing today is an avoidable tragedy. In the previous administration, under the leadership of President Trump, what he directed me to do, what he directed by predecessor to do, Secretary Rick Perry, was to produce all forms of energy here in America. So it's not only that we produced more energy in America, we produced different forms of energy. That included fossil energy. It included things like natural gas and oil here in America. We're now the largest producer of those products in the world.The important thing about what we're seeing in Texas today is that we need diverse energy supply. So, as you mentioned earlier, the weather is certainly behind some of this, but the weather is not the cause of the tragedy, it's the policies that we've decided to follow. And what I mean by that is we've moved away from what is known as base load electricity and we've moved to intermittent and sometimes unreliable renewable energy. And that technology is not yet ready for prime time.DEANGELIS: And when it comes to looking at energy industry from a global lens, so many people like to say that America contributed to pollution through fossil fuels. But, you know, from where I'm sitting, I can look at other countries, like China and India, for example, who are not following the rules to reducing emissions. We actually came out of the Paris agreement and we were still doing it. There is a case to be made here for pursuing traditional energy to alternative energy and still being able to reduce your carbon footprint and do the right thing.BROUILLETTE: That's exactly right, Jackie.What we've seen here in America is a reduction in carbon emissions at the same time that we have grown the world's largest economy. We've had the largest reduction in carbon emissions of any country in the world, certain as signatory to the Paris Accords. And the way we've done that is to develop technologies that allow us to produce things like natural gas here in America very, very cheaply. And natural gas is much less carbon intense than some of the other fuel sources that are being used in places like China.And as we see the world transitions, we would hope that they would transition to the use of, in some cases, American LNG, American natural gas, and that will again lessen the carbon intensity all around the world.DEANGELIS: And let's talk about gas prices. The national average for a gallon of regular is increasing here. It's over $2.50. So when I look at oil prices rising and I look at the price that consumers are going to pay at the pump, $2.52 right now in the winter when people really are not out on the road in earnest and its risen so much it's higher than it was at this time last year when the economy was fully functioning, and I say to myself, it could be close to $3 in the summer when the driving season peaks and that is a tax on consumers.BROUILLETTE: It really is. And the reason we're seeing that today is because some of the refineries are shut down and we can't move the product form the oil wells to the actual consumer because of a lack of infrastructure in some cases, or, in some cases, we've made the gas line -- the gas pipeline infrastructure dependent upon this renewable energy and, as a result, we can't move the gas to the consumers and we can't move the oil to the consumers, which is creating a lack of supply and driving up the prices.In America we have to be careful. We may have it exactly backwards. Renewable energy today is dependent upon base-load electricity, which is provided by natural gas, coal and nuclear. And if we're not careful and we make that base-load electricity dependent upon renewable power, we're not going to move the product to market and price are going to spike.DEANGELIS: I want to talk to you about the Dakota Access Pipeline, the future right now at stake.Energy advocates worry that the Biden administration may pull the plug on this project after revoking contracts for the Keystone XL pipeline. This is a project that's up for review on April 9th. It should -- you know, should the feds shut it down, it would force North Dakota to find a new, more expensive way to transport roughly 570,000 barrels of oil per day.Dan, when I look at this and I see pipelines shutting down or projections not moving forward, I covered energy for a long time, you need the infrastructure to move oil around. We can be the world's top producer of energy, we were, but you need to be able to distribute that oil to make it worthwhile and to make it valuable. And so shutting pipelines down is essentially shutting the industry down.BROUILLETTE: That's exactly right, Jackie. It's not only shutting the infrastructure down like what we're seeing the Biden administration do today, potentially with the Dakota Access Pipeline, it's shutting down the production, for instance, on federal lands all across the country.What has made us the world's largest producer of natural gas and oil is, one, technology development, innovation not regulation, and also our ability to produce on these lands. So when I look across these policies, I wonder what's going to happen in places like North Dakota, importantly places like New Mexico, where one-third -- one-third of their budget is dependent upon the production of oil and gas and the revenues that come from it. So we have -- we have some serious challenges here in the southwest part of the United States that's going to be interesting to watch over the course of the next few weeks and months.DEANGELIS: And what about, as our production comes down, national security? I mean that was something that former President Trump really focused on as well. If we could be energy independent, then we wouldn't have to rely on our foes for oil. And as you see us sailing back production, not only because of the pandemic but also because energy companies are scared of the policies that are to come right now, we're going to see more reliance on foreign nations, Middle Eastern producers. We had walked back from that. We had OPEC answering to us.BROUILLETTE: That's exactly right. So, you know, what happened over the course of the last few years is because we've been able to become energy independent, foreign policy options were available to President Trump and any further president who chooses to continue a true all of the above energy policies.What we saw happen, for instance, the movement of the embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem could not have happened a decade ago because we were completely dependent upon the provision of oil from the Middle East. So the ability and the freedom to make those types of foreign policy decisions are a direct results of our national -- our energy security and ultimately our national security and our energy independence.DEANGELIS: Dan Brouillette, great to see you this morning. Great conversation. Thank you.BROUILLETTE: Good to see you, Jackie. Great to be with you.DEANGELIS: Much more still ahead coming up on this show.Shopping short of an apology. We are following New York Governor Cuomo's denial of a cover-up in the nursing home scandal.And, alive and online. Social media site Parler reemerges for the first time since being vaulted offline. What's back and what's to be expected.Plus, luxury goes electric. What to expect when Jaguar goes gas free.And a programming note. "Kudlow" premiums today at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time. Larry Kudlow will be speaking with former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in his first interview since leaving the White House.Also joining the conversation all morning long, Brian Brenberg and Shana Sissel.You are watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.DEANGELIS: Parler is back online. It was booting from Amazon Web Services and Apple and Google's app stores last month. The social media platform was accused of helping incite the Capitol Hill rights. All 20 million existing users are supposed to have their accounts back starting next week.Joining me now is "The Federalist" publisher and Fox News contributor Ben Domenech.Great to see you this morning, Ben.BEN DOMENECH, PUBLISHER, "THE FEDERALIST": Good to be with you.DEANGELIS: Let's talk about Parler's comeback. Do you expect it to be the same Parler or it's going to look a little different?DOMENECH: I think it will look a little different because I think they're going to be changing a lot of things in the coming weeks. I've been talking to a couple of folks who had a little bit of knowledge of what their intentions are and I think that, you know, first step is just getting back online. And, obviously, this was a situation where I think a lot of people were surprised by how quickly everyone deplatformed them at once. It's not necessarily indicative of collusion together. But, certainly, you saw all of these big tech companies that people rely on in order to have their apps go forward moving together.And that raises a lot of different issues that I think are going to come up in the coming months because there is, obviously, a bipartisan motivation toward doing something as it relates to big tech. It's one of the few areas of agreement on Capitol Hill. And whether that action comes in the form of additional regulation, just more screaming at hearings, or potentially antitrust steps, that remains to be seen.DEANGELIS: Yes, it's been interesting to see Parler because it was, you know, essentially rejected by the two biggest players in the industry, Google and Amazon, and really butting heads with them in a way and taking the industry on. I feel like they're sort of acting like a trail-blazing company here to try to work through and around this infrastructure that has become just so widespread.DOMENECH: Yes, the word there that you said that's so important is infrastructure. People have been talking about big tech and questions regarding bias and the like in the form mostly of social media. Are individuals or small groups of people allowed to use these different platforms to organize or to express themselves? That's an interesting debate. It has to do with free speech and the like.But a much bigger question is, what happens when they pull the infrastructure out from underneath you? What happens when you can't keep the power on or the equivalent of being able to use the highways to transport your product? And that's basically what happened to Parler and it raises a lot of serious questions about what you can even do in terms of building up alternatives, competitors to these big, dominant tech organizations.PROFESSOR BRIAN BRENBERG, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Hey, Ben, Brian Brenberg here.On that point, I think that's the really interesting question, you know, and I -- I've talked with you about this before, can you build an alternative or not. And I know you've got some skepticism around that. You see Parler coming back here. Is this an indication that the possibility of circumventing the system is actually bigger than maybe people thought or do you think there's really too many question marks to say that completely building an alternative -- and I know it's a big infrastructure question, I mean huge, and it's not just the servers, it goes all the way down the line. What's your thought? Are you gaining optimism here that an alternative is possible?DOMENECH: No. I think it's a little -- I think it's way too early to say. And one of the things that we have to keep in mind here is that we're not just talking about, you know, Parler specifically, but the ability of people to compete within this environment is certainly one that incentivizes big players to either, you know, snap up small, potential competitors or to essentially crush them, to, you know, use the power and the connections that they have to make sure that they aren't in a position to compete.I think one of the things that's going to be a critical part of this going forward, not just within the tech community but for Americans across the country is that they have confidence that they're going to be able to use the system they traditionally have been. You already saw the Biden administration, for instance, rolling back protections that would have made sure that people didn't have or experience bias in their banking services, dependent on the products that they have. I think you're going to see more and more corporations being incentivized to distance themes from anyone who they find potentially problematic, either for their political views or for the nature of their product going forward.DEANGELIS: Ben, great to see you this morning. Thank you.DOMENECH: Good to be with you.DEANGELIS: We'll talk to you again soon.Coming up, luxury goes electric. Jaguar is the latest automaker promising to go all-electric. We're going to tell you when.Plus, cashing in on a cat-astrophe. How one lawyer's Zoom mishap could lead to a big payday. That's making a buzz this morning and we're going to tell you all about it.DEANGELIS: The China threat making its way to the Olympics. Congressman Michael Waltz introducing a House resolution calling on the United States to boycott the 2022 winter Olympics in Beijing. The resolution pointing to various human rights violations, as well as censorship and cover-ups from the Chinese Communist Party. President Joe Biden is expected to give his first officials position on the U.S. participation in the Olympics coming up today.Brian, what do you think the president's going to do here? My feeling is he's probably going to stand back and say he doesn't want to get in the fray.BRENBERG: Yes, I think he's going to punt on this and push it to the Olympic Committee. I think that's a problem, though. You know there's a sense that you can separate sports and politics. And maybe at some level that's true, although lately I'd say it's not. But particularly with the Olympics, any city, any place that hosts the Olympic games takes advantage of it from a propaganda standpoint.DEANGELIS: Oh, sure.BRENBERG: Call it whatever you want. And there's no way to avoid that in China. And you've just -- you've got serious issues. You've got genocide -- Uighur genocide. You've got repression in Hong Kong. I mean this is a moment I think for not just the United States but for liberal democracies around the world to stand up and say, we're not going to mix these things. We're not going to mix our athletes in Beijing and in any way put a stamp of approval or legitimacy on what's going on here.DEANGELIS: Yes, and, Shana, we were saying earlier that it is a privilege to have that platform, number one. And also there's huge economic gain from it. It really spurs the economy for a given country and that China doesn't necessarily deserve that privilege given some of these violations we're talking about.SHANA SISSEL, CIO, SPOTLIGHT ASSET GROUP: Well, I don't want to be the judge of privilege and what they deserve, but I do think it's a missed opportunity by the president to use this as leverage to get other things done. You know, when I think about China, for me, as an investors, I focus on trade, negotiations and the like. And because the Olympics is such a visible event, such a big event, and the United States is such a major player in terms of sending athletes, competitive athletes in medal -- medaling in the Olympics, I think you're missing an opportunity here to use this to leverage, to gain potential headway in other areas in negotiations with China and improving conditions in China for the people that live there. Not just with the U.S., but with the rest of the world being able to use this as leverage to get other things done and to me it's a huge missed opportunity.DEANGELIS: What do you think, Brian, bargaining chip?BRENBERG: Well, look, it just -- it's about clarity. You know, we're -- we might be talking about negotiation, we might be talking about economics here, but I think it's bigger than that. I mean this is the fundamental human rights question of our day. And the question is, will liberal democracy, will societies that champion freedom stand up say this is bigger than sports, this is bigger than the marketing, this is bigger than what western corporate companies want to do in this situation? No, it's about human rights and we're going to take a stand and we're going to do it now.And I think that does help ultimately get the world onboard with pushing back against China, but it requires clarity and it requires clarity from the president of the United States. We'll see if we get it.DEANGELIS: Well, coming up, guys, no apologies from Andrew Cuomo. New Yorkers have even more questions for the governor over the deadly nursing home scandal. Former New York Governor George Pataki weighs in next.Plus, bring COVID-19 testing to you? How one company is making it easier to stay safe at work. That's ahead, too.Stay with us.DEANGELIS: Well, welcome back, everybody. I'm Jackie DeAngelis, in for Maria Bartiromo today. It is Tuesday, February 16th. A look at the markets this half hour.Futures pointing to a higher open on Wall Street after being closed for the Presidents' Day holiday yesterday. And, wow, take a look at Bitcoin. Earlier this morning, the cryptocurrency breaking above the $50,000 level for the first time ever.European markets pretty much flat at this hour. You can see the FTSE's up 14, the CAC and the DAX slightly lower. In Asia overnight the Shanghai closed for the Lunar New Year with all other major markets seeing some green. The Hang Seng leading the pack up nearly 2 percent.And Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine reducing symptomatic coronavirus infections by more than 90 percent in the real world.Cheryl Casone has the details on that.Cheryl.CASONE: That is right, Jackie.The latest data coming from Israel's largest health care provider, who compared 600,000 people who got the shots with a group of the same size who did not. They found the rate of symptomatic COVID-19, meaning people who were infected with the virus and felt sick decreased by 94 percent among those who received two doses of the vaccine. The rate of serious illness decreased by 92 percent. The findings are consistent with Pfizer's own trial.Let's take a look at Pfizer in the pre-market. The stock is up half a percent.Clubhouse is in the doghouse. The popular audio chat platform is reviewing its security policies after it was revealed it left user data open to access by the Chinese government. According to a new report, a Shanghai- based company provided back end support for the app, leaving user data unencrypted. The company denies it stores data from users outside of China.Well, Jaguar planning to go fully electric by 2025. This as parent company Jaguar Land Rover pushes into the global market for emission-free vehicles with its first electric car expected in 2024. This change is going to cost the automaker, though, owned by India's Tata Motors, $3.5 billion a year on electrification and other technologies. Electric vehicles expected to make up a hundred percent of the brand sales by 2030.There is Tata. It's actually doing better in the premarket than it was earlier. It's fractionally lower right now.And those are your headlines from here, Jackie, back over to you.DEANGELIS: Everyone's going electricity. That's the name of the game.Cheryl, thank you so much.Holding Governor Cuomo accountable. Cuomo addressing the public yesterday for the first time since an aide told lawmakers that his administration withheld data to keep it from the former President Trump's Department of Justice. Cuomo stopping short of an apology and blaming nursing home staff for the deadly spread.Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): Staff walking into the nursing home were asymptomatic because the national experts all told us you could only spread COVID if you had symptoms.That's how COVID got into the nursing homes.(END VIDEO CLIP)DEANGELIS: Actually, Brian, I don't ever remember them saying if you were asymptomatic you couldn't spread it. That actually was the problem.BRENBERG: Yes.DEANGELIS: They said you could be asymptomatic and not know and do spread it and yet he's sitting there and he's saying, it was a visitors coming into the nursing home and the staff members that did this. I mean there's a lot of finger-pointing here instead of getting to the core of it, which is, people died, say sorry.BRENBERG: Yes. And, you know, he's sort of acting like a victim here. Like, I provided just the right leadership, but you moved into the space and you brought your conspiracy theories, you brought your misinformation. That's not what people are looking for.All they want is a person who claims the mantle of leadership. And, by the way, took a lot of authority away from New Yorkers in order to run this thing. All they're looking for is some honesty, some truth. Stand up, admit your mistakes and let's move forward. But he -- we're not getting that. He's digging him into a deeper hole here and it's attracting not just the ire of his traditional opponents on the right, Republicans, but Democrats are saying we can't stand for this. We live here too. We've dealt with what you've done. You've got to make this right, and he's not.DEANGELIS: And, Shana, you know, interesting here in New York, we had facilities where patients -- elderly patients that had coronavirus could have found treatment. We had the Javits Center, which we outfitted and turned into this huge facility to add hospital beds to the system. We also had the USS Comfort. And neither of those facilities was even close to really being at capacity or even really being used to that extent. So he doesn't have so much of a reason to say why he put these patient back into the nursing homes when we knew that elderly patients were vulnerable.SISSEL: No, he doesn't. And, again, as Brian had already pointed out when we talked about it earlier, you know, taking accountability and admitting that there was an error is the key to success in being able to overcome this. The more he digs a hole, the worse it gets for him. And by putting out information that's just patently wrong, saying that we didn't know asymptomatic people could spread the disease, as far as I know, that was why they shut down schools, remember, because kids were less likely to have symptoms.DEANGELIS: Right. We did know.SISSEL: And so we had to shut down the schools because kids were asymptomatic and could give to it the teachers. So it doesn't make any sense to me. It's just a bad look completely from the leadership there.DEANGELIS: And, Brian, a lot of people were saying that he was setting himself up here with his press conferences and how he handled things with, you know, irrespective of this to possibly make a presidential run at some point. Do you think something like this takes the wind out of those sails for them?BRENBERG: I hope so. I mean rule number one is, don't declare victory before you know you have victory. And he stepped in that whole at least twice.You know, there's talk about whether his executive powers or emergency powers should be rescind. I think the answer is absolutely. Missing -- you know, missing it on this, missing it on the nursing home issue and then making the problem worse I think is grounds for New Yorkers to say, you need to give that power back. This is not working. We want to live our lives and you're not even telling us the truth on some of the biggest issues that affected the states and affected people's families and lives. That's not grounds for the kind of power you're wielding right now.DEANGELIS: Well, some people are saying, forget the emergency authorities for a second. The governor needs to be held accountable for this, that there was negligence involved in this and they want to see it turn, you know, into a criminal kind of investigation, Shana.SISSEL: Yes, but unless you're here in Illinois, where the politicians like to eat their own, I don't see that actually happening necessarily in New York.You know, I find that that politicians, regardless of which side of the aisle that they're on, manage to skirt by these types of things without getting too much damage. So I'm skeptical that anything will happen there because unlike my home state, politicians are not likely to go after their own.DEANGELIS: And that's why I brought up the issue about him potentially running for president because, you know, you say to yourself, we've seen politicians in the past get through things we never thought they would and somehow the American public does forget with time. So it will be something to watch.But also turning to another governor that's facing some calls to resign. Organizers of a recall campaign for California's Gavin Newsom, saying that they have the 1.5 million signatures needed by mid-March for a special statewide election challenging Newsom's and leaders of the effort calling out the governor's response to the pandemic and also calling out his -- outing to a very high end restaurant amid statewide lockdowns a breaking point.And I remember seeing that video, Brian, and thinking it was really, really egregious that the governor is out while locked -- people are locked down at home.BRENBERG: Yes.DEANGELIS: He's out dining at a very expensive restaurant without a mask on.BRENBERG: Yes, I mean, and not only is he out dining at an expensive restaurant without a mask, but he's asking the rest of his state to deal with policies that are not science based. I mean how heartbreaking was it to watch those restaurant owners right next -- you know, not being able to serve food right next to a film shoot.DEANGELIS: Oh, yes.BRENBERG: Or talking about children in, you know, L.A. schools or other school districts, San Francisco, can't go to school, dealing with the consequences of that. And we have politicians in California, and in New York, acting like their plea for the science to be fold doesn't apply to them. This recall effort, I think, is great news. People are standing up for their rights.DEANGELIS: OK. Well, I want to do more on this conversation with Governor George Pataki joins us now, former governor of New York.You know, we've been having this conversation, Governor, welcome, and thank you for your time, about Governor Cuomo, how he's handled this. Some folks are saying it's time for him to just say sorry, that it's that simple.GEORGE PATAKI, FORMER NEW YORK GOVERNOR (R): I think it's not quite that simple but he certainly should apologize. You know, in a phone call earlier this week, his chief of staff apologize to Democratic politicians for inconveniencing them by covering up the number of nursing home deaths. They acknowledge the cover-up but they've never apologized to the people who lost their loved ones or to the people of New York who wanted to find out what was going on.So certainly an apology is in order and an investigation is in order to find out exactly what happened and how they engaged in this, I believe, illegal cover-up.DEANGELIS: Yes, and there's two pieces to this. You know, first he came out saying who cares how people died, a death is a death as long as it's counted. That seemed very callous. And also he's talking in that sound bite that we played earlier about the fact that it was staff who could have potentially brought the virus into the nursing homes, it was potentially the visitors that were coming in. And then he also was saying that if you were asymptomatic, you didn't know that you could spread the virus, which actually isn't true. I remember feeling educated on that early on in the virus knowing that asymptomatic people could spread the virus. So he's doing a lot of sort of side stepping here instead of addressing the issue.PATAKI: It's another day, another excuse. So now it's the, it's the -- the people who visited the nursing homes or the staff who worked in the nursing homes, it's not the 9,000 people with COVID who were released from hospitals into the nursing homes when the nursing homes were desperately saying, we're not prepared. We can't deal with this. Don't do this to us. So -- but, no, it's not those 9,000 hospital patients who actually had COVID. The governor somehow knows it's one of the employees who went into a nursing home. It's just another day, another excuse. This calls out for a bipartisan investigation. An investigation with subpoena power to get to the bottom of exactly what happened here.The excuses don't wash (ph). We need the truth.DEANGELIS: We certainly do need the truth.Governor Pataki, great to see you this morning. Thank you so much.PATAKI: Thank you very much.DEANGELIS: And a "Fox Business Alert." Marriott International announcing the unexpected death of its president and CEO, Arne Sorenson. He had been battling pancreatic cancer since 2019. The company says it will appoint a new CEO in the next two weeks.We'll be right back.DEANGELIS: Expanding access to COVID-19 testing. Worksite Labs aiming to make testing more wildly available around the country. A company is taking unused shipping containers and turning them into mobile labs where people can get tested and get accurate results back in the same day. Worksite Labs are available in 10 cities so far.Joining me now, Worksite Labs CEO Gary Frazier.Gary, good morning. This is a very exciting initiative, especially at a time where more testing is important and we're talking about a vaccine rollout right now and facilities have been difficult to come by. So tell me how you came up with this idea to use these containers in this way.GARY FRAZIER, CEO, WORKSITE LABS: Hi, Jackie. First of all, thanks for having me.DEANGELIS: Sure.FRAZIER: Yes, you know, the industry as it stands or before COVID really had a dilemma where we could do testing but the quality of the test was a trade-off between timing and quality. And so the way we came up with it was basically that if we want high quality, 99 percent specificity tests, which are the PCR tests, but at the same time without having people wait for days, is that we have to bring the labs to the site, thus the name Worksite Labs. And so by bringing the lab and popping them up in, you know, 30 days' time wherever they're needed, we're able to actually process high quality tests right there, near site or on-site, and to be able to get the businesses and/or the customers and/or the people what they need in hours versus days.DEANGELIS: It's remarkable and it's mobile.Brian.BRENBERG: Yes, Gary, I mean the testing and the long lines, it's just been the bane of so many people's existence over the past several months. It sounds like you're trying to solve that problem, but you're still working within the health care space, you're still working with all the government regulations. How much are you able to innovate and how much are you constrained by the government bureaucracy that we know is just sort of enmeshing everything going on with our response to COVID?FRAZIER: Well, oddly enough, most of our clientele are commercial clients. Our largest most popular client is Hawaiian Airlines, for people to actually travel to and from Hawaii and still meet the state's mandate. And so if you're focused on that particular clientele, then you're really not going through a lot of government red tape, to be honest. The ability to actually have a federally qualified (INAUDIBLE) laboratory is a straight forward process. Once you have all of your ducks in a row and you follow the protocols and you have qualified clinicians working in the lab, from there it -- there on it's pretty much logistics and business. So I will -- I would be able to say that we haven't really run into a lot of government red tape because, quite frankly, we're doing it more on a -- I'll say a free market system.DEANGELIS: Shana.SISSEL: Yes. So, I'm kind of curious, you know, in some of the big cities, like here in Chicago, our biggest problems happen to be in some of the lower income communities. How is what you're doing making a difference there and how does that help speed up the process of testing and vaccination to get us back to normal, if you will?FRAZIER: Yes. So what we're doing on two fronts is that we're, on the one hand, helping economies to get going again, a la Hawaiian and Hawaiian Airlines and Hawaii. On the other hand, we're working in communities like, for L.A. County, we work for the sheriff's department where we have put up a lab actually inside of the jail because you have populations of people that are being, let's just say, detained, and the safety of the officers, the safety of the people that are already detained, the safety of the new people being detained really rests on the ability to get those results fast and get those results the same day for that vulnerable population.Being able to use our existing footprint, which right now is across those 10 cities all up and down the West Coast, and now moving into Texas pretty soon, being able to use that same footprint to then offer those same services to the community is what we aim to do in the near future.DEANGELIS: Gary, really quickly, as we move past this pandemic at some point and we think about the future and we think about other viruses that we may be fighting or taking better precautions against them, for example, would this be a business model that's sustainable for you in the health care industry to work on and conquer others things and provide safety in these ways around the country?FRAZIER: Yes, I think the scalability of our model, being portable, modular, mobile, is one key to our entrance into the space. The existing infrastructure, let's just call it, they're pretty much consolidated and focused on efficiency. Where we come in is we're focused on service. And we're focused on speed and quality. And so I think the scalability to be able to put up a lab and put up services wherever they're needed, whether it's rural America, whether it's inner city where there is deserts of services, like your -- you just mentioned earlier, or whether it's in businesses that just want to reopen and get their workers there safely, the ability to do this is something that's unseen in the industry. Right now you got to do a sample --DEANGELIS: It is. It's transformative. It is transformative.FRAZIER: Yes.DEANGELIS: Gary Frazier, great to see you this morning. Thank you. And we'll talk to you again soon.FRAZIER: Thank you.DEANGELIS: Coming up, cashing in on a catastrophe. How one lawyer's Zoom mishap could lead to a big day. That's making a buzz this morning. We're going to tell you all about it.DEANGELIS: It's time for the "Morning Buzz."Scratching for cash. Last week we showed you a Texas lawyer who went viral after appearing as a cat on a Zoom court hearing. That was by accident. Now he wants to cash in on this moment. Ron Ponton is planning to sell merchandise and even give talks on online professionalism to help others avoid the same predicament.Brian, I thought it was actually hysterical. I didn't know you could turn something like this into a business.BRENBERG: I -- just -- it made my week to see that because it captured so much of, you know, what happens in life when you're on these Zoom calls and your kids change your name in the middle -- you know, and you get on and your name says something completely different. You know, Hello Kitty or something on you're on a big call. I loved that that happened.I don't think he's going to make any money on it, but I could see him coming back for a throwback commercial some day, you know, five years from now when we want to remember that moment. Maybe that's his opportunity.DEANGELIS: I mean he definitely is being a good sport about it, although the cat, you know, filter doesn't -- that, to me, isn't as embarrassing as some of the other things that we've heard about happening on Zoom, where people have been more embarrassed, Shana.But, you know, when you're holding these conference calls in your living room, you have to be careful.SISSEL: Oh, I know all about that. I always worry about when my son was doing remote learning, I was always afraid he was going to jump in a shot. And I -- it was -- I was super paranoid about it. But I applaud the guy. I think it's great. And I am all for using these opportunities when you can because they don't come along very often and any opportunity you have to monetize something like this, more power to him.DEANGELIS: Yes, we'll be watching for more of these mishaps as more people stay home and will continue to work from home. It seems to be this big trend that is here to stay.More MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business coming up after this.DEANGELIS: We're about 30 minutes away from the opening bell on Wall Street. Your "Morning Mover," Palantir. The stock sinking pre-market on earnings. The company missing on earnings per share, but did beat revenue expectations. Revenue guidance also a concern for investors. Sales are expected to slow from last year. You can see it's down about 6.5 percent.And, of course, Brian Brenberg and Shana Sissel, great to have you with us this morning.Real quick, Brian, with your expectation on what we're going to see today?BRENBERG: I am watching California and New York. People are demanding accountability from their governors. A good sign. Let's see what happens.DEANGELIS: All right.And we're watching the futures there. Dow indicated higher by 126 points, the Nasdaq by 46 and the S&P 500 by 12 points.Once again, thanks to my all-star panel, Brian Brenberg and Shana Sissel.That's going to do it for us on MORNINGS WITH MARIA."VARNEY AND COMPANY" is up next.Stu, I'm going to put it in your capable hands.Load-Date: February 16, 2021End of Document

China's new advance on Hong Kong: dozens of opposition figures, mostly for "subversion" arrestedCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 6, 2021 WednesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 483 wordsBodyThe Beijing regime arrested dozens of Hong Kong opposition figures on Wednesday (local time), in what is the highest-caliber action against the pro-democracy camp since the adoption of the controversial security law, which effectively undermines the autonomy of the former British colony.Opposition members and political parties reported on social media that at least 21 arrests have taken place, most of them for "subversion." Meanwhile, a police source told the AFP agency that the figure is higher: "About 50."Many of the opponents, including several former deputies, were arrested for their participation in the Democratic side's primaries last July in view of the September legislative elections, which were eventually postponed by the authorities under the pretext of the coronavirus pandemic.This is the largest detention since the controversial National Security Act came into force on 30 June, which sentences even with life imprisonment cases of secession or collusion with foreign forces.The Democratic Party assured through its profile on the Social Network Twitter that the Police considered the Democratic campaign to try to seize a majority in the Hong Kong parliament "an act of subversion that violates the National Security Act."Among those arrested are former deputies Leung Kwok-Hung, Gary Fan, Lam Cheuk-ting, Chu Hoi-dick, Au Nok-hin, Alvin Yeung, Wu Chi-wai, James To and Andrew Wan.The organizer of the primaries, Benny Tai, was also one of those arrested, as well as Robert Chung, executive director of the Hong Kong Institute for Public Opinion Research (PORI), a company that provided the technology needed to conduct the votes.PORI number two Chung Kim-wash today noted on Commercial Radio that police contacted him today to assist with investigations.For her part, Chinese researcher at human Rights Watch human rights organization Maya Wang said today that "the Chinese government has decided to celebrate 2021 with the arrests of more than 50 prominent pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong, thus erasing the remains of democratic appearance left in the city.""Once again, Beijing does not learn from its mistakes in Hong Kong: repression generates resistance, and millions of Hong Kongers will continue their struggle for their right to vote and run as candidates for a democratically elected government," he said.Since the entry into force of the controversial security law - designed and imposed by Beijing - there have been numerous police raids and arrests of activists, with some of them choosing to go into exile to try to avoid retaliation for activities that, under the new legislation, could constitute a crime.(With AFP and EFE information)MORE ON THESE TOPICS:Which countries sent their ambassadors and supported the installation of the Maduro National AssemblyU.S. raised $7 million in illicit Iranian assets: they will be earmarked for victims of terrorismLoad-Date: January 7, 2021End of Document

ZK International Forms xSigma Entertainment with the Intention of Acquiring Online Gaming AssetsPR NewswireMarch 24, 2021 Wednesday 8:30 AM ESTCopyright 2021 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1291 wordsDateline: WENZHOU, China, March 24, 2021 BodyPR NewswireZK International Group Co., Ltd. (Nasdaq: ZKIN) ("ZKIN", "ZK International" or the "Company"), is pleased to announce that the Company has formed a new wholly-owned subsidiary, xSigma Entertainment Limited, with the intent of acquiring online gaming assets.The formation of, xSigma Entertainment was created to acquire assets that will increase shareholder value by targeting businesses that are in growth industries, that have the ability to grow in scale, and that will allow the Company and its shareholders to realize additional growth alongside its existing core business.Currently, the Company has engaged in several discussions and negotiations regarding an investment in an online gaming company. The Company is evaluating several assets with the focus on Management, Approved Licenses, IP, and Branding. In addition, the Company is keen to enter the online gaming industry in the US and thus its focus on an investment will be weighted to companies that have access to the US gaming market, which is poised to grow as legalization occurs state by state.The current legislation framework for online betting in the United States allows only bookmakers licensed in Nevada, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and New Jersey to operate legally, as these are the four states where online betting is regulated. However, six states had online gaming legislation on the 2020 election ballot in November, and all six voted in favor. To top it off, President Joe Biden has gone on record indicating that his administration "doesn't support adding unnecessary restrictions to the gaming industry", which is a positive sign for gaming companies.According to Gambling Compliance, an independent research firm, "the U.S. betting market will range between $5.9 billion and $8.2 billion by 2024. Morgan Stanley believes the U.S. sports betting market could hit $10 billion annually by 2025; globally, it sees sports betting topping $100 billion. BofA Securities sees the U.S. market hitting $24 billion by 2030." 1Jiancong Huang, Chairman of the Company, stated, "as we evaluate exciting opportunities being presented to the Company, one cannot hold back the excitement that the Company is about to enter one of the fastest growing sectors in the market, which is motivating us to add value to our core business and our shareholders."1https://www.kiplinger.com/investing/stocks/stocks-to-buy/601471/best-sports-betting-stocks-to-wager-onAbout ZK International Group Co., Ltd.ZK International Group Co., Ltd. is a China-based designer, engineer, manufacturer and supplier of patented high-performance stainless steel and carbon steel pipe products that require sophisticated water or gas pipeline systems.

Investment Bridge Announces Investment Opinion: Bridge Report on Ferrotec Holdings Corporation: The Results for the Second Quarter of the Fiscal Year March 2021 and Earnings Estimates for the Fiscal Year March 2021; NOTE TO EDITORS: The following is an investment opinion issued by Investment BridgeBusiness WireMarch 16, 2021 Tuesday 1:00 PM GMTCopyright 2021 Business Wire, Inc.Length: 667 wordsDateline: TOKYO BodyInvestment Bridge, one of Japan's leading independent investor relations services companies, has released a "Bridge Report" on Ferrotec Holdings Corporation (JASDAQ: 6890) reviewing its earnings results for the second quarter of the fiscal year March 2021 and earnings estimates for the fiscal year March 2021Report Highlights*In the first half of the term ending March 2021, sales fell 0.6% year on year while operating income grew 9.7% year on year. While sales declined 25.8% year on year for the other business segment, particularly the photovoltaic business which is in a process of withdrawal, the sales of the semiconductor and other equipment-related business grew 5.9% year on year, thanks to the growth of material products used in semiconductor manufacturing processes such as jigs and consumable materials, and the growth of the cleaning business. Sales of the electronic device business for which thermo-electric modules are the mainstay, too, increased 1.8% year on year, as the growth of sales of 5G-related devices offset the decrease of sales of devices for automotive temperature control seats. On the profit front, gross profit increased, due partly to a decrease in photovoltaic cell-related sales, and SG&A costs decreased, thanks to cost cuts and the yen appreciation.*The company's full-year forecasts are unchanged, calling for sales and operating income to increase 4.1% and 8.1% year on year, respectively. Although earnings in the first half of the term exceeded the company's estimates, its full-year forecasts are unchanged, due partly to the uncertain outlook amid the U.S.-China trade friction and the fact that the company is currently investigating the impact from subsidiary restructuring. There is no concern in any of its businesses. In the semiconductor and other equipment-related business, semiconductor materials and the cleaning business are expected to perform well in the second half, too. In the electronic device business, sales of devices for communication equipment are expected to remain at high levels, and the devices for automotive temperature control seats are showing signs of recovery. The term end dividend is planned to be 12 yen/share, and with the first half dividend of 12 yen/share, the annual dividend will be 24 yen/share.*Ferrotec Holdings plans to push forward with its capital policy geared toward organizational restructuring and the improvement of its financial standing. Capital investments will be implemented with prioritization from the term ending March 2022 onward. It has already begun reorganization and preparations for listing of its Chinese subsidiary, and has started up a new business that has received funds from Chinese government-affiliated funds and private investment funds. The company has expanded its business with the growth of the semiconductor market and China's policies to promote domestic production of high-tech products working as a tailwind. Meanwhile, the bloating of its balance sheet sparked concern over financial risk. Going forward, the company will aim for further growth and the enhancement of corporate value while securing a balance between business opportunities and finance.To view the full report, please go to the website at the URL listed below.https://www.bridge-salon.jp/report_bridge/archives/eng/6890/20210127.htmlAbout Bridge Report:Bridge Report is produced by Investment Bridge Co., Ltd. and provides accurate and objective information about the earnings, business strategies, and other information of publicly traded Japanese companies.

Your top stories right now 6 am on the East Coast, low interest rates sticking around Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell saying that the Fed will continue to support the economic recovery.Also easing inflation fears, saying we are years away from hitting the 2 percent target on inflation. The Chairman's comments releasing the bulls yesterday take a look at markets this morning as we see markets extending a rally DOW Industrials this morning up 65 the NASDAQ still weak it is down 37 right now but the S&P 500 also positive at up one point.We begin today's trading session with the Dow at a record high. We also will get look at the strength of the U.S. economy later this morning. When we will get initial jobless claims and the second estimate on fourth quarter GDP that will be released in 2.5 hours. We'll get those numbers as soon as they hit the tape and show you the impact on markets.Yesterday Powell's comments boosted optimism helping sparked a broad based rally. The DOW Industrials closing at an all time high up 424 points putting the index this morning in uncharted territory NASDAQ yesterday up 132 and the S&P 500 higher by 44.The stimulus battle continues will $15 minimum wage be included in the massive $1.9 trillion package? We could have an answer as early as today as House Democrats slipped past that bill. The very latest on this high stakes tug of war coming up.COVID hopes and COVID fears Johnson & Johnson's one shot vaccine coming closer to approval as Moderna starts testing a booster shot to combat variants, all this as concerns grow over a new variant spreading in New York right now.Investigating Congressman Eric Swalwell's ties to alleged Chinese spy House Republicans requesting an FBI briefing we have the very latest this morning. Then this tattoo fail find out what happened to this person shortly after getting inked. It is making a buzz this morning. "Mornings with Maria" is live right now.All right, let's check global markets this morning first European Indices in the green the FT 100 up 32 the CAC Quarante in Paris up 23 the DAX Index higher by 15. In the U.K. there are expectations that the U.K. will announce raising corporate taxes to help pay down debt created by the COVID relief programs. No major negative impact there so far.Asian markets following Wall Street's lead overnight with strong rallies across the board in South Korea. The KOSPI Index was the big winner up 3.5 percent as you can see the others also strong Japan up one and two thirds percent.Now some of the top stories that we are watching this morning, the national debt will swell to nearly $30 trillion if Democrats pushed through the president's $1.9 trillion Coronavirus relief bill, economists say that the package will grow the U.S. budget deficit to $3.8 trillion in 2021 alone that puts the government on track to spread more money in one year than the previous 200 years combined.House Democrats aiming to pass this massive bill tomorrow, as the fate of the minimum wage hangs on Senate officials. Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth McDonough will determine if the minimum wage increase complies with what's known as the bird rule under the budget reconciliation process. A ruling could come later today.Meanwhile, President Biden is revoking another Trump era rule this is the Trump era ban on legal immigration for family members of U.S. citizens and residents, some employment based green cards as well as diversity visa lottery recipients. Yes, he's putting the lottery back in place. The Trump Administration has said that the ban was necessary to protect American workers and the U.S. labor market during the pandemic.And finally, the Biden Administration could start shipping out 4 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine as soon as next week this after the FDA yesterday called the one dose shot safe and effective. The vaccine was found to be 66 percent effective in preventing the virus in trials.An FDA panel will meet tomorrow to vote on its emergency use Johnson & Johnson shares are up this morning ahead of the open on this news up another one and a third percent. Broader market also higher takes a look at Futures this morning.We've got strengthen the DOW that's for sure it is continuing in record territory right now up 64 points. NASDAQ is lower right now down 38. The S&P higher by one and a quarter this after yesterday's strong performance the DOW jumping 425 points yesterday, closing at an all time high long term bond yields the price of oil and even GameStop all rising on the session.Joining me right now Cornerstone Macros Co-Founder and Chief Economist Nancy Lazar also joining the conversation all morning long this morning is Fox Business's Dagen McDowell, and Strategic Wealth Partners President and CEO Mark Tapper, great to see everybody this morning.Nancy kicking it off with you everything was up yesterday, "The Journal" wrote it as look, stocks were up and so was oil. And that tells you that people are expecting growth. Do you believe it? Would you - the markets justify what you have expected on this economy?NANCY LAZAR, CORNERSTONE MACRO CO-FOUNDER & CHIEF ECONOMIST: Yes, we think the economy is returning to normalcy. One, there's so much stimulus in the pipeline, not just from what we've seen, potentially in March, but from late last year that consumers have a massive amount of excess saving right now it's about 2 trillion in excess saving.And depending upon what they do in March, it could be as high as three. So the consumer is in good shape. Tow our manufacturing sector is doing great supported by both technology and capital spending. This on-shoring theme is continuing to gain momentum, a recognition that our supply chain is screwed up.And we're better off manufacturing stuff at home rather than depending on other parts of the world to deliver it on a timely basis. Three, you've got housing; there's a new shift up in housing around the country no longer just on the coasts. But Middle America is our favorite emerging market and you're seeing increasingly because of technology.What we're doing today is zooming at the end of the day you can pretty much live where you want. And indeed it could be more affordable. So housing is also doing well. So the economy is on full throttle, as Powell said yesterday, he's going to keep rates lower longer.And that just further increases the odds the job market, which still only has a lot of room to heal will indeed heal over the next couple of couple of year's further supporting consumer spending and corporate profits.BARTIROMO: Yes, and you've been saying this, expecting that we were going to see growth, you've said between six and even as high as 7 percent in 2021. Let's walk through what you heard from Jay Powell yesterday, as he told the Senate Banking Committee, it's going to be low rates for some time, he'll maintain the Central Bank's easy money policies until the economy recovers, keeping low rates continuing to purchase asset purchases until significant progress has been made toward employment and inflation goals, which he says is likely to take some time.Nancy, when do you think we are going to see that normalization? I know you say we're getting back to normal. Is it a 2021 affair? Or are you looking beyond this year?LAZAR: From a labor market perspective is probably later, there are still so many people out of unemployed, over 10 million people still are looking for jobs. It will take some time. So potentially not until the back half of 2022 that you're moving toward full employment, maybe even early 2023.But at the end of the day, it's on the horizon, which is happening relatively quickly. But the good news from that and I know this isn't really good news that people are unemployed is that with this labor market slack, it is going to increase the odds of inflationary pressures stay lower longer.In addition, we're very positive on productivity growth in the United States, companies are really focused on improving productivity to get profitability. So the combination of those two forces labor market slack and an improving backdrop from a productivity perspective, it further increases the odds that the Fed will be correct that core inflationary pressures will stay relatively tame with that combination.In addition, as the economy reopens, you're already starting to see early signs that the supply chain disruptions are starting to fade. And I emphasize starting; there are still plenty of supply chain disruptions. But as we reopen the economy with the vaccine rollout, indeed, some of those supply chain disruptions could ease and take some of the sting out of some of the commodity price increases that we've that we've seen.So returning to normal from an economic perspective, but from a job perspective, it does take time to re employ all of these people.BARTIROMO: Yes, this is all really important info. I want to ask you about the stimulus and what that means for things. But first, let me get your take on rates while we're talking about inflation. As the economy normalizes comebacks to a growth status, you're seeing rates move higher. Is there is there a number that you deem as sort of important for the stock market?I mean, the tenure right now, at 1.44 percent, even though that's obviously very low, it's come up significantly from the bottom is there a number in your head that becomes problematic for stocks where it encourages people to start putting some money in fixed income, taking it out of stocks?LAZAR: It's really at that point where the corporate bond market starts to react negatively to the increase in treasury yields. It's not unusual in an early part of an expansion to have a backup in treasury yields but because of the improvement that you see in corporate profitability in that early stage the corporate spreads continue to decline.And we still think we're in that sweet spot we are expecting ten year treasury yields to continue to rank higher. We've talked about for a while they move up toward 155 by the end of the year, maybe higher depending upon how much stimulus we get in March.But what's happening right now is that you are continuing to reopen the economy continuing to improve profitability in many different sectors of the economy. And that's continuing to push downward pressure on corporate spreads. So it really isn't until the corporate bond market starts to stave off strains.And that would show up in an increase in corporate bond spreads. But we don't see that happening, say for the next - that's very hard to forecast but for roughly the next year, because so much of the economy is still reopening and will take time to reopen the entire economy, creating profit tail when and keeping spreads lower longer.So we're not really worried about the backup and Treasury yields. We are expecting it, but the economy is just too healthy right now for that real things.BARTIROMO: Yes, interesting to note, the yield up 5.9 basis points right now on the 10 year. Let me ask you about the stimulus. President Biden's $1.9 trillion relief package could bring U.S. national debt to nearly $30 trillion if in fact, this goes through budget reconciliation, and this package also will grow the budget deficit to 3.8 trillion, clearing the path for the government to spend more money in one year than in the previous 200 plus years.Nancy, we're talking about more than $5 trillion thrown at this economy in the last year. Nancy, when does debt and deficits become a problem for markets?LAZAR: Well, as we saw the last expansion, at some point, quite frankly, we think S&P is going to start downgrade U.S. treasury debt. It may not be until we're out of the clear may not be until we're 2023. But we will at some point have a rude awakening that we've just thrown way too much money at the economy.What we need to do, as - even suggested yesterday is focus on improving productivity in this country, not just ballooning the budget deficit, to be sure we need to send people who really, really are in need additional funding.But a 1.9 trillion package that takes the budget deficit to 216 percent of GDP this year, probably close to 6 percent GDP next year, just is unwarranted given the underlying health in the U.S. economy. And I'm enjoying the debate right now.I think it's great that there is a debate amongst Republicans and Democrats that the 1.9 is just too much the way it is currently structured. So we will at some point have to pay the piper for some of this massive amount of debt we've put in place, but probably not until 2022, 2023.BARTIROMO: All right, real quick, Nancy, before you go, what throws a wrench in this growth story? You've talked about the consumer being as strong as they are, with all of that savings and the pent up demand out there. You've also talked about purchasing managers' indexes, and what we're seeing on the manufacturing front.But is there something that you're watching? That is the red flag that throws a wrench into your growth expectations over the near term that we need to focus on?LAZAR: Well, COVID is certainly at the top of anybody's risk list right now. It certainly looks encouraging. But as we've seen over the past year, we can stumble right now doesn't appear that well, that we are struggling with this J&J news yesterday. That's very encouraging.I do worry about the geopolitical backdrop is out of my league. But I do worry about tensions between the United States and China and this administration doesn't seem to be backing off too much on that so geopolitical for me and again, there I just have to listen and watch what's going on around the world.And I do worry longer term about some of the potential or how much how much our regulatory excuse me going to increase under this new administration that could curtail business, that could curtail business confidence and throw a wrench into quite frankly, the labor market. So yes, there is definitely a lot of worry out there.BARTIROMO: All right, very important note to make Nancy it's great to see this morning. Thank you so much. We'll keep watching all of that.LAZAR: Thanks for having me. Thank you.BARTIROMO: And to you have a good day Nancy Lazar joining us Cornerstone Macro. We're just getting started this morning coming up promising vaccine developments. Johnson & Johnson's shot could get the green light from the FDA as soon as tomorrow what it means to the fight against the Coronavirus?Then in the next hour Senator Bill Haggerty is here breaking down President Biden's cabinet confirmations, plus Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody will join me weighing in on the administration's rollback of the Trump era immigration policies.Coming up in the 8 am hour this morning Congressman Henry Cuellar with more on the House votes on President Biden's nearly $2 trillion COVID-19 relief plan. Don't miss a moment of it. You're watching "Mornings with Maria" live on Fox Business. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: All right tax is in focus this morning as the Coronavirus pandemic takes an economic toll on states across the country. Some are considering raising income and capital gains taxes to make up for the losses. We know this is part of the Biden agenda among the states specifically to watch New York, Minnesota, Washington and Pennsylvania.Joining me right now is Americans for Tax Reform President Grover Norquist. Grover, it's great to have you this morning. Thanks very much for being here. We are watching this massive $1.9 trillion spending plan move forward.And no doubt very soon after we're going to gets a federal revenue raise package from the Biden Administration looking to raise taxes to pay for some of this. And then you've got the states trying to get their own revenue on top of that, with additional tax increases, what is most likely from your standpoint, in terms of tax increases to come?GROVER NORQUIST, AMERICANS FOR TAX REFORM PRESIDENT: Well, at the national level, Biden ran for president saying he wanted $4 trillion in tax increases that's wiping out all of the Trump Republican tax cuts and doubling it.He wants to double the capital gains tax which will slow economic growth. He wants to bring it back to the rates we haven't seen since Jimmy Carter days. He wants to take the corporate rate from 21 percent up higher than what China takes in taxes.So back when he was Vice President, China would take 25 percent tax on corporate income America, the United States would take 35 so you are better off investing in China for after tax returns. Biden is committed to going back to that either up to 18 up to 28 or 35.He's unclear sometimes but always higher than China's those changes in incentives will slow economic growth. And the problem with this spending plan is not just that it wastes a bunch of money. The state and local governments have more money today than they did a year ago.They didn't stop collecting sales taxes. They didn't stop collecting property taxes even from businesses they shut down. So they've kept themselves largely whole but they want all this more money in blue states to make up for the damage they did with their shut up - not the virus, the virus is in all 50 states.The slow in growth, the high unemployment are in those states. You mentioned the blue states that have continued spending patterns that make no sense. And the worst of it is every incompetent Governor, every corrupt Mayor is going to say in the future, why should I try and rein in my pension obligations are overspending, I'll just wait for the Democrats to get the House, Senate and the Presidency and they will bail me out.And this is a targeted bailout to blue states that shut things down the worst you did the more money you get. You are paying people for failure. That means the next time there's a problem, more failure.BARTIROMO: Well, this is a really important point. But I want to get to the corporate tax move that you just mentioned. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has been talking about this, speaking out in a recent interview that the Biden Administration is open to raising corporate taxes.You said 28 percent Biden said 35 percent when he was on the campaign trail; Yellen also said she discussed her wealth tax in the past. It's not something favored by President Biden, she said, but Grover, if you're talking about taking taxes up to 35 percent, then what you're going to be doing is watching the corporate sector figure out how they're going to pay for that?What they're going to cut? How they're going to rein things in? And then the capital gains tax is troublesome. Because if you take the capital gains tax to 40 percent, up from 21 percent, doesn't that cause a stock market selloff and an impact to growth?We're just talking to Nancy Lazar about economic growth that would be one of those regulatory moves that would certainly slow things down.NORQUIST: Raising the capital gains has always slowed growth, raising the corporate rate will do the same thing. This is very, very bad news. The longer they delay that or the less damage they do, the better, but they're heading in the wrong direction on taxes.BARTIROMO: All right, Grover we'll continue this conversation; please come back soon. Thank you, sir Grover Norquist joining us. Stay with us. We'll be right back. We're talking about getting removed from Amazon.BARTIROMO: Welcome back free speech under pressure Republican Senators calling out Amazon asking why the technology giant removed conservative scholar Ryan T Anderson's book when Harry became Sally, responding to the transgender moment from its platforms?According to lawmakers, Amazon has been unable to provide sufficient explanation. As far as why they removed this book. Amazon did not comment to the Wall Street Journal. Dagen McDowell interesting developments here with this pushback, what is your take on it?DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: The book was published in 2018, so why now? Very interesting, "The National Review" wrote an editorial about this very subject called "Amazon kneels before the mob".And it points out that the problem often with these large tech monopolies the big four is that it's their size and market share. But this is evidence that their opacity is another problem. The fact they can't answer questions about why this book was censored.And this is not as the author notes; it's not a bomb throwing book of red meat and heated rhetoric. And Jeff Bezos as he became one of the richest men in the world, because of the freedoms afforded him here in the United States. So he does have maybe not by law, because this first amendment doesn't apply to a private company.But he does have a duty. It's an obligation as just a citizen and a leader here in the United States to stand up for our very freedoms. He's not doing that. The one thing I disagree with in that and this is just one example of many Alex Berenson; his booklets that he was publishing about COVID were censored and totally took to Twitter.And they were restored on Amazon. But I take issue with the headline of this national review piece. It says Amazon kneels before the mob, Amazon is the mob. It's one of four families. It is cracking down on everything in this country that we hold dear and government and academia and big media. They're just on the take and in cahoots with these what could be criminal organizations.BARTIROMO: Well, I mean, what's going to be done about it? Dagen, what can be done about it? Section 230 was one lever to pull to say, look, clearly these companies has too much power and they need to be reined in. Let's allow these companies to face liability.But is that even going to come to pass given the fact that the Democrats are running things on all the chambers? And this is one of their big donors?MCDOWELL: Well, section - repealing section 230 wouldn't stop Amazon from censoring books on its bookstore online. In fact, if you get rid of Section 230, your - if these companies say a Twitter, Facebook are treated like media companies, they're just going to censor even more.And I say criminal I was - I was being facetious when I said that. That being said it the Democrats in the House, were talking about the danger to have these monopolies Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple just back in October.And so they were talking about the danger to our economy and our democracy being at stake because of the power that they held. So you know, it's not going to - a breakup isn't going to happen now in the United States with a again, they're all working in coordination with one another big check government, media and academia.But it will happen overseas. You saw what happened in Australia, other countries pushing back, I do think that there will be severe serious action by governments in Europe on these big tech companies, they will lead the way and America will follow despite the fact that we have greater freedom of speech here, but nobody is willing to stand up to the mob to big tech.BARTIROMO: Well, it is true Europe have certainly been more aggressive in terms of the antitrust damages and fees they're. Real quick comment Mark Tapper any thoughts here?MARK TAPPER, STRATEGIC WEALTH PARTNERS PRESIDENT AND CEO: Yes, I mean, again, it's not just a censorship issue. It is an antitrust issue. Look, I'm a business owner myself. If I don't agree with someone's values, I can turn them away as a client, but the difference is this.I'm not a monopoly, right? So if I told someone I'm not the right fit, they've got thousands of alternatives. Amazon sells 53 percent of physical books. They sell 80 percent of E-books. So, they're the dominant player. There really aren't very many alternatives. So look, I think the anti-trust issue is the biggest issue, and if big tech is going to mute conservative voices, our society is in big trouble.I mean, they've got way too much power --MARIA BARTIROMO, ANCHOR, MORNINGS WITH MARIA: Yes --TEPPER: We didn't get to where we are as a country through group think. We got to where we are --BARTIROMO: Yes --TEPPER: Because we encourage individual thought, we encourage contrarian thoughts. We need that.BARTIROMO: Yes, that's exactly right --DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS: It's digital book burning.BARTIROMO: Yes --MCDOWELL: It is digital book burning. Don't think it's anything --BARTIROMO: Yes --MCDOWELL: Else.BARTIROMO: All right, we'll leave it there, we'll be right back. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, good Thursday morning everybody, thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, February 25th. A look at markets this half an hour. We do have a firmer tone, but futures have turned decidedly mixed. Dow Industrials still in record territory this morning after hitting an all time high yesterday. But look at what has happened this morning to the Nasdaq, down now 118 points, we're seeing a real rollover in big tech. We are getting a look at the strength of the economy later this morning. We'll get the initial jobless claims report out as well as the second estimate on fourth quarter GDP.That will be out in two hours' time. As you see, the Nasdaq is now selling off, down 118 points, and the S&P 500 lower by 10.5. Even though the Dow is higher by 18 and in record territory. Let's check global markets here, European markets this morning are mostly higher, although here too, we are off of the best levels of the morning. The Dax Index in Germany has just turned negative, it is down 33 points. The FTSE 100 in the U.K. is up 22, the U.K. is expected to announce an increase in corporate taxes to help pay down debt created by COVID relief programs. Asian markets also this morning with strong rallies following Wall Street's lead overnight. The markets were higher across the board, but it was South Korea and the Kospi index where we saw the big win up 3.5 percent on the Kospi overnight.And Japan was up 1.75 percent on the Nikkei average. Back in the U.S., no criminal charges for Tiger Woods following this week's horrific crash. He continues to recover. Cheryl Casone with those details now. Cheryl?CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS: Good morning, Maria. The Los Angeles County sheriff has ruled Tuesday's crash an accident, saying specifically accidents are not a crime. Woods remains in the hospital and is recovering from what is said to be the first of several surgeries on his shattered right leg. The golf legend's SUV is said to have gone the distance of more than a football field before finally coming to a stop down the hill. Well, more trouble for embattled New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. His former aide Lindsey Boylan giving new details to her previous sexual harassment claims against him. On the website, "Medium", Boylan accuses Cuomo of kissing her without consent and suggesting they play strip poker.His administration denying her claims. And there's more trouble for Cuomo, Republicans on the House Oversight Committee are calling on Chairwoman Caroline Malone to subpoena the governor to testify after his administration admitted to withholding data on COVID-19 related deaths at nursing homes. And a wild ride for shares of GameStop, the stock halted twice yesterday after surging more than a 100 percent during the final hours of trading. The reason behind the surge, well, possibly an announcement a day earlier that GameStop's CFO is going to resign from his post in March. Shares of GameStop closed at $91.71, that was the highest mark we've seen since February 3rd, now, it's up 58 percent. Remember, though, it hit almost 500 bucks during the trading frenzy last month. And those are GameStop for you this morning, Maria. And those are your headlines, back to you.BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl, thank you so much. The future of the Durham investigation, one of the notable takeaways from Merrick Garland's confirmation hearings this week was when he said, he sees no reason why John Durham should not be left in place to continue his investigation into the origins of the Russia probe. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MERRICK GARLAND, NOMINATED TO BE ATTORNEY GENERAL: Another one of the very first things I'm going to have to do is speak with Mr. Durham, figure out how his investigation is going. I am a great believer in transparency. I would, though, have to talk with Mr. Durham and understand the nature of what he's been doing and the nature of the report.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: My next guest says, however, a Durham report is becoming more and more unlikely. Joining me right now is the author of "The Permanent Coup", Lee Smith, who has documented what has taken place over the last four years with regard to this takedown of Donald Trump. Lee, it's great to have you this morning, thanks very much for being here. You don't think we're going to get --LEE SMITH, AUTHOR: Good morning, Maria --BARTIROMO: Any indictments?SMITH: I think it's becoming increasingly unlikely. I think it's probably been unlikely for about a year now. But certainly, if you look at Merrick Garland's statements, he seemed not to have been -- he appears not to have been very well briefed about the Durham investigation, about the Steele report. But it's preposterous, of course, because someone would have told him to -- by the way, you've seen Mr. Garland over the last year, there have been documents, declassified, that show actually that your boss, the current president of the United States was involved in this operation, spying on Trump officials, including national security adviser Michael Flynn.So given all that, given that the people that Durham is reportedly looking at are in effect President Biden's co-conspirators. I find it highly unlikely that this investigation is going to go much further tragically for the country.BARTIROMO: Well, it's pretty extraordinary, and I would say that that's one of the reasons people are so skeptical because when you figure out what took place, and that there were --SMITH: Yes --BARTIROMO: All these lies that got the public up in arms about collusion with Russia, and then you recognize that it was all based on a lie and just one political campaign --SMITH: Right --BARTIROMO: Trying to take down another political campaign, that is Hillary Clinton's --SMITH: Right --BARTIROMO: Campaign trying to take down Trump's, and then nothing is done about it, you have skepticism about the other side and that's just going to continue.SMITH: Right --BARTIROMO: I think that's why there was so much skepticism on the 2020 election as well because nobody ever did anything about what took place in 2016.SMITH: I think you're absolutely right. And this is -- I mean, the failure goes in particular to the previous Attorney General William Barr. He should have understood, perhaps he did understand, but he didn't realize this. The problem was because people did not have faith in what happened before, because they saw an enormous crime which was the crossfire hurricane investigation. They understood that, that had to be addressed. If that wasn't going to be addressed, if people weren't going to pay for that, heading into the 2020 election, people would not fear -- the bad guys would not fear paying a price for the bad things that were done in 2016. It's an enormous failure and Americans will continue to pay for that.If you see what's happened -- everything has rolled out of this original insane conspiracy theory that we know as Russiagate or the collusion conspiracy theory because no one has paid a price for pushing that conspiracy theory into the American public. Look at the consecutive -- the serial lies that have been forced down the throats of the American people. And until one of these is broken, until one of these is broken down, we're going to continue to live with this nonsense and these lies and people will not believe the important things that Americans need to have confidence in, above all, our justice system. We're past that point right now --BARTIROMO: That is right, that's absolutely right, yes. And I think that, you know, I've said this in the past, people go back into the water when they know the shark is dead. When people feel like there was accountability --SMITH: Right --BARTIROMO: That's when they will trust again. Otherwise, you're not trusting any of the institutions and this has real implications as we just saw with the 2020 election where there was so many questions about it, partly because --SMITH: Right --BARTIROMO: Of the underlying biggest lie of all --SMITH: Right --BARTIROMO: And that big lie was Trump colluded with Russia.SMITH: Right --BARTIROMO: By the way, there's these weak spots that we keep seeing within the FBI. Earlier, we heard about the January 6th Capitol riots, and that the FBI did not pass on the information that they were hearing --SMITH: Right --BARTIROMO: That these groups were planning to breach the Capitol. Now house Republicans are calling on the FBI to hold a briefing on Congressman Eric Swalwell's --SMITH: Right --BARTIROMO: Ties to the Chinese spy.SMITH: Right.BARTIROMO: Lee, your reaction? I want to talk about Eric Swalwell in a minute --SMITH: Yes --BARTIROMO: But first, the FBI and what needs to be done here to get trust back in place? Because clearly, there are --SMITH: Yes --BARTIROMO: A lot of things, a lot of places where people are questioning the leadership at the FBI, most notably the Capitol breach as well, and what they knew --SMITH: Right --BARTIROMO: And why they didn't pass that information on.SMITH: Right. What needs to happen, I mean, the first thing I believe is that Christopher Wray has to go. He should have been fired by Donald Trump and William Barr. If Joe Biden wants to make an honest effort to get people to believe in America's federal law enforcement agency, Mr. Wray has to go. But as you say, this is a very big problem. The fact that at least half of America, Republicans, conservatives, are not going to have faith in the FBI is an enormous issue. As for --BARTIROMO: Right --SMITH: As for Representative Swalwell, I mean, another institution we don't have faith in right now is the democratic-run House Intelligence Committee. So, it's had nothing to do with intelligence for many years now, and the idea that Swalwell is still on that committee is just part of the Democrats' -- Nancy Pelosi's upside-down universe. It's bizarre world where nothing makes sense. Here's a man who was compromised by a Chinese spy and he's sitting on the House Intelligence Committee? None of this makes --BARTIROMO: Right --SMITH: Any sense --BARTIROMO: Well, it does because it's all coordinated. It's a stick in the eye for anybody who was --SMITH: Right --BARTIROMO: Talking about his ties to China and Fang Fang, this spy that he was obviously --SMITH: Right --BARTIROMO: Romantically involved with. Lee, you've done a lot of work on China. Real quick --SMITH: Yes --BARTIROMO: Before we go, what is the story with California and the Chinese Communist government? It's not just Eric Swalwell.SMITH: Yes --BARTIROMO: You've got Barbara Boxer, you've got --SMITH: Oh, yes --BARTIROMO: Dianne Feinstein who had a spy as a driver for 20 years.SMITH: Yes.BARTIROMO: The CCP has been very smart in terms of infiltrating --SMITH: Right --BARTIROMO: California Democrats.SMITH: Yes, I mean, it's the -- it's the epicenter of the tech industry. So, this has been very important for decades. I mean, of course, there's, you know, there are large Asian populations all over the country including New York, but the reason that California is the real problem is because it's the tech epicenter. And apparently, the California congressional and U.S. Senate delegation are not paying very close attention or they seem not to --BARTIROMO: Yes --SMITH: Care about it very much, and the FBI apparently is not doing -- again, this is another time where the FBI appears to be failing to do its job. Understandably, however, the number of intelligence agents that are run at U.S. officials, it's astonishing. But it seems that the FBI is perhaps overwhelmed and of course they are, because when they're looking at Russia collusion, when they're looking at made-up stories, instead of doing their job by looking at Chinese intelligence agents, that's where the problem comes in.BARTIROMO: Yes, bingo, that's exactly right. Spot-on. And unfortunately, you're talking about a very serious threat in terms of the Chinese Communist Party, and instead they're playing politics with Russia collusion and a made-up narrative. Lee, it's good to see you as always. Thank you, sir.SMITH: Thank you, Maria --BARTIROMO: Lee Smith joining us there --SMITH: Thanks very much.BARTIROMO: We're going to take a break, and then we're going to get into the vaccine progress, what it could mean for the new COVID-19 variant spreading in New York, plus that J&J great news. And then this, a tattoo gone all wrong, why one woman regrets the ink she got just before the pandemic, it's making a buzz this morning. You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A new coronavirus variant in the Big Apple, researchers from Columbia University say that the variant is unique, but shares similarities to the South African strain that scientists believe spreads more quickly. Joining me right now is emergency and family medicine doctor, Fox News medical contributor Janette Nesheiwat. And Janette, it's great to see you this morning, thanks very much for being here. Your reaction to what we're seeing in New York? How worried should we be?JANETTE NESHEIWAT, EMERGENCY & FAMILY MEDICINE DOCTOR: Good morning, Maria, so I am concerned with this new home-grown strain of COVID-19 that we found here in New York. It's found in about 12 percent of the samples that we have taken from New Yorkers at this time, and the concern is that it's very similar to the South African variant, and that it could spread more easily and it's more contagious. So what that means is, we need to continue to vaccinate as many New Yorkers, as many American as quickly as possible before the virus continues to replicate and mutate even further.BARTIROMO: Yes, but is there anything that people should be doing differently with these new variants?NESHEIWAT: Excellent question. We need to continue doing the basics, covering your face, wearing your mask --BARTIROMO: OK --NESHEIWAT: Even the CDC says now double-masking is better, keeping your hands washed and clean and physical distancing, avoiding the crowds and congregations. And even if you've been vaccinated, continue to wear your mask until we can get the entire population vaccinated.BARTIROMO: All right, we also have now new vaccinations coming, Johnson & Johnson has this one shot treatment, it's been deemed safe by the FDA. It could be approved as soon as tomorrow. Moderna is sending a booster shot to the CDC for a trial with a goal of protecting against these new variants. And then there's this new study from Israel saying that the Pfizer vaccine could, quote, "end the pandemic" with two doses preventing 94 percent of cases among half a million people. Your thoughts on the variety now of vaccines we're talking about.NESHEIWAT: This is just such excellent news, Maria. This is exactly what we need to get out of this pandemic. As far as Johnson & Johnson, I am so excited about this vaccine because it's so much easier to use. Just like a flu shot, it's just one shot and you're done. It provides good efficacy, good protection against death, against hospitalizations, against severe complications. And we're going to have hopefully a few million doses sent out next week if we get emergency use authorization, hopefully this Friday or in the next few days. So another tool to help us combat this pandemic. It's very effective. And then we look at Moderna as well. They are looking at a booster shot, specifically targeting the South African variant.They've already submitted trials and data to the NIH to get approval on this booster shot which will help with the virus spreading. And then again, the study out of Israel, which followed 1.2 million participants. Remember, Israel has the world's highest level of vaccination of all countries. So they followed 1.2 million participants and found that 94 percent effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine, these are the vaccines that are going to get us out of this pandemic. It's just a matter of time.BARTIROMO: Very good. Dr. Nesheiwat, great to see you this morning, thank you. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. It is time for the Morning Buzz. A tattoo fail. A woman on TikTok wishing she could turn back the clock after revealing a tattoo she got just before the pandemic, it reads this, "courageously and radically refuse to wear a mask". The ink was meant to mean being true to yourself, but she has been hiding it by wearing long sleeve shirts to avoid anti-masking assumptions. Mark, wow, your thoughts?TEPPER: That stinks. That stinks. So --BARTIROMO: Yes --TEPPER: Well, getting tattoos removed isn't all that easy. She's probably going to have to cover it up with another. But while we're on the topic of dumb tattoos that people regret, Maria, Dagen, you've seen "We're the Millers" with Jason Sudeikis and Jennifer Aniston, right? Awesome movie --BARTIROMO: Yes --TEPPER: Remember that kid's tattoo? No regrets. Spelled r-a-g-r-e-t-s, right? Jason Sudeikis looks at him and says really? No regrets, not even one letter? So awesome movie, love that movie, but you know, tattoos are permanent unfortunately.BARTIROMO: Right, Dagen, what do you say?MCDOWELL: Can we take a look at this woman's tattoo again? It's on this part of her arm right here. Nobody is going to see that, except a family member or someone you're intimate with. So this is attention seeking behavior, right? And nobody is ever going to see that. Nobody should get a tattoo unless you're a rock star or ride a Harley Davidson for a living until you're 50 because then, maybe, you know what you're doing.BARTIROMO: All right, let's take a short break, and we've got a lot coming up, stay with us, stocks trading higher ahead of tomorrow's vote on the stimulus package. We're breaking it all down and the "WORD ON WALL STREET", it all starts next hour right here. MORNINGS WITH MARIA is live on Fox Business.Load-Date: February 25, 2021End of Document

FREE SPEECH: PROTECTING CITIZENS' VOICES ADVANCES SOCIETIESStates News ServiceMarch 1, 2021 MondayCopyright 2021 States News ServiceLength: 444 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: London, England BodyThe following information was released by the U.S. Embassy in London:Free Speech Protecting Citizens VoiceThe Chinese government sentenced a book publisher to three years in prison in February after she voiced support for a prominent critic of the Chinese Communist Party. Geng Xiaonan's sentence came after the party arrested dozens of politicians and democracy advocates in Hong Kong in January.Authoritarian governments punish speech to protect their power.In November 2019, Iran's regime blacked out the internet and killed more than 1,500 demonstrators in a crackdown on nationwide protests that began with a hike in gas prices but turned against government corruption and mismanagement.Iran's regime also routinely imprisons journalists, human rights activists and women who peacefully protest the government's mandatory hijab law. China's ruling party censors movies, newspapers, television and social media that criticize its repressive policies in Xinjiang and Tibet or other authoritarian practices.In the United States, free speech is protected as an essential part of democracy.Benjamin Franklin, an American founding father, called freedom of speech "a principal pillar of free government." He understood that without free speech, "the constitution of a free society is dissolved, and tyranny is erected on its ruins."Protecting speech advances societyAmericans' right to speak freely without government-imposed suppression or restriction is enshrined in the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, along with the freedoms of religion, press and assembly and the right to petition the government for redress of grievances.Those five freedoms empower citizens to fully participate in society, self-govern, hold elected officials accountable, protest peacefully and even lead social movements.Protests after the killing of George Floyd in law enforcement custody May 25, 2020, in Minneapolis prompted nationwide demonstrations that led to police reforms to protect communities and advance equal justice for all Americans.The speeches of Martin Luther King Jr. inspired thousands to peacefully march for equal rights during the civil rights movement of the 1950s and '60s. Those peaceful demonstrations contributed to the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibited discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin.While the civil rights movement is among the most prominent exercises of free speech, Americans exercise that right every day, interacting with their local, state and federal governments. The White House alone receives thousands of letters and emails from Americans every day.Source: ShareAmericaLoad-Date: March 1, 2021End of Document

Telecom Global Market Report 2021: COVID 19 Impact and Recovery to 2030; Major companies in the telecom market include AT&T; Apple; Verizon Communications Inc; China Mobile Ltd and Samsung. The global telecom market is expected to grow from $2555. 45 billion in 2020 to $2713.GlobeNewswireFebruary 2, 2021 Tuesday 7:52 AM PTCopyright 2021 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: MARKET RESEARCH REPORTSLength: 693 wordsBodyNew York, Feb.  02, 2021  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Reportlinker.com announces the release of the report "Telecom Global Market Report 2021: COVID 19 Impact and Recovery to 2030" - https://www.reportlinker.com/p06018824/?utm_source=GNW 53 billion in 2021 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.2%. The growth is mainly due to the companies rearranging their operations and recovering from the COVID-19 impact, which had earlier led to restrictive containment measures involving social distancing, remote working, and the closure of commercial activities that resulted in operational challenges. The market is expected to reach $3461.03 billion in 2025 at a CAGR of 6%.The telecom market consists of sales of telecom goods and services by entities (organizations, sole traders and partnerships) that provide communication hardware equipment for the transmission of voice, data, text and video. The telecoms market also includes manufacturers' sales of goods such as GPS equipment, cellular telephones and switching equipment. The telecom market is segmented into wireless telecommunication carriers; wired telecommunications carriers; communications hardware and satellite & telecommunication resellers.Asia Pacific was the largest region in the global telecom market, accounting for 34% of the market in 2020. North America was the second largest region accounting for 32% of the global telecom market. Africa was the smallest region in the global telecom market.Internet TV is gaining acceptance and being preferred by customers in developed and developing markets. The traditional pay-TV industry has been facing severe competition from online video streaming service providers. The low-cost video streaming service providers are threatening the pay-TV business model and forcing traditional pay-TV service providers to offer internet TV services to their subscribers. For example, in June 2018, AT&T, after its acquisition of Time Warner, announced a launch of a live TV streaming platform, WatchTV, which was a lower cost alternative to AT&T's DirecTV Now.The telecom industry involved in the provision of national networks across the world is increasingly targeted by hackers, exposing various security issues. The hackers' main aim is to steal valuable information and use it in their own favor. Despite various measures taken by many national governments resorting to stricter regulatory norms for foreign hardware manufacturers, issues concerning national security continue to rise. The extreme cases of the surveillance include banning the Huawei Company by the USA, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the UK governments to participate in the provision of 5G network hardware due to security concerns, which stemmed from the Chinese government's use of Huawei's products to spy on people around the world. Hence, these security issues leading to the ban of foreign manufacturers are expected to hinder the growth of the communications hardware in the forecast period, a major segment within the telecom market.IoT technology adoption by manufacturing and transportation services companies is driving the telecom market in the forecast period. IoT is a network of physical objects such as devices, vehicles, buildings and other items which are embedded with electronics, software, sensors and network connectivity enable these objects to collect and exchange data. For instance, Microsoft and Rolls-Royce have announced a partnership centering on future Rolls-Royce intelligent engines, which will integrate Microsoft Suite into its service solutions to expand its digital capabilities. Smart Grid encompasses inter related technologies entering public use to manage electricity consumption. Thus, IoT technology adoption is expected to expand the demand for telecom services.

Tencent Seeks Video Breakthrough After $240 Billion Lite App HitCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 20, 2021 WednesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 981 wordsBody(Bloomberg) -- WeChat creator Allen Zhang is counting on a breakthrough in video to thwart TikTok owner ByteDance Ltd., building on the success of his last big overhaul of the all-in-one messaging app.Zhang, celebrated in China for inventing Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s signature creation, has toyed for years with ways to keep and expand WeChat’s industry lead, particularly as upstarts like Douyin -- the Chinese twin to TikTok -- began to surpass WeChat in user time-spent. Since 2017, mini apps -- the last significant WeChat innovation -- have blossomed into a $240 billion marketplace, with 400 million daily users doubling the amount they spent last year on transactions such as booking rides and buying groceries.Through mini programs, WeChat has become intrinsic to the lives of over a billion people and is the backbone of the Chinese tech giant’s sprawling internet empire that spans social media, gaming and financial services. In his annual spiel to developers, Zhang signaled that the next chapter of the platform will be focused on short-form videos: an arena where Tencent is playing catch-up to nemesis ByteDance.“In terms of self-expression and media consumption, our era is shifting toward videos,” Zhang said Tuesday in a two-hour speech at WeChat’s 10th anniversary developer conference.The explosive growth in video has upended China’s social media landscape over the past four years, with Douyin accumulating 600 million daily users and cementing its position as the go-to for goofy lip-syncing videos. By September last year, ByteDance’s share of Chinese app users’ screen time had climbed to 15% from 12% a year earlier as Tencent’s dropped to 41% from 45%, according to researcher QuestMobile.In response, the 51-year-old Zhang -- who commands a cult-like following in China thanks to WeChat’s influence -- first touted the app’s short-videos function during last year’s event in Guangzhou. Just like in Douyin, users of the Channels feature scroll through an endless stream of videos or photos recommended by algorithms. In just six months, the function had garnered 200 million daily active users, Zhang said on WeChat in June. Since then, it’s upgraded that function so users can also scout for nearby live-streamers and tip them with virtual coins.Tencent has dabbled in short videos in the past, with mixed success. Its infamous “shark womb” culture has given birth to numerous products akin to Douyin, with its Weishi app making the biggest splash. It’s also an investor in Kuaishou, the Douyin competitor that’s said to be planning a $5 billion Hong Kong initial public offering this year.Zhang devoted most of his speech this year to detailed discussions of Channels’ product design. While WeChat’s social feeds have been centered around words and long-form articles, many people find it easier to create content via videos, he said. Unlike rivals, Channels won’t lure influencers with cash prizes and both social networks and machine recommendations will play a part in deciding what content shows up on user feeds, he said. The company now has nearly 200 people working on the product, growing from just around 20 when it started, he said.“It’s challenging for everybody to drive traffic to a new standalone app rather than making it part of their existing apps. That’s where Channels differs significantly from Weishi,” said Michael Norris, research and strategy manager at Shanghai-based consultancy AgencyChina. “WeChat is this piggy bank that drives new use cases. The question is why Tencent didn’t do that sooner.”WeChat executives giving presentations on Tuesday showed how formidable the Chinese super-app is to just about every internet peer: about 300 million people now buy fresh produce through mini programs, signaling Tencent’s rapid inroads into the hottest sphere of online commerce. Roughly 800 million made use of its healthcode during the lockdowns, as the Chinese government sought to track people’s movements via apps to control the spread of the virus. Monthly active users for mini-program games alone surpassed half a billion.Still, Tencent faces some headaches. The Chinese government has sent a warning shot to its technology giants by issuing wide-ranging guidelines against monopolistic practices on the internet from the sharing of sensitive information to alliances that squeeze out smaller rivals. While the crackdown has so far focused largely on areas such as e-commerce and fresh produce delivery, Tencent’s overwhelming leadership in gaming and social media may draw scrutiny.WeChat, for its part, has established a so-called walled garden that controls what content and services its users can interact with. ByteDance, which has been eating away at Tencent’s lead in areas like social media and gaming, is among a number of rivals that have long complained about the platform blocking their services. The companies’ billionaire founders -- Zhang Yiming at ByteDance and Tencent’s Pony Ma -- have previously traded barbs and, as recently as this month, ByteDance senior executives publicly accused the larger company of blocking its offerings including Douyin and work app Feishu on WeChat.There are signs Asia’s most valuable corporation is making tentative efforts to ease away from that closed ecosystem. WeChat is focused on opening up access to its mini programs this year, executives said Tuesday, and users can now access the lite apps through links sent via email and text messages.As WeChat’s evolution and monetization become increasing visible, Tencent’s Zhang -- who has said he doesn’t think about the competition -- insists he’s sticking with his original product philosophy.“Wechat is almost as simple as it was 10 years ago. There are lots of new functions, but we delivered these functions in the simplest way,” Zhang said, before wrapping up the night. “Maybe you don’t agree, but simplicity is beauty.”Load-Date: January 21, 2021End of Document

This is because, last year, the U.S. Senate passed a bill requiring all Chinese companies listed on both indices to be governed by the same accounting transparency rules as u.S. counterparts for at least three consecutive years.And already this year, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) withdrew three Chinese telecommunications companies due to several defaults recorded by regulators. They were China Mobile Communications, China Telecommunications and China Unicom (Hong Kong), three companies controlled by the Chinese Government, which are also listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange. At issue is the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, a bill passed by the U.S. Senate in May 2020 and signed in December by outgoing President Donald Trump.The legislation aims to compel all Chinese companies listed on both indices to be governed by the same accounting transparency rules as the Us counterparts for at least three consecutive years.The securities of the three Chinese companies trade in the United States in the form of "ADR" ("American Depositary Shares"), that is, they are securities awarded to foreign companies that want to access Wall Street.       Load-Date: February 18, 2021End of Document

Joe Biden proclaims "US is back" in its international premiereCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 20, 2021 SaturdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1071 wordsBodyU.S. President Joe Biden proclaimed Friday the return of the transatlantic alliance, in a powerful speech to re-establish America as the West's leader against what he saw as a global attack on democracy. Biden's speech at the Munich Security Conference, an annual videoconference event held by the COVID-19 pandemic, coincided with German Chancellor Angela Merkel's welcome to "multilateralism" after years of confrontation under Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump. In his first major international foreign policy allocution since he took office on January 20, Biden said America's traditional allies should once again have confidence in Washington's leadership. "I am sending a clear message to the world: America is back. The transatlantic alliance is back," he said from the White House. "The United States is determined to recommit to Europe, to consult with you, to regain our position of reliable leadership," he said. Biden, who spoke earlier with leaders of the Group of Seven (G7), a club of rich democratic countries, said his government will again emphasize alliance building, in contrast to Trump's allied policies and caustic treatment of allies. "Our partnerships have endured and grown over the years because they are rooted in the richness of our shared democratic values. They're not transactional. They're not about bringing something out," Biden said alluding to Trump's emphasis on redefining partners as economic rivals. Collective force, Biden said, is the only way to succeed when the global contest between democracy and autocracy is at a "turning point." "In too many places, including Europe and the United States, democratic progress is under attack," he said. "Historians will examine and write about this moment. It's a turning point. And I believe with all my being that democracy must prevail."  Beyond the Pandemic Group of Seven leaders, who account for just under half of the world economy, tried Friday to look beyond the COVID-19 pandemic to rebuild their battered economies with free trade and counter China's "non-market-oriented" policies. Not only did Biden premier in the meeting, so did Italy's new prime minister Mario Draghi. Leaders called for strengthening defenses against a future pandemic, including the exploration of a global health treaty, but the focus was on an ecological economic recovery, the same day the United States rejoined the Paris climate agreement. "Employment and growth is what we're going to need after this pandemic," Johnson said at the opening of the meeting. In an official statement, the G7 said it will defend open economies, "the free movement of data with confidence", and work on "a rules-based, modernized, freer and fairer multilateral trading system." After Facebook eliminated news channels in Australia, French President Emmanuel Macron raised the role that social media platforms should play in preserving freedom of expression and how to regulate them, a French official said Friday. China and Russia, threats G7 leaders also supported Japan's commitment to hosting the 2020 Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games this summer. Biden denied seeking a return to "the rigid cold war blocs," insisting that the international community must work together on issues such as the coronavirus pandemic and climate change, even if there are deep disagreements on other issues. America's return to the Paris Climate Agreement is a test ofWashington's intentions, he said. "We can no longer delay or do the minimum to address climate change," Biden stressed, calling it a "global existential crisis." But Biden made harsh warnings about the threats posed by Russia and China. "The Kremlin attacks our democracies and uses corruption as a weapon to try to undermine our system of government," he said. He noted: President Vladimir Putin "seeks to weaken the European project and our NATO alliance." Again urging the unity of Western countries, Biden said that "it is much easier for the Kremlin to intimidate and threaten individual states than to negotiate with a strong and closely united transatlantic community." The White House said Biden does not plan to resume Trump's controversial efforts last year to restore the G8, which became the G7 after Russia was expelled in response to its annexation of Ukraine's Crimean region. "I don't think we're going to make new invitations to Russia or reiterate new invitations to Russia," press secretary Jen Psaki said. Similarly, Biden said, U.S. partners must remain united against "economic abuses and coertion by the Chinese government that undermine the foundations of the international economic system." "Chinese companies must meet the same standard" as U.S. and European companies, he said. In a clear reference to China, G7 members stated that "they will consult each other on collective approaches to address non-market-oriented policies and practices". "We must prepare together for a long-term strategic competition with China," Biden asked. "The competition with China is going to be tough. That's what I expect, and it's something I welcome. Because I believe in the global system that Europe and the United States together, with our allies in the Indo-Pacific, we have fought so hard to build in the last 70 years," he added. His message will not have easy fit into a European Union where many leaders and entrepreneurs want to strengthen the economic and trade relationship with Beijing, and that in December he signed an investment agreement with China that caused a deep unease in Biden's team. The difficulty in addressing this issue became clear when French President Emmanuel Macron avoided talking about China during his speech at the same conference shortly after Biden. In addition, Macron insisted on his idea of Europe's "strategic autonomy" to reduce its dependence on major powers, including the United States; while Biden avoided one of the thorniest issues in the relationship: the US threat of sanctions for the Nordstream 2 pipeline, which will link Russia and Germany. At the Munich forum, NATO Chief Jens Stoltenberg also referred to Beijing's influence. "China's rise is a defining issue for the transatlantic community with possible consequences for our security, prosperity, and way of life," he said. "That's why NATO should deepen our relations with close partners, such as Australia and Japan, and forge new ones around the world."

Understand what the WTO is and why it needs to be reformedCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 19, 2021 TuesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 2144 wordsBodyTwenty-five years after its creation, the WTO (World Trade Organization) has reached a crossroads and urgently needs to undergo reform, says a wide range of analysts involved in international trade.All three of the organization's functions -- providing a negotiating forum to liberalize trade, resolving disputes between its 164 members, and monitoring trade policies -- face challenges, said Marianne Schneider-Petsinger, senior research fellow in the U.S. and Americas Program at Chatham House. "To reinvigorate, it needs reforms on the three pillars."But there is an even more urgent reason for multilateral trade talks to occur again, says Anabel Gonzalez, costa rica's former trade minister (2010-2014) and former director of the entity: the Covid-19 pandemic, which encouraged protectionist measures and prompted many companies and countries to review their dependence on Chinese suppliers, disrupting supply chains crucial to world trade.                  Read also                                                                                                                                           Targeted by Trump, WTO should have symbolic relief with Biden                                                                                                              "Countries need to understand that trade is not the cause of the crisis, but a solution," says Gonzalez, for whom it is crucial to facilitate trade in medical equipment and fight protectionism.Addressing issues that have been set on the global agenda -- the digital economy, the environment, climate change, labor rights and inclusion -- is necessary for the organization to gain relevance again, says Canadian Debra Steger, former director of the WTO Ad Appeal Council.First of all, however, it will be necessary to unlock the current gears of the entity, paralyzed by blockades of the United States during the Donald Trump administration. But what is the WTO for, why does it face problems and what needs to change?         How did the WTO come about?    The organization was founded in 1995 as an expansion of GATT, an agreement to facilitate trade signed by 23 countries after World War II.The WTO maintained gatt's original purposes —reducing tariffs and other non-tariff barriers to trade in goods, combating unfair practices such as dumping, and facilitating investment between countries—but expanded its scope.In the new structure, it included trade in services and intellectual property and reformed its rules in sensitive areas such as agriculture and textiles.The number of members was also expanded, reaching 164 members, which move 98% of global trade. Another 22 savings are candidates to join.The main novelty of the WTO in its creation was a system of dispute settlement, to resolve commercial disagreements among its members. This gave predictability and legal certainty to the agreements, which, in the case, would favor the negotiations.    What went wrong?    1. The crisis of globalizationThe WTO was found in the 1980s in alignment with globalization and neoliberalism sowing by Ronald Reagan, former President of the United States (1981-1989), and Margaret Thatcher, former British Prime Minister (1979-1990).By the time it finally came to light, however, economic liberalism was already tinted by the social policies of the Third Way advocated by the American Bill Clinton (president from 1993 to 2001) and the British Tony Blair (prime minister from 1997 to2007). Globalization, on the other hand, was bombarded by activists of the most different flags: ecologists, anarchists, unionized workers, students, pacifists and humanists.Gathered in Seattle, tens of thousands of protesters rioted and buried the so-called Millennium Round in 1999.Bilateral agreements took the place of the major multilateral rounds and no broad negotiations were successful until 2015, when WTO members agreed to ban subsidies from agricultural exports.? 2. The Sino-American rivalryThe WTO framework, written when the world was dominated by the United States and major European economies, was surpassed by China's emergence, says Jeffrey Schott, senior analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, who has been closely monitoring rounds and trade negotiations since the 1970s.The WTO system provided for concessions to development economies —which at that time included Singapore, South Korea, India, South Africa and Brazil, among others. Among the others was China, which joined the organization in 2001.Schott points out that the WTO rulebook did not provide for a giant economy with strong state intervention. The more space the Chinese gained, the more the U.S. criticized the fact that it received the same preferential treatment from Uganda or Guatemala, but continued to disrespect the rules of the game.Criticism has escalated under President Donald Trump, who accused the WTO of protecting China and systematically harming the U.S. in dispute settlements. The U.S. government blocked the appointment of judges to the adhering body in late 2019, also paralyzing this pillar.For Schneider-Petsinger, in addition to Trump's extreme measures, there are longstanding systemic issues that have already been exposed by previous U.S. governments and are shared by many other WTO members.3. Leadership crisisIn Schott's assessment, the WTO has plunged into a leadership crisis in recent years: "the US, China, the EU and Japan, which together account for almost half of the world's trade in goods and 54% of global exports of services, have ceased to engage. The negotiations will only succeed if they work together."The largest area of disagreement among the founders of the entity is the adbody. "If the U.S. and the EU cannot work together bilaterally, WTO reform is unlikely," Schneider-Petsinger said. In addition, every conversation needs to include China, the world's largest trading nation. "That is, transatlantic cooperation is necessary, but not enough," argues the analyst.In July, when she was presented as a candidate to head the entity, Nigerian Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala defended a similar thesis: "The current problems of the WTO are not only technical in nature. If they were, they would have been resolved a long time ago, given the expertise of their members and their secretariat."       Does Trump's exit change anything?    President-elect Joe Biden defends multilateralism in his speeches, but analysts point out that in the American dictionary the word has a selective meaning: it serves while serving the interests of the country.Former trade negotiators close to the U.S. government say the clash with China will not go away, because the conviction that the Chinese government anchors itself in multilateralism to maintain state subsidy policies is also strong among diplomats around Biden.According to Anabel Gonzalez, who is also a senior analyst at PIIE, the president-elect will at least give space for the organization to face the challenges of the pandemic andeconomic crisis it causes—the Democrat has elected the fight against Covid-19 as a priority.For Steger, any reform will bring challenges -- "powerful countries will have very different views on what needs to change"—but at least the changes will be encouraged by Biden, who sees the WTO as a key part of economic policy.    What reforms are needed?    To begin with, we will need to agree on what kind of reform there will be, says Deputy Director-General Alan Wolff. "What is needed is not to start over, but to improve what we have. There is no reason to favor the burning of what exists in the hope that something better will emerge from the ashes like a phoenix," says the American.And because WTO decisions are based on consensus, the chances of a fundamental review are minimal if everyone's approval is required, Schneider-Petsinger says: "Therefore, members should make a point of reviewing some of the organization's principles and decision-making system."Wolff agrees. Among the concrete examples of necessary changes he cites an agreement on when and where unanimity is appropriate and where it is not. "In other words, an understanding that consensus is not unanimous. This is necessary for the organization to work," he said in September at the opening session of Geneva Trade Week.If they agree on how to reach agreements, these are some points that need reform, according to experts in the field:1. Digital worldOne of the most urgent is a broad agreement on digital trade, as the Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated the digitization of the economy, Gonzalez said. WTO rules were written before technology radically changed the way it finances, produces, markets and transports products and services around the world.In 2019, a group of WTO members - including China - endorsed a joint statement on the issue in Davos, promising a result based on "existing WTO agreements and structures with the participation of as many members as possible." The document also referred to small and medium-sized enterprises and undeveloped countries, but was "scarce in substantive details or timelines," Sofia Baliño of the IISD (International Institute for Sustainable Development) said at the time.Experts such as Simon Lester, who worked at the WTO's adagency secretariat, are skeptical about the feasibility of an international e-commerce regime. "Governments that engage in specific practices will not want to sign rules prohibiting these practices," he wrote on the International Economic Law and Policy blog.2. Subsidies and state contributionsAnother theme enhanced by coronavirus are the programs of governments created to address the pandemic: it may be necessary to discipline subsidies given to industry and agriculture, which can unbalance competition and affect trade.In addition, there is a back-up of huge companies with state participation, not just in China, says Thomas Duesterberg of the Hudson Institute. "In 2013, 81% of the revenues of Russia's 10 largest companies came from state-owned companies. The figures for Brazil were 50%, for the United Arab Emirates, 88%, for India, 59%, and for France, 17%," he says.The coronavirus crisis tends to increase this trend, as has happened with aid to airlines in several countries.China, where 8 of the top 10 companies were state-owned in 2017, is also a problem because "it is difficult to differentiate state-owned companies from market-oriented private companies because of opaque ownership networks and usesubsidies and market restrictions," says the expert.WTO rules do not achieve most mercantilist and non-market practices of state-owned enterprises and urgently need updating, he says.3. The environmental issueWe need to work on developing new rights and obligations covering the intersection of trade and climate policies, says PIIE analyst Jeffrey Schott.The pressure for trade rules to provide for the possibility of punishing countries that degrade the environment to make their exports viable is growing, as recent protests in the European Union against the Mercosur agreement show.4. Differentiated treatmentDiplomats also point to the discussion on the contribution of the largest emerging economies -- including China, India, Brazil and South Africa -- to the trading system as crucial. The current system is based on self-declaration, a criterion that developed countries consider unfair.In bolsonaro management, Brazil announced that it would give up its preferential treatment, given pressure from the United States."Reform will be impossible without addressing a consensual definition of what constitutes a developed or developing country," Schneider-Petsinger says.The issue, however, is sensitive with regard to agricultural subsidies, as Indians and Chinese face enormous problems of poverty and hunger.5. Procedural reformsAccording to Schott, a revitalisation of the WTO over the next five years depends on the reconstitution of the Adhering Body with new rules that ensure objective and timely decisions.Duesterberg says it is necessary to address U.S. complaints that the dispute settlement system "invents" rules without going through WTO members.If many agree that the edges of the controversy system need to be trimming, it has not been easy to find solutions that please everyone.In trilateral talks, Japan, the US and the EU have been talking about it for two years, without major advances.Among the detailed proposals Duesterberg describes is to refer matters to member committees whenever there is ambiguity or legal uncertainty.The key, Okonjo-Iweala argued in a recent article, is to stop treating the trade as a zero-sum game. Rights and obligations can be balanced with the evolution of trade rules, without making trade "a bogeyman to blame for the economic problems that some countries face," the Nigerian said."A dying WTO does not serve the interests of any country."Load-Date: January 20, 2021End of Document

WHO, in search of the origin of Covid-19CE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 8, 2021 MondayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 499 wordsBodyMore than a year after the first recorded case of Covid-19, it is still inconclusive where and how patient zero appeared, but World Health Organization research in China is moving towards a possible response.Knowing the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is key to preventing a new health emergency with this magnitude that has kept the whole world for months in an unprecedented health, social and economic crisis. That is why WHO sent a team of 14 international experts to Wuhan, where the first contagion was recorded, to try to determine the origin of the coronavirus.The research has not been easy for scientists to be issued with the strong restrictions and controls of the Chinese socialist government, which has even closed the door to the international press and jealously safeguards information on such research.Despite government control, WHO experts have already been at a key point in the research, Huanan Market in Wuhan. At the beginning of the pandemic it had been presumed to be the place where the virus had jumped from animals to humans, as it was a market where all kinds of species are marketed. However, experts believe that this market only served as a massive transmission space and not exactly where the virus came from.A second important visit was made by the researchers to the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Here, the international comitiva was received by renowned Dr. Shi Zhengli, who assured that tests were done to rule out a leak related to the appearance of the new coronavirus. This institute is also key, because the scientists who work there investigate the different strains of coronavirus; it was even the center of tense statements between the Chinese and U.S. governments, as US representative Donald Trump claimed that the virus had escaped from this lab.It took more than a year for WHO's group of researchers to enter Chinese territory in the face of a refusal by the WHO government, and, according to some experts, this lengthy delay in conducting investigations could prevent relevant data from being obtained to understand the origin of the pandemic. However, not everything is lost and WHO experts have found data that had not been previously published thanks to information shared by Chinese scientists, field research and interviews with those affected in key areas, said Peter Daszack, one of the scientists who is part of this entourage of the health organization.Although so far there is no conclusive resolution on the origin of SARS-CoV-2, the expert group's research in China continues and does not rule out the possibility that the new coronavirus has left a laboratory, as well as other theories that remain in force in the absence of accuracy in knowing the origin of the virus. The Chinese government is very uncomfortable with this research, but it is a big step that it accepted an exploration to determine the origin of the pandemic and thereby give confidence to the world's population not to repeat something similar to a new strain.Load-Date: February 9, 2021End of Document

Does Wuhan's lab belong to Glaxo?CE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 21, 2021 ThursdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1149 wordsBodyMEXICO CITY.The theory that Wuhan's lab where the new coronavirus allegedly originated belongs to glaxo, which would be part of a chain of connections ranging from pharmaceutical company Pfizer to investment fund manager BlackRock to Microsoft and Bill Gates, was shared at least 1,500 times in Spanish since November 29 on social media. The Wuhan Institute of Virology has no relation to Glaxo, but is owned by the Chinese government. Similarly, although Glaxo and Pfizer sealed a business alliance, they remain competitors."The world is a handkerchief!! Wuhan's Chinese biological laboratory actually belongs to GLAXO which by chance owns PFIZER, which manages the finances of black ROCK which by chance manages the finances of the Open Society of SOROS who by chance takes care of the interests of the Frenchman AXA whose German company WINTERTHUR built the Chinese laboratory accidentally purchased by the Aleman ALLIANZ and who by It happens to have as a large shareholder VANGUARD shareholder of BLACK ROCK that controls THE CENTRAL BANKS and manages 1/3 of the WORLD INVESTMENT CAPITAL which by chance is a large shareholder of MICROSOFT and GATES which is a shareholder of PFIZER and currently the first sponsor of WHO!!! Chances of life... Follow the money," says the text shared by users on Facebook (1, 2).   Screenshot of a Facebook post, made on December 4, 2020 The same text also circulates on Twitter and the first record found of it is in this Facebook post in Italian, on November 12, attributed to a certain "Giuseppe Renda".A first search by this name on Google found a Pfizer employee in Italy, according to his LinkedIn profile. AFP Factual contacted Renda without getting a response to the date of publication of this article.Wuhan Institute of Virology Research on ownership of the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) showed no relationship with Glaxo. According to this note from the 2017 journal Nature, the creation of the WIV P4 laboratory, at the center of the controversy since the onset of the coronavirus crisis, was approved in 2003 by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and built with the help of the French International Center for InfectiousOlogy Research (CIRI). The WIV P4 opened in 2015.Numerous theories claim that the virus was created on the P4 of the WIV, or that it "escaped" it. Donald Trump himself said in April "having evidence" that the pandemic originated at that institute, but did not introduce them.AFP Factual has already verified claims that the virus was created in a laboratory or manufactured with human intervention.Both in the inauguration registers and on the pages (1) of corporate information on the WIV website there is no mention of the participation of any foreign company. The Institute depends on cas, which in turn depends on the Chinese government.A search of the Open Society Foundations website, founded by George Soros, shows that there are no mentions of the French insurer AXA linked to monetary arrangements, just one in which it is mentioned as an example of business trials to protect their intellectual property. Also, AXA's organizational graphs do not showSoros' philanthropic organization.Winterthur Group, meanwhile, was a Swiss (non-German) insurer that was acquired by AXA in 2006. The Google search yields no results on the company's alleged construction of a laboratory in China.On the other hand, Allianz points out on its website that in China it has offices in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. There are no mentions of Wuhan or a company lab based in that country.There is also no mention of its participation in the WIV or any other centre in Wuhan on the corporate information page of the multinational Glaxo in China. Glaxo has two joint ventures in the Asian country, and is present in the cities of Shanghai, Beijing and Tianjin.Glaxo and Pfizer According to CNN Money, Pfizer is mostly controlled by The Vanguard Group, with 7.67% ownership of its shares. GlaxoSmithKline does not appear in Pfizer's shareholder list, although the Capital Research &Management; fund does. However, it only owns 0.67% of Glaxo, so the correlation that viral publications make is not correct.In December 2018, the companies merged into a joint venture by creating in 2019 the company Gsk Consumer Healthcare with the participation of both, a concrete alliance for the commercialization of pharmaceutical products such as Voltaren, Panadol and Advil. However, this was not a purchase operation by one company over the other and both remain competitors in the pharmaceutical sector.BlackRock, Pfizer, Soros and the other relationships BlackRock is the world's leading investment fund manager and, as such, holds stakes in tens of thousands of companies (including Pfizer), and has thousands of investors, including tycoon George Soros, within its multitude of portfolios.Pfizer also received money from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation's Strategic Investment Fund. The foundation invested in pharmaceuticals to expand Sayana's access, its injectable contraceptive, to developing countries. He also reported in September 2020 that he would collaborate with several of the companies working on the development of a covid-19 vaccine. However, neither the foundation nor the Gates are among Pfizer's major shareholders.The Gates Foundation is also among WHO's top contributors, representing 11.65% of the money the agency receives. However, it is not the "main sponsor", as the money contributed by the German government accounts for 12.18% of the revenue.In conclusion, there is nothing to prove that Wuhan's WIV is owned or owned by glaxo, nor is it true that it owns Pfizer. There are also no records of the linkage of winterthur and Axa insurers with the WIV. On the other hand, fund manager BlackRock, which owns part of the Pfizer shares, has the share as an investor of George Soros, as well as many other global fortunes. In addition, Bill and Melinda Gates have invested in Pfizer for the development of concrete projects but are not one of the main shareholders. Finally, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation supports WHO with funding but is not the main sponsors.   If you click on the following image you can access our galleries:  You may be interested in the following Particular Notes: The dark side of childrenLoose, in the name of the law!Dr. Alfredo Rustrián, a social fighter, died at the age of 83So was the verbal fencing between Maradona and PeléLost cell phone syndromeThe ParkMexico, the unforgettable emblem of the CityMinute to Sal Sanchez, the impossible-to-forget champion In the following video: Driver 'warns' police van, so citizens defend her    Be part of the power of technology with us.  Youtube is supported by the most popular web browsers and on Excélsior TV/Multicast we are already a million subscribers.

Worldwide Infrared Cameras Industry to 2027 - Continuous Development of Robust IR Cameras Presents OpportunitiesGlobeNewswireMarch 17, 2021 Wednesday 2:03 AM PTCopyright 2021 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: RESEARCH ANALYSIS AND REPORTSLength: 1780 wordsBodyDublin, March  17, 2021  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Infrared Cameras Market Forecast to 2027 - COVID-19 Impact and Global Analysis By Type, Component, Wavelength, and Application" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.According to this report the market is expected to reach US$ 9,055.58 million by 2027 and is likely to register a CAGR of 7.1% from 2020 to 2027.Several industries such as aerospace and defense, automotive, healthcare, and others are investing heavily in advanced technologies to strengthen their capabilities with advanced machinery and offer enhanced services to customers. The market players present in countries such as Russia, the US, and France are developing advanced infrared cameras for the global market. Rising procurement of infrared cameras by the US Army is propelling its market growth. Developing nations such as India, China, and Indonesia are strengthening their military capabilities due to rising border clashes with neighboring countries. Furthermore, the adoption of infrared cameras has increased in the automotive sector due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, in March 2020, the Chinese government planned to install temperature monitoring infrared cameras on the public transport.Furthermore, the rising defense expenditure of countries such as the US, China, and India is expected to drive the growth of the market. Additionally, the increasing number of product launches by companies such as FLIR Systems, Inc. is expected to drive the growth of the market. For instance, in April 2020, FLIR Systems, Inc. launched FLIR Ranger HDC MR high-definition medium-wave infrared (MWIR) border-security surveillance system. The system assists in countering illegal drug smuggling, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and human trafficking. Therefore, these factors are expected to drive the growth of the market.Manufacturing, automotive, semiconductor and electronics, oil & gas, mining, aviation, and other industries have witnessed a decline in their operations due to the temporary shutdown of activities. The infrared cameras market players also experienced a slowdown in the volumes because the manufacturing facilities were operating with a limited workforce. This has had a negative impact on the market. Additionally, the temporary closure has resulted in reduced procurement of infrared cameras among industries during the first quarter of 2020, and the scenario is likely to continue in the first six months of 2021.The automotive OEMs are increasingly emphasizing non-destructive testing (NDT) methods to detect flaws on a developed component or product. The use of infrared camera facilitates the auto maker to visualize defects, also reduce the cost and time for detecting defects or flaws. The functions of catalysts and electric systems of cars and motor assemblies can also be tested with the help of infrared camera systems. Moreover, several defects of multiple products and components in the automotive industry are detected through temperature changes. Therefore, various auto makers are focusing on infrared cameras to detect defects on windows and seats. This practice is foreseen to grow among the automotive industry players across the world, which would boost the infrared camera market in terms of value and volume.The introduction of advanced infrared cameras is set to generate substantial demand among the end users owing to the benefits of enhanced sensing and imaging capabilities. As the advantages of infrared cameras over traditional systems or products have been attracting end users, the infrared camera manufacturers are continuously upgrading their products for end users can procure advanced IR cameras. This factor is foreseen to bolster the growth of the infrared cameras market.Swift advancements pertaining to technologies, various initiatives by governments, and growing number of military systems manufacturing industries are expected to drive the market growth in APAC. APAC is expected to register substantial growth rate in the infrared cameras market during the forecast period owing to the factors such as increasing military expenditure, rising territorial conflicts, and growing industrialization. APAC countries have been investing extensively in defense owing to increased tensions between neighboring countries. According to the SIPRI, in 2019, China's defense budget was ~US$ 261 billion, while India had a budget of US$ 71.1 billion. Furthermore, increasing automotive and healthcare industries in the region are expected to drive the market growth in the region.Reasons to Buy• Save and reduce time carrying out entry-level research by identifying the growth, size, leading players and segments in the infrared camera market.• Highlights key business priorities in order to assist companies to realign their business strategies• The key findings and recommendations highlight crucial progressive industry trends in the infrared camera market, thereby allowing players across the value chain to develop effective long-term strategies• Develop/modify business expansion plans by using substantial growth offering developed and emerging markets• Scrutinize in-depth global market trends and outlook coupled with the factors driving the market, as well as those hindering it• Enhance the decision-making process by understanding the strategies that underpin commercial interest with respect to client products, segmentation, pricing and distributionKey Topics Covered: 1.

How Huawei set up a campaign with fake social media accounts to wash up its image in EuropeCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 1, 2021 MondayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1330 wordsBodyLONDON—Edwin Vermulst, a commercial lawyer in Brussels, did not think twice before agreeing to write an article for Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant, which would be focused on criticizing a Policy of the Belgian government that threatened to exclude the company from lucrative contracts. Vermulst had worked with the company for years.After the article was published on 17 December on a Dutch website, Vermulst focused on other things. "That was the beginning and end of my participation," he said.Vermulst had no idea that the article would come to life of its own. A short time later it became part of a covert campaign in Belgium on behalf of Huawei and related to 5G networks, the high-speed wireless technology that is at the center of a geopolitical dispute between the United States and China.At first, according to Graphika, a research company that studies misinformation and fake social media accounts, at least 14 Twitter accounts that pretended to belong to writers, academics and telecommunications experts, shared articles by Vermulst and many others criticizing the Belgian bill, which would limit "high-risk" providers like Huawei to develop the country's 5G system. Pro Huawei accounts used computer-generated profile images, a signal of non-authentic activity.Huawei officials then retwent publications of fake accounts, giving articles an even broader reach that reached lawmakers, journalists and business leaders. Kevin Liu, President of Communications and Public Affairs at Huawei in Western Europe, who has a verified Twitter account with 1.1 million followers, shared 60 fake account posts for three weeks in December, according to Graphika. Huawei's official account in Europe, with more than 5 million followers, did so 47 times.The initiative is an indication of a new shift in social media manipulation, said Ben Nimmo, a Graphika researcher who helped spot the campaign. Tactics that used to be used for government targets—such as Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election—are being adapted to achieve corporate goals."It's about business rather than politics," Nimmo said. "This is not one country attacking another. It seems like an operation to promote the interests of a large multinational against a European state."Graphika, who supported investigations by the U.S. Senate Select Commission on Intelligence on Russian misinformation, said there was insufficient evidence to identify who was behind the pro-Huawei operation.Huawei said in a statement that it had initiated an internal investigation "to try to find out exactly what happened and determine if there has been any inappropriate behavior.""Huawei has clear social media policies, based on international best practices, and we take seriously any indication that they have not been implemented," the company said. "We have been informed about some online activities and social media that suggest that we have not complied with these policies and our comprehensive values of openness, honesty and transparency."Twitter said it had deleted the fake accounts after Graphika alerted about the campaign on December 30."Platform manipulation is strictly prohibited under Twitter rules," the company said via a statement. "As long as we have clear evidence, we will take action on the accounts associated with this practice, whichcould include permanent suspension."Huawei, the star of China's technology industry, has undergone a sustained campaign in the United States that seeks to prevent its equipment from being used on the world's new 5G networks. The Trump administration said the company posed a threat to national security, claiming that the Chinese government could use Huawei's communications technology for espionage. Huawei has strongly denied these accusations.Belgium, the headquarters of the European Union and NATO, illustrates the risk facing Huawei in Europe, the company's largest market outside China. Until now, Huawei and Chinese company ZTE had dominated Belgium's telecommunications equipment market, according to Strand Consult, a research firm. But as the Belgian government has considered new restrictions, the country's wireless network operators have been taking 5G agreements to rival companies."They fear this might extend to other parts of the world," said John Strand, founder of Strand Consult, which works with many wireless network companies.Nimmo stated that the pro Huawei initiative in Belgium had been awkwardly implemented as well as being obvious. However, he said it showed how clandestine internet campaigns attempt to "wash" seemingly legitimate materials such as Vermulst's article through a web of websites and fake social media accounts to give them an air of impartiality and authenticity.Graphika discovered the pro-Huawei campaign after detecting suspicious posts about Belgium's policies around 5G on Twitter accounts that had already been used in a previous operation on behalf of China. Belgian magazine Knack and Michiel van Hulten, director of Transparency International in Brussels, also identified suspicious actions to disseminate pro Huawei information.The 14 fake accounts amplified by Huawei officials disseminated positive articles about the company and negative opinions on Belgium's policy around 5G. The three-week campaign was reportedly linked to the 30 December deadline in Belgium to review this policy.For twitter's casual user, fake accounts seemed legitimate. They had insipid profile pictures along with professional information. Many of them had more than a thousand followers.But by inspecting in more detail, the researchers identified problems in the accounts. Many of his followers appeared to be bots. In addition, the images had characteristics typical of an artificial intelligence software, that is, they are perfectly centered photographs but with small imperfections, such as asymmetric glasses. Online businesses sell such photos of fake people, which help avoid the risk of detection that comes with using images of real people.Fake accounts shared articles and opinions from different online publications, including EU Reporter, which publishes government news on its own website and from affiliates such as London Globe and New York Globe."If the Belgian government excludes specific suppliers, who will pay for it?" said the headliner published on different EU Reporter websites.Colin Stevens, editor of the US Reporter, said in an email that he "had no knowledge of any fake Twitter account that promoted our articles." Stevens said Huawei had paid EU Reporter to publish opinion articles in the past, but that they had always been marked with warnings. Stories about the 5G network in Belgium were assigned independently without Huawei's involvement, he said."EU Reporter would never bevoluntarily part of a disinformation campaign," Stevens said.In some cases, the researchers found articles such as that of Huawei-funded Vermulst, which included warnings about the financial agreement. Other critical articles in the 5G network policy appeared on websites that accept user-generated content without reviewing it, alongside images of authors equal to those generated by computer that were on twitter's fake profiles.In Belgium, the campaign seemed to have little effect beyond attracting unwanted attention to Huawei's lobbying efforts. Lawmakers have shown no sign of curbing plans to limit Huawei's access to 5G networks. The bill must now be considered by the country's Parliament.Vermulst, the commercial lawyer, said he hadn't heard about the fake social media account campaign until he was contacted for this article. And although she called the initiative "dumb" and "stupid," she hopes to continue working for Huawei."Lawyers are paid to give legal opinions," he said. "Once that article is in the public domain, anyone can do with it whatever they want."READ ON:Huawei's methods: Punishes its expatriate Chinese employees for marrying a European or applying for citizenshipLoad-Date: February 2, 2021End of Document

In smaller letters, "Usa occupied the first place for decades".It was the main focus of other American financial vehicles, such as CNBC, with the assessment that President Xi Jinping, who opens the World Economic Forum on Monday, "is positioning China as the indispensable economy."For the WSJ, the data show that "the pandemic accentuates the shift in the center of gravity of the global economy" to Asia. It cites growing investments by Walmart, Tesla and Disney in China, in counter to four years of pressure from the White House for U.S. companies to leave the country.Un data also show that new foreign investment has halved in Brazil, in line with other major economies in Latin America -- with the exception of Mexico, down less than 10 percent.    BIDEN &AMLO;    The Council on Foreign Relations even compared the President of Mexico to a "dog" growling for the U.S. in the New York Times, but the heavy play of the Washington lobbies did not work and Joe Biden called Andrés Manuel López Obrador.They addressed immigration and trade, according to agencies, with the American promising to review his country's "draconian" policies. "Mexico is the largest trading partner in the U.S." today, Bloomberg explained.    LOST IN TRANSLATION    The attacks on AMLO in Washington intensified after he demanded and obtained the return of a former Mexican defense minister arrested at the U.S. airport for alleged ly connecting to trafficking.Mexican and American websites, such as Vice, had access to evidence and pointed to primary translation errors by U.S. investigators at the central points of the indictment, and inconsistency in the former minister's own assignment of messages.    'AMERICA FIRST' 2    The WSJ reported that Biden on Monday detailed his "Buy American Product" proposal, which is being "viewed with suspicion by other countries."

However, many customers are now wondering about the security risks associated with this brand. This article is designed to examine the various security features of Huawei's mobile phones, but also to shed light on the entire debate surrounding Huawei Technologies, the Chinese mobile phone giant. Huawei was ranked as the third best-known smart phone manufacturer in the world.What about the security of Huawei smart phones?Security and sanctions are essentially the two concerns inherent in Huawei smart phones and equipment. Basically, the conflict refers more to the Huawei kit installed on the networks than to mobile phones, tablets and other Huawei devices. In fact, there is no evidence to show that Huawei's smart phones represent security holes compared to other brands. However, the fact that the Huawei Company is under the control of the Chinese government makes many people think that these devices are not safe.Huawei smart phoneHuawei smart phones are designed under the open source version of Android. The brand continues to market its devices under this operating system even after being forced to stop collaborating with US companies such as Google. Many people consider that Android mobile phones are less secure than iOS. This is mainly due to the fact that the applications presented in their stores do not necessarily comply with the security standards.However, with the launch of p30 lite smart phone, Huawei began to regaining the faith and chase the success. Here you can see the completeHuawei p30 lite review.The best  Good quality cameraSpectacular designGenerous storageComplete connectivity.Worst  Very poor soundFast  little  chargeMaterials and assemblyEMUI and its apps with a lot of presence.Does it make sense to buy a Huawei mobile phone?If potential buyers are reluctant to buy a Huawei-branded mobile phone, it's not necessarily because of all this national security controversy, even if the conflict between China and the United States may influence public opinion. In fact, the right question is that since Huawei smart phones seem quite safe and reliable than other phones, it would be wise to buy them. Read more aboutUsb power adapter.ApplicationsThe operating system of Huawei devices is available in two versions, depending on the terminal used. Users of previous models or those who bought models with a new version can access Google applications as well as Google Play. The android version that Huawei uses on its devices is open source, so the United States cannot ban Huawei from using it. Thus, the Chinese company can continue to manufacture its mobile phones using the free version of Android without being subject to any restrictions.ConclusionNo confirmation has been formally announced proving that Huawei's smart phones are less secure and less reliable than those of rivals. However, the Chinese mobile phone brand is still involved in the trade dispute with the United States. Huawei smart phones remain reliable for the middle class. The question of buying a Huawei is not synonymous with recklessness.Tags:,EnglishLoad-Date: March 10, 2021End of Document

Sweden's Ericsson Says China Drives Growth in 2020; Warns of Adverse Impact from Regulatory BansMT Newswires Live Briefs PROFebruary 1, 2021 Monday 9:26 PM ESTCopyright 2021 MT Newswires All Rights ReservedLength: 195 wordsBody Swedish telecommunications company Ericsson said China contributed to its growth in 2020, particularly in the northeast Asia market, but warned that bans against Chinese vendors from Sweden's 5G network may have a negative impact on its operations in China."The Swedish telecom regulator's decision to exclude Chinese vendors from 5G networks may create exposure for our operations in China," the company said in its full-year earnings report released Friday.Late last year, the Swedish government banned Chinese telecommunications companies Huawei Technologies and ZTE (HKG:0763, SHE:000063) from its 5G networks, citing national security concerns."China is one of the greatest threats to Sweden. The Chinese state carries out cyber espionage in order to promote its own economic development and to develop its military capability... This is something we have to take into account as the 5G network is being built," Klas Friberg, head of Sweden's security services, said in an earlier statement.Most recently, Ericsson said China is now the largest 5G market in the world with more than 100 million subscribers.Price (HKD): $22.90, Change: $0.20, Percent Change: +0.88%Load-Date: February 1, 2021End of Document

Taiwan.- US ambassador to the UN holds a video conference with Taiwan's president after cancelling her tripCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 14, 2021 ThursdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 441 wordsBody    MADRID, 14 (EUROPA PRESS)   U.S. permanent representative to the United Nations, Kelly Craft, held a video conference with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing Wen after cancelling her trip to the island due to the transition process in the US country to take office on January 20 from President-elect Joe Biden.   "It is a great privilege to speak with President Tsai today. We have discussed the many ways Taiwan is a model for the world, as it has demonstrated in its fight against COVID-19 and how much Taiwan has to offer in the fields of health, technology and innovative science," Craft said through his twitter social media account.   "Unfortunately, Taiwan cannot share these successes in UN rooms, including the World Health Assembly, as a result of China's obstruction," he said. "If the pandemic has taught us anything, it is that more information and more transparency are part of the response," he added.   Craft has also assured that he has "made clear" to Tsai that "America is on Taiwan's side and always will be, as friends and partners, shoulder to shoulder as pillars of democracy."   Taiwan Presidency spokesman Xavier Chang noted in a statement that Cfrat and Tsai have addressed a number of issues, including the island's participation in international organizations, strengthening bilateral cooperation, democracy and student exchanges, as collected by the German news agency DPA.   Craft was scheduled to travel to Taiwan on Wednesday and stay on the island until Friday, during which time he was meeting Tsai and Taiwanese Foreign Minister Joseph Wu. Taiwan has said it "understands and respects" Washington's decision.   The Chinese government stressed last week that it "strongly opposes" Craft's visit, while reiterated that the island "is an inalienable part of Chinese territory." "U.S. actions seriously violate the 'one China' principle and the three Sino-American joint communiqués," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said.   He also charged against "a small number of anti-Chinese politicians within the Trump Administration" that drive such initiatives, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and stated that this group of politicians would be "carrying out the ultimate madness, unscrupulously using what remains in mandate to deliberately undermine bilateral relations and benefit their own personal interests."   The Chinese government rejected on 2 January the Taiwanese authorities' latest offer of dialogue to resolve the island's historic dispute over the status of the island, which China claims as its own even though its policy makers maintain that it exists in a regime of self-government.Load-Date: January 15, 2021End of Document

Our goal is to implement our new policy framework in a way that helps this promising field advance, while making sure that we address issues that can put patients at risk.

The soft power of Asian influence on American cultureBadger Herald: University of Wisconsin - MadisonJanuary 27, 2021 WednesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2021 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: ARTSETC; Pg. 1Length: 866 wordsByline: Veronica KuffelBodyIn the past few years, anime has made a resurgence in American culture. Those who remember watching Naruto on Cartoon Network can now experience it on many different streaming sites and it's a trending genre among adolescents. But what anime watchers and their counterparts fail to realize is their reach is so much broader than cartoons.The three Asian powerhouses of China, Japan and the Koreas have permeated U.S. entertainment and culture through the effects of "soft power." Unlike the aggressive militant or economic tactics of hard power, soft power has a deeper focus on culture.This can include arts and entertainment, which in America's case, we've seen Japanese anime influence American cartoons, K-pop top music charts and Chinese collaborations with Hollywood. With that in mind, here are a few examples of Asia's impact on popular American entertainment.How COVID-19 is changing our era with quarantine online cultureI think we can officially say that we've hit a new era in human culture, and it's that of the Read...K-Pop and DramasWhat may have started as the meme of "Gangnam Style" has emerged as a profitable market in America. K-pop has topped music charts and awards shows time and time again with artists like BTS and Blackpink.BTS was No. 1 on the Billboard Music Top 100 for their single, "Dynamite" for three consecutive weeks by the end of 2020 - you heard it everywhere. They've been on famous talk shows, acted for American advertising and even performed at a few award shows, including the VMAs.It stands to reason K-pop is getting more popular every week in the U.S., and K-dramas are making an appearance as well. When it was in business, Korean-owned production company DramaFever developed dramas geared toward Korean-Americans. To the shock of its creators, 85% of viewers did not identify as Asian.Not only is there emerging Asian influence in American music, but in visual entertainment, too.Japanese Anime (and inspired shows)Anime in America started in the 1960s with "Astroboy" and rose to popularity with shows like "Sailor Moon," "Dragon Ball Z" and the "Pokemon" series. Shonen Jump is a popular producer of anime, starting from magazines in the mid-20th century to its shows and movies of today.Their most famous trifecta of shows includes "Bleach," "One Piece" and "Naruto", which all found tremendous success on U.S. American children's networks like Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon, which often played reruns of these and many more anime shows from Japan.Farmers across US are suffering because of Trump's trade war with ChinaMontana farmer Robert Henry has been receiving subsidies for his farm from the federal government as compensation for money lost Read...Many cartoons developed by American animators featured anime-like drawings and storylines. "Avatar: The Last Airbender" has fantasy lands based on real Asian nations, references to Asian schools of thought, and facial drawings and body movements based in anime style.Other shows exhibit comic relief commonly drawn in anime, like "Teen Titans" and "Steven Universe." But while anime has influenced countless American shows in their animation and plot, one country both collaborates and sometimes restricts a majority of the film industry.China and HollywoodIn the early 2000s, China allowed more foreign films for distribution and became a big market for Hollywood. This still isn't a big number, but they currently allow 34 foreign films in the country.And yet many production companies have had to work with the Chinese government to redevelop films for viewing. The Chinese Communist Party must approve movies before they are available for the country's audiences, which can come to be a large cost for companies to alter their films. This has especially affected Disney, one of the most powerful companies in the world, and its production within the nation.There has been much controversy over Disney's LGBTQ+ representation in its films, and part of this is due to Chinese restrictions. Because a small population of the country approves of homosexuality and the CCP is against it, Disney has had to add subtle references which can easily be taken out when exported to China.China has also caused Disney to change some films for political reasons. While Marvel Comics wrote the monk in "Doctor Strange" to be Tibetan, the CCP refuses to acknowledge Tibet as an independent nation, so they were forced to make the "Ancient One" into a white woman played by Tilda Swinton.56th Chicago International Film Festival is available to UW studentsFounded in 1964, the Chicago International Film Festival is the longest-running film festival in North America. The festival has sought Read...If the film industry wants to maximize profit, companies are forced to comply with CCP Censorship Board's restrictions. And according to CNET, modern Hollywood prioritizes the Chinese box office over domestic because China seems to severely impact the revenue of a film.Each year, Asian powerhouses gain more control over U.S. entertainment. Through the effects of slow power, nations like Korea, Japan and China may one day become the trendsetters of not just American culture, but global culture as well.Load-Date: January 28, 2021End of Document

Undeterred by US Sanctions, China Expected to Continue Development in Disputed Asian Sea ASEAN TribuneJanuary 18, 2021 MondayCopyright 2021 ASEAN Tribune All Rights ReservedLength: 252 wordsBody 18 January 2021 (Voice of America) TAIPEI - U.S. curbs against Chinese officials and companies suspected of helping Beijing extend its reach in a disputed, resource-rich Asian sea will do little to reduce China's maritime influence and could indirectly increase it, analysts believe.The government of outgoing U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday announced a ban on travel to the United States by officials in the military, the ruling Communist Party and major state-owned enterprises. Washington believes they have used coercion on countries with claims to the 3.5 million-square-kilometer South China Sea.In December the U.S. government placed 60 Chinese companies, including offshore oil giant CNOOC, on a trade blacklist that stops them from receiving certain types of American technology. Last week Washington barred American investors from holding shares in nine Chinese firms with suspected ties to The People's Liberation Army, including the world's third biggest smartphone developer, Xiaomi.These penalties, along with others that the Trump administration has used to stop Chinese maritime activities, will hardly dislodge Beijing from the disputed sea, scholars say. They say the targeted people and companies can keep drilling for oil, supplying the military and building infrastructure in the tropical waterway.  and lt;https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/sourced/s3/2020-12/2019-02-01T060629Z_684683033_RC15D73FC600_RTRMADP_3_CHINA-OIL-EXPLORATION.JPG?itok=p7VeO3B_ and gt;Load-Date: January 19, 2021End of Document

SEN. CRUZ: PRESIDENT BIDEN'S EARLY POLICIES ARE RADICAL, EXTREME, AND DIVISIVEStates News ServiceFebruary 1, 2021 MondayCopyright 2021 States News ServiceLength: 877 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, D.C BodyThe following information was released by Texas Senator Ted Cruz:U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) on Friday joined 'The Michael Berry Show,' 'The Lars Larson Show,' 'The Sean Hannity Show,' and 'The Rick Roberts Show' to discuss Team Biden's rush to embrace the worst elements of the Chinese Communist Party, and President Biden's job-killing executive orders. Excerpts are included below.LISTEN: Cruz on Michael Berry: Biden's Nominees Are Showing a Pattern of Openly Embracing Communist ChinaOn the Democrat Party's disturbing embrace of China, Sen. Cruz said:"I think it is more of an ideological commitment. Today's Democratic Party is a party that loves communist China. [...] Think of the donors who fund them [like] Big Tech. Big Tech is the China lobby. They make a lot of money in China. They want to make more money in China. They don't want to piss off the Chinese government. So Big Tech pulls the strings for today's Democrats. [...] Hollywood right now lets the Chinese communist government edit and censor their moviesthey do that today. Hollywood pulls the strings and dictates what Democrats do. So, what we've been seeing the last two weeks is a really disturbing pattern among Joe Biden nomineesthat one after the other after the other is telegraphing an embrace of China." (Sen. Cruz, The Michael Berry Show, 1/29/21)On how President Biden's executive actions benefit China, Sen. Cruz said:"Joe Biden knows about China. [...] We're seeing with the Biden administration, a major, major pivot towards an embrace of communist China. It's one of the reasons why in the very first week in office, Joe Biden signed an executive order reentering the Paris Climate Deal. What does that do? That threatens millions of jobs here in the United States and it benefits China. China is a massive polluter and the Paris Climate Deal doesn't require China to substantially rein in its pollution. It just kills jobs in America. That's one of the great hypocrisies of the Democratic climate agendait doesn't actually make the environment any cleaner." (Sen. Cruz, The Rick Roberts Show, 1/29/21)LISTEN: Cruz on the Rick Roberts Show Discusses Pres. Biden's Nominees, Impeachment, China, and GameStopOn President Biden's job-killing executive orders, Sen. Cruz said:"He [President Biden] began with a series of just radical, extreme, and divisive policieshis cabinet nominees are behaving that way, Senate Democrats are behaving that way, and House Democrats are behaving that way. One of the examples: All the people's jobs who are being eliminatedone of the first things he did, [...] was end the Keystone Pipeline11,000 jobs disappeared, literally with the stroke of a pen. Eight thousand union jobs just went away. And he decided, 'You don't get a job. Your job is ended,' because they want to shut down the Keystone Pipeline. [...] There is just an arrogancethey look down on you. If you don't do what they want you to do then they're perfectly prepared to blow up your job, your livelihood, and your ability to provide for your kids. Unfortunately, I think that arrogant condescension is only going to get worse over the next two years and the next four years." (Sen. Cruz, The Michael Berry Show, 1/29/21)On how Democrats' energy policy threatens America's energy security Sen. Cruz said:"You look at what Joe Biden has done in just a couple of weeks, and it has dramatically weakened U.S. energy production. It has destroyed jobs here at home. The people who are getting rich on it are Vladimir Putin, Iran, the Middle East. [...] Basically, the Democrats' brilliant idea [is] to try to destroy energy independence here at home, destroy jobs here at home, and make us more dependent on energy from our enemieswhich pollutes the environment more and gives them [Iran] billions of dollars to use to try to kill Americans." (Sen. Cruz, The Sean Hannity Show, 1/29/21)LISTEN: Cruz on Hannity Radio: The Biden Admin Is Rushing to Embrace Communist ChinaOn his efforts to fight for the American people and stand against Democrats' radical policies, Sen. Cruz said:"I am going to be leading the fight to stop bad policies that destroy jobs in America, that take away freedom in America, that undermine our security, [and] that undermine our constitutional rights. In the long term, we need to make the case to the American people why these policies are so harmful. Here's the good news: Politics has a natural pendulum sense to itit tends to go one direction, it goes too far, and then it goes back the other direction. The far Left is driving the train right now. [...] We need to make the case to the American people that commonsense conservative ideas work, that free markets work, [and] that socialism is a train wreck and it doesn't work. I think if we win the hearts and minds of the American people as happy warriors, not the kind of angry, shrill, [and] hysterical voices of rage on the left but instead as happy warriors defending libertyI think that's the path to pull the country back from the damage we're about to see over the next couple of years."

Unveil a social media influence campaign on Huawei's behalfCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 1, 2021 MondayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1322 wordsBodyBy Adam Satariano, The New York TimesEdwin Vermulst, a commercial lawyer in Brussels, did not think twice before agreeing to write an article for Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant, which would be focused on criticizing a Belgian government policy that threatened to exclude the company from lucrative contracts. Vermulst had worked with the company for years.After the article was published on 17 December on a Dutch website, Vermulst focused on other things. "That was the beginning and end of my participation," he said.Vermulst had no idea that the article would come to life of its own.  A short time later it became part of a covert campaign in Belgium on behalf of Huawei and related to 5G networks, the high-speed wireless technology that is at the center of a geopolitical dispute between the United States and China.At first, according to Graphika, a research company that studies misinformation and fake social media accounts, at least 14 Twitter accounts that pretended to belong to writers, academics and telecommunications experts, shared articles by Vermulst and many others criticizing the Belgian bill, which would limit "high-risk" providers like Huawei to develop the country's 5G system. Pro Huawei accounts used computer-generated profile images, a signal of non-authentic activity.Huawei officials then retwent publications of fake accounts, giving articles an even broader reach that reached lawmakers, journalists and business leaders. Kevin Liu, President of Communications and Public Affairs at Huawei in Western Europe, who has a verified Twitter account with 1.1 million followers, shared 60 fake account posts for three weeks in December, according to Graphika. Huawei's official account in Europe, with more than 5 million followers, did so 47 times.The initiative is an indication of a new shift in social media manipulation,said Ben Nimmo, a Graphika researcher who helped spot the campaign. Tactics that used to be used for government targets—such as Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election—are being adapted to achieve corporate goals."It's about business rather than politics," Nimmo said. "This is not one country attacking another. It seems like an operation to promote the interests of a large multinational against a European state."Graphika, who supported investigations by the U.S. Senate Select Commission on Intelligence on Russian misinformation, said there was insufficient evidence to identify who was behind the pro-Huawei operation.Huawei said in a statement that it had initiated an internal investigation "to try to find out exactly what happened and determine if there has been any inappropriate behavior.""Huawei has clear social media policies, based on international best practices, and we take seriously any indication that they have not been implemented," the company said.  We have been informed about some online activities and social media that suggest the possibility that we have not complied with these policies and our comprehensive values of openness, honesty and transparency."Twitter acted on fake accountsTwitter said it had deleted the fake accounts after Graphika alerted about the campaign on December 30."Platform manipulation is strictly prohibited under Twitter rules," said thecompany through a statement. "As long as we have clear evidence, we will take action on the accounts associated with this practice, which may include permanent suspension."Huawei, the star of China's technology industry, has undergone a sustained campaign in the United States that seeks to prevent its equipment from being used on the world's new 5G networks. The Trump administration said the company posed a threat to national security, claiming that the Chinese government could use Huawei's communications technology for espionage. Huawei has strongly denied these accusations.Belgium, the headquarters of the European Union and NATO, illustrates the risk facing Huawei in Europe, the company's largest market outside China. Until now, Huawei and Chinese company ZTE had dominated Belgium's telecommunications equipment market, according to Strand Consult, a research firm. But as the Belgian government has considered new restrictions, the country's wireless network operators have been taking 5G agreements to rival companies."They fear this might extend to other parts of the world," said John Strand, founder of Strand Consult, which works with many wireless network companies.Nimmo stated that the pro Huawei initiative in Belgium had been awkwardly implemented as well as being obvious. However, he said it showed how clandestine internet campaigns attempt to "wash" seemingly legitimate materials such as Vermulst's article through a web of websites and fake social media accounts to give them an air of impartiality and authenticity.Graphika discovered the pro-Huawei campaign after detecting suspicious posts about Belgium's policies around 5G on Twitter accounts that had already been used in a previous operation on behalf of China. Belgian magazine Knack and Michiel van Hulten, director of Transparency International in Brussels, also identified suspicious actions to disseminate pro Huawei information.The 14 false accounts amplified by Huawei officials disseminated positive articles about the company and negative opinions on Belgium's policy around 5G.Lto a three-week campaign, apparently linked to the 30 December deadline in Belgium to review that policy.For twitter's casual user, fake accounts seemed legitimate. They had insipid profile pictures along with professional information. Many of them had more than a thousand followers.But by inspecting in more detail, the researchers identified problems in the accounts. Many of his followers appeared to be bots. In addition, the images had characteristics typical of an artificial intelligence software, that is, they are perfectly centered photographs but with small imperfections, such as asymmetric glasses. Online businesses sell such photos of fake people, which help avoid the risk of detection that comes with using images of real people.Fake accounts shared articles and opinions from different online publications, including EU Reporter, which publishes government news on its own website and from affiliates such as London Globe and New York Globe."If the Belgian government excludes specific suppliers, who will pay for it?" said the headliner published on different EU Reporter websites.Colin Stevens, editor of the US Reporter, said in an email that he "had no knowledge of any fake Twitter account that promoted our articles." Stevens said Huawei hadpaid eu Reporter to publish opinion articles in the past, but they had always been marked with warnings. Stories about the 5G network in Belgium were assigned independently without Huawei's involvement, he said."EU Reporter would never voluntarily be part of a disinformation campaign," Stevens said.In some cases, the researchers found articles such as that of Huawei-funded Vermulst, which included warnings about the financial agreement.  Other critical articles in the 5G network policy appeared on websites that accept user-generated content without reviewing it, alongside images of authors equal to those generated by computer that were on twitter's fake profiles.In Belgium, the campaign seemed to have little effect beyond attracting unwanted attention to Huawei's lobbying efforts. Lawmakers have shown no sign of curbing plans to limit Huawei's access to 5G networks. The bill must now be considered by the country's Parliament.Vermulst, the commercial lawyer, said he hadn't heard about the fake social media account campaign until he was contacted for this article. And although she called the initiative "dumb" and "stupid," she hopes to continue working for Huawei."Lawyers are paid to give legal opinions," he said. "Once that article is in the public domain, anyone can do with it whatever they want." (I)Load-Date: February 2, 2021End of Document

Jack Ma’s Brief Video Chat Prompts a $58 Billion Sigh of ReliefCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 20, 2021 WednesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 862 wordsBody(Bloomberg) -- He appeared for less than a minute and said nothing about the Chinese government clampdown that had left his business empire in crisis.But for investors who’d been waiting months to catch a glimpse of Jack Ma, the entrepreneur’s participation in a live-streamed video conference on Wednesday was enough to trigger a $58 billion sigh of relief. That’s how much Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s market value soared after a clip of Ma speaking to a group of teachers began circulating online -- his first public comments since disappearing from view late last year.Much about the future of China’s most famous businessman remains unclear. Yet analysts said Wednesday’s video was a sign that worst-case scenarios -- such as jail time for Ma or a government takeover of his companies –- are probably now off the table. It’s unlikely Ma would have participated in the event without at least tacit approval from Beijing; state-run media including the Global Times were among outlets that posted snippets of his talk or wrote stories about his appearance.“There’s still a lot of uncertainty on regulators’ next moves, but this does mean the status of Jack Ma is much better than a lot of people speculated,” said Fang Kecheng, a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.Ma’s talk focused on philanthropic issues including the importance of narrowing income disparities and reviving China’s countryside, two big priorities for Xi Jinping’s Communist Party. While far from a mea culpa, the comments offered a stark contrast to Ma’s last public remarks in October, when the billionaire launched into an unusually strong rebuke of Chinese regulators and state-owned banks.Just a few days after that now-infamous speech at the Bund Summit in Shanghai, the government torpedoed Ma’s plan to take Ant Group Co. public in what would have been the world’s biggest-ever initial share sale. In the weeks that followed, authorities called for an overhaul of Ant’s business and began an antitrust probe of Alibaba.Few expect Ma’s change of tone will cause Beijing to back off its campaign to more tightly regulate Ant, Alibaba and the rest of China’s high-tech giants. But Wednesday’s market response suggests investors are beginning to price out the risk of a crackdown that would put the country’s richest entrepreneurs and most innovative companies in serious jeopardy.“Alibaba is not out of the doghouse, but at least it’s clear that the current anti-monopoly drive is not about punishing Jack Ma,” said Zhang Fushen, senior analyst at Shanghai PD Fortune Asset Management.Speculation about Ma’s whereabouts had intensified in recent weeks after it emerged that he skipped the recent taping of a Shark Tank-like TV program that he had created. Chinese authorities have in the past quietly detained billionaires that run afoul of the Communist Party.Ma’s resurfacing appeared to be carefully calibrated, according to Justin Tang, head of Asian research at United First Partners in Singapore. The video conference was part of an annual event Ma hosts to recognize rural teachers. A former English teacher himself, Ma spoke in a solemn tone about the need to create better education opportunities in China’s poorer areas.“Recently, my colleagues and I have been studying and thinking. We made a firmer resolution to devote ourselves to education philanthropy,” Ma said. “Working hard for rural revitalization and common prosperity is the responsibility for our generation of businessmen.”It was “the perfect setting for Jack to reappear in the public spotlight,” Tang said. “The backdrop sees Jack in his roots as a humble school teacher versus being a haughty entrepreneur that doesn’t know his place. The whole scene allows him to show contriteness without being scripted.”Ant, which is controlled by Ma and part-owned by Alibaba,confirmed the authenticity of the video but declined to comment further.The big question facing investors now: to what degree will Beijing keep tightening the screws on Ant, Alibaba and its peers? The early evidence suggests regulators aren’t in a hurry to let up. Just a few hours after Ma’s reappearance, China’s central bank released draft rules to curb market concentration in online payments, potentially dealing another blow to Ant and rival Tencent Holdings Ltd.The move is part of a wide-ranging campaign to rein in a generation of Chinese tech giants that Beijing views as wielding too much control over the world’s second-largest economy.Despite the regulatory overhang, Alibaba bulls at firms including Amber Hill Capital Ltd. and Pegasus Fund Managers Ltd. said easing concerns over Ma’s status might be enough to lift shares of the e-commerce company back toward its record high in October. That would imply a gain of about 15% in the Hong Kong-listed shares from their close on Wednesday.Mitchell Green, a founding partner of Lead Edge Capital who holds shares of Alibaba, expects Ma to focus primarily on charity work going forward, a shift that began a few years ago. Green said he’s still optimistic about the long-term prospects for both Alibaba and Ant. “Both are very important to China’s economy and its people,” he said.Load-Date: January 21, 2021End of Document

Enthusiasm returns on Wall Street as US Treasury bond yields recedCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 9, 2021 TuesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 453 wordsBodyInvestors begin to look again at equities after U.S. Treasury bond yields give way. Since the Fed, they have insisted that market players maintain current monetary policies, so they do not plan to raise rates. All this amid the concerns that have been raised in the face of possible upward pressures that could be in the world's main economy.Also, strategists are seeing with some optimism the progress that the US Congress is taking in approving the fiscal stimulus package pushed by President Joe Biden's Democratic government, which will make their country one of the main drivers of the global economic recovery.In this way, Wall Street futures operate with advances, especially the Nasdaq that could leave behind the crash sessions it has experienced following the massive sale of technology stocks when Treasury bond yields were steeped.The market notes that U.S. government tax measures could continue to drive technology companies with the development of e-commerce, software, entertainment.In terms of debt, the 10-year Treasury bond reached 1.53% in the early hours of the day and the 30-year-old reached 2.25%. Operators mention that the leap in U.S. debt securities is due to inflationary pressures in the economy resulting from government stimulus.While in Europe the main indicators started on Tuesday with profit. Old Continent stocks were also pressured by Treasury bonds but falls in the region's tech roles suffered less.UBS European equity strategy director Nick Nelson told Reuters that "the European market is much less technology-heavy than the growth-dominated S&P 500, so higher bond yields are not as negative."European exchanges respond favourably to the cessation of increased bond yields: euro Stoxx 50 rises 0.42%, London's FTSE 100 is advancing 0.46%, Frankfurt's DAX is 0.26%, CAC 40 in Paris gains 0.21% and MADRID's IBEX 35 is steeped 0.44%.Investors' attention in Europe will be focused by the end of this week at the European Central Bank chaired by Christine Lagarde on whether the pace of buying emergency bonds will change.In Asia the session was with mixed numbers. Because of the blue ribbon was the Nikkei that advanced 0.99% supported in part by the best economic scenario projected in the United States, supporting exporting companies. Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.81%.But mainland China's CSI 300 fell sharply by 2.15% in a session marked by the Asian giant's massive stock sale. AVIC Securities analyst Zheng Zichun told the agency that "the pace of China's economic recovery slowed ... while rates have steadily increased. This combination doesn't bodse well for stocks." Market players commented that there are fears that the Chinese government will tighten its policies.Load-Date: March 10, 2021End of Document

As part of an influence campaign for HuaweiCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 31, 2021 SundayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1310 wordsBodyLONDON—Edwin Vermulst, a commercial lawyer in Brussels, did not think twice before agreeing to write an article for Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant, which would be focused on criticizing a Policy of the Belgian government that threatened to exclude the company from lucrative contracts. Vermulst had worked with the company for years.After the article was published on 17 December on a Dutch website, Vermulst focused on other things. "That was the beginning and end of my participation," he said.Vermulst had no idea that the article would come to life of its own.

Carla Vizzotti: "We take steps to clarify everything"CE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 23, 2021 TuesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1325 wordsBodyThe national government disseminated the list of sixty people vaccinated at Posadas Hospital and ten at the Ministry of Health. After a meeting between the Chief of Staff, Santiago Cafiero, and the new Minister Carla Vizzotti, it was decided to publish the names. Irregular vaccination was "a very punctual, exceptional, wrong situation and the necessary steps have been taken to clarify what happened," Vizzotti said in dialogue with C5N and stressed that "the responsibility of the national state is to give answers to justice and we are absolutely available."Almost all vaccines - no less than 700,000 - were applied by each of the districts, but the focus was on those of national jurisdiction. In the Rosada they point out that the vast majority are officials who fit the established regulations: "management and driving of the State". There are others, who do not follow this definition such as businessman Florencio Aldrey and his family, journalist Horacio Verbitsky, Eduardo Duhalde's family or some young health and economics officials.Cafiero and the minister also planned the next steps of the vaccination plan, including distributing one million doses to arrive Thursday from the Sinopharm Chinese laboratory and more vaccines managed in Moscow by presidential adviser Cecilia Nicolini. Today a protocol will be presented to transparent vaccination, with definitions of who is strategic staff and who is not. A vaccination card and access to information will be added to this based on the traceability of each application.ListsThe meeting between Cafiero and Vizzotti assessed the possibility of making public the payroll of all vaccinated people in the country, but the idea was brazen because it violated the rules regarding the confidentiality of personal data. It was then chosen to ask Posadas to make known the list of those who were vaccinated in its facilities at the request of the Ministry of Health. In total, in the nearly two months since the first doses arrived - 24 December - 70 people were vaccinated outside the normal circuit, which is vaccination from each district, i.e. from the provinces and CABA.Most of the list is persons who are covered by the regulations set out in resolution 2883 of the Ministry of Health whose title is clear: "Strategic Plan of Vaccination against Covid-19 in the Argentine Republic". The Annex identifies those who take precedence and there is a specific section on the administration of the State: "any person who develops management and/or driving functions and strategic functions necessary for the proper functioning of the State, as well as persons at risk of infection or transmission".The text leaves room to discuss who enters that definition, but part of the payroll seems logical: the President, his spokesman, the chancellor, secretaries of the presidency, the photographer of the trip to Mexico, the Minister of Economy, the ambassador to Brazil, Daniel Scioli, his peer in Paraguay, Domingo Peppo, the debt negotiator, Sergio Chodos. There are 22 officials from the Ministry of Health and five from the Ministry of Economy. A finer review of these officials will have to be done: for example, there is a common economics manager of about 30 years and at least three other people under the age of 40.FalseSince Sunday and throughout yesterday, names and more names of people who were vaccinated "by acomodo" were circulated and which was false information. Among others, the trolls of Cambiamos put Marcelo Tinelli, Veronica Lozano, Pablo Echarri, Mariano Iudica, Angel De Brito, Gustavo Silvestre or Diego Brancatelli. Most of them had to take some time to deny that they had been vaccinated.Some media outlets also went out to report that they had been given doses to the in-laws of Sergio Massa, Marcela Durrieu and Fernando Galmarini. She is a doctor, he is 80 years old and both exhibited the registration they made on January 1, 2021.Another mentioned was treasury attorney Carlos Zannini. The official explained to this newspaper that he asked to be vaccinated for strategic state personnel and that his wife was also vaccinated, with Advanced Epoc. Zannini believes that it fits perfectly into the regulations dictated by the Ministry of Health.The debate will get the vaccination of Eduardo Duhalde and his wife Chiche. There is no justification in the vaccination of the former president's daughters. Everything indicates that they got the application because of the old friendship between Duhalde and Ginés González García.VaccineThe Ministry of Health's "VIP vaccination" ended in a list of ten people, including several questioned people such as Verbitsky, Aldrey's family, 84-year-old businessman Zeza Manukian, another businessman, Felix Guille, 71, and the well-known 94-year-old physician Solomon Schochter. Posadas' mobile team moved to the ministry on a single day, on February 18, and they also doseed Eduardo Valdés and Jorge Taiana, who were to integrate the presidential contourage into Mexico, the country with the highest mortality rate on the continent. These vaccinations are the ones that precipitated Ginés' resignation.Finally, Minister Vizzotti explained why the portfolio booked 3000 vaccines. The doses were applied to staff at Posadas Hospital - a total of 5000 workers - which is the only hospital that depends on the national state. There is also a reservation in case an outbreak appears somewhere in the country or if the cold chain is broken and a replacement must be provided to a district.VaccinesA central point of the meeting between Cafiero and Vizzotti was the continuity of the vaccination plan. It is already known that this Sunday, the Anmat finally authorized the Chinese vaccine of Sinopharm, the most expensive on the market. Given the urgencies, Alberto Fernandez signed an agreement with the Chinese government for a million doses that would arrive on Friday.At the same time, Vizzotti reported the results of the trip of presidential adviser Cecilia Nicolini who was in Moscow in the week he spent. The version is that more Sputnik V will come, but no one wanted to confirm the amounts or when the next trip will take place. The Russian government admitted this week that it cannot comply with the provision to all countries and, as mentioned, the transfer of technology to a laboratory in India is delayed.In this way, in the short term the million coming from China is added, plus 580,000 Astra/Zeneca that will come from India, plus what comes from Sputnik V. These amounts should allow for smooth vaccination, though still a little far from what is needed.Perhaps the strongest solution is related to Alberto Fernández's visit to Mexico yesterday. The representative was at the Liomont laboratory, where the final preparation of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, whose active element is produced in Munro's mAbxience laboratory, is under way. The commitment is that by the end of March the conglomerate will start distributing millions of vaccines throughout Latin America and should reach 22 million doses in Argentina.Cafiero and Vizzotti launched the development of a thorough protocol of vaccination criteria and these standards will be submitted today, first, to the National Immunization Council, a scientific area in which it will be defined which personnel is really strategic, and then put to the consideration of all the health ministers of the country. "The idea is for all districts to adhere to this proposal for protocol and traceability ofvaccines," Vizzotti anticipated last night. The definition of strategic personnel is essential at all levels, including provincial and municipal governments. And along with these definitions, the Ministry of Health will propose access to vaccination information, i.e. if someone wants to establish who is vaccinated, they can verify it. The complement to these measures is the delivery of a card that will prove the vaccination of each person.Report: Maria Cafferata.Load-Date: February 24, 2021End of Document

"We take steps to clarify everything"CE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 23, 2021 TuesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1325 wordsBodyThe national government disseminated the list of sixty people vaccinated at Posadas Hospital and ten at the Ministry of Health. After a meeting between the Chief of Staff, Santiago Cafiero, and the new Minister Carla Vizzotti, it was decided to publish the names. Irregular vaccination was "a very punctual, exceptional, wrong situation and the necessary steps have been taken to clarify what happened," Vizzotti said in dialogue with C5N and stressed that "the responsibility of the national state is to give answers to justice and we are absolutely available." Almost all vaccines - no less than 700,000 - were applied by each of the districts, but the focus was on those of national jurisdiction. In the Rosada they point out that the vast majority are officials who fit the established regulations: "management and driving of the State". There are others, who do not follow this definition such as businessman Florencio Aldrey and his family, journalist Horacio Verbitsky, Eduardo Duhalde's family or some young health and economics officials. Cafiero and the minister also planned the next steps of the vaccination plan, including distributing one million doses to arrive Thursday from the Sinopharm Chinese laboratory and more vaccines managed in Moscow by presidential adviser Cecilia Nicolini. Today a protocol will be presented to transparent vaccination, with definitions of who is strategic staff and who is not. A vaccination card and access to information will be added to this based on the traceability of each application.ListsThe meeting between Cafiero and Vizzotti assessed the possibility of making public the payroll of all vaccinated people in the country, but the idea was brazen because it violated the rules regarding the confidentiality of personal data. It was then chosen to ask Posadas to make known the list of those who were vaccinated in its facilities at the request of the Ministry of Health. In total, in the nearly two months since the first doses arrived - 24 December - 70 people were vaccinated outside the normal circuit, which is vaccination from each district, i.e. from the provinces and CABA. Most of the list is persons who are covered by the regulations set out in resolution 2883 of the Ministry of Health whose title is clear: "Strategic Plan of Vaccination against Covid-19 in the Argentine Republic". The Annex identifies those who take precedence and there is a specific section on the administration of the State: "any person who develops management and/or driving functions and strategic functions necessary for the proper functioning of the State, as well as persons at risk of infection or transmission". The text leaves room to discuss who enters that definition, but part of the payroll seems logical: the President, his spokesman, the chancellor, secretaries of the presidency, the photographer of the trip to Mexico, the Minister of Economy, the ambassador to Brazil, Daniel Scioli, his peer in Paraguay, Domingo Peppo, the debt negotiator, Sergio Chodos. There are 22 officials from the Ministry of Health and five from the Ministry of Economy. A finer review of these officials will have to be done: for example, there is a common economics manager of about 30 years and at least three other people under the age of 40.FalseSince Sunday and throughout yesterday, names and more names of people who were vaccinated "by acomodo" were circulated and which was false information. Among others, the trolls of Cambiamos put Marcelo Tinelli, Veronica Lozano, Pablo Echarri, Mariano Iudica, Angel De Brito, Gustavo Silvestre or Diego Brancatelli. Most of them had to take some time to deny that they had been vaccinated. Also some meansthey went out to report that they had been given doses to the in-laws of Sergio Massa, Marcela Durrieu and Fernando Galmarini. She is a doctor, he is 80 years old and both exhibited the registration they made on January 1, 2021.Another mentioned was treasury attorney Carlos Zannini. The official explained to this newspaper that he asked to be vaccinated for strategic state personnel and that his wife was also vaccinated, with Advanced Epoc. Zannini believes that it fits perfectly into the regulations dictated by the Ministry of Health.The debate will get the vaccination of Eduardo Duhalde and his wife Chiche. There is no justification in the vaccination of the former president's daughters. Everything indicates that they got the application because of the old friendship between Duhalde and Ginés González García.VaccineThe Ministry of Health's "VIP vaccination" ended in a list of ten people, including several questioned people such as Verbitsky, Aldrey's family, 84-year-old businessman Zeza Manukian, another businessman, Felix Guille, 71, and the well-known 94-year-old physician Solomon Schochter. Posadas' mobile team moved to the ministry on a single day, on February 18, and they also doseed Eduardo Valdés and Jorge Taiana, who were to integrate the presidential initiative into Mexico, the country with the highest mortality rate on the continent. These vaccinations are the ones that precipitated Ginés' resignation.Finally, Minister Vizzotti explained why the portfolio booked 3000 vaccines. The doses were applied to staff at Posadas Hospital - a total of 5000 workers - which is the only hospital that depends on the national state. There is also a reservation in case an outbreak appears somewhere in the country or if the cold chain is broken and a replacement must be provided to a district.VaccinesA central point of the meeting between Cafiero and Vizzotti was the continuity of the vaccination plan. It is already known that this Sunday, the Anmat finally authorized the Chinese vaccine of Sinopharm, the most expensive on the market. Given the urgencies, Alberto Fernandez signed an agreement with the Chinese government for a million doses that would arrive on Friday.At the same time, Vizzotti reported the results of the trip of presidential adviser Cecilia Nicolini who was in Moscow in the week he spent. The version is that more Sputnik V will come, but no one wanted to confirm the amounts or when the next trip will take place. The Russian government admitted this week that it cannot comply with the provision to all countries and, as mentioned, the transfer of technology to a laboratory in India is delayed.In this way, in the short term the million coming from China is added, plus 580,000 Astra/Zeneca that will come from India, plus what comes from Sputnik V. These amounts should allow for smooth vaccination, though still a little far from what is needed.Perhaps the strongest solution is related to Alberto Fernández's visit to Mexico yesterday.

Offensive tweets and genocideThe Gatepost: Framingham State CollegeFebruary 18, 2021 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2021 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 648 wordsByline: James BarrafordBodyGina Carano has been fired from the Disney+ series "The Mandalorian."She posted a black-and-white photograph of a battered Jewish woman running in her undergarments from a mob of Nazis. The caption above the photo explains there was a process of indoctrination that made Nazis hate their Jewish neighbors.She compared the plight of European Jewry in WWII to being an American conservative today."How is that any different from hating someone of their political views?" Carano's tweet asked.On Feb. 9, a LucasFilm spokesperson announced she would no longer be a cast member of "The Mandalorian.""Nevertheless, her social media posts denigrating people based on their cultural and religious identities are abhorrent and unacceptable." The spokesperson said.Carano had also posted a tweet in the past mocking mandatory COVID-19 mask policies and questioned the results of the recent Presidential election.This is the problem with Twitter. It allows us to project our impulsive thoughts and perpetuate feelings into "fact."I find Carano's tweet mind-numbingly stupid. Hatred in this country must be treated as a social crisis. Her tweet added absolutely nothing of value to that conversation.Anyone who tweets making fun of those who wear masks during a pandemic is naïve or unintelligent.However, her tweet hurt no one physically.Has her tweet enabled the genocide Uighurs face under the Chinese Communist Party's regime? No.Has Disney+ worked closely with the government that is leading a systemic genocide of China's inconvenient minority? Yes.With the release of Disney+'s "Mulan," it was revealed part of the movie was filmed in Xinxiang. This is the region where Uighurs are being held in internment camps. Disney+ also thanked eight CCP offices in the movie's closing credits.The Chinese government is undertaking measures against the Uighurs, such as forced sterilization and IUDs, according to the AP."The campaign over the past four years in the far west region of Xinjiang is leading to what some experts are calling a form of 'demographic genocide,'" according to the AP.Even Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said the actions of the CCP, "speak to an effort to commit genocide."If history tells us anything, the genocide of the Uighurs will only become more aggressive.On July 3, 2020, New York federal agents seized 13 tons of hair to be sold as weaves. It was not synthetic hair. It was hair from Uighurs detained in China.Let that sink in. Thirteen tons of human hair.What is occurring in Xinjiang, under the authority of the Chinese Communist Party, is evil. The genocidal impulse of President Xi Xinping will only grow.LucasFilms made a choice to align itself with Disney+. Disney+ made a choice to work with government agencies within the CCP that are leading a systemic genocide of the Uighur minority.Their business model is based on platitudes. Their dream machine is not concerned with actually making the world a better place.As a liberal, I uphold Carano's right to free speech. I don't agree with her grotesque tweets. But social media has supplanted face-to-face interaction.With so much communication done on social media, the potential for missteps grows. All the nuance of talking to a live person is lost on Twitter.We are reduced to a profile picture. We are reduced, as a human being, to whatever message we wrote in under 280 characters.While I understand the desire to hold people accountable for idiotic or hateful rhetoric, at some point we must ask ourselves if our desires for justice are based on pragmatism or perfectionism.LucasFilm has the right to fire her. But what happens if moral tastes change as they so often do?Will the righteous of today be the canceled of tomorrow?For those who called for her firing on Twitter, you are welcome to block her.You are also welcome to tweet about the genocide occurring in Xinjiang.We cannot be silent anymore.Load-Date: February 19, 2021End of Document

CSIS: 'Advancing Data Governance in G7'Targeted News ServiceFebruary 3, 2021 Wednesday 8:10 AM  ESTCopyright 2021 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2306 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Center for Strategic and International Studies issued the following commentary on Feb. 2, 2021, by Matthew P. Goodman, senior vice president and director of the economics program, and Pearl Risberg, research associate with the economics program, entitled "Advancing Data Governance in the G7":This piece is made possible through the generous support of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Japan.* * *Two years ago last month, Japan's former prime minister Shinzo Abe gave a speech at Davos aimed at starting a global conversation about data governance. With more than 2.5 quintillion bytes of new data created every day, Abe noted, the global economy was increasingly driven by data, yet there were few globally accepted rules on the collection, processing, and sharing of data. In the two years since Abe's speech, there has been a patchwork of efforts to advance rules and principles in this area, but there is still a long way to go toward creating a coherent global approach. As host of the Group of Seven (G7) in 2021, the United Kingdom has a chance to take the global conversation on data governance a few practical steps forward this year.Abe used Japan's 2019 presidency of the Group of Twenty (G20) to put his concept of "data free flow with trust" (DFFT) on the global agenda. G20 leaders endorsed the somewhat elusive phrase in their communique at the Osaka summit. Abe was less successful in his goal of establishing an "Osaka Track" to carry work on DFFT forward. He did win endorsement of an "Osaka Declaration on Digital Economy" to advance work on electronic commerce rules in the World Trade Organization (WTO), but three G20 members--India, Indonesia, and South Africa--opted out, and the document made only a vague reference to broader data governance issues.A Divided WorldProgress toward a global consensus on data governance has been slow because of philosophical and regulatory differences among key economic blocs. The European Union has been most forceful in pushing its preferred approach, which starts with an emphasis on an individual's right to privacy and to control of his or her own personal data. These rights were enshrined in EU law through the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into force in May 2018. GDPR holds businesses--whether European or otherwise--to a high standard of security and transparency in handling the personal data of EU citizens and has become a de facto global standard.By contrast, the United States lacks federal data privacy legislation or a unified approach to data governance. Washington has taken a mainly hands-off approach, allowing the private sector to largely shape norms in this area. But with consumer privacy concerns rising and no federal response emerging, state legislatures, led by California, began to adopt their own legislative variations on GDPR and other existing models. Despite increasing consensus in the U.S. Congress that federal data privacy legislation is necessary, no bill has garnered broad support yet. However, there could be movement under the Biden administration, driven by both Vice President Kamala Harris' interest in the issue and rising China-related national security concerns.China's approach to data governance represents a third global model that has some of the formal trappings of the EU approach but is very different in practice. Data in China are considered a strategic asset of the state and have been subject to tightening regulatory controls. Under a draft Personal Information Privacy Law formally modeled on GDPR and issued for public comment in October of 2020, Chinese citizens will in theory enjoy strict data privacy protections, including high barriers to the collection of personal data. However, the Chinese government holds legal authority to access nearly any data on the basis of national security. The draft privacy law also contains extraterritorial provisions that would apply to foreign entities processing or analyzing data on Chinese citizens.Beyond different approaches to privacy, there is an array of other data-related issues on which global consensus remains elusive. One critical debate is over the rules governing transfer of data across borders. Many countries have imposed data localization requirements, which mandate that data be stored or processed locally. The United States, Japan, and other advanced countries have argued against data localization and advocated for essentially free flow of data across borders, stressing the financial, health, and other benefits of cross-border flows. In addition to these debates, there are significant differences over the national security dimensions of data governance and the appropriate role of government intervention in the digital economy.Clarifying "Trust"The Japanese concept of DFFT could be useful as a lodestar to guide international discussions on convergence toward a global approach to data governance. However, this will likely require greater definition of the "T" in DFFT: trust. At a public event at CSIS in December 2020, Director General of the Economics Bureau of Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs Noriyuki Shikata acknowledged that trust is a broad concept subject to different interpretations, but said the term allowed room for international discussions among relevant stakeholders to develop common rules addressing different dimensions of trust. However, the term's ambiguity could undermine DFFT's success, since different actors--citizens, businesses, and government, both within and among countries--have at least some degree of mistrust of each other, and policies to establish greater trust across these groups could impede the benefits of free flows of data.One area in which the debate about trust is playing out is government access to individuals' personal data held by private companies. The now infamous "Schrems 2.0" decision by the European Court of Justice in the summer of 2019, which invalidated the U.S.-EU Privacy Shield, was the result of an Austrian citizen's taking issue with U.S. intelligence agencies' authority to access his personal data; this, he argued, was a breach of his right to privacy through the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. The court's ruling had wide-sweeping ramifications: the over 5,000 U.S. companies that relied on the U.S.-EU Privacy Shield are now individually tasked with assessing the sufficiency of data privacy laws in the destination country before exporting personal data, an expensive new burden. Schrems 2.0 prompted work by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to develop high-level principles for trusted government access to personal data held by the private sector.A Plethora of PrinciplesThe OECD has become an important player in advancing broader global principles and standards on data governance. The Paris-based organization representing 37 mainly advanced countries is launching a two-year horizontal project on data governance in 2021 and 2022, clearing the way for an organization-wide, interdisciplinary approach. As explained by Andrew Wyckoff, the OECD's director for science, technology and innovation, at the December CSIS event, the project is designed around four modules: access, control, and sharing of data; cross-border data flows; the impact of data on business models, market dynamics, and market structure; and data measurement and classification. Progress in all of these areas is important to establishing international consensus on data governance.Beyond the OECD, there is a plethora of other efforts around the world to define principles, rules, and norms of data governance. Following the Osaka summit, G20 ministers responsible for the digital economy met and outlined a broad agenda for potential joint work on data governance (though new commitments were few). Meanwhile, industry groups have formed a Global Data Alliance to develop high standards of data responsibility and instill trust in the digital economy. Think-tank scholars have also gotten into the game, including two colleagues from CSIS who in 2019 put forward a set of principles to advance global consensus on data governance.Data rulemaking has also become a central element of global and regional trade negotiations. The WTO's negotiations on trade-related aspects of electronic commerce were launched at Davos in 2019, with 86 members (including China) now participating. The group plans to make a concerted push to reach agreement on data flows ahead of the 12th WTO Ministerial Conference due to be held later this year, although expectations for early progress in a group of this size and diversity are low. Digital rules have also been embedded in a series of plurilateral and bilateral trade agreements, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) , the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, and the U.S.-Japan Digital Trade Agreement. And the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum has been working for a number of years to develop digital norms in the region, including through its Cross-Border Privacy Rules (CBPR), an opt-in alternative for both companies and countries that bridges gaps between regulatory systems.The G7 in 2021As host of the G7 in 2021, the United Kingdom has an opportunity to pull some of these disparate strands of work on data governance together and move closer to global consensus. The G7 has worked for nearly 50 years to coordinate economic policies among the world's largest market economies. Digital issues have been formally on the G7 agenda since the 2016 Ise-Shima summit. Despite concerns about its representativeness in today's changed global economy, the G7 still has an important role to play in advancing global economic norms.The United Kingdom has identified digital governance as an important element of the 2021 G7 agenda, both as a standalone topic and in informing policy responses to other challenges such as Covid-19. While acknowledging that the pandemic and the economic disruption related to it will be priorities for the United Kingdom's host year, Heulwen Philpot, deputy director for G7/20 policy in the Cabinet Office, stressed at the December CSIS event the importance of getting something tangible done on digital issues. She noted that the United Kingdom will convene a meeting of G7 digital and technology ministers in the spring and a broader "future tech forum" later in the year. The G7 presidency is the first opportunity for "Global Britain" to prove its leadership credentials since its withdrawal from the European Union, and data governance is one area where London can steer progress on an important, if complex, issue.A Way ForwardBased on our findings from a series of CSIS expert roundtables last fall, we offer three modest recommendations to the UK G7 hosts for taking the conversation on data governance forward in 2021.First, seek small but tangible progress. Nothing breeds cynicism like a G7 communique full of lofty goals and vague "action plans" unlikely to be fulfilled. The G7 host can gain more credibility by laying down some "bricks in the road" toward a long-term goal that most agree is desirable. Agreement on all aspects of data governance will not be possible at one meeting, but incremental progress can be built upon by future G7 hosts and in other international forums. The G7 would do a useful service in 2021 if it were simply to shed light on dimensions of the data story that are not well understood: among other things, by cataloguing different types of data (the flight data produced by an airplane, for example, are very different from data on an individual's shopping habits); defining key terms such as "access," "control," and "trust"; and mapping out the different data regimes in G7 countries and beyond, showing where they align and where there are conflicts or gaps.Second, work toward a set of G7 data governance principles. As noted earlier, there is much good work underway around the world that can be drawn on for this purpose--in the OECD, among industry groups and think tanks, in trade agreements, and so on. Distilling these into a shortlist of core principles on issues such as privacy, security, and data flows would be useful in setting a common baseline for policy, in shaping global rules and norms, and--importantly--in allowing for greater interoperability among different data regimes in member countries. If agreement cannot be reached in one year, G7 leaders could task relevant ministers to work out agreed principles for endorsement by leaders in Germany's G7 host year in 2022.Third, use the G7's influence to shape broader global work on data governance. This starts by pulling G7 outreach countries such as Australia, South Korea, and India into the group's work on principles. Deepening partnerships with the private sector and other nongovernmental actors is also critical. Once they reach a common approach, G7 countries can then use their still-formidable influence as the world's seven largest advanced market economies to drive debate publicly and via other forums such as the G20 and WTO.As noted in previous writings by the CSIS Economics Program, data governance represents the missing "fifth pillar" of the global economic order, after the three Bretton Woods institutions and the energy-related arrangements of the 1970s (including the G7 itself). Data of all kinds are too important an element of the twenty-first century global economy not to have a system of broadly agreed rules and norms underlying them. Former prime minister Abe planted a useful seed two years ago with his concept of "data free flow with trust." As this year's G7 host, the United Kingdom has a chance to lay a few solid bricks in the road toward that worthwhile objective.[Category: Political][Category: ThinkTank1]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7372432 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: February 3, 2021End of Document

Treasuries started the day with modest losses that were widened during the first half of action. The selling was undisturbed by the Employment Situation report for December, which disappointed on the headline level, but contained some positive offsetting factors like a larger than expected increase in average hourly earnings and an upward revision to November figures. The market looked past the report, focusing instead on reports that President-elect Biden intends to seek $3 trln in spending, which would include $2 trln in spending on infrastructure and green jobs. Later in the day, it was reported that Democratic Senator Manchin from West Virginia opposes increasing direct payments to $2,000. The Senator's opposition was notable because he is believed to have influence over potential swing votes. The uncertainty lifted Treasuries off their lows, but the bounce was not big. This week's selling widened the 2s10s spread by 18 basis points to 98 bps. The U.S. Dollar Index rose 0.3% to 90.09, rising 0.2% for the week. Yield Check: 2-yr: -1 bp to 0.13% (+1 bp for the week) 3-yr: UNCH at 0.22% (+5 bps for the week) 5-yr: +3 bps to 0.48% (+12 bps for the week) 10-yr: +3 bps to 1.11% (+19 bps for the week) 30-yr: +2 bps to 1.86% (+21 bps for the week)News: Democrats in the House of Representatives reportedly plan to introduce new articles of impeachment against President Trump on Monday.

Four of the five largest components by weight trade lower, weighing the sector down. Extension of this week's underperformance. The sector is now down 1.0% for the week, which leaves the group only ahead of real estate (+0.8%; -2.8% week-to-date), consumer staples (-0.2%; -1.7% week-to-date), and utilities (+0.5%; -1.0% week-to-date) on this week's leaderboard.Notable movers:Fox Corporation (FOXA 29.99, -0.95, -3.1%): weakest performer in the sector, deepening its pullback from a seven-month high. Twitter (TWTR 50.76, -1.57, -3.0%): falling to one-month low. Verizon (VZ 57.48, -1.06, -1.8%): falling below its 200-day moving average (57.86). AT&T (T 28.86, -0.53, -1.8%): falling below its 200-day (29.44) and 50-day moving averages (28.91). Facebook (FB 265.89, -2.86, -1.1%): returning to yesterday's session low. Disney (DIS 177.70, -0.88, -0.5%): slipping past yesterday's low despite being upgraded to Neutral from Sell at Lightshed Partners. DISH Network (DISH 32.98, +0.56, +1.7%): best performer in the sector, rising to its best level since mid-December.12:58SCANX Earnings Out Next WeekMonday (Jan 11) Morning: AZZ CMC Afternoon: SNX Tuesday (Jan 12) Morning: ACI Afternoon: KBH Wednesday (Jan 13) Morning: INFO SJR Afternoon: WAFD Thursday (Jan 14) Morning: APHA BLK DAL FRC TSM Afternoon: PRGS Friday (Jan 15) Morning: C JPM PNC WFC12:58WRAPX Midday Market Summary: Another record-setting advance despite weak jobs dataThe S&P 500 (+0.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+0.6%), and Russell 2000 (+0.1%) set fresh all-time highs at the open despite a weak December employment report, but they are off prior highs and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.2%) is trading in negative territory.Currently, the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (+1.5%), real estate (+0.8%), energy (+0.6%), and information technology (+0.4%) sectors are leading the broader advance, with the former driven higher by Tesla (TSLA 881.72, +65.61, +8.0%) again. The financials (-0.6%), communication services (-0.4%), and materials (-0.6%) sectors lag with modest declines.Specifying the jobs data, December nonfarm payrolls decreased by 140,000 (Briefing.com consensus +112,000), private sector payrolls decreased by 95,000 (Briefing.com consensus +100,000), and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 6.7%, as expected.The disappointing data has been partially offset by large upward revisions to November payrolls, an appreciation for the vaccination efforts that should hopefully reopen the economy later this year, and expectations for more fiscal stimulus under a Biden Administration and Democrat-controlled Congress.On a related note, reports indicate that President-elect Biden will propose a $3 trillion infrastructure package and will prioritize passing $2000 stimulus checks when he takes office. This has supported the continued selling in longer-dated Treasuries where the 10-yr yield is up four basis points to 1.11%.In other positive corporate developments, Union Pacific (UNP 219.15, +6.43, +3.0%) issued upside Q4 revenue guidance, Micron (MU 79.91, +0.82, +1.0%) topped earnings and revenue expectations and issued upside quarterly guidance, and Chevron (CVX 91.77, +1.55, +1.7%) was upgraded to Overweight from Neutral at Piper Sandler.Reviewing today's economic data:The December employment report disappointed on the headline level as nonfarm payrolls declined by 140,000 (Briefing.com consensus 112,000) against expectations for an increase. However, the drop was partially offset by a large upward revision to November figures and an increase in December average hourly earnings. December private sector payrolls decreased by 95,000 (Briefing.com consensus 100,000). December unemployment rate was unchanged at 6.7% (Briefing.com consensus 6.7%)Capital markets are likely to look past this report and focus on the expected increase in fiscal spending once a new administration is inaugurated, but the December report shows that the labor market is facing an uphill climb.Wholesale inventories were unchanged in November (Briefing.com consensus -0.1%) following an upwardly revised 1.3% increase (from +1.1%) in October.12:36EFX Equifax agrees to acquire Kount for $640 mln (182.29 +1.00)Equifax has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Kount, a provider of Artificial Intelligence-driven fraud prevention and digital identity solutions, for $640 mln.

The largest sector member-Amazon (AMZN 3150.94, -11.22, -0.4%)-holds a modest loss but seven of the next eight largest components sport solid gains. Continuation of this week's show of relative strength. The sector has extended this week's gain to 3.3% versus a 1.5% week-to-date gain in the S&P 500 (+0.2%).Notable movers:Etsy (ETSY 176.76, +5.97, +3.5%): best performer in the sector, rising toward its high from Monday. CarMax (KMX 102.64, +2.34, +2.3%): rising to its best level since late September.

The Nasdaq (+0.7%) and S&P 500 (+0.3%) continue hanging onto gains while the Dow (-0.1%) has turned negative.The early dip from highs represents a pullback after a strong start to 2021. The S&P 500 remains higher by 1.6% for the week while the Russell 2000 has jumped more than 6.0% in the first week of the year.Today's biggest story was the disappointing Employment Situation report for December, but it took a back seat to today's second biggest story, which was an Axios report that President-elect Biden will seek a $3 trln fiscal package that would call for about $2 trln in spending on green jobs and infrastructure.The December jobs report showed the loss of 140,000 payrolls (Briefing.com consensus +112,000) but some of the initial sting was offset by a large upward revision to November data and a larger than expected increase in average hourly earnings. Still, the report painted a bland picture of the labor market in December. However, the stock market is looking past the news thanks to the prospect of more fiscal spending.Seven out of eleven sectors trade with early gains, led by consumer discretionary (+1.5%) and real estate (+1.2%). On the downside, communication services (-0.7%) and financials (-0.4%) are the two weakest performers.10:24BAYRY Bayer AG announces FDA approval of sNDA for NUBEQA (15.84 -0.37)Bayer today announced that the FDA approved a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to add overall survival (OS) and other secondary endpoint data from the Phase III ARAMIS trial to the NUBEQA (darolutamide) Prescribing Information.

The results were published on the preprint server bioRxiv and are available here.Rapidly spreading variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, initially in the United Kingdom and South Africa. These variants have multiple mutations in their spike or S glycoproteins, which are key targets of virus neutralizing antibodies. Though these two rapidly spreading viruses are different, they share the N501Y mutation, which is located in the receptor binding site of the spike protein and results in the virus's spike protein binding more tightly to its receptor. It has been shown to infect mice more efficiently.iTo determine if sera of people who had received the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine could neutralize SARS-CoV-2 with the N501Y mutation, a virus with this substitution was generated in UTMB's laboratory. The sera of 20 participants from the previously reported Phase 3 trial neutralized the virus with the mutation as well as they neutralized virus without the mutation. While the virus tested in this experiment did not include the full set of spike mutations found on the rapidly spreading strains in the U.K. or South Africa, neutralization of virus with the N501Y mutation by the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine-elicited human sera is consistent with preserved neutralization of a panel of 15 pseudoviruses bearing spikes with other mutations found in circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains. This indicates that the key N501Y mutation, which is found in the emerging U.K and South Africa variants, does not create resistance to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine induced immune responses. Pfizer, BioNTech, and UTMB are encouraged by these early, in vitro study findings. Further data are needed to monitor the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine's effectiveness in preventing COVID-19 caused by new virus variants. If the virus mutates such that an update to the vaccine is required to continue to confer protection against COVID-19, we believe that the flexibility of BioNTech's proprietary mRNA vaccine platform is well suited to enable an adjustment to the vaccine.06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- Markets trade higher ahead of US jobs reportThe global equity markets are mostly higher with US futures pointing to modest gains to begin the day.

SRP-9001 is an investigational gene transfer therapy intended to deliver its micro-dystrophin-encoding gene to muscle tissue for the targeted production of the micro-dystrophin protein.At 12 weeks post-treatment compared to baseline, the study met its primary biological endpoint of micro-dystrophin protein expression (P<0.0001). Participants who received SRP-9001 (n=20) had mean micro-dystrophin expression of 28.1%, as measured by western blot. Accompanying secondary biological endpoints including vector genome copies per nucleus, percent positive fibers, intensity, and reduction in creatine kinase (exploratory) were also met.In the primary functional endpoint, SRP-9001-treated participants showed an increase in NSAA total score compared to placebo at 48 weeks; however, the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.37). At every time point measured, the cohort of SRP-9001 treated participants outperformed the placebo group, and, at 48 weeks, participants in the treatment group demonstrated a statistically significant increase of 1.7 points in NSAA total score compared to baseline (P=0.009), while participants in the placebo group saw an increase of 0.9 points on the NSAA total score compared to baseline, which was not statistically significant (n=21, P=0.1411).In the pre-specified analysis by age-group, by which the randomization was stratified, participants aged 4-5 years at time of treatment with SRP-9001 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in NSAA total score versus the age-matched placebo cohort, achieving a 4.3-point improvement on NSAA at 48 weeks post-treatment from baseline.The results from Study 102 reinforce the "favorable" safety and tolerability profile of SRP-9001, with no new safety signals identified.16:16WRAPX Closing Stock Market SummaryEach of the major indices closed at record highs on Thursday in a momentum trade led by the technology stocks. The Nasdaq Composite outperformed with an impressive 2.6% gain, followed by solid gains in the Russell 2000 (+1.9%), S&P 500 (+1.5%), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%).Risk sentiment broadened out to nine of the 11 S&P 500 sectors. The information technology (+2.7%), consumer discretionary (+1.8%), energy (+1.5%), and financials (+1.5%) sectors were the best-performing sectors; conversely, the utilities (-1.3%) and consumer staples (-0.3%) sectors closed lower.Investors bought yesterday's dip in the broader technology space and continued to bid up shares of Tesla (TSLA 816.04, +60.06, +7.9%), which was upgraded to Sector Perform from Underperform at RBC Capital Mkts after the firm conceded it was wrong about the stock.In addition, the oft-repeated recovery narrative was on display after Democrats flipped both Senate seats in Georgia yesterday, giving them slim majority in the Senate, and the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index rose to a better-than-expected 57.2% in December (Briefing.com consensus 54.7%) from 55.9% in November.The projected Democratic majority in the Senate contributed to the continued selling pressure in longer-dated Treasuries amid the possibility for more fiscal stimulus. These respective yields moved higher.The 10-yr yield increased three basis points to 1.07%, while the 2-yr yield was flat at 0.14%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 89.84. WTI crude futures increased 0.5%, or $0.24, to $50.81/bbl.In other corporate news, shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA 45.26, +2.23, +5.2%) rose 5% after beating top and bottom-line estimates, while DXC Technology (DXC 28.91, +2.46, +9.3%) received an acquisition proposal from French IT firm Atos for reportedly more than $10 billion.Reviewing Thursday's economic data:The ISM Non-Manufacturing Index rose to 57.2% in December (Briefing.com consensus 54.7%) from 55.9% in November. The dividing line between expansion and contraction is 50.0%. The December reading reflects a faster pace of expansion than the prior month, and it is the seventh consecutive reading above 50.0%.The key takeaway from the report is that the Employment Index, which dipped below 50.0%, blemished an otherwise solid snapshot of the services sector in December.Initial claims for the week ending January 2 decreased by 3,000 to 787,000 (Briefing.com consensus 752,000). Continuing claims for the week ending December 26 decreased by 126,000 to 5.072 million.The key takeaway from the report is that initial claims are still coming in at a stubbornly high level, which sends a poor signal about the state of the labor market.The U.S. trade deficit widened to $68.1 billion in November (Briefing.com consensus -$67.1 billion) from an unrevised $63.1 billion in October.The key takeaway from the report is that it showed another increase in exports and imports, indicating an uptick in global trade.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Employment Situation Report for December, Consumer Credit for November, and Wholesale Inventories for November on Friday.Russell 2000 +6.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +1.4% YTDNasdaq Composite +1.4% YTDS&P 500 +1.3% YTD16:14AIRG Airgain reports preliminary Q4 revenue inline with consensus; also announces acquisition of NimbeLink (17.19 -0.08)Co reports in-line preliminary Q4 revenue of $12.8 mln vs. the $12.82 mln S&P Capital IQ consensus.

The Russell 2000 (-0.3%) set an intraday all-time high at the open but closed lower.Briefly, December nonfarm payrolls decreased by 140,000 (Briefing.com consensus +112,000), private sector payrolls decreased by 95,000 (Briefing.com consensus +100,000), and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 6.7%, as expected. The unexpected decline in payrolls was partially offset by large upward revisions to November payrolls.The market presumably interpreted the report as a blip in the labor market recovery due to ongoing vaccination efforts and less consequential to the economic growth outlook due to prospects for more fiscal stimulus. It was also backwards-looking based on the renewed lockdown measures enacted to curb the spread of the coronavirus.In the stock market, the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (+1.8%), real estate (+1.1%), information technology (+0.8%), and utilities (+0.9%) sectors carried the market higher, with Tesla (TSLA 880.02, +63.98, +7.8%) disproportionately aiding the consumer discretionary sector and Nasdaq.On the downside, the materials (-0.5%), financials (-0.2%), industrials (-0.2%), and energy (-0.1%) sectors finished in the red. Micron (MU 77.42, -1.69, -2.1%) shares gave up an early 6% gain and closed lower despite reporting positive earnings results and upbeat guidance.Separately, the S&P 500 briefly turned negative on reports that Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) said he will not support $2000 stimulus checks, but Mr. Manchin quickly clarified that "if the next round of stimulus checks goes out, they should be targeted to those who need it." Stocks recovered.President-elect Biden said he will propose a complete economic package next week that will include a range of issues and said the "price tag will be high."Longer-dated Treasuries continued to face selling pressure amid expectations for economic growth and possibly inflation. The 10-yr yield increased another three basis points to 1.11%, while the 2-yr yield decreased one basis point to 0.13%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 90.06. WTI crude futures increased 2.8%, or $1.44, to $52.25/bbl.Reviewing Friday's economic data:The December employment report disappointed on the headline level as nonfarm payrolls declined by 140,000 (Briefing.com consensus 112,000) against expectations for an increase. However, the drop was partially offset by a large upward revision to November figures and an increase in December average hourly earnings. December private sector payrolls decreased by 95,000 (Briefing.com consensus 100,000). December unemployment rate was unchanged at 6.7% (Briefing.com consensus 6.7%)Capital markets are likely to look past this report and focus on the expected increase in fiscal spending once a new administration is inaugurated, but the December report shows that the labor market is facing an uphill climb.Consumer credit increased by $15.3 bln in November after increasing a revised $4.5 bln (from $7.2 bln) in October.The key takeaway from the report is that revolving credit decreased for the eighth time over the last nine months dating back to February, which preceded the initial pandemic lockdown period taking hold in the U.S.Wholesale inventories were unchanged in November (Briefing.com consensus -0.1%) following an upwardly revised 1.3% increase (from +1.1%) in October.Investors will not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Russell 2000 +5.9% YTDNasdaq Composite +2.4% YTDS&P 500 +1.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +1.6% YTD16:21WRAPX This week's biggest % gainers/losers The following are this week's top percentage gainers and losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).This week's top % gainers Healthcare: TRXC (1.18 +88.8%), PACB (38.29 +47.61%), DBVT (3.86 +47.33%), NTLA (78.61 +44.49%)Industrials: RUN (95.44 +37.55%)Information Technology: DDD (23.44 +123.69%), SSYS (28.38 +36.97%), MTLS (74.04 +36.58%)Financials: BPFH (12.07 +42.78%)Energy: REI (1.06 +60.63%), BPT (3.36 +41.18%), SM (8.55 +39.71%), PDS (22.77 +38.05%), GPRE (18.03 +36.9%)This week's top % losers Healthcare: SRPT (82.91 -51.37%), SLDB (6.73 -11.21%), MGNX (20.46 -10.5%), IRTC (212.94 -10.23%), ALLK (126.55 -9.61%)Industrials: GOL (8.72 -11.2%), AZUL (20.29 -11.09%), ATSG (27.93 -10.88%), MRCY (79.58 -9.63%)Consumer Discretionary: AGS (6.49 -9.86%), DDS (57.46 -8.87%)Information Technology: INFN (9.14 -12.83%)Financials: GNW (3.11 -17.7%), ECPG (33.54 -13.89%), PFSI (57.21 -12.82%), FCFS (62.15 -11.26%), PRAA (35.88 -9.53%)16:15BOOT Boot Barn guides DecQ EPS and revs above consensus; comps +4.6% (48.58 +1.03)Co issues upside guidance for Q3 (Dec), sees EPS of $0.99, excluding non-recurring items, vs. $0.87 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; sees Q3 (Dec) revs of approx $302.3 mln vs. $297.24 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Same store sales increased +4.6%, including an increase in retail comps of +1.9% and an increase in e-commerce sales of +16.3%.

Treasuries started the day with modest losses that were widened during the first half of action. The selling was undisturbed by the Employment Situation report for December, which disappointed on the headline level, but contained some positive offsetting factors like a larger than expected increase in average hourly earnings and an upward revision to November figures. The market looked past the report, focusing instead on reports that President-elect Biden intends to seek $3 trln in spending, which would include $2 trln in spending on infrastructure and green jobs. Later in the day, it was reported that Democratic Senator Manchin from West Virginia opposes increasing direct payments to $2,000. The Senator's opposition was notable because he is believed to have influence over potential swing votes. The uncertainty lifted Treasuries off their lows, but the bounce was not big.

Four of the five largest components by weight trade lower, weighing the sector down. Extension of this week's underperformance. The sector is now down 1.0% for the week, which leaves the group only ahead of real estate (+0.8%; -2.8% week-to-date), consumer staples (-0.2%; -1.7% week-to-date), and utilities (+0.5%; -1.0% week-to-date) on this week's leaderboard.Notable movers:Fox Corporation (FOXA 29.99, -0.95, -3.1%): weakest performer in the sector, deepening its pullback from a seven-month high. Twitter (TWTR 50.76, -1.57, -3.0%): falling to one-month low. Verizon (VZ 57.48, -1.06, -1.8%): falling below its 200-day moving average (57.86).

The financials (-0.6%), communication services (-0.4%), and materials (-0.6%) sectors lag with modest declines.Specifying the jobs data, December nonfarm payrolls decreased by 140,000 (Briefing.com consensus +112,000), private sector payrolls decreased by 95,000 (Briefing.com consensus +100,000), and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 6.7%, as expected.The disappointing data has been partially offset by large upward revisions to November payrolls, an appreciation for the vaccination efforts that should hopefully reopen the economy later this year, and expectations for more fiscal stimulus under a Biden Administration and Democrat-controlled Congress.On a related note, reports indicate that President-elect Biden will propose a $3 trillion infrastructure package and will prioritize passing $2000 stimulus checks when he takes office. This has supported the continued selling in longer-dated Treasuries where the 10-yr yield is up four basis points to 1.11%.In other positive corporate developments, Union Pacific (UNP 219.15, +6.43, +3.0%) issued upside Q4 revenue guidance, Micron (MU 79.91, +0.82, +1.0%) topped earnings and revenue expectations and issued upside quarterly guidance, and Chevron (CVX 91.77, +1.55, +1.7%) was upgraded to Overweight from Neutral at Piper Sandler.Reviewing today's economic data:The December employment report disappointed on the headline level as nonfarm payrolls declined by 140,000 (Briefing.com consensus 112,000) against expectations for an increase. However, the drop was partially offset by a large upward revision to November figures and an increase in December average hourly earnings. December private sector payrolls decreased by 95,000 (Briefing.com consensus 100,000). December unemployment rate was unchanged at 6.7% (Briefing.com consensus 6.7%)Capital markets are likely to look past this report and focus on the expected increase in fiscal spending once a new administration is inaugurated, but the December report shows that the labor market is facing an uphill climb.Wholesale inventories were unchanged in November (Briefing.com consensus -0.1%) following an upwardly revised 1.3% increase (from +1.1%) in October.12:36EFX Equifax agrees to acquire Kount for $640 mln (182.29 +1.00)Equifax has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Kount, a provider of Artificial Intelligence-driven fraud prevention and digital identity solutions, for $640 mln.

The S&P 500 remains higher by 1.6% for the week while the Russell 2000 has jumped more than 6.0% in the first week of the year.Today's biggest story was the disappointing Employment Situation report for December, but it took a back seat to today's second biggest story, which was an Axios report that President-elect Biden will seek a $3 trln fiscal package that would call for about $2 trln in spending on green jobs and infrastructure.The December jobs report showed the loss of 140,000 payrolls (Briefing.com consensus +112,000) but some of the initial sting was offset by a large upward revision to November data and a larger than expected increase in average hourly earnings. Still, the report painted a bland picture of the labor market in December. However, the stock market is looking past the news thanks to the prospect of more fiscal spending.Seven out of eleven sectors trade with early gains, led by consumer discretionary (+1.5%) and real estate (+1.2%).

The results were published on the preprint server bioRxiv and are available here.Rapidly spreading variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, initially in the United Kingdom and South Africa. These variants have multiple mutations in their spike or S glycoproteins, which are key targets of virus neutralizing antibodies. Though these two rapidly spreading viruses are different, they share the N501Y mutation, which is located in the receptor binding site of the spike protein and results in the virus's spike protein binding more tightly to its receptor. It has been shown to infect mice more efficiently.iTo determine if sera of people who had received the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine could neutralize SARS-CoV-2 with the N501Y mutation, a virus with this substitution was generated in UTMB's laboratory. The sera of 20 participants from the previously reported Phase 3 trial neutralized the virus with the mutation as well as they neutralized virus without the mutation. While the virus tested in this experiment did not include the full set of spike mutations found on the rapidly spreading strains in the U.K. or South Africa, neutralization of virus with the N501Y mutation by the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine-elicited human sera is consistent with preserved neutralization of a panel of 15 pseudoviruses bearing spikes with other mutations found in circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains. This indicates that the key N501Y mutation, which is found in the emerging U.K and South Africa variants, does not create resistance to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine induced immune responses. Pfizer, BioNTech, and UTMB are encouraged by these early, in vitro study findings. Further data are needed to monitor the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine's effectiveness in preventing COVID-19 caused by new virus variants. If the virus mutates such that an update to the vaccine is required to continue to confer protection against COVID-19, we believe that the flexibility of BioNTech's proprietary mRNA vaccine platform is well suited to enable an adjustment to the vaccine.06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- Markets trade higher ahead of US jobs reportThe global equity markets are mostly higher with US futures pointing to modest gains to begin the day.

SRP-9001 is an investigational gene transfer therapy intended to deliver its micro-dystrophin-encoding gene to muscle tissue for the targeted production of the micro-dystrophin protein.At 12 weeks post-treatment compared to baseline, the study met its primary biological endpoint of micro-dystrophin protein expression (P<0.0001). Participants who received SRP-9001 (n=20) had mean micro-dystrophin expression of 28.1%, as measured by western blot. Accompanying secondary biological endpoints including vector genome copies per nucleus, percent positive fibers, intensity, and reduction in creatine kinase (exploratory) were also met.In the primary functional endpoint, SRP-9001-treated participants showed an increase in NSAA total score compared to placebo at 48 weeks; however, the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.37). At every time point measured, the cohort of SRP-9001 treated participants outperformed the placebo group, and, at 48 weeks, participants in the treatment group demonstrated a statistically significant increase of 1.7 points in NSAA total score compared to baseline (P=0.009), while participants in the placebo group saw an increase of 0.9 points on the NSAA total score compared to baseline, which was not statistically significant (n=21, P=0.1411).In the pre-specified analysis by age-group, by which the randomization was stratified, participants aged 4-5 years at time of treatment with SRP-9001 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in NSAA total score versus the age-matched placebo cohort, achieving a 4.3-point improvement on NSAA at 48 weeks post-treatment from baseline.The results from Study 102 reinforce the "favorable" safety and tolerability profile of SRP-9001, with no new safety signals identified.16:16WRAPX Closing Stock Market SummaryEach of the major indices closed at record highs on Thursday in a momentum trade led by the technology stocks. The Nasdaq Composite outperformed with an impressive 2.6% gain, followed by solid gains in the Russell 2000 (+1.9%), S&P 500 (+1.5%), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%).Risk sentiment broadened out to nine of the 11 S&P 500 sectors. The information technology (+2.7%), consumer discretionary (+1.8%), energy (+1.5%), and financials (+1.5%) sectors were the best-performing sectors; conversely, the utilities (-1.3%) and consumer staples (-0.3%) sectors closed lower.Investors bought yesterday's dip in the broader technology space and continued to bid up shares of Tesla (TSLA 816.04, +60.06, +7.9%), which was upgraded to Sector Perform from Underperform at RBC Capital Mkts after the firm conceded it was wrong about the stock.In addition, the oft-repeated recovery narrative was on display after Democrats flipped both Senate seats in Georgia yesterday, giving them slim majority in the Senate, and the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index rose to a better-than-expected 57.2% in December (Briefing.com consensus 54.7%) from 55.9% in November.The projected Democratic majority in the Senate contributed to the continued selling pressure in longer-dated Treasuries amid the possibility for more fiscal stimulus. These respective yields moved higher.The 10-yr yield increased three basis points to 1.07%, while the 2-yr yield was flat at 0.14%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 89.84. WTI crude futures increased 0.5%, or $0.24, to $50.81/bbl.In other corporate news, shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA 45.26, +2.23, +5.2%) rose 5% after beating top and bottom-line estimates, while DXC Technology (DXC 28.91, +2.46, +9.3%) received an acquisition proposal from French IT firm Atos for reportedly more than $10 billion.Reviewing Thursday's economic data:The ISM Non-Manufacturing Index rose to 57.2% in December (Briefing.com consensus 54.7%) from 55.9% in November. The dividing line between expansion and contraction is 50.0%. The December reading reflects a faster pace of expansion than the prior month, and it is the seventh consecutive reading above 50.0%.The key takeaway from the report is that the Employment Index, which dipped below 50.0%, blemished an otherwise solid snapshot of the services sector in December.Initial claims for the week ending January 2 decreased by 3,000 to 787,000 (Briefing.com consensus 752,000). Continuing claims for the week ending December 26 decreased by 126,000 to 5.072 million.The key takeaway from the report is that initial claims are still coming in at a stubbornly high level, which sends a poor signal about the state of the labor market.The U.S. trade deficit widened to $68.1 billion in November (Briefing.com consensus -$67.1 billion) from an unrevised $63.1 billion in October.The key takeaway from the report is that it showed another increase in exports and imports, indicating an uptick in global trade.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Employment Situation Report for December, Consumer Credit for November, and Wholesale Inventories for November on Friday.Russell 2000 +6.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +1.4% YTDNasdaq Composite +1.4% YTDS&P 500 +1.3% YTD16:14AIRG Airgain reports preliminary Q4 revenue inline with consensus; also announces acquisition of NimbeLink (17.19 -0.08)Co reports in-line preliminary Q4 revenue of $12.8 mln vs. the $12.82 mln S&P Capital IQ consensus.

The Russell 2000 (-0.3%) set an intraday all-time high at the open but closed lower.Briefly, December nonfarm payrolls decreased by 140,000 (Briefing.com consensus +112,000), private sector payrolls decreased by 95,000 (Briefing.com consensus +100,000), and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 6.7%, as expected. The unexpected decline in payrolls was partially offset by large upward revisions to November payrolls.The market presumably interpreted the report as a blip in the labor market recovery due to ongoing vaccination efforts and less consequential to the economic growth outlook due to prospects for more fiscal stimulus. It was also backwards-looking based on the renewed lockdown measures enacted to curb the spread of the coronavirus.In the stock market, the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (+1.8%), real estate (+1.1%), information technology (+0.8%), and utilities (+0.9%) sectors carried the market higher, with Tesla (TSLA 880.02, +63.98, +7.8%) disproportionately aiding the consumer discretionary sector and Nasdaq.On the downside, the materials (-0.5%), financials (-0.2%), industrials (-0.2%), and energy (-0.1%) sectors finished in the red. Micron (MU 77.42, -1.69, -2.1%) shares gave up an early 6% gain and closed lower despite reporting positive earnings results and upbeat guidance.Separately, the S&P 500 briefly turned negative on reports that Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) said he will not support $2000 stimulus checks, but Mr. Manchin quickly clarified that "if the next round of stimulus checks goes out, they should be targeted to those who need it." Stocks recovered.President-elect Biden said he will propose a complete economic package next week that will include a range of issues and said the "price tag will be high."Longer-dated Treasuries continued to face selling pressure amid expectations for economic growth and possibly inflation. The 10-yr yield increased another three basis points to 1.11%, while the 2-yr yield decreased one basis point to 0.13%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 90.06. WTI crude futures increased 2.8%, or $1.44, to $52.25/bbl.Reviewing Friday's economic data:The December employment report disappointed on the headline level as nonfarm payrolls declined by 140,000 (Briefing.com consensus 112,000) against expectations for an increase. However, the drop was partially offset by a large upward revision to November figures and an increase in December average hourly earnings. December private sector payrolls decreased by 95,000 (Briefing.com consensus 100,000). December unemployment rate was unchanged at 6.7% (Briefing.com consensus 6.7%)Capital markets are likely to look past this report and focus on the expected increase in fiscal spending once a new administration is inaugurated, but the December report shows that the labor market is facing an uphill climb.Consumer credit increased by $15.3 bln in November after increasing a revised $4.5 bln (from $7.2 bln) in October.The key takeaway from the report is that revolving credit decreased for the eighth time over the last nine months dating back to February, which preceded the initial pandemic lockdown period taking hold in the U.S.Wholesale inventories were unchanged in November (Briefing.com consensus -0.1%) following an upwardly revised 1.3% increase (from +1.1%) in October.Investors will not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Russell 2000 +5.9% YTDNasdaq Composite +2.4% YTDS&P 500 +1.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +1.6% YTD16:15BOOT Boot Barn guides DecQ EPS and revs above consensus; comps +4.6% (48.58 +1.03)Co issues upside guidance for Q3 (Dec), sees EPS of $0.99, excluding non-recurring items, vs. $0.87 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; sees Q3 (Dec) revs of approx $302.3 mln vs. $297.24 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Same store sales increased +4.6%, including an increase in retail comps of +1.9% and an increase in e-commerce sales of +16.3%.

Treasuries started the day with modest losses that were widened during the first half of action. The selling was undisturbed by the Employment Situation report for December, which disappointed on the headline level, but contained some positive offsetting factors like a larger than expected increase in average hourly earnings and an upward revision to November figures. The market looked past the report, focusing instead on reports that President-elect Biden intends to seek $3 trln in spending, which would include $2 trln in spending on infrastructure and green jobs. Later in the day, it was reported that Democratic Senator Manchin from West Virginia opposes increasing direct payments to $2,000. The Senator's opposition was notable because he is believed to have influence over potential swing votes. The uncertainty lifted Treasuries off their lows, but the bounce was not big. This week's selling widened the 2s10s spread by 18 basis points to 98 bps. The U.S. Dollar Index rose 0.3% to 90.09, rising 0.2% for the week.

The financials (-0.6%), communication services (-0.4%), and materials (-0.6%) sectors lag with modest declines.Specifying the jobs data, December nonfarm payrolls decreased by 140,000 (Briefing.com consensus +112,000), private sector payrolls decreased by 95,000 (Briefing.com consensus +100,000), and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 6.7%, as expected.The disappointing data has been partially offset by large upward revisions to November payrolls, an appreciation for the vaccination efforts that should hopefully reopen the economy later this year, and expectations for more fiscal stimulus under a Biden Administration and Democrat-controlled Congress.On a related note, reports indicate that President-elect Biden will propose a $3 trillion infrastructure package and will prioritize passing $2000 stimulus checks when he takes office. This has supported the continued selling in longer-dated Treasuries where the 10-yr yield is up four basis points to 1.11%.In other positive corporate developments, Union Pacific (UNP 219.15, +6.43, +3.0%) issued upside Q4 revenue guidance, Micron (MU 79.91, +0.82, +1.0%) topped earnings and revenue expectations and issued upside quarterly guidance, and Chevron (CVX 91.77, +1.55, +1.7%) was upgraded to Overweight from Neutral at Piper Sandler.Reviewing today's economic data:The December employment report disappointed on the headline level as nonfarm payrolls declined by 140,000 (Briefing.com consensus 112,000) against expectations for an increase. However, the drop was partially offset by a large upward revision to November figures and an increase in December average hourly earnings. December private sector payrolls decreased by 95,000 (Briefing.com consensus 100,000). December unemployment rate was unchanged at 6.7% (Briefing.com consensus 6.7%)Capital markets are likely to look past this report and focus on the expected increase in fiscal spending once a new administration is inaugurated, but the December report shows that the labor market is facing an uphill climb.Wholesale inventories were unchanged in November (Briefing.com consensus -0.1%) following an upwardly revised 1.3% increase (from +1.1%) in October.12:36EFX Equifax agrees to acquire Kount for $640 mln (182.29 +1.00)Equifax has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Kount, a provider of Artificial Intelligence-driven fraud prevention and digital identity solutions, for $640 mln.

The Nasdaq (+0.7%) and S&P 500 (+0.3%) continue hanging onto gains while the Dow (-0.1%) has turned negative.The early dip from highs represents a pullback after a strong start to 2021. The S&P 500 remains higher by 1.6% for the week while the Russell 2000 has jumped more than 6.0% in the first week of the year.Today's biggest story was the disappointing Employment Situation report for December, but it took a back seat to today's second biggest story, which was an Axios report that President-elect Biden will seek a $3 trln fiscal package that would call for about $2 trln in spending on green jobs and infrastructure.The December jobs report showed the loss of 140,000 payrolls (Briefing.com consensus +112,000) but some of the initial sting was offset by a large upward revision to November data and a larger than expected increase in average hourly earnings. Still, the report painted a bland picture of the labor market in December. However, the stock market is looking past the news thanks to the prospect of more fiscal spending.Seven out of eleven sectors trade with early gains, led by consumer discretionary (+1.5%) and real estate (+1.2%). On the downside, communication services (-0.7%) and financials (-0.4%) are the two weakest performers.10:24BAYRY Bayer AG announces FDA approval of sNDA for NUBEQA (15.84 -0.37)Bayer today announced that the FDA approved a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to add overall survival (OS) and other secondary endpoint data from the Phase III ARAMIS trial to the NUBEQA (darolutamide) Prescribing Information.

Preliminary gold production for the fourth quarter of 2020 increased 16% to 138,220 ounces compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.Preliminary 2020 gold production at Lamaque exceeded guidance despite a three-week shutdown in early Spring related to government-mandated COVID-19 operating restrictions. The strong performance at Lamaque was partially offset by lower labour availability impacting leach pad flow rates at Kisladag during the second quarter. Kisladag finished the year with strong fourth-quarter gold production, driven by improving heap leach performance.The Company also announced today that Steve Reid has been appointed Chair of the Board, replacing George Albino, who will remain on the Eldorado Board as a Director. Steve Reid has served as a Director on the Eldorado Board since May 2013. He has over 40 years of experience in the mineral resource industry.

Before joining Goldcorp, Mr. Reid spent 13 years at Placer Dome in numerous corporate, mine management and operating roles.06:00BNTX BioNTech and Pfizer (PFE) study shows its vaccine elicits antibodies that neutralize SARS-CoV-2 with a mutation associated with rapid transmission (93.69 )Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech SE (BNTX) announced results from an in vitro study conducted by Pfizer and the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) that shows the antibodies from people who have received the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine effectively neutralize SARS-CoV-2 with a key mutation that is also found in two highly transmissible strains. The results were published on the preprint server bioRxiv and are available here.Rapidly spreading variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, initially in the United Kingdom and South Africa. These variants have multiple mutations in their spike or S glycoproteins, which are key targets of virus neutralizing antibodies. Though these two rapidly spreading viruses are different, they share the N501Y mutation, which is located in the receptor binding site of the spike protein and results in the virus's spike protein binding more tightly to its receptor. It has been shown to infect mice more efficiently.iTo determine if sera of people who had received the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine could neutralize SARS-CoV-2 with the N501Y mutation, a virus with this substitution was generated in UTMB's laboratory. The sera of 20 participants from the previously reported Phase 3 trial neutralized the virus with the mutation as well as they neutralized virus without the mutation. While the virus tested in this experiment did not include the full set of spike mutations found on the rapidly spreading strains in the U.K. or South Africa, neutralization of virus with the N501Y mutation by the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine-elicited human sera is consistent with preserved neutralization of a panel of 15 pseudoviruses bearing spikes with other mutations found in circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains. This indicates that the key N501Y mutation, which is found in the emerging U.K and South Africa variants, does not create resistance to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine induced immune responses. Pfizer, BioNTech, and UTMB are encouraged by these early, in vitro study findings. Further data are needed to monitor the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine's effectiveness in preventing COVID-19 caused by new virus variants. If the virus mutates such that an update to the vaccine is required to continue to confer protection against COVID-19, we believe that the flexibility of BioNTech's proprietary mRNA vaccine platform is well suited to enable an adjustment to the vaccine.06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- Markets trade higher ahead of US jobs reportThe global equity markets are mostly higher with US futures pointing to modest gains to begin the day.

SRP-9001 is an investigational gene transfer therapy intended to deliver its micro-dystrophin-encoding gene to muscle tissue for the targeted production of the micro-dystrophin protein.At 12 weeks post-treatment compared to baseline, the study met its primary biological endpoint of micro-dystrophin protein expression (P<0.0001). Participants who received SRP-9001 (n=20) had mean micro-dystrophin expression of 28.1%, as measured by western blot. Accompanying secondary biological endpoints including vector genome copies per nucleus, percent positive fibers, intensity, and reduction in creatine kinase (exploratory) were also met.In the primary functional endpoint, SRP-9001-treated participants showed an increase in NSAA total score compared to placebo at 48 weeks; however, the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.37). At every time point measured, the cohort of SRP-9001 treated participants outperformed the placebo group, and, at 48 weeks, participants in the treatment group demonstrated a statistically significant increase of 1.7 points in NSAA total score compared to baseline (P=0.009), while participants in the placebo group saw an increase of 0.9 points on the NSAA total score compared to baseline, which was not statistically significant (n=21, P=0.1411).In the pre-specified analysis by age-group, by which the randomization was stratified, participants aged 4-5 years at time of treatment with SRP-9001 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in NSAA total score versus the age-matched placebo cohort, achieving a 4.3-point improvement on NSAA at 48 weeks post-treatment from baseline.The results from Study 102 reinforce the "favorable" safety and tolerability profile of SRP-9001, with no new safety signals identified.16:16WRAPX Closing Stock Market SummaryEach of the major indices closed at record highs on Thursday in a momentum trade led by the technology stocks. The Nasdaq Composite outperformed with an impressive 2.6% gain, followed by solid gains in the Russell 2000 (+1.9%), S&P 500 (+1.5%), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%).Risk sentiment broadened out to nine of the 11 S&P 500 sectors. The information technology (+2.7%), consumer discretionary (+1.8%), energy (+1.5%), and financials (+1.5%) sectors were the best-performing sectors; conversely, the utilities (-1.3%) and consumer staples (-0.3%) sectors closed lower.Investors bought yesterday's dip in the broader technology space and continued to bid up shares of Tesla (TSLA 816.04, +60.06, +7.9%), which was upgraded to Sector Perform from Underperform at RBC Capital Mkts after the firm conceded it was wrong about the stock.In addition, the oft-repeated recovery narrative was on display after Democrats flipped both Senate seats in Georgia yesterday, giving them slim majority in the Senate, and the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index rose to a better-than-expected 57.2% in December (Briefing.com consensus 54.7%) from 55.9% in November.The projected Democratic majority in the Senate contributed to the continued selling pressure in longer-dated Treasuries amid the possibility for more fiscal stimulus. These respective yields moved higher.The 10-yr yield increased three basis points to 1.07%, while the 2-yr yield was flat at 0.14%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 89.84. WTI crude futures increased 0.5%, or $0.24, to $50.81/bbl.In other corporate news, shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA 45.26, +2.23, +5.2%) rose 5% after beating top and bottom-line estimates, while DXC Technology (DXC 28.91, +2.46, +9.3%) received an acquisition proposal from French IT firm Atos for reportedly more than $10 billion.Reviewing Thursday's economic data:The ISM Non-Manufacturing Index rose to 57.2% in December (Briefing.com consensus 54.7%) from 55.9% in November. The dividing line between expansion and contraction is 50.0%. The December reading reflects a faster pace of expansion than the prior month, and it is the seventh consecutive reading above 50.0%.The key takeaway from the report is that the Employment Index, which dipped below 50.0%, blemished an otherwise solid snapshot of the services sector in December.Initial claims for the week ending January 2 decreased by 3,000 to 787,000 (Briefing.com consensus 752,000). Continuing claims for the week ending December 26 decreased by 126,000 to 5.072 million.The key takeaway from the report is that initial claims are still coming in at a stubbornly high level, which sends a poor signal about the state of the labor market.The U.S. trade deficit widened to $68.1 billion in November (Briefing.com consensus -$67.1 billion) from an unrevised $63.1 billion in October.The key takeaway from the report is that it showed another increase in exports and imports, indicating an uptick in global trade.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Employment Situation Report for December, Consumer Credit for November, and Wholesale Inventories for November on Friday.Russell 2000 +6.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +1.4% YTDNasdaq Composite +1.4% YTDS&P 500 +1.3% YTD16:14AIRG Airgain reports preliminary Q4 revenue inline with consensus; also announces acquisition of NimbeLink (17.19 -0.08)Co reports in-line preliminary Q4 revenue of $12.8 mln vs. the $12.82 mln S&P Capital IQ consensus.

The Russell 2000 (-0.3%) set an intraday all-time high at the open but closed lower.Briefly, December nonfarm payrolls decreased by 140,000 (Briefing.com consensus +112,000), private sector payrolls decreased by 95,000 (Briefing.com consensus +100,000), and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 6.7%, as expected. The unexpected decline in payrolls was partially offset by large upward revisions to November payrolls.The market presumably interpreted the report as a blip in the labor market recovery due to ongoing vaccination efforts and less consequential to the economic growth outlook due to prospects for more fiscal stimulus. It was also backwards-looking based on the renewed lockdown measures enacted to curb the spread of the coronavirus.In the stock market, the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (+1.8%), real estate (+1.1%), information technology (+0.8%), and utilities (+0.9%) sectors carried the market higher, with Tesla (TSLA 880.02, +63.98, +7.8%) disproportionately aiding the consumer discretionary sector and Nasdaq.On the downside, the materials (-0.5%), financials (-0.2%), industrials (-0.2%), and energy (-0.1%) sectors finished in the red. Micron (MU 77.42, -1.69, -2.1%) shares gave up an early 6% gain and closed lower despite reporting positive earnings results and upbeat guidance.Separately, the S&P 500 briefly turned negative on reports that Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) said he will not support $2000 stimulus checks, but Mr. Manchin quickly clarified that "if the next round of stimulus checks goes out, they should be targeted to those who need it." Stocks recovered.President-elect Biden said he will propose a complete economic package next week that will include a range of issues and said the "price tag will be high."Longer-dated Treasuries continued to face selling pressure amid expectations for economic growth and possibly inflation. The 10-yr yield increased another three basis points to 1.11%, while the 2-yr yield decreased one basis point to 0.13%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 90.06. WTI crude futures increased 2.8%, or $1.44, to $52.25/bbl.Reviewing Friday's economic data:The December employment report disappointed on the headline level as nonfarm payrolls declined by 140,000 (Briefing.com consensus 112,000) against expectations for an increase. However, the drop was partially offset by a large upward revision to November figures and an increase in December average hourly earnings. December private sector payrolls decreased by 95,000 (Briefing.com consensus 100,000). December unemployment rate was unchanged at 6.7% (Briefing.com consensus 6.7%)Capital markets are likely to look past this report and focus on the expected increase in fiscal spending once a new administration is inaugurated, but the December report shows that the labor market is facing an uphill climb.Consumer credit increased by $15.3 bln in November after increasing a revised $4.5 bln (from $7.2 bln) in October.The key takeaway from the report is that revolving credit decreased for the eighth time over the last nine months dating back to February, which preceded the initial pandemic lockdown period taking hold in the U.S.Wholesale inventories were unchanged in November (Briefing.com consensus -0.1%) following an upwardly revised 1.3% increase (from +1.1%) in October.Investors will not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Russell 2000 +5.9% YTDNasdaq Composite +2.4% YTDS&P 500 +1.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +1.6% YTD16:15BOOT Boot Barn guides DecQ EPS and revs above consensus; comps +4.6% (48.58 +1.03)Co issues upside guidance for Q3 (Dec), sees EPS of $0.99, excluding non-recurring items, vs. $0.87 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; sees Q3 (Dec) revs of approx $302.3 mln vs. $297.24 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Same store sales increased +4.6%, including an increase in retail comps of +1.9% and an increase in e-commerce sales of +16.3%.

Treasuries started the day with modest losses that were widened during the first half of action. The selling was undisturbed by the Employment Situation report for December, which disappointed on the headline level, but contained some positive offsetting factors like a larger than expected increase in average hourly earnings and an upward revision to November figures. The market looked past the report, focusing instead on reports that President-elect Biden intends to seek $3 trln in spending, which would include $2 trln in spending on infrastructure and green jobs. Later in the day, it was reported that Democratic Senator Manchin from West Virginia opposes increasing direct payments to $2,000. The Senator's opposition was notable because he is believed to have influence over potential swing votes. The uncertainty lifted Treasuries off their lows, but the bounce was not big. This week's selling widened the 2s10s spread by 18 basis points to 98 bps. The U.S. Dollar Index rose 0.3% to 90.09, rising 0.2% for the week.

Four of the five largest components by weight trade lower, weighing the sector down. Extension of this week's underperformance. The sector is now down 1.0% for the week, which leaves the group only ahead of real estate (+0.8%; -2.8% week-to-date), consumer staples (-0.2%; -1.7% week-to-date), and utilities (+0.5%; -1.0% week-to-date) on this week's leaderboard.Notable movers:Fox Corporation (FOXA 29.99, -0.95, -3.1%): weakest performer in the sector, deepening its pullback from a seven-month high. Twitter (TWTR 50.76, -1.57, -3.0%): falling to one-month low. Verizon (VZ 57.48, -1.06, -1.8%): falling below its 200-day moving average (57.86). AT&T (T 28.86, -0.53, -1.8%): falling below its 200-day (29.44) and 50-day moving averages (28.91). Facebook (FB 265.89, -2.86, -1.1%): returning to yesterday's session low. Disney (DIS 177.70, -0.88, -0.5%): slipping past yesterday's low despite being upgraded to Neutral from Sell at Lightshed Partners. DISH Network (DISH 32.98, +0.56, +1.7%): best performer in the sector, rising to its best level since mid-December.12:58SCANX Earnings Out Next WeekMonday (Jan 11) Morning: AZZ CMC Afternoon: SNX Tuesday (Jan 12) Morning: ACI Afternoon: KBH Wednesday (Jan 13) Morning: INFO SJR Afternoon: WAFD Thursday (Jan 14) Morning: APHA BLK DAL FRC TSM Afternoon: PRGS Friday (Jan 15) Morning: C JPM PNC WFC12:58WRAPX Midday Market Summary: Another record-setting advance despite weak jobs dataThe S&P 500 (+0.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+0.6%), and Russell 2000 (+0.1%) set fresh all-time highs at the open despite a weak December employment report, but they are off prior highs and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.2%) is trading in negative territory.Currently, the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (+1.5%), real estate (+0.8%), energy (+0.6%), and information technology (+0.4%) sectors are leading the broader advance, with the former driven higher by Tesla (TSLA 881.72, +65.61, +8.0%) again. The financials (-0.6%), communication services (-0.4%), and materials (-0.6%) sectors lag with modest declines.Specifying the jobs data, December nonfarm payrolls decreased by 140,000 (Briefing.com consensus +112,000), private sector payrolls decreased by 95,000 (Briefing.com consensus +100,000), and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 6.7%, as expected.The disappointing data has been partially offset by large upward revisions to November payrolls, an appreciation for the vaccination efforts that should hopefully reopen the economy later this year, and expectations for more fiscal stimulus under a Biden Administration and Democrat-controlled Congress.On a related note, reports indicate that President-elect Biden will propose a $3 trillion infrastructure package and will prioritize passing $2000 stimulus checks when he takes office. This has supported the continued selling in longer-dated Treasuries where the 10-yr yield is up four basis points to 1.11%.In other positive corporate developments, Union Pacific (UNP 219.15, +6.43, +3.0%) issued upside Q4 revenue guidance, Micron (MU 79.91, +0.82, +1.0%) topped earnings and revenue expectations and issued upside quarterly guidance, and Chevron (CVX 91.77, +1.55, +1.7%) was upgraded to Overweight from Neutral at Piper Sandler.Reviewing today's economic data:The December employment report disappointed on the headline level as nonfarm payrolls declined by 140,000 (Briefing.com consensus 112,000) against expectations for an increase. However, the drop was partially offset by a large upward revision to November figures and an increase in December average hourly earnings. December private sector payrolls decreased by 95,000 (Briefing.com consensus 100,000). December unemployment rate was unchanged at 6.7% (Briefing.com consensus 6.7%)Capital markets are likely to look past this report and focus on the expected increase in fiscal spending once a new administration is inaugurated, but the December report shows that the labor market is facing an uphill climb.Wholesale inventories were unchanged in November (Briefing.com consensus -0.1%) following an upwardly revised 1.3% increase (from +1.1%) in October.12:36EFX Equifax agrees to acquire Kount for $640 mln (182.29 +1.00)Equifax has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Kount, a provider of Artificial Intelligence-driven fraud prevention and digital identity solutions, for $640 mln.

The largest sector member-Amazon (AMZN 3150.94, -11.22, -0.4%)-holds a modest loss but seven of the next eight largest components sport solid gains. Continuation of this week's show of relative strength. The sector has extended this week's gain to 3.3% versus a 1.5% week-to-date gain in the S&P 500 (+0.2%).Notable movers:Etsy (ETSY 176.76, +5.97, +3.5%): best performer in the sector, rising toward its high from Monday. CarMax (KMX 102.64, +2.34, +2.3%): rising to its best level since late September. L Brands (LB 47.24, +1.07, +2.3%): rising to its best level since March 2018 after Telsey Advisory Group raised its target for the stock to $50 after the company issued above-consensus guidance for Q4.

The Nasdaq (+0.7%) and S&P 500 (+0.3%) continue hanging onto gains while the Dow (-0.1%) has turned negative.The early dip from highs represents a pullback after a strong start to 2021. The S&P 500 remains higher by 1.6% for the week while the Russell 2000 has jumped more than 6.0% in the first week of the year.Today's biggest story was the disappointing Employment Situation report for December, but it took a back seat to today's second biggest story, which was an Axios report that President-elect Biden will seek a $3 trln fiscal package that would call for about $2 trln in spending on green jobs and infrastructure.The December jobs report showed the loss of 140,000 payrolls (Briefing.com consensus +112,000) but some of the initial sting was offset by a large upward revision to November data and a larger than expected increase in average hourly earnings. Still, the report painted a bland picture of the labor market in December. However, the stock market is looking past the news thanks to the prospect of more fiscal spending.Seven out of eleven sectors trade with early gains, led by consumer discretionary (+1.5%) and real estate (+1.2%). On the downside, communication services (-0.7%) and financials (-0.4%) are the two weakest performers.10:24BAYRY Bayer AG announces FDA approval of sNDA for NUBEQA (15.84 -0.37)Bayer today announced that the FDA approved a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to add overall survival (OS) and other secondary endpoint data from the Phase III ARAMIS trial to the NUBEQA (darolutamide) Prescribing Information.

On November 30, 2020, the judge presiding over this legacy case issued an order requiring both parties to submit estimates of damages in respect of these mortgages which could result in a judgment against Credit Suisse of up to approximately $680 million.

The results were published on the preprint server bioRxiv and are available here.Rapidly spreading variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, initially in the United Kingdom and South Africa. These variants have multiple mutations in their spike or S glycoproteins, which are key targets of virus neutralizing antibodies. Though these two rapidly spreading viruses are different, they share the N501Y mutation, which is located in the receptor binding site of the spike protein and results in the virus's spike protein binding more tightly to its receptor. It has been shown to infect mice more efficiently.iTo determine if sera of people who had received the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine could neutralize SARS-CoV-2 with the N501Y mutation, a virus with this substitution was generated in UTMB's laboratory. The sera of 20 participants from the previously reported Phase 3 trial neutralized the virus with the mutation as well as they neutralized virus without the mutation. While the virus tested in this experiment did not include the full set of spike mutations found on the rapidly spreading strains in the U.K. or South Africa, neutralization of virus with the N501Y mutation by the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine-elicited human sera is consistent with preserved neutralization of a panel of 15 pseudoviruses bearing spikes with other mutations found in circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains. This indicates that the key N501Y mutation, which is found in the emerging U.K and South Africa variants, does not create resistance to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine induced immune responses. Pfizer, BioNTech, and UTMB are encouraged by these early, in vitro study findings. Further data are needed to monitor the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine's effectiveness in preventing COVID-19 caused by new virus variants. If the virus mutates such that an update to the vaccine is required to continue to confer protection against COVID-19, we believe that the flexibility of BioNTech's proprietary mRNA vaccine platform is well suited to enable an adjustment to the vaccine.06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- Markets trade higher ahead of US jobs reportThe global equity markets are mostly higher with US futures pointing to modest gains to begin the day.

Accompanying secondary biological endpoints including vector genome copies per nucleus, percent positive fibers, intensity, and reduction in creatine kinase (exploratory) were also met.In the primary functional endpoint, SRP-9001-treated participants showed an increase in NSAA total score compared to placebo at 48 weeks; however, the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.37). At every time point measured, the cohort of SRP-9001 treated participants outperformed the placebo group, and, at 48 weeks, participants in the treatment group demonstrated a statistically significant increase of 1.7 points in NSAA total score compared to baseline (P=0.009), while participants in the placebo group saw an increase of 0.9 points on the NSAA total score compared to baseline, which was not statistically significant (n=21, P=0.1411).In the pre-specified analysis by age-group, by which the randomization was stratified, participants aged 4-5 years at time of treatment with SRP-9001 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in NSAA total score versus the age-matched placebo cohort, achieving a 4.3-point improvement on NSAA at 48 weeks post-treatment from baseline.The results from Study 102 reinforce the "favorable" safety and tolerability profile of SRP-9001, with no new safety signals identified.16:16WRAPX Closing Stock Market SummaryEach of the major indices closed at record highs on Thursday in a momentum trade led by the technology stocks. The Nasdaq Composite outperformed with an impressive 2.6% gain, followed by solid gains in the Russell 2000 (+1.9%), S&P 500 (+1.5%), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%).Risk sentiment broadened out to nine of the 11 S&P 500 sectors. The information technology (+2.7%), consumer discretionary (+1.8%), energy (+1.5%), and financials (+1.5%) sectors were the best-performing sectors; conversely, the utilities (-1.3%) and consumer staples (-0.3%) sectors closed lower.Investors bought yesterday's dip in the broader technology space and continued to bid up shares of Tesla (TSLA 816.04, +60.06, +7.9%), which was upgraded to Sector Perform from Underperform at RBC Capital Mkts after the firm conceded it was wrong about the stock.In addition, the oft-repeated recovery narrative was on display after Democrats flipped both Senate seats in Georgia yesterday, giving them slim majority in the Senate, and the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index rose to a better-than-expected 57.2% in December (Briefing.com consensus 54.7%) from 55.9% in November.The projected Democratic majority in the Senate contributed to the continued selling pressure in longer-dated Treasuries amid the possibility for more fiscal stimulus. These respective yields moved higher.The 10-yr yield increased three basis points to 1.07%, while the 2-yr yield was flat at 0.14%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 89.84. WTI crude futures increased 0.5%, or $0.24, to $50.81/bbl.In other corporate news, shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA 45.26, +2.23, +5.2%) rose 5% after beating top and bottom-line estimates, while DXC Technology (DXC 28.91, +2.46, +9.3%) received an acquisition proposal from French IT firm Atos for reportedly more than $10 billion.Reviewing Thursday's economic data:The ISM Non-Manufacturing Index rose to 57.2% in December (Briefing.com consensus 54.7%) from 55.9% in November. The dividing line between expansion and contraction is 50.0%. The December reading reflects a faster pace of expansion than the prior month, and it is the seventh consecutive reading above 50.0%.The key takeaway from the report is that the Employment Index, which dipped below 50.0%, blemished an otherwise solid snapshot of the services sector in December.Initial claims for the week ending January 2 decreased by 3,000 to 787,000 (Briefing.com consensus 752,000). Continuing claims for the week ending December 26 decreased by 126,000 to 5.072 million.The key takeaway from the report is that initial claims are still coming in at a stubbornly high level, which sends a poor signal about the state of the labor market.The U.S. trade deficit widened to $68.1 billion in November (Briefing.com consensus -$67.1 billion) from an unrevised $63.1 billion in October.The key takeaway from the report is that it showed another increase in exports and imports, indicating an uptick in global trade.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Employment Situation Report for December, Consumer Credit for November, and Wholesale Inventories for November on Friday.Russell 2000 +6.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +1.4% YTDNasdaq Composite +1.4% YTDS&P 500 +1.3% YTD16:14AIRG Airgain reports preliminary Q4 revenue inline with consensus; also announces acquisition of NimbeLink (17.19 -0.08)Co reports in-line preliminary Q4 revenue of $12.8 mln vs. the $12.82 mln S&P Capital IQ consensus.

The Russell 2000 (-0.3%) set an intraday all-time high at the open but closed lower.Briefly, December nonfarm payrolls decreased by 140,000 (Briefing.com consensus +112,000), private sector payrolls decreased by 95,000 (Briefing.com consensus +100,000), and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 6.7%, as expected. The unexpected decline in payrolls was partially offset by large upward revisions to November payrolls.The market presumably interpreted the report as a blip in the labor market recovery due to ongoing vaccination efforts and less consequential to the economic growth outlook due to prospects for more fiscal stimulus. It was also backwards-looking based on the renewed lockdown measures enacted to curb the spread of the coronavirus.In the stock market, the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (+1.8%), real estate (+1.1%), information technology (+0.8%), and utilities (+0.9%) sectors carried the market higher, with Tesla (TSLA 880.02, +63.98, +7.8%) disproportionately aiding the consumer discretionary sector and Nasdaq.On the downside, the materials (-0.5%), financials (-0.2%), industrials (-0.2%), and energy (-0.1%) sectors finished in the red. Micron (MU 77.42, -1.69, -2.1%) shares gave up an early 6% gain and closed lower despite reporting positive earnings results and upbeat guidance.Separately, the S&P 500 briefly turned negative on reports that Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) said he will not support $2000 stimulus checks, but Mr. Manchin quickly clarified that "if the next round of stimulus checks goes out, they should be targeted to those who need it." Stocks recovered.President-elect Biden said he will propose a complete economic package next week that will include a range of issues and said the "price tag will be high."Longer-dated Treasuries continued to face selling pressure amid expectations for economic growth and possibly inflation. The 10-yr yield increased another three basis points to 1.11%, while the 2-yr yield decreased one basis point to 0.13%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 90.06. WTI crude futures increased 2.8%, or $1.44, to $52.25/bbl.Reviewing Friday's economic data:The December employment report disappointed on the headline level as nonfarm payrolls declined by 140,000 (Briefing.com consensus 112,000) against expectations for an increase. However, the drop was partially offset by a large upward revision to November figures and an increase in December average hourly earnings. December private sector payrolls decreased by 95,000 (Briefing.com consensus 100,000). December unemployment rate was unchanged at 6.7% (Briefing.com consensus 6.7%)Capital markets are likely to look past this report and focus on the expected increase in fiscal spending once a new administration is inaugurated, but the December report shows that the labor market is facing an uphill climb.Consumer credit increased by $15.3 bln in November after increasing a revised $4.5 bln (from $7.2 bln) in October.The key takeaway from the report is that revolving credit decreased for the eighth time over the last nine months dating back to February, which preceded the initial pandemic lockdown period taking hold in the U.S.Wholesale inventories were unchanged in November (Briefing.com consensus -0.1%) following an upwardly revised 1.3% increase (from +1.1%) in October.Investors will not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Russell 2000 +5.9% YTDNasdaq Composite +2.4% YTDS&P 500 +1.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +1.6% YTD16:15BOOT Boot Barn guides DecQ EPS and revs above consensus; comps +4.6% (48.58 +1.03)Co issues upside guidance for Q3 (Dec), sees EPS of $0.99, excluding non-recurring items, vs. $0.87 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; sees Q3 (Dec) revs of approx $302.3 mln vs. $297.24 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Same store sales increased +4.6%, including an increase in retail comps of +1.9% and an increase in e-commerce sales of +16.3%.

Treasuries started the day with modest losses that were widened during the first half of action. The selling was undisturbed by the Employment Situation report for December, which disappointed on the headline level, but contained some positive offsetting factors like a larger than expected increase in average hourly earnings and an upward revision to November figures. The market looked past the report, focusing instead on reports that President-elect Biden intends to seek $3 trln in spending, which would include $2 trln in spending on infrastructure and green jobs. Later in the day, it was reported that Democratic Senator Manchin from West Virginia opposes increasing direct payments to $2,000. The Senator's opposition was notable because he is believed to have influence over potential swing votes. The uncertainty lifted Treasuries off their lows, but the bounce was not big. This week's selling widened the 2s10s spread by 18 basis points to 98 bps. The U.S. Dollar Index rose 0.3% to 90.09, rising 0.2% for the week.

Four of the five largest components by weight trade lower, weighing the sector down. Extension of this week's underperformance. The sector is now down 1.0% for the week, which leaves the group only ahead of real estate (+0.8%; -2.8% week-to-date), consumer staples (-0.2%; -1.7% week-to-date), and utilities (+0.5%; -1.0% week-to-date) on this week's leaderboard.Notable movers:Fox Corporation (FOXA 29.99, -0.95, -3.1%): weakest performer in the sector, deepening its pullback from a seven-month high. Twitter (TWTR 50.76, -1.57, -3.0%): falling to one-month low. Verizon (VZ 57.48, -1.06, -1.8%): falling below its 200-day moving average (57.86). AT&T (T 28.86, -0.53, -1.8%): falling below its 200-day (29.44) and 50-day moving averages (28.91). Facebook (FB 265.89, -2.86, -1.1%): returning to yesterday's session low. Disney (DIS 177.70, -0.88, -0.5%): slipping past yesterday's low despite being upgraded to Neutral from Sell at Lightshed Partners. DISH Network (DISH 32.98, +0.56, +1.7%): best performer in the sector, rising to its best level since mid-December.12:58SCANX Earnings Out Next WeekMonday (Jan 11) Morning: AZZ CMC Afternoon: SNX Tuesday (Jan 12) Morning: ACI Afternoon: KBH Wednesday (Jan 13) Morning: INFO SJR Afternoon: WAFD Thursday (Jan 14) Morning: APHA BLK DAL FRC TSM Afternoon: PRGS Friday (Jan 15) Morning: C JPM PNC WFC12:58WRAPX Midday Market Summary: Another record-setting advance despite weak jobs dataThe S&P 500 (+0.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+0.6%), and Russell 2000 (+0.1%) set fresh all-time highs at the open despite a weak December employment report, but they are off prior highs and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.2%) is trading in negative territory.Currently, the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (+1.5%), real estate (+0.8%), energy (+0.6%), and information technology (+0.4%) sectors are leading the broader advance, with the former driven higher by Tesla (TSLA 881.72, +65.61, +8.0%) again. The financials (-0.6%), communication services (-0.4%), and materials (-0.6%) sectors lag with modest declines.Specifying the jobs data, December nonfarm payrolls decreased by 140,000 (Briefing.com consensus +112,000), private sector payrolls decreased by 95,000 (Briefing.com consensus +100,000), and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 6.7%, as expected.The disappointing data has been partially offset by large upward revisions to November payrolls, an appreciation for the vaccination efforts that should hopefully reopen the economy later this year, and expectations for more fiscal stimulus under a Biden Administration and Democrat-controlled Congress.On a related note, reports indicate that President-elect Biden will propose a $3 trillion infrastructure package and will prioritize passing $2000 stimulus checks when he takes office. This has supported the continued selling in longer-dated Treasuries where the 10-yr yield is up four basis points to 1.11%.In other positive corporate developments, Union Pacific (UNP 219.15, +6.43, +3.0%) issued upside Q4 revenue guidance, Micron (MU 79.91, +0.82, +1.0%) topped earnings and revenue expectations and issued upside quarterly guidance, and Chevron (CVX 91.77, +1.55, +1.7%) was upgraded to Overweight from Neutral at Piper Sandler.Reviewing today's economic data:The December employment report disappointed on the headline level as nonfarm payrolls declined by 140,000 (Briefing.com consensus 112,000) against expectations for an increase. However, the drop was partially offset by a large upward revision to November figures and an increase in December average hourly earnings. December private sector payrolls decreased by 95,000 (Briefing.com consensus 100,000). December unemployment rate was unchanged at 6.7% (Briefing.com consensus 6.7%)Capital markets are likely to look past this report and focus on the expected increase in fiscal spending once a new administration is inaugurated, but the December report shows that the labor market is facing an uphill climb.Wholesale inventories were unchanged in November (Briefing.com consensus -0.1%) following an upwardly revised 1.3% increase (from +1.1%) in October.12:36EFX Equifax agrees to acquire Kount for $640 mln (182.29 +1.00)Equifax has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Kount, a provider of Artificial Intelligence-driven fraud prevention and digital identity solutions, for $640 mln.

The largest sector member-Amazon (AMZN 3150.94, -11.22, -0.4%)-holds a modest loss but seven of the next eight largest components sport solid gains. Continuation of this week's show of relative strength. The sector has extended this week's gain to 3.3% versus a 1.5% week-to-date gain in the S&P 500 (+0.2%).Notable movers:Etsy (ETSY 176.76, +5.97, +3.5%): best performer in the sector, rising toward its high from Monday. CarMax (KMX 102.64, +2.34, +2.3%): rising to its best level since late September.

The Nasdaq (+0.7%) and S&P 500 (+0.3%) continue hanging onto gains while the Dow (-0.1%) has turned negative.The early dip from highs represents a pullback after a strong start to 2021. The S&P 500 remains higher by 1.6% for the week while the Russell 2000 has jumped more than 6.0% in the first week of the year.Today's biggest story was the disappointing Employment Situation report for December, but it took a back seat to today's second biggest story, which was an Axios report that President-elect Biden will seek a $3 trln fiscal package that would call for about $2 trln in spending on green jobs and infrastructure.The December jobs report showed the loss of 140,000 payrolls (Briefing.com consensus +112,000) but some of the initial sting was offset by a large upward revision to November data and a larger than expected increase in average hourly earnings. Still, the report painted a bland picture of the labor market in December. However, the stock market is looking past the news thanks to the prospect of more fiscal spending.Seven out of eleven sectors trade with early gains, led by consumer discretionary (+1.5%) and real estate (+1.2%). On the downside, communication services (-0.7%) and financials (-0.4%) are the two weakest performers.10:24BAYRY Bayer AG announces FDA approval of sNDA for NUBEQA (15.84 -0.37)Bayer today announced that the FDA approved a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to add overall survival (OS) and other secondary endpoint data from the Phase III ARAMIS trial to the NUBEQA (darolutamide) Prescribing Information.

The results were published on the preprint server bioRxiv and are available here.Rapidly spreading variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, initially in the United Kingdom and South Africa. These variants have multiple mutations in their spike or S glycoproteins, which are key targets of virus neutralizing antibodies. Though these two rapidly spreading viruses are different, they share the N501Y mutation, which is located in the receptor binding site of the spike protein and results in the virus's spike protein binding more tightly to its receptor. It has been shown to infect mice more efficiently.iTo determine if sera of people who had received the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine could neutralize SARS-CoV-2 with the N501Y mutation, a virus with this substitution was generated in UTMB's laboratory. The sera of 20 participants from the previously reported Phase 3 trial neutralized the virus with the mutation as well as they neutralized virus without the mutation. While the virus tested in this experiment did not include the full set of spike mutations found on the rapidly spreading strains in the U.K. or South Africa, neutralization of virus with the N501Y mutation by the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine-elicited human sera is consistent with preserved neutralization of a panel of 15 pseudoviruses bearing spikes with other mutations found in circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains. This indicates that the key N501Y mutation, which is found in the emerging U.K and South Africa variants, does not create resistance to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine induced immune responses. Pfizer, BioNTech, and UTMB are encouraged by these early, in vitro study findings. Further data are needed to monitor the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine's effectiveness in preventing COVID-19 caused by new virus variants. If the virus mutates such that an update to the vaccine is required to continue to confer protection against COVID-19, we believe that the flexibility of BioNTech's proprietary mRNA vaccine platform is well suited to enable an adjustment to the vaccine.06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- Markets trade higher ahead of US jobs reportThe global equity markets are mostly higher with US futures pointing to modest gains to begin the day.

SRP-9001 is an investigational gene transfer therapy intended to deliver its micro-dystrophin-encoding gene to muscle tissue for the targeted production of the micro-dystrophin protein.At 12 weeks post-treatment compared to baseline, the study met its primary biological endpoint of micro-dystrophin protein expression (P<0.0001). Participants who received SRP-9001 (n=20) had mean micro-dystrophin expression of 28.1%, as measured by western blot. Accompanying secondary biological endpoints including vector genome copies per nucleus, percent positive fibers, intensity, and reduction in creatine kinase (exploratory) were also met.In the primary functional endpoint, SRP-9001-treated participants showed an increase in NSAA total score compared to placebo at 48 weeks; however, the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.37). At every time point measured, the cohort of SRP-9001 treated participants outperformed the placebo group, and, at 48 weeks, participants in the treatment group demonstrated a statistically significant increase of 1.7 points in NSAA total score compared to baseline (P=0.009), while participants in the placebo group saw an increase of 0.9 points on the NSAA total score compared to baseline, which was not statistically significant (n=21, P=0.1411).In the pre-specified analysis by age-group, by which the randomization was stratified, participants aged 4-5 years at time of treatment with SRP-9001 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in NSAA total score versus the age-matched placebo cohort, achieving a 4.3-point improvement on NSAA at 48 weeks post-treatment from baseline.The results from Study 102 reinforce the "favorable" safety and tolerability profile of SRP-9001, with no new safety signals identified.16:16WRAPX Closing Stock Market SummaryEach of the major indices closed at record highs on Thursday in a momentum trade led by the technology stocks. The Nasdaq Composite outperformed with an impressive 2.6% gain, followed by solid gains in the Russell 2000 (+1.9%), S&P 500 (+1.5%), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%).Risk sentiment broadened out to nine of the 11 S&P 500 sectors. The information technology (+2.7%), consumer discretionary (+1.8%), energy (+1.5%), and financials (+1.5%) sectors were the best-performing sectors; conversely, the utilities (-1.3%) and consumer staples (-0.3%) sectors closed lower.Investors bought yesterday's dip in the broader technology space and continued to bid up shares of Tesla (TSLA 816.04, +60.06, +7.9%), which was upgraded to Sector Perform from Underperform at RBC Capital Mkts after the firm conceded it was wrong about the stock.In addition, the oft-repeated recovery narrative was on display after Democrats flipped both Senate seats in Georgia yesterday, giving them slim majority in the Senate, and the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index rose to a better-than-expected 57.2% in December (Briefing.com consensus 54.7%) from 55.9% in November.The projected Democratic majority in the Senate contributed to the continued selling pressure in longer-dated Treasuries amid the possibility for more fiscal stimulus. These respective yields moved higher.The 10-yr yield increased three basis points to 1.07%, while the 2-yr yield was flat at 0.14%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 89.84. WTI crude futures increased 0.5%, or $0.24, to $50.81/bbl.In other corporate news, shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA 45.26, +2.23, +5.2%) rose 5% after beating top and bottom-line estimates, while DXC Technology (DXC 28.91, +2.46, +9.3%) received an acquisition proposal from French IT firm Atos for reportedly more than $10 billion.Reviewing Thursday's economic data:The ISM Non-Manufacturing Index rose to 57.2% in December (Briefing.com consensus 54.7%) from 55.9% in November. The dividing line between expansion and contraction is 50.0%. The December reading reflects a faster pace of expansion than the prior month, and it is the seventh consecutive reading above 50.0%.The key takeaway from the report is that the Employment Index, which dipped below 50.0%, blemished an otherwise solid snapshot of the services sector in December.Initial claims for the week ending January 2 decreased by 3,000 to 787,000 (Briefing.com consensus 752,000). Continuing claims for the week ending December 26 decreased by 126,000 to 5.072 million.The key takeaway from the report is that initial claims are still coming in at a stubbornly high level, which sends a poor signal about the state of the labor market.The U.S. trade deficit widened to $68.1 billion in November (Briefing.com consensus -$67.1 billion) from an unrevised $63.1 billion in October.The key takeaway from the report is that it showed another increase in exports and imports, indicating an uptick in global trade.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Employment Situation Report for December, Consumer Credit for November, and Wholesale Inventories for November on Friday.Russell 2000 +6.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +1.4% YTDNasdaq Composite +1.4% YTDS&P 500 +1.3% YTD16:14AIRG Airgain reports preliminary Q4 revenue inline with consensus; also announces acquisition of NimbeLink (17.19 -0.08)Co reports in-line preliminary Q4 revenue of $12.8 mln vs. the $12.82 mln S&P Capital IQ consensus.

US intelligence services accuse Iran and Russia of interference in 2020 electionsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 16, 2021 TuesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 491 wordsBodyU.S. intelligence agencies accused Russia and Iran of trying to interfere in the November 2020 presidential election and revealed that Cuba, Venezuela, and the Lebanese Shia hezbollah militia also tried to influence the process, although its effect was more limited.In a 15-page report, all U.S. intelligence services, including the CIA and the National Security Agency (NSA), conclude that Russian President Vladimir Putin interfered with former President Donald Trump, who lost to democratic candidate and current representative Joe Biden.For his part, Iran's supreme leader, Ali Khamení, to which the document mentions by name, tried to harm Trump. Specifically, intelligence agencies say Putin "authorized" a "wide range" of operations to undermine public confidence in the electoral process and exacerbate divisions in the United States in order to help Trump and harm both Biden and the Democratic Party.In another similar report released four years ago, U.S. intelligence agencies said Putin influenced the November 2016 election because he felt a "clear" preference for Trump, who was elected to Democrat Hillary Clinton.This time, however, Putin did not order cyberattacks and his "main tool" was the use of Russian-linked groups to create a series of narratives, including false or unsubstantiated allegations about Biden.In the case of Iran, the report highlights that there was a "multi-front influence campaign" by the Islamic Republic to undermine support for Trump. He further notes that Khamení "authorized" a campaign by the Iranian armed forces and their intelligence services that included cyber-activities.China did not influence the election... but Hezbollah, Cuba and VenezuelaThe document also concludes that the Chinese government "made no interference efforts", because it believed that the risk of interfering and being discovered was greater than any benefit."China sought stability in its relationship with the United States and considered that none of the election results would be advantageous enough for China to risk a setback if caught," the text reads.During the election campaign, without providing evidence, Trump repeated that China was trying to favor Biden because he had deployed a tough trade policy with the Asian giant.Finally, U.S. intelligence indicates that Hezbollah, Cuba, and Venezuela "took a few steps to influence the elections," but were "smaller in scale" than attempts by Russia and Iran.In the case of Cuba, intelligence agencies say Havana attempted to promote narratives against Trump and Republicans, and in favor of Democrats in the Latin American community in the United States. And it goes further by noting that "Cuban intelligence probably carried out some low-level activities to support this effort."Meanwhile, U.S. intelligence considers Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to have the "intention, but probably not the ability to influence public opinion" against Trump.m{1297164}DmrLoad-Date: March 17, 2021End of Document

India seeks to block Chinese company Huawei over security issuesCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 11, 2021 ThursdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 360 wordsBodyThe Indian government is on its way to block local telephony operators from using cell phones produced by Chinese company Huawei. According to government officials, this measure could take effect in June of this year.According to officials, the measure is feared by safety and with the aim of local telecommunications manufacturers manufacturing more equipment.Huawei and ZTE are accused of being spy tools of Chinese President Xi Jinping's government. For their part, Chinese companies deny these accusations and wish to enter into an agreement with India to allay security concerns.The situation between China and the world has caused not only India to prohibit Huawei products, but also other parts of the world. Add to this the strained relations on the New Delhi-Beijing border.After June 15, 2021, operators will only be able to purchase certain technology equipment, classified as "reliable" by the Indian Department of Telecommunications. They also announced that a list of "non-acquisitions" could be created.Moreover, although more information on these plans needs to be presented, officials explained that ZTE, another Chinese cell phone brand, which has some presence in India, could also be blocked and added to this blacklist.Of the three major telecommunication operators in India, two use Huawei equipment. This restriction could raise costs, social media maintenance contracts, as Chinese company equipment is much cheaper relative to others.From 2019 the United States, during the Administration of Donald Trump, began the process of excluding Huawei from his country. This is because the U.S. government claimed that this company used its equipment to spy on the country. Huawei denied these allegations.Following these statements by the then president, huawei was pressured by the country to expel Huawei from its territories by also commenting that the data from its territories were delivered to China by the telephony company.• Coronavirus killed 3000 nurses worldwide so far from the pandemic• Joe Biden signs third U.S. tax bailout against coronavirus pandemic• Luz del Carmen Ibáñez, Peruvian judge, is appointed vice president of the ICCLoad-Date: March 12, 2021End of Document

In an unpredictable 2021, maize gained prominenceCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 18, 2021 MondayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1411 wordsBodyWe kicked off the year with the delusional break-in at the January 6 capitol, the day the American Congress had to confirm Joe Biden's victory over still President Donald Trump. Meanwhile, on the other side of the planet remains missing Jack Ma, owner of Alibaba Group,the great Chinese e-commerce company after having described, at the end of November 2020, the Chinese authorities as outdated and backward, and having called for more regulatory freedoms for consortia such as Ant Group, a company affiliated with the Chinese group Alibaba and the world's top-rated Tech End. In the same sense, Alex Navalny was arrested in Moscow on Sunday after returning from Germany where he recovered from a strange poisoning with Novichok, on top of a plane returning from Siberia on 20 August. Despite warnings from Putin himself, he decided to land in Moscow, and as he had been warned he was arrested by the police, with uncertain futures.While these strange issues often happen in some of the most important countries on the planet from a financial point of view, the central banks of the world's most relevant countries continue in "EMERGENCY MODE",with interest rates close to zero or negative and emitting mountains of money, with the persistent objective of taking the economic activity in which the cursed COVID 19 put it out of the well. Now, if we spin a little more finely we must say that the Dollar in the world has been appreciating against the world's strongest currencies for 7 business days, i.e. operating in the opposite direction than has been seen since the end of March 2020. It may be a short-term correction as monetary issuance continues, but you know that it is a weight factor that we follow very closely and with daily attention, knowing that the depreciation of the US currency has a positive impact on the price of grains.In the same line we must say that, although it may seem like a small thing from Argentina, that Inflation in the United States has risen from 1.20% from November to 1.40% annually in December. Of course, it is not even close to the 2.00% sought by monetary authority Jerome Powell but it is a variable to follow closely because, the Dollar Tsunami issued during 2020, could generate some significant rise in inflation in that country and in that case, push the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, which is worth clarifying that it is still in the range of 0.00% - 0.25% , in that "EMERGENCY MODE".If this increase were to occur, it would bea negative impact on the capital market, within which you know that agricultural products participate as investment assets of those major players, the Speculative Funds in the so-called "Managed Money" category. To close this introduction from the financial environment, let us remember that the Chinese currency, the Yuan, has appreciated strongly against the dollar (the counterpart to the weakening of the Dollar mentioned above) from 7.16 yuan at the end of May 2020 to 6.48 today, earning almost 10%.This is not something that pleases the Chinese government too much, which could embark on a voluntary weakening of its currency to balance the variation of recent months, which has made its dollar-expressed exports more expensive. The above issues, coupled with the very high borrowings and fiscal deficits of many large economies of the planet, open up the possibility of new macroeconomic black swans in which grain prices could be involved.Most likely someone is thinking, "... Why do you tell me all this if I'm an agricultural producer...?". The answer once again is,to remember that not everything in grain prices is Supply and Demand and; making analogy with the words of the great professor Juan Carlos de Pablo, the Supply and Demand of Agricultural Commodities is something that happens in a certain global financial context, which is why the "fundamental is expressed, if and only if, the financial environment allows it" and; presently we seem to be flying in the middle of a flock of black swans.Having made this extensive introduction that frames the current context we go to the world of grains in which today we will place special emphasis on the king of foragers, maize. We have already told that Soybeans would be closing this commercial year in the United States with the second lowest stocks in history, with Chinese purchases exceeding 100 million tons by 2020,and a Grinding that grows and grows month by month. But the disruptive thing about the foragingis that a major change in global demand is being verified, we are talking mainly about the volume of imports from Southeast Asia, South Korea and China in particular. In the case of the Southeast Asia bloc, we come from Imports in year 18-19 of 16.66 Million tons, went through 19-20 with 17.36 and are transiting 20-21 during which imports of the block in question would reach 18.05 million tons.On the South Korean side, the import numbers for the three consecutive campaigns show us 10.76; 11.89 and 12.00 Million tonnes respectively. Finally, from China the maize imports of the three campaigns in question show an increase never seen before, we are talking about 4.48; 7.60 million tonnes and 17.50 million tonnes, respectively. In summary, the block under analysis accounts for virtually all growth in maize imports globally during the last three campaigns, but mainly during the last one; showing an increase of 15.65 million tons. The group of countries under analysis have accumulated an increase in their foraging imports by 49% since the 18-19 campaign, which more than counteracts the decline shown by Europe's imports.In this line and most likely attending and observing these same numbers, the Hedge Funds have resumed purchases of Corn futures in Chicago over the past four weeks in which they increased their Net Position Purchased by almost 16 million tons, totaling acquisitions of Corn for the refrigerator of 69.55 million tons purchased since August 2020. Think of this as almost an Argentine corn production, bought in futures in 5 months. It is through this that they reach the third most purchased position in history, only surpassed by those of September 2010 and January 2011. So the price of the ton of Corn in Chicago rose almost $88/tn from August 2020 to the time, reaching US$D 209/tn. Meanwhile in our country position July 21 describes the following graphic: While all this happens, in our country we continue to discuss what to prioritize, whether to try to "DECOUPLE" the international prices of the premises; or take advantage of this price escalation to capture the additional currencies that would offer these prices, exporting as much as possible. At this point the circumstances is both sad and incredible, observing discussions at high levels of government on these issues that have already been tested to the point of exhaustion in our country and in the world and which is known, end up generating in the medium term the effect exactly contrary to that originally sought. Some call it"therapeutic empecination", to this need to continue trying with recipes that did not give results on the same conflicts, rather than trying to give the conditions to enlarge production year after year. Anyway, we don't want to bore them or waste time with rolled-up and trite topics that at this point become sterile, puerile and useless discussions and an absolute waste of time.GOING TO MANAGEMENT...Exceptional corn prices at the local level, both Available and 20-21 campaign, are captured in a significant proportion of future stocks or productions,either with physical sales and/or with copper PUTs July 21; seeking to be protected from any government decision that catapults us into the past, but the situation of the World deserves flexibility in the positions taken. I mean, if I sell, I buy CALLs for every ton sold, otherwise the purchase of PUTs July 21 is the suggestion, understanding that for example the PUT of US$D 168/tn with US$D 6.00/tn or that of US$D 176/tn with U$D 7.20/tn, offer us Flats that are well above the Target Price raised in the precampaña for any of the agricultural areas of the country. An ideal variant in this context, although not offered by many buyers/runners, is the purchase of CALLs in Chicago, which would allow us to capture potential ups in a market that will obviously never be clouded by potential local intervention.CORN RESULTS ASK TO BE DEFENDED ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, RAINS ARE HELPING AND PRICES TOO!Look too       Load-Date: January 19, 2021End of Document

RUBIO WELCOMES STATE DEPARTMENT'S GENOCIDE DETERMINATION OF CCP ATROCITIES AGAINST UYGHURS IN XINJIANGStates News ServiceJanuary 19, 2021 TuesdayCopyright 2021 States News ServiceLength: 325 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Florida Senator Marco Rubio:U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) welcomed the State Department's determination that the Chinese Government's and the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) persecution of Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and members of other Muslim minority groups in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) constitute crimes against humanity and genocide. Rubio is the co-author of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act introduced last Congress (S.3744), which would require the Secretary of State to make an atrocity determination related to the actions taken by Beijing in support of forced labor. Similar language was signed into law in December 2020. Rubio also co-authored the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act of 2020 (P.L. 116-145), the first piece of legislation regarding Uyghurs in the world to be signed into law."The Trump Administration did the right thing by calling the horrific crimes being committed by the Chinese Communist Party against Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities by their rightful name: crimes against humanity and genocide," Rubio said . "Today's determination by the State Department is an important step towards accountability and justice, as we included in the FY2021 Omnibus Appropriations spending bill. The ongoing crimes at the hands of the Chinese government is a human tragedy that demands an immediate international response. These determinations are a call to action for the incoming administration, Congress, and our allies. We must ensure that the U.S. and free nations do all we can to end these atrocities and ensure that it remains a priority of our nation's China policy."Rubio is Cochair of the bipartisan and bicameral Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC), the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations' Subcommittee that oversees human rights, and is a member of the Subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific, and International Cybersecurity Policy.Load-Date: January 19, 2021End of Document

Trump's blockade and social media censor powerCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 25, 2021 MondayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 2197 wordsBody          By Pablo Kornblum       In the film Argentina with the title of the same name, 'the censor', played by the huge Ulysses Dumont, is an official who during the last civic-military dictatorship has as a decisive role to prevent certain films – whether political or sexual – from reaching cinemas. Nearly half a century later, this time it is not the state's own repressive apparatus (in this virtual case) that decides to block a social network; onthe contrary, the one who takes command and the decision are the communication empires themselves, the so-called 4th power, which, with its 'oligopolistic firepower' have aligned themselves against those who, in this case, exercise the first judiciary of the planet's still main power. In this sense, the accounts of U.S. President Donald Trumphave been blocked on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, among others, following the riots at the Capitol. The motive? Trump allegedly told thousands of people in Washington that he would never grant victory to his rival because electoral fraud existed; Moreover, he sninged his followers to do 'something memorable' on the day of Joe Biden's confirmation as president. Following the same line, Snapchat and Youtube announced that it was all "for the sake of public safety" and Trump'sattempts "to spread misinformation and incite violence." "We believe that the risks of allowing the president to continue using our service are simply too great,"explained Mark Zuckerberg,FACEBOOK CEO.So we find an exogenous power with economic interests found in officialism? Surely these huge and wealthy corporations, which are no longer satisfied with being oligopolies about one of the few highly profitable industries left, will continue to seek the accumulation of political power for their particular purposes.Are they just one more tool for co-opting political power by opposition groups? In this regard, Michelle Obama asked social media platforms to permanently block Trump's accounts. "Now is the time for Silicon Valley companies to stop allowing this monstrous behavior and go beyond what they have done by permanently banning this man on their platforms, setting policies to prevent the nation's leaders from using their technology to fuel the insurrection,"the former first lady said vehemently and very carelessly. Surely he has not thought that the hampering discursiveness can lead to a boomerang that could also impact the newly beginning Democratic government.Do they represent the paladins of an imaginary world from which they consider ideal, the 'new paradise on earth'? The tech elite loves to appear as the policy maker of moral altruism – especially progressive - . Let's not remember how in 2018 Naomi Buchwald,a district judge in New York, determined that it was a violation of freedom of expression to receive a blockade – just from a social activist – by @realDonaldTrump, the personal Twitter account used daily by the now-former US president.Anyway, you'd have to be on your boards and at the head of the shareholders of the big companiesto be able to deduce the reasons for this historic decision; there's probably a little bit of it. In the meantime, the debate has already started. Some will wonder what right these companies have to close accounts, that is, to decide what the democratically elected president of a country should say or not. Moreover, Zuckerberg added that Trump's decision to "use his platform to condone rather than condemn the actions of his supporters in the Capitol building has rightly disturbed people in the United States and around the world." I mean, not only do you object to what you did, but what I stop doing.Several questions are arising from this. What is the fine limit of what is contrary to the common good? How do you decide that an account is terrorist, attacks public health, or is it 'too much' right or left? Is 'Fighting Capital' then dangerous because it would go against the very interests of these technology corporations? Should those who promote the end of the state - as some libertarian of those abounding by these lares - be banned, then, since it would be to take us all into a dangerous semi-anarchic world? Has it been reasonable – without geopolitical analysis through - for Twitter to suppress a message from Iran's supreme guide, Ali Khamenei,because it claimed that it was unwise to have confidence in American or British covid-19 vaccines? It seems then that 'the freedom to listen and see' button is in private hands (rather at Google, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and other digital empires headquarters), and not on the street, the Assemblies, or the very vote of a democratic election. It seems that Trump's digital blockade would be nothing more than the expansion of a kind of dictatorship, in terms of what tech elites believe politically correct to spread to all spheres of society.However, as a counterpart to the most pessimistic vision, there are those who argue that, since liberal capitalism governs the fates of the world, everyone is free to seek another platform and inform themselves as they wish. But what happens when they are a quasi-monopoly? Complex question; of course, competitive capitalism remains only in the purity of classical book theory. If not ask parler's four million active members, who observed inerts such as Amazon, Google, and Apple removed the social network from their download platforms. It should be remembered that Parler, created in September 2018, has skyrocketed its popularity in recent weeks thanks to its anti-censorship measures, functioning as a haven for conservative far-right groups in the United States.However, any reaction can lead to even more adverse contexts that were primarily avoided: one of these potential scenarios is that public figures are pushed to even more marginal platforms, where their discourses circulate smoothly among fans leading to greater radicalization. On the other hand, a model of 'choking or bottleneck' could also be generated, precisely because moderate users, those who use the networks in a more generalistic and informal way, could also be lost, and follow the political character in question only for reasons, for example, of 'ironic consumption'.Of course, all of the above is not exclusive to the United States: the double morality of what happens in the international arena is the order of the day, especially if you take advantage of what is happening in the most important country on earth to assert domestic policy questions. With greater or lesser veracity.In this sense, the Russian government itself, a paladin of 'non-freedom'expression of dissidents – an opposition leader imprisoned through - has said since his Chancellery that the decision "can be compared to a nuclear explosion in cyberspace. Destruction is not as terrible as the consequences." Of course, by sighting a 'mirror scenario', they try to prevent something similar from happening with President Vladimir Putin.But in addition, in order to finish taking the coup de grace on their historic opponents, they have implemented the usual 'vulgar chicaneo' of 21st-century diplomacy: counter-coup using 'their own medicine', as China does when it attacks American protectionism, arguing that it is contrary to the neoliberal international system that Americans themselves have created decades ago. In this sense, from the other side of the former iron curtain, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharovafelt that with the blockade Of President Trump "democratic values declared by Western countries have been struck."Just talking about China, with Google censored and Yahoo so slowed that it 'strangely' falls permanently, the most used search engine in China is Baidu, which owns 75% of the market. Of course, if you write the word Tiananmen in it, don't expect to find the overwhelming image of the man cutting off the way to a column of tanks; You should simply relax and enjoy tourist photos of the square and, above all, the entrance to the Forbidden City under mao's portrait that still hangs on one of its doors. However, this does not imply that 'business are business': with a market value of more than $40 billion, Baidu was in 2007 the first Chinese technology firm to enter the Nasdaq.When one asks the Chinese government why restrictive measures, the answer is blunt: "Social stability is mission number one. The government must ensure clean, positive, healthy and orderly cyberspace." Moreover, as a cold war deja voo of the last century, since the ACC, the Chinese Information Control Agency, it was requested that "the whole society participate in the clean-up and orderly development of the media; thanking those who collaborated by denouncing illegal and harmful information."Meanwhile in France, economy minister Bruno Le Mairecalled into question whether the suspension of accounts has not been carried out "under a legal framework of regulation". At least I miss discursively, in a country that years ago intends to dismantle the welfare state, embedded in a clear process of deregulation that is not wilder due to opposition from trade unions, a certain sector of yellow vests, university groups, etc. Similarly, this would not be the most relevant: little or nothing they say about creating regulations when it comes to protecting millions of French internet users from the mass espionage they are subjected to every second of their lives. Clearly, the main contradiction of modern 'democratic' capitalism is that between the possibility of socially producing abundant and gratuitous information goods, and a system of monopolies striving to maintain control, the 'self-intellectual property' of information.The European Union, which is working on new jurisprudence - the Digital Services Act - wants to provide a kind of state solution. It is that as with the case of digital currencies, where state digital currencies are already being created to compete with Bitcoin and others that have no control or any kind of government regulation.In this sense, the state actors of the old continent argue that this issue cannot be left to the market. It is that statehood is not a minor issue; less now that tech companies have perpetrated for many 'the first successful coup d'ere done by the media'. Among officials, however, there is quite a fear of the potential response to the legislative attempt to break the monopoly of the technological elite. What kind of replica are you afraid of? With the simple threat of exposing the secrets of the dozens of government agencies – and their officials – they have their data stored in the cloud.In conclusion, Noam Chomsky said that the goal of education was to show people how to learn for themselves; the rest is indoctrinate. Will it be the main drawback then that citizens cannot discern between 'good and evil', so the blockade is justified? Do we live in a context where most human beings have to work hard to survive, and have neither the time nor tools to understand what is going on, so you need a big brother to tell you that 'reality' or 'truth' may or may not see? Wouldn't it be more logical to show all those who want to express themselves than to block those they believe do not represent the 'interests' or 'welfare' of the people? Wouldn't the millions of representatives who have democratically elected a president, a way of doing politics, ideas be indirectly silenced? Aren't they acting childishly (like giving candy to a child and then taking it off), by allowing political figures, like in this case former President Trump - to speak directly across their platforms with their target audience without intermediation, and then say that presidential sayings do not live up to the circumstances to institutionally resolve the serious dilemmas of states? Lots of questions, complex answers.It is interesting here then to highlight the words of the British essayist, Paul Mason,who argues that information technology – the most fundamental product of the 21st century – is dissolving the capitalist system in general because it corrodes market mechanisms, undermines property rights, destroys the traditional relationship between wages, work and profit, and, above all, attacks the foundations of democratic institutionality; I mean, we'd be heading towards a post-capitalist model. However, an in-depth analysis seems to indicate that it is difficult to sustain a change in status quo, at least in the short and medium term. It may have another face, but systemic logic is likely to prevail. What is potentially realistic, as technology economist Paula Bach points out, is that "the scenarios for transforming new technologies into material strength continue to lead to significant upheails – in the order of economics, politics, geopolitics and class struggle – the final results of which are open." And in this sense, with the recent addition to the scenario of complex global interdependence of these pre-existing technological actors, we are surely facing a new style of battle that is just beginning.(*) Economist and Doctor of International Relations.

Thanks for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and today is Wednesday, February 10. Your top stories right now, 6 AM on the East Coast. Markets this morning on the rise. Take a look at Futures indicating a higher opening for the broader averages this morning.The Dow industrials right now up 95, the NASDAQ up 60 and the S&P 500 up 13.5. This after a choppy session yesterday ended with the Dow and the S&P 500 lower but the NASDAQ notched another record close finishing above the 14,000 mark for the very first time.NASDAQ this morning up again further into uncharted territory. Well, from one market to another. New York Stock Exchange's iconic location in the Big Apple may need to find a new home if state lawmakers get their way on tax laws. That's according to the President of the NYSE, we are on it.Impeachment 2.0. The Senate agrees to proceed with former President Trump's trial as his acquittal looks more and more likely. Hear from North Dakota senator Kevin Cramer this morning about what went down yesterday and what to expect going forward. China is pushing back. Huawei files a new lawsuit claiming it is not a security threat to the United States and then challenges the SEC to drop the blacklist.Crude awakening. Oil is back on the rise as state attorneys generals want a re-examination of the executive decision to cancel the Excel pipeline. Former Trump Senior Policy Adviser Stephen Miller is here weighing in the 8:00 AM hour and then keeping tabs on travelers.One tourist destination with strict COVID protocols wants to track you to make sure you are in quarantine. We're on it all morning long. Mornings with Maria is live right now. And European markets this morning are mixed. Take a look. The Ft100 is up 15, the CAC40 is down a fraction and the Dax index lower by 8.5. In Asia overnight, it was green across the board.Take a look. China reporting its Producer Price Index slipping to deflationary territory in a year over year rising three-tenths of a percent in January from a year earlier. Of course these numbers are released by the Communist Party. Shanghai composite was up 1.5 percent, Hong Kong Hang Seng up almost 2 percent.Now some of the top stories that we're watching this morning. President Biden supporting a proposal from House Democrats that would send $1400 stimulus checks to Americans making up to $75000 a year so part of the President's nearly $2 trillion coronavirus relief package which Biden discussed yesterday with some of the nation's leading CEO. He also pushed for a $15 minimum wage.The impeachment of former President Trump moves forward. House impeachment managers began by showing a 13 minute mashup of comments from his January 6 speech mixed with video of rioters storming the capitol. Attorneys for the former President made their arguments.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And if we go down the road that my very worthy adversary here Mr. Raskin asks you to go down, the floodgates will open and partition impeachments will become commonplace.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: The Senate voting 56 to 44 to proceed with the trial set for later today. The chamber needs 67 votes for conviction. Coronavirus on the decline. Reports showing that new cases have declined 56 percent over the last month. This based on a 7-day average. The decline marks a significantly steeper fall than previously seen after the spring and summer surges.And then getting a COVID vaccine may become a yearly thing just like the flu shot. Johnson & Johnson CEO Alex Gorsky says that as the virus mutates, new variants do come with it. The company has applied for emergency use of its one shot vaccine.Chicago finally sending kids back to school, we think.

Tenev posted a blog discussing the role high-speed traders play in modern markets, saying investors benefit from their ability to efficiently process trades. Robinhood's use of firms such as Citadel securities and Virtue Financial have been the subject of scrutiny since Robinhood began restricting stocks.The SEC now changing how senior officials can handle probes. They now have more authority to speed up investigations. However Reddit was not mentioned as part of the announcement. Yesterday of course, we heard from one such lawsuit.Markets pointing higher this morning ahead of trading. Take a look. We're expecting more record highs this morning to come. The NASDAQ finished in record territory yesterday. The tech heavy sector bolstered by better than expected earnings.Joining us right now to talk more about that is Federated Hermes, Chief Equity Market Strategist Phil Orlando. Also joining the conversation all morning long, this morning is Fox business' Dagen McDowell and Macro Trends Advisors Founding Partner Mitch Roschelle.Great to see everybody this morning. Thank you so much for joining us. Phil, I was reading your - your report this week and I love the comments about bulls, bears and pigs so I what - but at the end of it, you say look, fundamentals matter. Let's talk fundamental.Phil, what do you see in terms of earnings in the backdrop for investing today that would be economic growth?PHIL ORLANDO, CHIEF EQUITY MARKET STRATEGIST, FEDERATED HERMES: So it's all positive. You look at the Reddit, the Robinhood, the GameStop fiasco. I mean I think that's behind us. Now the markets are starting to trade on fundamentals again. So let's look at the fourth quarter earnings.We're about 70 percent of the way through. The consensus expectation going into the earnings season for the fourth quarter's that earnings would be down 9 to 10 percent. We're actually up 6 percent. 80 percent of the companies that have reported earnings so far have beaten by 17 percent.That's the third best beat rate history trailing only the second quarter and the third quarter of last year so the underlying fundamentals are good and getting stronger over the course of calendar 21 so that's exactly why stocks should be moving higher and again we've got a 4500 forecast for the S&P 500 by the end of this year which would be roughly a 20 percent gain.So we think the fundamentals are pretty good.BARTIROMO: Well, you know it's interesting to see all these valuations where they are. I mean Twitter reported earnings yesterday. They - noting the company added more users earlier this month after former President Trump's account was banned. Twitter also expecting growth to slow down in the coming months following the initial boom of users logging on to the start of the pandemic, Phil.What's your take on tech? I mean this morning Twitter is up almost 5 percent but we know tech has seen those valuations skyrocket. Do you still want to put new money to work even with these valuations?ORLANDO: So coming out of the bottom of the cycle last March, we thought that technology would be the one sector that would lead us out and it's done phenomenally well but back last August, we took technology and domestic large cap growth in general backed down to neutral because we thought those sectors, you know that sector had simply gotten ahead of itself.We rotated those profits in other areas that lagged, that we think are going to play catch up and in fact, have started to play catch up. Small cap stocks, domestic value stocks and international stocks so technology still going to work but we think the outsize gain is going to come from those other sectors.You know over the last three or four months of last year and over the course of calendar 21.BARTIROMO: Yes but I mean look, you talk about - you talk about valuations. Look at what has taken place in the junk bond market, right? I mean The Journal wrote about this yesterday. Junk has never been so valued, the average yield on low rated bonds falls below 4 percent for the first time. Phil, your reaction.ORLANDO: Well, I don't think we're back to the sock puppet at the Y2K calendar changeover in 2000 but there's no question that the valuation levels of technology stocks and - stocks are far ahead of value stocks. Last set of numbers I saw is that forward multiples on technology up around 40 times earnings, forward multiples on domestic value stocks down around 20 times earnings.So you've got a pretty significant gap on valuation and savvy investors are going to pay attention to that.BARTIROMO: Yes, all right, we will leave it there. Phil, it's great to see you this morning. Thanks so much.ORLANDO: Thanks for having me back, Maria.BARTIROMO: And to you. Have a great day. Phil Orlando joining us this morning and your Morning Mover this morning is Lyft, the ride sharing app up better than 11 percent, almost 12 percent in the pre-market after reporting yesterday earnings. It says it could see an adjusted profit by the year's third quarter despite the pandemic due to additional cost cuts and a rebound in shared rides.Lyft shares now at's $60. One cent a share. We're just getting started this morning. Coming up, the iconic New York Stock Exchange could become part of the blue state exodus if lawmakers get their way. We will break it all down in the Word on Wall Street share the Op- Ed from the President of the NYSE this morning.And then New York Congresswoman Nicole Malliotakis talking about reopening New York City as indoor dining finally returns on Friday. Plus in the 8:00 AM hour, we are zeroing in on Washington's impeachment battle with North Dakota Senator Kevin Cramer.Plus former Trump Senior Policy Adviser Stephen Miller is here to discuss the Biden administration's executive orders, the push to end American energy dominance and how new immigration policies will impact every day Americans.Don't miss a moment of it. You're watching Mornings with Maria live on Fox business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Well, Huawei is now pushing back. The Chinese telecom giant filing a lawsuit on Monday asking the Fifth circuit court of appeals to review the FCC ruling that deemed the company a national security threats.This comes hours before CEO Ren Zhengfei said he would welcome a call from President Biden. The President has noted his new administration was ready for 'extreme competition with China' but that Joe Biden will do things differently than President Trump. Joining me right now is Gatestone Institute senior fellow and author of the book, 'The Coming Collapse of China,' Gordon Chang.Gordon, it's great to have you. Thank you so much for being here.GORDON CHANG, SENIOR FELLOW, GATESTONE INSTITUTE: Thank you Maria.BARTIROMO: What is your reaction to Huawei now pushing back? We know that Huawei has had several settlements with American technology companies for this very reason. Vodafone also has reported that they were back doors going back to the Chinese Communist Party with data from Americans and Vodafone obviously.But you've had settlements from everybody from Microsoft to Cisco with Huawei. What is your reaction?CHANG: The important point here Maria is that Huawei is a national security threat. We know that from 2012 to 2017, Beijing used Huawei servers to surreptitiously download information from the headquarters of the African union in Addis Ababa.We know that independent tests of Huawei equipment have shown unusual numbers of security flaws. When Ren Zhengfei, the founder of Huawei says that he would never spy, we've got to remember that China's 2017 national intelligence law requires every Chinese entity to commit espionage if demanded.Clearly Huawei is a threat to the security of the U. S.BARTIROMO: Well, that's an interesting point and I think that point really needs to be underlined, the fact that it is the law in China that if the Chinese Communist Party comes to you and says we want this data, you are - you have to hand it over. This is the law and the rules of China.CHANG: Yes and the other thing about this is that in the Communist Party's top down system in China, nobody, no company, no matter how powerful can resist the demand from the Communist Party. That's the nature of the system and the other thing about it is that although Huawei says it's employee owned, only one percent of its shares are in fact owned by an employee.That's Ren Zhengfei himself. The other 99 percent are controlled by the Chinese central government through what's called a Trade Union Committee but which acts on behalf of Beijing so when you start looking at all of this evidence it's clear that Huawei is a threat, not only to the United States but also to other countries where its equipment is installed in their networks.BARTIROMO: Well, we know that pretty much very straightforwardly based on what just happened with the Ant group, right? Very good story in the Wall Street Journal this morning, sure fire bet on Ant has tracked global investors and the bottom line here is that more than $10 billion of money invested in the Ant group came from international investors.They bought shares in an off shore shell companies set up by Ant to raise funds in U.S. dollars. This was an unusual arrangement. It came about in order to secure a payment license to operate Alipay, the popular mobile app so these investors have their money locked up right now and of course we know that Jack Ma went missing for two months because he criticized the CCP.CHANG: And he's still missing. He did resurface in a 48 seconds video but that video is sort of hideous because it reminds everyone of the concession - the confession videos that the Communist Party likes to air to show that people are now obedient to the will of the Communist Party.You know Ant right now is subjecting itself to central bank regulation and is becoming a holding company. It is a very different company than investors have put their money into or to which they've let money to and it's clearly a much less valuable company because it has much less business potential because of the regulation and because of the new capital requirements, it is going to have to meet.BARTIROMO: Yes, exactly so if anybody has a question about who's in charge, if you've got a large company or any company in China, it's pretty clear. Then there's the World Health Organization, Gordon. I've got to get your take on this. The WHO says well, we looked at Wuhan, we're done.The team investigates the origins of the COVID-19, they claim they did. They say that the possibility that the virus began in the lab is 'extremely unlikely' and that a lab accident does not warrant future study. No more study, Gordon. The team instead said that the most likely case came from an animal to human transmission.This from the World Health Organization who of course back in January of 2020 put a tweet out there saying that the coronavirus was not transmissible, human to human.CHANG: Yes, well, this WHO mission spent a grand total of 3.5 hours at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. This is a year after China sent its top biological weapons expert General Chen Wei to head the P4 biosafety unit at the lab.Now she is described as China's clearly the head of their biological weapons program and I think she was sent there to clean up the lab and to indeed remove any sort of evidence of a biological weapons program. The WHO assessment is wrong. The Lancet, which is the authoritative British medical journal said that the first coronavirus case had nothing to do with fast or the wet market and indeed many of the initial cases also had nothing to do with that wet market.Clearly what's going on here is this is an origin which is still unknown. The WHO should not be making assessments as definitive as the one that he came out with yesterday.BARTIROMO: Well, all of these things happening now under a new administration. There's also this story that really went unnoticed yesterday and that is about scrapping the disclosures about working with China. The Biden administration has withdrawn a proposal from former President Trump to call on U.S. schools and universities to disclose when they have ties to China-backed Confucius centers, the Confucius institutes.In August, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that Confucius institutes 'advance Beijing's global propaganda and malign influence campaign on U.S. campuses and Kindergarten through 12 classrooms.' So that proposal by the Trump administration for these schools to just disclose that they are working with Confucius institutes was quietly withdrawn. Your reaction.CHANG: Well, it's not only Confucius institutes, they are the instrumentalities of the Communist Party's united front work department which is the unit of the Communist Party that is meant to subvert others around the world and this follows the Biden administration withdrawing that protection that prohibited Chinese companies from supplying equipment to the U.S. grid, allowing Beijing to sabotage our electricity system.This is one concession after another that the Biden administration is making to China without getting anything in return and the American people have need to ask what the devil is going on now.BARTIROMO: Yes, so what do you think Gordon, are we going to see a changed policy with regard to China with this new administration, given these new signals that we're getting?CHANG: We're already seeing these changed policies from the day one with the U.S. rejoining the World Health Organization which was hideous because it actually helped spread the disease to America, from rejoining the Paris agreement with you know that is unbalanced with regard to America and China and all these other things that the Biden administration is done in the executive orders.So China's been getting one gift after another from Biden so it is in effect a new policy regardless of what the President might say about 'extreme competition.' He's been extremely generous to Beijing.BARTIROMO: Yes. Gordon, we'll keep following it of course. Thank you so much. Great to see you this morning, Gordon, thank you. Gordon Chang.CHANG: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Stay with us. We got a big show coming up. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A potential market move that could change the iconic location of the New York Stock Exchange. NYC President Stacey Cunningham urging lawmakers in Albany not to reinstate the stock transfer tax in New York, something she says could cause the entire operation to move elsewhere.She writes this in a new Wall Street Journal Op-Ed writing this, "The New York Stock Exchange belongs in New York. If Albany lawmakers get their way however, the center of the global financial industry may need to find a new home."Dagen McDowell, she also brings up that some believe the tax will ease budget challenges but in reality it could actually push more firms out of the city.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Right, it doesn't help and doesn't raise revenue and fix your budget problems if your income tax base continues to flee to other states.Money is mobile and so are financial transactions. There are myriad reasons why this won't work. In the Op-Ed that Cunningham writes she points out that in 2012 France imposed such a financial transaction tax, a third of the trading volume and French public companies went to London.The same thing happened in Sweden when it a proposed a tax in 1984 when the volume migrated to London as well. This tax is essentially in New York, been dormant since 1981 and it would clear - and no other states in the United States have taxes on financial transactions.So already people have left during the pandemic shut down and so these firms could easily pick up and move elsewhere and that leaves an even bigger budget hole in terms of income tax collection.These are critical jobs, particularly critical revenue particularly for New York City where 60 percent of all private sector wages come from the finance and insurance industries. These budget calculations, the estimated revenue that these taxes would raise, they never are accurate and these - Democrats really have their head stuck in the dirt.They're like oh, they're just threatening to leave. People have already left, you can't see that?BARTIROMO: Yes. Yes, absolutely. And remember Brian, during the Obama administration when we had a 35 percent corporate tax rate, what did we see - what did we see happening? Mitch, we talked about this so much. Mitch Roschelle, how much we talked about it in terms of the number of companies looking for a more attractive tax rate across the world?So back into the Obama years, what happened? A string of acquisitions of companies based in Ireland because in Ireland, the corporate tax rate was 9 percent versus the U. S.'s 35 percent match.MITCH ROSCHELLE, FOUNDING PARTNER, MACRO TRENDS ADVISORS: That's the first thing that happens Maria. As soon as you impose a restriction, a regulation, a higher tax, business finds a way to find their domicile someplace else. It happened throughout the entire Obama administration with these sort of reverse mergers in foreign companies, by lowering the corporate tax rate United States brought that business home.But whenever you impose any kind of you know toll, people will always find a way around the toll and that's - that's exactly what will happen. Listen, on the New York Stock Exchange, they shut down their operations on the floor almost a year ago back in March and they were open for business the next day virtually.So they could set up shop someplace else very, very quickly if this you know, tax was imposed.MCDOWELL: I'll just add -BARTIROMO: Yes, but I mean it's the New York Stock Exchange. Dagen?MCDOWELL: It's not called - they can call it the New York Stock Exchange but it's going to be the Tupelo, Mississippi Stock exchange if they have any - if they're financially smart.Just one thing, I want to just point out that see, Andy Cuomo, the governor has proposed raising the top income tax rate in addition to this financial transaction tax idea, that that New York City if this tax hike goes through would have the top state and local and income tax rate in the entire country at almost 15 percent.They're giving one after another, these Democrats are giving people a reason on top of the crime and the just horrific living conditions in New York City to head south, Midwest, it's somewhere that your money and your person are treated better than they're treated here in New York.BARTIROMO: Yes but they're saying don't look over there, look over here, there's an impeachment battle going on. The impeachment battle will begin and hear from both sides of the aisle as we examine the political fallout over President Trump's second impeachment trial.We're going to get into it when we come back. Then a mistake on Zoom brings a virtual court hearing to a stop. We've got the video that's making a buzz this morning. You've got to see this, we'll tell you all about it when we come back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, good Wednesday morning everybody, thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Wednesday, February 10th, a look at markets this half hour, we've got another rally underway and we are in once again record territory. Dow Industrials up 104 right now, the Nasdaq up 56 and the S&P 500 higher by 14. This after a choppy session yesterday which ended with the Dow and the S&P 500 lower, but the Nasdaq notching another record close. It finished above 14,000 for the first time ever with a 20-point gain on Nasdaq and it is off once again this morning.Check European markets right now. Here is what we've got, European indices right now are higher across the board, but it is a fractional move, FTSE 100 up 27, the CAC Quarante in Paris is up 3 points and the Dax Index in Germany higher by just a fraction. In Asia overnight, green across the board, take a look at Asian indices overnight, best performer there was Hong Kong, Hang Seng index up almost 2 percent. And now this, one person is dead this morning, four others hurt after a mass shooting at a Minnesota Health Clinic. Cheryl Casone now with all these details, Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS: That is right, Maria, and good morning. The shooting broke out yesterday morning about 40 miles northwest of Minneapolis. Police say the suspect Gregory Ulrich targeted the health clinic because he was upset with the treatment he received. Investigators found suspicious devices at the building as well as at the motel where Ulrich was staying. Well, online dating giant Match Group looking to do more than help people find love. The company has reached an agreement to buy South Korean social media company Hyperconnect for $1.73 billion. Hyperconnect has developed two video apps that focus on helping people interact one-on-one and getting into new social communities.Match Group already runs several dating apps including Tinder and OkCupid. And go ahead and drink that cup of coffee, your heart health may depend on it. A new report found drinking at least one cup of Joe a day could help reduce your risk of heart failure. That is compared to people who don't drink coffee, jug lovers found to have decreased their risk of heart failure by up to 12 percent for each cup they drink on a daily basis, but you need the jolt, decaf coffee, Maria, does not show the same benefits. Keep caffeinating up, everybody out there, back to you.BARTIROMO: Interesting, all right, Cheryl, thank you so much. We are watching Capitol Hill this morning for sure. The Senate yesterday voted 56 to 44 to proceed with a second impeachment trial of former President Trump, arguments were presented on both sides of the aisle on whether it was constitutional to even try a former president.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD): We cannot have presidents inciting and mobilizing mob violence against our government and our institutions because they refuse to accept the will of the people under the constitution of the United States.BRUCE CASTOR JR., TRUMP DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Let's understand why we are really here. We are really here because the majority in the House of Representatives does not want to face Donald Trump as a political rival in the future.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Six GOP senators joined Democrats to move ahead with this trial. Joining me right now is Democrat's strategist Laura Fink and former Trump campaign communications director and Republican strategist Bryan Lanza. Great to see you both, thank you so much for joining us. So, let's talk about first the vote to even have the trial because this is one of the issues that the Republicans are saying it's not even constitutional, Laura, because he's no longer a president.LAURA FINK, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, I think there are a lot of scholars that would disagree with that statement and concluding some prominent conservative scholars that suggest that this is constitutional, and that in fact, you know, the preservation of our democracy is the intent of impeachment, and on day one, you can be impeached and on your final day of your presidency, you can be impeached. And Donald Trump's behavior, inciting an insurrection, starting months before, going into that deadly January 6th day is really what people are defending against here in the Senate.And I remember Ben Franklin saying that ours is a republic if we can keep it, and that's what we see going on in the Senate today. Trying to preserve our democracy, trying to make sure that we don't have insurrections like we saw on January 6th, and the fact is the American people are down with this argument, 58 percent of them want to see Donald Trump banned from future office --BARTIROMO: Laura, what do you say --FINK: One out of four -- nearly one out of four Republicans I just should add.BARTIROMO: Yes, Laura, what do you say when you hear the sound bites of, for example, Maxine Waters, you know, last year, saying if you see anybody who supports Trump, get in their face, tell them they're not wanted. Well, what about that? Or what about Kamala Harris saying, look, we are not going to stop, we're going to keep it up, they're not going to stop the protestors and rioters. I mean, isn't that inciting violence as well?FINK: I don't think they are inciting violence and they're not looking to overturn an election, and it's not based on a Seminole lie that said that there was mass voter fraud, that Trump was sowing the seeds up for months in advance. So, I think the difference is, there's a fragile moment in our democracy when we transfer power from one president to the next. And Donald Trump is a very smart man and he knew what he was doing. He knew what he was saying --BARTIROMO: It was really fragile --FINK: When he said -- when he said -- when he said go fight --BARTIROMO: Yes, it was really fragile --FINK: That he knew what he was saying --BARTIROMO: All Summer --FINK: Yes --BARTIROMO: It was really fragile all Summer when businesses had to board up and nobody said anything with those Molotov cocktails being thrown in these states --FINK: I think a lot of people said things, Maria --BARTIROMO: Faces, and when you --(CROSSTALK)FINK: Absolutely --BARTIROMO: You really didn't have the Democrats push back --FINK: And here's the other thing --BARTIROMO: And say stop this. Bryan Lanza, it is true that as the commander-in-chief, the president could also have said, look, stop this, and we didn't hear that from him, you know, on January 6th. But no doubt during the Summer of quote, unquote, "love" in Seattle, the president was certainly firm in saying this violence has got to stop, there was violence all Summer in 2020.BRYAN LANZA, PARTNER, MERCURY: Good morning, Maria, thank you for having me. Yes, I mean, it wasn't the Summer of love, it was the Summer of violence and hate, and that hate manifested itself in November election and it kept on going. You know, hopefully we've turned the page. But I caution my Democratic friends who are now saying we can impeach when people are leaving to add a stain to their record. I mean, we could have impeached Bill Clinton for his pardons then when he left and left the stain on what the pardon process was. I mean, this is a very dangerous slippery slope when we now start impeaching former presidents.I guarantee you that if the Republicans take over the Senate and Republicans take over the house and Biden does something stupid on his pardon, we will impeach him on the way out too or even after the fact. Like we can't go down this road because of Trump derangement syndrome that people go outside the normal reality. And impeaching a president after leaving really has no purpose other than partisan purposes, and Republicans can do it too, and that's dangerous for our democracies. It has to be for real reasons --BARTIROMO: Yes, well --LANZA: Other than the fact that we don't like the guy.BARTIROMO: President Biden is supporting a proposal from house Democrats that would send $1,400 stimulus checks to Americans making up to $75,000 a year, cutting off families who earn more than $200,000. Democrats also call for a temporary Obamacare expansion in their relief bill. Let's talk about the stimulus package. It is likely going through, Bryan. What are the ramifications here?LANZA: Debt, big spending, no focus, lack of plan. We just went through this last time where, you know, we thought it was a 3-month, you know, crap shooting, we gave them a lot of money, the government spent a lot of money and it didn't do a lot of good. I mean, that's the problem with this plan. It's the previous plans on steroid with even less regulation. And California had what? Thirty billion dollars worth of fraud as a result of these bailouts that took place, you don't think the fraud is going to stop? I mean, more debt, more chaos, more money being wasted as a result of Joe Biden's tax --BARTIROMO: It's a lot of money --LANZA: And some people --BARTIROMO: Yes, it's a lot of money being thrown at our economy, Laura. We're up to $5 trillion just in the last year. That's one of the proposals on the spending side, but we are also expecting pretty significant tax increases, tax and spends out of this administration. Your reaction to all of this and its impact.FINK: Well, I don't think that there's a tax increase on the table. What we do have here is a $1.9 trillion package that is working on reopening schools, $130 billion of that will go to schools, getting money in the pockets of average Americans so that we can get that economy and that consumer spending rolling again, and then, of course, we have to finance the deployment of the vaccine and ensure that our health workers have what they need to contain the coronavirus. All of that is integrated into the recovery of our economy and of our national health. And so what we see here is a bold Biden moving forward with a package that is aggressive, and it's aggressive because I think he -- going back to the Obama administration and the financial crisis, he thought that maybe things were -- they didn't do enough in the beginning.So, time is of the essence here and ensuring that, that -- those finances are infused into our economy, it just makes sense. So, it's just common sense.BARTIROMO: Yes, just to be clear, Kamala Harris said the first thing she does -- she'll do when she gets in office is reverse the Trump tax cuts. Also --LANZA: Correct --BARTIROMO: Elizabeth Warren has been talking about her wealth tax --FINK: She's not the president --BARTIROMO: We are expecting higher taxes --LANZA: Probably to --BARTIROMO: Pretty much everybody is expecting higher taxes, Bryan.LANZA: I mean, Biden has promised largest tax cut in American history. I mean, he said he's going to reverse the Trump tax cuts, so he's promising the largest tax increase -- sorry, in American history. He's unapologetic about that. He said he wanted to do it in the first 100 days. I mean, I get that the Democrats don't want to talk about a tax increase because voters tune out everything else they say after that. But the tax increase is on the table, period, nobody can deny that. That's their --BARTIROMO: Yes --LANZA: Legislative --BARTIROMO: Just to be clear, Janet Yellen, the Treasury Secretary did say that she did not think it was appropriate to raise taxes during a pandemic, so I'm thinking maybe this is a second half of the year situation. I don't know if it becomes, you know, the whole year retroactive, but certainly second half is what we are looking at likely. Laura Fink, Bryan Lanza, we'll keep watching. Good to see you both, thank you so much. Stay with us, we'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, oil prices higher yesterday hitting a 13-month high. Take a look at where oil is, 58.68 a barrel after Saudi Arabia pledged extra supply cuts in February and March. Joining me right now is the "Schork Report" publisher Stephen Schork. Stephen, it's good to see you this morning, your reaction to what we're seeing in the oil markets. It's interesting to note that even as demand has slowed so much globally because of the coronavirus, you're talking about $60 a barrel oil.STEPHEN SCHORK, PUBLISHER, THE SCHORK REPORT: Yes, absolutely, Maria, and what we're seeing is a pricing of stronger fundamentals into the new year. We started to see it over a month ago, we always have to keep in mind that spreads lead the way. What does that mean? When we look at prices along the fold, of course, we have the stock price and then we have the futures prices. In a normal healthy market, we want to see backwardation, that is to say we want to see spot prices greater than futures' prices. That is a clear signal that demand in the spot market in all commodity markets are cleared in the stock market, remember.Now spot prices or demand in the stock market is outpacing supply. That is a normal healthy market whatever commodity we're talking about. Now for the better part or during the -- since the start of COVID, we've been in a situation called contango which spot prices are cheaper. So, it made no sense, it made more sense, the market was telling you don't consume your oil today, don't put it out to the spot market, put it into inventory. That has reversed. Now, oil is being bid out of inventory, so we're seeing a decline in inventory, and that is a sign of rising demand and hence we've got stronger prices.BARTIROMO: So what do you make of the several state attorneys general on President Biden's decision on the Keystone XL pipeline? They say that it would result in devastating damage to state and local communities. What impact do you see if construction of the XL pipeline does not continue?SCHORK: Oh, that is clearly the situation here. Even when we had President Obama, in his first term when Hillary Clinton was secretary of state, her State Department, the EPA all signed off on it and their State Department, that analysis that was done more than 10 -- yes, more than 10 years ago, clearly stated what an economic boom this would be for the states, towns, communities with the construction of this pipeline. Now, for government pipeline, we're going to see considerable amount of job, you know, decay in this industry. We're already seeing it, Maria, over -- you know, since their respective peaks over the last 2 years. Pipeline construction for oil and gas, support services, rig counts and so forth, we've seen, you know, probably about -- my estimate is about 200,000 job cuts.Now, clearly, that's going to accelerate when we put this moratorium and keep in mind what the Biden administration is telling us and they've codified it, Maria, in their 2020 platform. This is going to be the most hostile White House the oil and gas industry has ever seen. And therefore, they're going to violate the bedrock of capitalism, and that is capital goes where it is welcome, stays where it is well treated. And the Biden administration is clearly telling us that investments into fossil fuels will not be welcomed over the next at least 2 years by the Democrats control of the legislative agenda.BARTIROMO: Yes, well, we remember President Obama's favorite was Solyndra, right? During the --SCHORK: Yes, exactly --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: There when we were talking about -- yes, I know, I know. Stephen, it's good to see you this morning, thank you, sir. We will keep following --SCHORK: Thank you, Maria --BARTIROMO: The important story. Stephen Schork. Coming up, Zoom mishap, wait until you see this. One lawyer's digital mistake turned him into a ferocious feline. It is making a buzz this morning, we'll tell you all about it back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, it is time for the Morning Buzz, an awkward perk document a Texas attorney joined a virtual court hearing when this happened. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Can you hear me, judge?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I can hear you, I think it's a filter.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It has a -- don't know how to remove it. I'm not a cat.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: He is not a cat. The judge later tweeted out the video with some good advice, "if a child used your computer before you joined a virtual hearing, check the Zoom video options to be sure filters are on." Dagen, this is so funny, I guess it's bound to happen when you work from Zoom all the time, and multiple people like your kids are using the computer.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS: You've got -- you've got to make sure that the filters are off. I watched this video, this was down in southwest Texas, I believe. It was a civil forfeiture hearing. I watched it. I don't know, a friend of mine sent it to me via text message, and I maybe watched it 20, 25 times in a row, and it never gets old. It is so funny.BARTIROMO: What do you think of that, Mitch?MITCH ROSCHELLE, FOUNDING PARTNER, MACRO TRENDS ADVISORS: I think we're all living these moments and, you know, it's about time some of these things go viral and you realize how human we are. I mean, listen, we are doing this by Zoom or at least I'm doing it by Skype and stuff just happens. Technology isn't perfect, so, I think it was a real human moment and I think it was great for us all to take a break and see that we're all human.BARTIROMO: You're right, I needed that. That was great. All right, let's take a break. When we come back, ready to reopen. New York Congresswoman Nicole Malliotakis is here to talk about the importance of indoor dining, returning to America's largest metropolis. It all starts next hour right here, MORNINGS WITH MARIA is live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Wednesday morning everybody, thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Wednesday, February 10th, your top stories right now, 7:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast. Markets are higher this morning, take a look at futures indicating a gain of about 100 on the Dow Industrials right out of the gate, the Nasdaq up 45 and the S&P 500 up 12. We will begin in uncharted.Load-Date: February 10, 2021End of Document

The robot end-effector market is projected to attain a CAGR of approximately 15% over the forecast period (2021 - 2026); Emerging markets are more inclined towards automation due to intense competition in the market and to need to improve product quality along with the increasing speed of production to maintain efficiency and productiveness.GlobeNewswireMarch 17, 2021 Wednesday 5:43 AM PTCopyright 2021 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: MARKET RESEARCH REPORTSLength: 1392 wordsBodyNew York, March  17, 2021  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Reportlinker.com announces the release of the report "Robot End-Effector Market - Growth, Trends, COVID-19 Impact, and Forecasts (2021 - 2026)" - https://www.reportlinker.com/p06036761/?utm_source=GNW  This is leading to robotic innovations including end-effectors for various surfaces as well as with different degrees of freedom, to handle routine tasks.- The rapidly growing market for automation has increased the demand for the deployment of robotics systems across various end-user industries globally, which is driving the demand for robot end-effectors. Emerging markets are more slanted towards automation due to intense competition in the market and need to improve product quality and the speed of production. This led to several robotic innovations, including end-effectors for various surfaces and different degrees of freedom, to handle routine tasks.- The advancement in industrial and collaborative robot arms has been slow and steady, but the end-effector evolution has become more rapid in the past few years. This is partially driven by demand for dexterous manipulation in pick-and-place operations such as e-commerce order fulfillment.- The end effectors of current times are becoming smarter and more potent as machine learning software, and safety features are increasingly being combined within the EOAT itself, together with the ability to adapt to its environment using machine vision. For example, in specific applications, conveyors are being replaced with Automated Guided Vehicles, transporting bins containing mixed products.- This scenario leads to random bin picking operations, where vision-guided robots are equipped with suitable tooling to pick randomly oriented components from a bin and place them ready for the next step in the process. In these applications, the tooling must be capable to cover a wide range of products and procedures, and today's advances at the end of arm tooling are making this a reality.- With the evolution of Industry 4.0, industrial operations are growing automated, which is heading to the prevalence of robots for taking out mundane or complex tasks. For example, robots with laser-vision systems can fit doors accurately to car bodies. Such innovations are commencing to an exponential growth of robot end-effectors.- The advancement in industrial and collaborative robot arms has been slow and steady, but the end-effector evolution has become more rapid in the past few years.

Keeping food industry automation needs in strategic target to develop the solutions, Piab introduced piSOFTGRIP, a novel vacuum-based soft gripping tool in June 2019 which handles unpackaged, fresh, and delicate food items without crushing them.- In March 2019, Schunk released its EGL-C long-stroke gripper through which it is aiming to achieve comprehensive human-robot collaboration. The gripper is designed to achieve high gripping forces while complying with global safety standards.- 3D printed grippers are gaining popularity, especially in the packaging industry. For instance, Carecos Kosmetic GmbH faced an issue with its packaging process and solved it with 3D plastic grippers. The company initially used aluminum gripper that cost more than USD 11,500 per part and needed six weeks to execute a changeover. But with 3D printed plastic grippers, it was able to economically produce small batches.- The safety of the robots and the surrounding environment is slowly coming into the forefront for the industries. Keeping such emerging trends in the product development strategies, University at Buffalo has developed a two-fingered dynamic gripper that could contribute to better grasping as well as improve safety for robots that work around people. The design of the robotic hand enables it to absorb energy from impacts during collisions.- According to the International Federation of Robotics (IFR), growth in installed base of operational robots is forecasted to increase the market for grippers.Asia Pacific to Witness the Highest Growth- Rapid growth in modernization & industrialization across the region and most of the production industries shifting towards automation of their process methods to reduce the workforce drive the market's growth in the Asia-Pacific region.

ZK International's Subsidiary, xSigma Eneters Non-Fungible-Token Market Projected at $1.3 billion in 2021 as it Announces the Launch of its "NFT" Platform on Ethereum and Polkadot BlockchainsPR NewswireMarch 15, 2021 Monday 8:30 AM ESTCopyright 2021 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1726 wordsDateline: WENZHOU, China, March 15, 2021 BodyPR Newswire ZK International GroupCo., Ltd. (Nasdaq: ZKIN) ("ZKIN", "ZK International" or the "Company"), is pleased to announce that, xSigma Corporation, a subsidiary of the Company and a blockchain R&D lab, announces that it will be launching its newest project that will allow it to participate in the projected $1.3 Billion growing industry in 2021 of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT).The new platform being developed by the developing team at xSigma labs will be an NFT marketplace, which will allow users in the community to buy and sell NFTs, as well as to create their own custom NFTs in a few clicks. xSigma plans to use multiple blockchains behind the platform, such as Ethereum and Polkadot. xSigma plans to attract various artists and talents on an exclusive basis to its platform. Previously, xSigma was able to attract NBA Champion Dwight Howard, to endorse its DeFi project and it hopes that the new marketplace will be able to attract similar celebrities to its new NFT Platform.The NFT Platform will be the fourth project in xSigma's ecosystem of blockchain products to be implemented and launched later this year. Currently, xSigma's DeFi project was launched in February and successfully reached $100 M of Total Value Locked in the first week.What are Non-Fungible Tokens?Non-Fungible Tokens are easily exchangeable and individually unique digital assets which are held on certain blockchains, mainly Ethereum but also others such as Flow, Wax, and many others.One of the key differences between Cryptocurrencies and Non-Fungible Tokens is that every NFT is completely and not directly interchangeable with any other asset by identity, value, and/or utility. Every Non-Fungible Token is composed of metadata which gives each one their individuality, these attributes can include size, artist name, scarcity etc. NFT not only exist in a digital space but crucially they can also represent any type of physical asset, acting as a kind of 'digital twin' to anything existing in the real world and enabling the ownership and exchange of physical possessions within digital marketplaces.True ownership is one of the defining key components of any NFT and, as the digital economies continue to thrive, there is no doubt that NFT will play a pivotal role in bringing the digital and physical worlds closer to one another than they have ever been before.According to the report by Canadian-based analytics company NonFungible, they indicated that, "the total market cap for project-based NFTs finished was $338 million at the close of 2020. Messari research analyst Mason Nystrom believes this figure could rise to more than $1.3 billion in 2021."  The report goes on to indicate, that it is predicting that 2021 is poised for "a new Bull Market in the NFT industry."1Additional indications and validation of the growing NFT space, is last week's volume of the NFT industry which saw over $43 million a week of transactions, according to NonFungible.com.2The popularity of NFTs are growing and attracting top tier companies and some examples are as follows:Recently, the world's record of the most expensive NFT was recorded by artist Beeple with his digital art piece that was sold for over $60m at Christie's. The auction house is set to become the first major auctioneer to apply the innovative technology. NBA TopShot, the flagship non-fungible token (NFT)-powered game built by Dapper Labs is the first app offering blockchain-based collectibles to launch on Samsung's mobile shop. Top Shot allows users to collect multi-media "moments" of varying scarcity representing significant highlights across basketball's history. The limited edition tokens feature video and statistics depicting an event — like a buzzer beater shot — with users able to unlock extremely rare tokens by completing particular "sets" of tokens showcasing related moments. Mark Cuban, the billionaire entrepreneur and renowned investor, has created his own non-fungible token (NFT). Titled "The RollUp 2021," the digital art piece was released in an edition of 10 on the NFT marketplace Rarible. Within hours, a buyer bought two for roughly $81,000.3 Traditional brands like Nike, Louis Vuitton, and Formula 1 are already looking at exploring the various commercial applications of NFT in a means of seeing how they can engage their customers virtually while increasing their value of their brands and their profitability.Mr. Huang, Chairman of xSigma stated, "We are pleased to announce that we are moving quickly into the next boom of monetizing of digital assets of the innovative industry known as Non-Fungible Tokens. We have invested into xSigma to create value by developing various projects from the R&D lab and we are extremely pleased in our top tier team who continue to exceed our expectations and we believe that they have come up with another new great product for the NFT community, which is scheduled to be launched in the third quarter of 2021".About ZK International Group Co., Ltd.ZK International Group Co., Ltd. is a China-based designer, engineer, manufacturer and supplier of patented high-performance stainless steel and carbon steel pipe products that require sophisticated water or gas pipeline systems.

Joe Biden orders Donald Trump's plan to move TikTok into U.S. companiesCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 12, 2021 FridayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 423 wordsBodyThe Joe Biden Administration ordered that the plan for TikTok's U.S.-owned operations, owned by China's ByteDance, to be abandoned to U.S. companies,as reported by The Wall Street Journal.Donald Trump's government's order for ByteDance to get rid of its U.S. operations and sell them to Oracle and Walmart, especially after TikTok's legal counter-offensive reaped some success.This order from Biden's predecessorhad placed Oracle and Walmart as top candidates to take over the popular social video network.Read more: Joe Biden end national emergency declared by Donald Trump on Mexican borderIt should be remembered that, last year and as part of his strategy of increasing pressure on China, Trump gave TikTok an ultimatum to transfer his operations to U.S. companies if he did not want to be banned in the country because he was a risk to national security.                        The Trump administration considered that the popular short video app could be used as an espionage tool by Beijing, something Bytedance, the company that owns the app, denied.In response to the former representative, TikTok's U.S.general manager Vanessa Pappas warned this Saturday that the Chinese network has no plans "to go anywhere."In a message Pappas stated in his message that they are proud of the 1,500 workers they have in this country and that they will create another 10,000 places of employment over the next three years.However, the US government's talks with TikTok have continued with the intention of implementing safeguards to ensure that American data collected by the popular social network is in no way accessible by the Chinese government.Read more: Joe Biden spoke to Xi and expressed concern for Hong Kong and the UighursFor her part, said Emily Horne, spokesperson for the White House National Security Council, the Biden Executive is designing a general plan that addresses all kinds of data security risks and that will be accompanied by a review of Chinese technology and companies on a case-by-case basis, including TikTok's.Today, TikTok has more than 100 million users in the United States and has quickly become one of the most popular social networks in the world, EFE reports.Several federal court rulings have blocked the closure of TikTok if it does not transfer its operations, although the case remains pending resolution.ByteDance, which often insists that it addresses innovation and data processing in a similar way as it is done in the West, has major Silicon Valley investment firms and is valued at $180 billion.Load-Date: February 13, 2021End of Document

PLA Admits 4 Soldiers Died During Galwan Clash with Indian Army in LadakhThe SentinelFebruary 19, 2021 FridayCopyright 2021 Omega Printers & Publishers Pvt Ltd, distributed by Contify.com All Rights ReservedLength: 360 wordsByline: Sentinel Digital DeskBodyChina has revealed names of People's Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers who died during a border clash with Indian soldiers at Galwan Valley in Ladakh.Ladakh: The Chinese government has officially admitted that four of their soldiers were killed in Galwan Valley clash with the Indian Army in June 2020.According to reports, China has named and shared details of four People's Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers who died during the border clash with Indian soldiers in eastern Ladakh.Meanwhile, China's mouthpiece, Global Times stated that the Central Military Commission awarded Qi Fabao, the regimental commander from the PLA Xinjiang Military Command, the title of "Heroic regimental commander for defending the border," Chen Hongjun with "Hero to defend the border," and awarded the first-class merit to Chen Xiangrong, Xiao Siyuan and Wang Zhuoran.It is to be mentioned that this is the first time China has unveiled casualties and details of these officers and soldiers, four of whom died when dealing with the Indian military's illegal trespassing of the Galwan Valley Line of Actual Control (LAC).Earlier, the United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA) has posted two Pro-China videos on its YouTube Channel signalling the chance of proxy war by China in the coming days in the northeastern region of the country.This comes amidst the week-long stand-off between India and China after the two clashed at Galwan valley in June 2020. In the videos, ULFA blames India for all the border clashes that have occurred between the two countries since 1962.Defending China, ULFA gives lengthy pro-China justification in these videos. The videos leave a sign of proxy war by China in northeastern India using ULFA and the Naga insurgents, something they had refrained from since 1971.However, the intelligence source going through these videos said that ULFA leader Paresh Baruah had to release these types of videos as he and a few other members of ULFA were currently residing in the Wa state of China-Myanmar border with the support of the Chinese administration. "It is obvious that Paresh Baruah will release such a video. Otherwise, they will be killed," said the source.Load-Date: February 20, 2021End of Document

Dahua faces scrutiny over its facial recognition softwareSecurityInfoWatch.comFebruary 1, 2021 Monday 12:00 AM ESTCopyright 2021 Cygnus Business Media All Rights ReservedLength: 654 wordsHighlight: Company SDK reportedly featured code that could be used to track China's minority Uyghur populationBodyJust three months after being placed on a government  blacklist that bans U.S. companies and individuals from investing in the  company, Chinese surveillance giant Dahua has once again drawn the ire of  federal officials following a report that it has developed intentionally  discriminatory analytics software. According to a report first published by IPVM, a software development  kit published by Dahua on its website included code that could be used by  Chinese authorities to track Uyghurs, a minority ethnic group, leveraging its  facial recognition analytics. Dahua's alleged involvement in helping the  Chinese government track and detain Uyghurs was the justification used by the  Trump administration to place them on the aforementioned blacklist. On Wednesday, Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla) and Bob Menendez (D-N.J.)  sent  a letter to outgoing Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos asking him to provide details  about the e-commerce leader's business dealings with the company. Last April,  Amazon reportedly purchased  1,500 thermal cameras from Dahua to help the company monitor the  temperature of workers amid the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic in a deal valued at  approximately $10 million."These reports are extremely disturbing, and show that the  comprehensive surveillance system that Chinese authorities have deployed  against the Uyghurs is just as bad as we had feared, if not worse," the  Senators wrote in the letter.The senators also raised questions concerning Bezos' awareness  of Dahua's status on the Commerce Department's Entity List when Amazon entered  into negotiations for the thermal camera purchase as well as what the company's  criteria is in determining when to terminate a business relationship with an  entity that engages in alleged human rights violations. "While buying equipment from Dahua Technology is not illegal, it does raise  several questions for you as the Chief Executive of Amazon," the Senators  added. "If these allegations against Dahua are true, it would mean that Amazon  willfully ignored guidance from the United States government and purchased  equipment from an entity-listed company that is complicit in China's atrocities  against the Uyghurs." For its part, Dahua said the documents referenced in the IPVM  report were "historical internal software design documents" and that it "will  not provide the features or applications in the software products in the  future."Here is Dahua's statement in its entirety:         1. Zhejiang Dahua Technology Co., Ltd. ("Dahua" or  "Company") only provides generic video technology products in the regional  markets reported by the media, and does not provide products and services for  ethnicity detection in such regional markets.                 2. In recent years, Dahua has been increasing its  investment in the commercial market. The proportion of such commercial market  in the Company's total sales profile has also been increasing. Dahua's total  sales in the relevant regional markets reported by certain media in the past 5  years are far lower than the amount alleged in such media reports and have been  declining rapidly on a yearly basis.                3. Based on the Company's internal review, the relevant  documents reported by certain media are historical internal software design  documents. Dahua will not provide the features or applications in the software  products in the future. Dahua will conduct a rigorous internal review and  strengthen the design review process and management of the Company's Research and  Development functions.       A spokesperson for Dahua declined to comment further on the matter and referred SecurityInfoWatch.com to the statement above.          Joel Griffin is the Editor-in-Chief of SecurityInfoWatch.com and a veteran security journalist.

They discussed with the Prime Minister their motivations for leaving Hong Kong and their experiences since coming to the UK.During the call, the Prime Minister said to the families:On behalf of the whole country I want to say how glad we are to have you here and how proud we are that you have chosen the UK to live.I believe strongly in the prospects the UK can offer for those who want to make their lives here and I have no doubt that you are going to feel very much at home.The UK has a long and proud history of embracing those who arrive on our shores seeking the inalienable rights and freedoms denied to them in their homeland. I am very proud that we have been able to make this offer to you and other British Nationals (Overseas).The offer to BN(O) status holders was made following the Chinese Government's imposition of the National Security Law in Hong Kong last year, in breach of its commitments under international law.The visa reflects the UK's historic and moral commitment to the people of Hong Kong who have had their rights and freedoms restricted.Since February, Hong Kong BN(O) status holders with certain biometric passports have been able to apply for their visa using a smartphone app to scan their passport rather than visiting a visa centre the first time non-EEA passport holders have been able to use this technology to apply, a further step in the UK's digitisation of our immigration system.The UK has taken a number of steps in response to restrictions on freedom in Hong Kong in addition to the BN(O) visa offer, including raising human rights abuses alongside international partners, suspending our extradition treaty with Hong Kong and extending our arms embargo on mainland China to Hong Kong.Load-Date: March 19, 2021End of Document

As a result, we exceeded our previous guidance, increased our balance of loans facilitated by 17.9% year over year to RMB545.1 billion, and grew our client assets by 23.0% year over year to RMB426.6 billion by the end of 2020. Looking ahead, we plan to remain cognizant of the evolving regulatory landscape while also working diligently to improve our unit economics and optimize our product mix."Mr. James Zheng, Chief Financial Officer of Lufax, commented, "We continued to deliver solid financial results in the fourth quarter of 2020, increasing our total income by 5.9% year over year to 13.3 billion. More importantly, during the period, our net profit increased by 17.4% year over year to 2.8 billion, while our net profit margin further expanded to 21.4% from 19.3% in the same period of 2019. Meanwhile, certain factors have affected the pace of our revenue and expense recognition, creating a timing mismatch between our financial and business results. Such factors have impacted our fourth quarter results and will continue to impact our 2021 results going forward. Additionally, these factors will likely result in more quarterly movement and volatility. Whilst our pre-tax net margin is temporarily under pressure due to these factors and price adjustments from September 2020, we have already observed early signs of recovery and expect this trend to continue throughout the remainder of 2021."Fourth Quarter 2020 Financial ResultsTOTAL INCOMETotal income increased by 5.9% to RMB13,286 million (US$2,036 million) in the fourth quarter of 2020 from RMB12,549 million in the same period of 2019. The Company's revenue mix changed with the evolution of its business model as it started to gradually bear more credit risks and increased funding from those consolidated trust plans that offered lower funding costs.• Technology platform-based income decreased by 8.5% to RMB9,859 million (US$1,511 million) in the fourth quarter of 2020 from RMB10,778 million in the same period of 2019 due to the decrease in retail credit facilitation service fees, partially offset by the increase in wealth management transaction and service fees.• Retail credit facilitation service fees decreased by 9.9% to RMB9,283 million (US$1,423 million) in the fourth quarter of 2020 from RMB10,299 million in the same period of 2019, mainly due to: (i) an increase in loans funded by consolidated trusts as the Company's business model continued to evolve; (ii) early repayments by borrowers; and (iii) adjustments in product prices.• Wealth management transaction and service fees increased by 20.3% to RMB576 million (US$88 million) in the fourth quarter of 2020 from RMB479 million in the same period of 2019. The increase was mainly driven by the year-over-year increase in fees generated from the Company's current products, partially offset by the year-over-year decrease in fees generated from the Company's legacy products.• Net interest income increased by 140.8% to RMB2,333 million (US$358 million) in the fourth quarter of 2020 from RMB969 million in the same period of 2019, mainly as a result of the Company's increased usage of those trust funding channels that are consolidated by the Company. As of December 31, 2020, the Company's on-balance sheet loans accounted for 21.7% of its total loan balance under management as compared to 10.4% as of December 31, 2019.• Guarantee income increased by 341.4% to RMB256 million (US$39 million) in the fourth quarter of 2020 from RMB58 million in the same period of 2019, primarily due to the increase in the loans for which the Company bears credit risk.• Investment income increased by 4.9% to RMB386 million (US$59 million) in the fourth quarter of 2020 from RMB368 million in the same period of 2019.TOTAL EXPENSESTotal expenses increased by 11.7% to RMB9,106 million (US$1,396 million) in the fourth quarter of 2020 from RMB8,153 million in the same period of 2019.• Sales and marketing expenses increased by 20.5% to RMB4,885 million (US$749 million) in the fourth quarter of 2020 from RMB4,053 million in the same period of 2019.• Borrower acquisition expenses increased by 22.3% to RMB2,810 million (US$431 million) in the fourth quarter of 2020 from RMB2,298 million in the same period of 2019. The increase was mainly due to the accelerated recognition of amortized selling expenses from loans originated in prior years as the result of early repayment by customers.• Investor acquisition and retention expenses decreased by 17.5% to RMB227 million (US$35 million) in the fourth quarter of 2020 from RMB275 million in the same period of 2019. The reduction was mainly driven by the Company's improvements to its investor acquisition and retention efficiency.• General sales and marketing expenses increased by 24.9% to RMB1,848 million (US$283 million) in the fourth quarter of 2020 from RMB1,480 million in the same period of 2019, primarily due to: (i) the postponement of certain marketing campaigns to the fourth quarter of 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak; and (ii) the overall increase in marketing efforts to attract borrowers to the Company's platform in the fourth quarter of 2020 as businesses across China resumed their operations in the period and as the Company restarted its marketing activities.• General and administrative expenses increased by 47.8% to RMB986 million (US$151 million) in the fourth quarter of 2020 from RMB667 million in the same period of 2019, mainly due to: (i) the reinstatement of employee social security contribution, which was previously suspended during the first three quarters of 2020 following a COVID-19 moratorium issued by the Chinese government; and (ii) higher share-based compensation expenses.• Operation and servicing expenses increased by 10.6% to RMB1,650 million (US$253 million) in the fourth quarter of 2020 from RMB1,492 million in the same period of 2019, primarily due to: (i) growth in the outstanding balance of loans facilitated; and (ii) increased payment processing expenses as a result of the expanded loan repayment volume. The increase was partially offset by efficiency improvements in the loan approval and collection process as a result of the Company's utilization of artificial intelligence.• Technology and analytics expenses decreased by 17.4% to RMB461 million (US$71 million) in the fourth quarter of 2020 from RMB558 million in the same period of 2019, mostly due to improved efficiency.• Credit impairment losses increased by 1.4% to RMB985 million (US$151 million) in the fourth quarter of 2020 from RMB971 million in the same period of 2019, mainly driven by: (i) increased risk exposure related to loans; and (ii) the increase in loan-related receivables from off-balance sheet loans caused by the COVID-19 outbreak. These factors were partially offset by the year-over-year decrease in asset management impairment losses of financial assets.• Finance costs decreased by 17.0% to RMB326 million (US$50 million) in the fourth quarter of 2020 from RMB393 million in the same period of 2019, mainly due to the decrease in borrowing costs.NET PROFITNet profit increased by 17.4% to RMB2,847 million (US$436 million) in the fourth quarter of 2020 from RMB2,425 million in the same period of 2019. This increase was partially driven by total income tax expenses in the fourth quarter of 2020, which decreased by 32.4% to RMB1,333 million (US$204 million) from RMB1,971 million in the same period of 2019 due to the decrease in non-tax-deductible items.EARNINGS PER ADSBasic and diluted earnings per American Depositary Share ("ADS") were both RMB1.25 (US$0.19) in the fourth quarter of 2020. In comparison, basic and diluted earnings per ADS were both RMB1.12 in the same period of 2019. Two ADSs represent one of the Company's ordinary shares.BALANCE SHEETThe Company had RMB24,159 million (US$3,703 million) in cash at bank as of December 31, 2020, as compared to RMB7,352 million as of December 31, 2019.Business OutlookFor the first quarter of 2021, the Company expects its new loan sales to be in the range of RMB175 billion to RMB180 billion, client assets to be in the range of RMB385 billion to RMB395 billion, total income to be in the range of RMB14.3 billion to RMB14.6 billion, and net profit to be in the range of RMB4.0 billion to RMB4.2 billion.For the first half of 2021, the Company expects its new loan sales to be in the range of RMB340 billion to RMB350 billion, client assets to be in the range of RMB375 billion to RMB385 billion, total income to be in the range of RMB28.5 billion to RMB29.3 billion, and net profit to be in the range of RMB7.8 billion to RMB8.0 billion.These forecasts reflect the Company's current and preliminary views on the market and operational conditions, which are subject to changes.Changes in Board of Directors and ManagementThe Company's board of directors (the "Board") has approved the following changes to the Board's composition, effective as of January 29, 2021.

Lufax believes that adjusted net profit help identify underlying trends in the Company's business by excluding the impact of non-recurring expense related to C-round convertible notes restructuring. The Non-IFRS adjusted net margin is calculated by dividing net profit excluding non-recurring expense related to C-round convertible notes restructuring by total income. Non-IFRS basic and diluted earnings per ADS represents basic and diluted earnings per ADS calculated by dividing non-IFRS net income attributable to Lufax, which is adjusted for non-recurring expense related to C-round convertible notes restructuring, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares expressed in ADS.Lufax believes that adjusted net profit, adjusted net margin and adjusted basic and diluted EPS per ADS provide useful information about the Company's operating results, enhance the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by Lufax's management in its financial and operational decision-making.Non-IFRS adjusted net profit, adjusted net margin and basic and diluted EPS per ADS are not defined under IFRS and are not presented in accordance with IFRS. This Non-IFRS financial measures have limitations as analytical tool, and when assessing the Company's operating performance, cash flows or its liquidity, investors should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for net profit, net margin or other consolidated statements of comprehensive income data prepared in accordance with IFRS. The Company encourages investors and others to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.For more information on this Non-IFRS financial measures, please see the table captioned "UNAUDITED RECONCILIATION OF IFRS AND NON-IFRS RESULTS" set forth at the end of this press release.LUFAX HOLDING LTDUNAUDITED INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INCOME

business is calculated by dividing the aggregated amount of retail credit facilitation service fee, net interest income, guarantee income and the penalty fees and account management fees by the average outstanding balance of loans facilitated for each period.2High quality borrowers refer to G1-G3 borrowers. The Company groups its qualified borrowers into eight risk levels, with G1 representing the lowest risk and G8 representing the highest risk among qualified borrowers. A borrower's risk level is determined based on two primary considerations. The first is credit risk score, modeled using statistical techniques and based on the records of the Credit Reference Center of the People's Bank of China and the borrower's prior records such as repayment, delinquency and application histories. The other consideration takes into account the customer's assets, such as residential property, vehicle and insurance policies. Borrowers with higher credit risk scores and better assets will be assigned a lower risk level.3 Flow rate estimates the percentage of current loans that will become non-performing at the end of three months, and is defined as the product of (i) the loan balance that is overdue from 1 to 29 days as a percentage of the total current loan balance of the previous month, (ii) the loan balance that is overdue from 30 to 59 days as a percentage of the loan balance that was overdue from 1 to 29 days in the previous month, and (iii) the loan balance that is overdue from 60 to 89 days as a percentage of the loan balance that was overdue from 30 days to 59 days in the previous month.4 Legacy products of retail credit facilitation business refer to a category of unsecured revolving credit lines the Company offered in historical period which have been phased out for strategic reasons.5 DPD 30+ delinquency rate refers to the outstanding balance of loans for which any payment is 30 to 179 calendar days past due divided by the outstanding balance of loans.6 DPD 90+ delinquency rate refers to the outstanding balance of loans for which any payment is 90 to 179 calendar days past due divided by the outstanding balance of loans.7 Legacy products of wealth management business refer to a variety of products and related services that the Company has historically offered but no longer offers, primarily due to shifts in strategy and regulatory requirements. Legacy products are primarily comprised of certain types of structured alternative products originated from financial institutions and peer-to-peer platforms.8 The take rate of wealth management business is calculated by dividing total wealth management transaction and service fees for current products by the Company's average current product client assets.View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210202005887/en/CONTACT: Investor RelationsLufax Holding LtdEmail: Investor_Relations@lu.com ICR Inc.Jack WangTel: +1 (646) 318-0546Email: lufax.ir@icrinc.comhttp://www.businesswire.comLoad-Date: February 2, 2021End of Document

Alibaba's actions soared after Jack Ma's reappearanceCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 20, 2021 WednesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 498 wordsBodyInternet giant Alibaba's stock soared more than eight percent Wednesday after its founder Jack Ma made its first public appearance since November, ending weeks of speculation about its whereabouts after the company took a hit from Chinese regulators.Ma, one of Asia's richest people with an estimated fortune of about $58 billion, disappeared from public view after during an October conference critical of China's regulators and financial system.Following these criticisms, Chinese regulators blocked the expected $37 billion record outpob of Ant Group, Alibaba's financial subsidiary, a move several analysts saw as retaliation for Ma's candor.Since then, China's financial authorities have ordered Ant to change its business model and modify its lending, insurance and wealth management services, while Alibaba is also the subject of an antitrust investigation.Some said he was in custody; others, who simply kept quiet. Either way, the billionaire was "missing" for 88 days, which had fueled speculation about his whereabouts behind his frictions with the Chinese government.But a video clip released Wednesday by Chinese financial media showed him in a recording giving a speech to rural teachers as part of an awards ceremony organized by his charity.Following the billionaire's reappearance, Alibaba shares soared 8.5 percent at $265 on the Hong Kong stock exchange.In the speech, Ma praised China's poverty alleviation efforts, a central goal of communist leadership, and promised to devote more efforts to helping rural teachers."My colleagues and I... we are even more determined to engage in education and public welfare," he said, according to a transcript of his speech published by the Tianmu News site."China has entered a new stage of development and is moving towards common prosperity."A spokesman for the Jack Ma Foundation, his charity, confirmed that he "participated in the online ceremony of the annual Rural Teacher Initiative event."Both Alibaba and Ant said they will cooperate with requests from regulatory authorities.Ma, a charismatic former professor-turned-Internet entrepreneur, retired as president of Alibaba in 2019, but has long attracted attention for his candor and outlandish attitudes, acting as a rock star at company conferences.Continued pressure on one of China's most influential companies is the latest sign that Xi Jinping's regime is ready to deflate the ambitions of large technology companies in the Internet sector.Beijing has a history of disappearing, investigating and imprisoning financial tycoons who do not follow the party line.Last year, real estate tycoon Ren Zhiqiang was imprisoned for 18 years on alleged corruption charges, months after writing an essay criticizing the Communist Party.MORE ON THIS SUBJECT.Chinese tycoon Jack Ma reappeared in a video congratulating rural teachers from the Asian countryJack Ma's ideas that annoyed Xi Jinping's regimeThe hidden reason for the Chinese regime's harassment of Jack Ma and AlibabaLoad-Date: January 21, 2021End of Document

Business HighlightsAssociated Press InternationalJanuary 5, 2021 Tuesday 10:06 PM GMTCopyright 2021 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 918 wordsByline: The Associated PressBody___Where is Jack Ma, China’s e-commerce pioneer?BEIJING (AP) — China’s best-known entrepreneur, e-commerce billionaire Jack Ma, hasn’t been seen in public since he angered regulators with an October speech. That is prompting speculation about what might happen to the billionaire founder of Alibaba Group, the world’s biggest e-commerce company. Ma said regulators were too conservative in the Oct. 24 speech. Shortly after that, the government suspended the stock market debut of Ant Group, a financial platform spun off from Alibaba. The normally voluble Ma disappeared from public view, canceling a TV appearance and going silent on social media. It is unclear what awaits Ma , who made his fortune by taking big risks.___Saudis take on burden of oil output cut to support priceFRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — Saudi Arabia says it’s cutting oil production by a million barrels a day through March as a “goodwill gesture.” The cut surprised oil markets where some had expected no change in production from Saudi-led OPEC and a clutch of allies like Russia. The decision comes as the pandemic sows uncertainty about when an economic recovery might arrive and boost sagging demand for energy. Saudi Arabia urged caution, saying demand for oil remains fragile even as the vaccination rollout raises hopes for an eventual return to more normal behavior. The price of oil rallied on Tuesday’s surprise cut by Saudi Arabia.___World Bank sees subdued recovery in 2021 and plenty of riskWASHINGTON (AP) — The World Bank on Tuesday forecast that the global economy will see a subdued recovery this year from a devastating pandemic but warned that the near-term outlook is highly uncertain and growth could be harmed if infections keep rising and the rollout of vaccines is delayed. In its new Global Economic Outlook, the World Bank forecast growth this year of 4% following a decline for the global economy of 4.3% in 2020. That was the biggest drop in global output since a contraction of 9.8% in 1945, a decline that was related to the demobilization as World War II was ending.___US stocks recoup some losses after sharp slide to start 2021NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are closing higher Tuesday, regaining their footing a day after suffering their worst loss in months amid the worsening pandemic and potentially market-moving Senate elections. The S&P 500 was 0.7% higher in afternoon trading, and the majority of big stocks in the index were rising. Oil producers led the way as crude prices strengthened. The market’s moves were tenuous, though. The S&P 500 at one point lost all of an early-morning rise even after a report showed U.S. manufacturing grew last month at its strongest pace since 2018.___US: Hack of federal agencies ‘likely Russian in origin’WASHINGTON (AP) — Top national security agencies, in a rare joint statement, said Tuesday that Russia was likely responsible for a massive hack of U.S. government departments and corporations, rejecting President Donald Trump’s claim that China might be to blame. The statement represents the U.S. government’s first formal attempt to assign responsibility for the breaches at multiple agencies and to assign a possible motive for the operation.___NYSE withdraws plans to delist 3 Chinese phone carriersBEIJING (AP) — The New York Stock Exchange says it no longer plans to remove shares of three Chinese state-owned phone carriers as ordered by President Donald Trump. The exchange cited “further consultation” with U.S. regulators but gave no other details of its decision. The NYSE announced plans to remove China Telecom Corp. Ltd., China Mobile Ltd. and China Unicom Hong Kong Ltd. after Trump’s order in November barring Americans from investing in securities issued by companies deemed to be linked to the Chinese military. The Chinese government has accused Washington of misusing national security as an excuse to hamper competition.___US factories grew in December at fastest pace since mid-2018WASHINGTON (AP) — American factories grew in December at the fastest pace in more than two years as manufacturing continued to fare better during the pandemic than the battered services sector. The Institute for Supply Management reported Tuesday that its gauge of manufacturing activity rose to 60.7% last month, the highest reading since it stood at 60.8 in August 2018. The activity gauge was up 3.2 percentage points from a November level of 57.5. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector. The U.S. economy collapsed from April through June but since that time manufacturing has posted solid gains.___American Airlines is grounding emotional-support animalsDALLAS (AP) — American Airlines is banning emotional-support animals in a move that will force most owners to pay extra if they want their pets to travel with them. The airline said Tuesday that it will allow animals in the cabin free of charge only if they are trained service dogs. The change takes effect Monday, although passengers who already bought tickets can fly with a companion animal until Feb. 1. The move follows a similar decision by Alaska Airlines and is likely to be copied by other carriers. The U.S. Transportation Department cleared the way for the crackdown against companion animals last month.___The S&P 500 rose 26.21 points, or 0.7%, to 3,726.86. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 167.71 points, or 0.6%, to 30,391.60. The Nasdaq composite picked up 120.51 points, or 1%, to 12,818.96.

The Nasdaq (+0.7%) and S&P 500 (+0.3%) continue hanging onto gains while the Dow (-0.1%) has turned negative.The early dip from highs represents a pullback after a strong start to 2021. The S&P 500 remains higher by 1.6% for the week while the Russell 2000 has jumped more than 6.0% in the first week of the year.Today's biggest story was the disappointing Employment Situation report for December, but it took a back seat to today's second biggest story, which was an Axios report that President-elect Biden will seek a $3 trln fiscal package that would call for about $2 trln in spending on green jobs and infrastructure.The December jobs report showed the loss of 140,000 payrolls (Briefing.com consensus +112,000) but some of the initial sting was offset by a large upward revision to November data and a larger than expected increase in average hourly earnings. Still, the report painted a bland picture of the labor market in December. However, the stock market is looking past the news thanks to the prospect of more fiscal spending.Seven out of eleven sectors trade with early gains, led by consumer discretionary (+1.5%) and real estate (+1.2%). On the downside, communication services (-0.7%) and financials (-0.4%) are the two weakest performers.10:24BAYRY Bayer AG announces FDA approval of sNDA for NUBEQA (15.84 -0.37)Bayer today announced that the FDA approved a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to add overall survival (OS) and other secondary endpoint data from the Phase III ARAMIS trial to the NUBEQA (darolutamide) Prescribing Information. NUBEQA significantly reduced the risk of death by 31%, offering men with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC) extended survival for a greater chance of living longer. Additional data include time to pain progression and time to initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy. The Prescribing Information was also updated to include additional guidance on drug interactions. The final analysis reinforced NUBEQA's safety profile with an extended follow-up of median 29 months for the overall study population.10:23OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:EXEL Jan 25 calls are seeing interest with 4060 contracts trading vs. open int of 70, pushing implied vol up around 20 points to ~88%.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.2%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows energy (+1.0%), consumer discretionary (+1.0%), and information technology (+0.8%) outperforming in early action, while the communication services (-0.2%), financials (-0.1%), and materials (-0.1%) sectors trade lower.Longer-dated Treasuries have extended their recent retreat on the prospects for more fiscal stimulus, driving yields higher. The 10-yr yield is up three basis points to 1.10%, while the 2-yr yield is down one basis point to 0.13%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.2% to 89.69. WTI crude is up 1.2% to $51.44/bbl.09:30CSCO Cisco provides update on Acacia Communications (ACIA) deal; affirms that Chinese regulators informed Cisco that its submission was "sufficient to address the relevant competition concerns" (44.63 -0.33)Cisco today announced that it is seeking confirmation from the Delaware Court of Chancery that it has met all conditions for closing of its acquisition of Acacia Communications, including approval of China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR). Cisco is also seeking a court mandate that the agreement may not be terminated until the court resolves these matters, and an order from the court requiring Acacia to close the transaction. On January 7, 2021, Cisco was notified by SAMR that the agency has determined that Cisco's submission is "sufficient to address the relevant competition concerns."09:21ROKU Roku acquires Quibi's content distribution rights; terms notdisclosed (379.29 )09:13WRAPX S&P futures vs fair value: +13.10.

The results were published on the preprint server bioRxiv and are available here.Rapidly spreading variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, initially in the United Kingdom and South Africa. These variants have multiple mutations in their spike or S glycoproteins, which are key targets of virus neutralizing antibodies. Though these two rapidly spreading viruses are different, they share the N501Y mutation, which is located in the receptor binding site of the spike protein and results in the virus's spike protein binding more tightly to its receptor. It has been shown to infect mice more efficiently.iTo determine if sera of people who had received the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine could neutralize SARS-CoV-2 with the N501Y mutation, a virus with this substitution was generated in UTMB's laboratory. The sera of 20 participants from the previously reported Phase 3 trial neutralized the virus with the mutation as well as they neutralized virus without the mutation. While the virus tested in this experiment did not include the full set of spike mutations found on the rapidly spreading strains in the U.K. or South Africa, neutralization of virus with the N501Y mutation by the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine-elicited human sera is consistent with preserved neutralization of a panel of 15 pseudoviruses bearing spikes with other mutations found in circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains. This indicates that the key N501Y mutation, which is found in the emerging U.K and South Africa variants, does not create resistance to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine induced immune responses. Pfizer, BioNTech, and UTMB are encouraged by these early, in vitro study findings. Further data are needed to monitor the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine's effectiveness in preventing COVID-19 caused by new virus variants. If the virus mutates such that an update to the vaccine is required to continue to confer protection against COVID-19, we believe that the flexibility of BioNTech's proprietary mRNA vaccine platform is well suited to enable an adjustment to the vaccine.06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- Markets trade higher ahead of US jobs reportThe global equity markets are mostly higher with US futures pointing to modest gains to begin the day.

SRP-9001 is an investigational gene transfer therapy intended to deliver its micro-dystrophin-encoding gene to muscle tissue for the targeted production of the micro-dystrophin protein.At 12 weeks post-treatment compared to baseline, the study met its primary biological endpoint of micro-dystrophin protein expression (P<0.0001). Participants who received SRP-9001 (n=20) had mean micro-dystrophin expression of 28.1%, as measured by western blot. Accompanying secondary biological endpoints including vector genome copies per nucleus, percent positive fibers, intensity, and reduction in creatine kinase (exploratory) were also met.In the primary functional endpoint, SRP-9001-treated participants showed an increase in NSAA total score compared to placebo at 48 weeks; however, the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.37). At every time point measured, the cohort of SRP-9001 treated participants outperformed the placebo group, and, at 48 weeks, participants in the treatment group demonstrated a statistically significant increase of 1.7 points in NSAA total score compared to baseline (P=0.009), while participants in the placebo group saw an increase of 0.9 points on the NSAA total score compared to baseline, which was not statistically significant (n=21, P=0.1411).In the pre-specified analysis by age-group, by which the randomization was stratified, participants aged 4-5 years at time of treatment with SRP-9001 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in NSAA total score versus the age-matched placebo cohort, achieving a 4.3-point improvement on NSAA at 48 weeks post-treatment from baseline.The results from Study 102 reinforce the "favorable" safety and tolerability profile of SRP-9001, with no new safety signals identified.16:16WRAPX Closing Stock Market SummaryEach of the major indices closed at record highs on Thursday in a momentum trade led by the technology stocks. The Nasdaq Composite outperformed with an impressive 2.6% gain, followed by solid gains in the Russell 2000 (+1.9%), S&P 500 (+1.5%), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%).Risk sentiment broadened out to nine of the 11 S&P 500 sectors. The information technology (+2.7%), consumer discretionary (+1.8%), energy (+1.5%), and financials (+1.5%) sectors were the best-performing sectors; conversely, the utilities (-1.3%) and consumer staples (-0.3%) sectors closed lower.Investors bought yesterday's dip in the broader technology space and continued to bid up shares of Tesla (TSLA 816.04, +60.06, +7.9%), which was upgraded to Sector Perform from Underperform at RBC Capital Mkts after the firm conceded it was wrong about the stock.In addition, the oft-repeated recovery narrative was on display after Democrats flipped both Senate seats in Georgia yesterday, giving them slim majority in the Senate, and the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index rose to a better-than-expected 57.2% in December (Briefing.com consensus 54.7%) from 55.9% in November.The projected Democratic majority in the Senate contributed to the continued selling pressure in longer-dated Treasuries amid the possibility for more fiscal stimulus. These respective yields moved higher.The 10-yr yield increased three basis points to 1.07%, while the 2-yr yield was flat at 0.14%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 89.84. WTI crude futures increased 0.5%, or $0.24, to $50.81/bbl.In other corporate news, shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA 45.26, +2.23, +5.2%) rose 5% after beating top and bottom-line estimates, while DXC Technology (DXC 28.91, +2.46, +9.3%) received an acquisition proposal from French IT firm Atos for reportedly more than $10 billion.Reviewing Thursday's economic data:The ISM Non-Manufacturing Index rose to 57.2% in December (Briefing.com consensus 54.7%) from 55.9% in November. The dividing line between expansion and contraction is 50.0%. The December reading reflects a faster pace of expansion than the prior month, and it is the seventh consecutive reading above 50.0%.The key takeaway from the report is that the Employment Index, which dipped below 50.0%, blemished an otherwise solid snapshot of the services sector in December.Initial claims for the week ending January 2 decreased by 3,000 to 787,000 (Briefing.com consensus 752,000). Continuing claims for the week ending December 26 decreased by 126,000 to 5.072 million.The key takeaway from the report is that initial claims are still coming in at a stubbornly high level, which sends a poor signal about the state of the labor market.The U.S. trade deficit widened to $68.1 billion in November (Briefing.com consensus -$67.1 billion) from an unrevised $63.1 billion in October.The key takeaway from the report is that it showed another increase in exports and imports, indicating an uptick in global trade.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Employment Situation Report for December, Consumer Credit for November, and Wholesale Inventories for November on Friday.Russell 2000 +6.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +1.4% YTDNasdaq Composite +1.4% YTDS&P 500 +1.3% YTD16:14AIRG Airgain reports preliminary Q4 revenue inline with consensus; also announces acquisition of NimbeLink (17.19 -0.08)Co reports in-line preliminary Q4 revenue of $12.8 mln vs. the $12.82 mln S&P Capital IQ consensus.

The largest sector member-Amazon (AMZN 3150.94, -11.22, -0.4%)-holds a modest loss but seven of the next eight largest components sport solid gains. Continuation of this week's show of relative strength. The sector has extended this week's gain to 3.3% versus a 1.5% week-to-date gain in the S&P 500 (+0.2%).Notable movers:Etsy (ETSY 176.76, +5.97, +3.5%): best performer in the sector, rising toward its high from Monday. CarMax (KMX 102.64, +2.34, +2.3%): rising to its best level since late September. L Brands (LB 47.24, +1.07, +2.3%): rising to its best level since March 2018 after Telsey Advisory Group raised its target for the stock to $50 after the company issued above-consensus guidance for Q4. Hasbro (HAS 96.49, +1.67, +1.8%): revisiting its high from December. Home Depot (HD 268.90, +2.64, +1.0%): touched its 50-day moving average (270.93). McDonald's (MCD 214.29, +2.31, +1.1%): rising above its 50-day moving average (213.59). Lowe's (LOW 164.61, +0.90, +0.6%): approached its December high before narrowing its gain.

The Nasdaq (+0.7%) and S&P 500 (+0.3%) continue hanging onto gains while the Dow (-0.1%) has turned negative.The early dip from highs represents a pullback after a strong start to 2021. The S&P 500 remains higher by 1.6% for the week while the Russell 2000 has jumped more than 6.0% in the first week of the year.Today's biggest story was the disappointing Employment Situation report for December, but it took a back seat to today's second biggest story, which was an Axios report that President-elect Biden will seek a $3 trln fiscal package that would call for about $2 trln in spending on green jobs and infrastructure.The December jobs report showed the loss of 140,000 payrolls (Briefing.com consensus +112,000) but some of the initial sting was offset by a large upward revision to November data and a larger than expected increase in average hourly earnings. Still, the report painted a bland picture of the labor market in December. However, the stock market is looking past the news thanks to the prospect of more fiscal spending.Seven out of eleven sectors trade with early gains, led by consumer discretionary (+1.5%) and real estate (+1.2%). On the downside, communication services (-0.7%) and financials (-0.4%) are the two weakest performers.10:24BAYRY Bayer AG announces FDA approval of sNDA for NUBEQA (15.84 -0.37)Bayer today announced that the FDA approved a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to add overall survival (OS) and other secondary endpoint data from the Phase III ARAMIS trial to the NUBEQA (darolutamide) Prescribing Information.

On November 30, 2020, the judge presiding over this legacy case issued an order requiring both parties to submit estimates of damages in respect of these mortgages which could result in a judgment against Credit Suisse of up to approximately $680 million.

The results were published on the preprint server bioRxiv and are available here.Rapidly spreading variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, initially in the United Kingdom and South Africa. These variants have multiple mutations in their spike or S glycoproteins, which are key targets of virus neutralizing antibodies. Though these two rapidly spreading viruses are different, they share the N501Y mutation, which is located in the receptor binding site of the spike protein and results in the virus's spike protein binding more tightly to its receptor. It has been shown to infect mice more efficiently.iTo determine if sera of people who had received the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine could neutralize SARS-CoV-2 with the N501Y mutation, a virus with this substitution was generated in UTMB's laboratory. The sera of 20 participants from the previously reported Phase 3 trial neutralized the virus with the mutation as well as they neutralized virus without the mutation. While the virus tested in this experiment did not include the full set of spike mutations found on the rapidly spreading strains in the U.K. or South Africa, neutralization of virus with the N501Y mutation by the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine-elicited human sera is consistent with preserved neutralization of a panel of 15 pseudoviruses bearing spikes with other mutations found in circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains. This indicates that the key N501Y mutation, which is found in the emerging U.K and South Africa variants, does not create resistance to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine induced immune responses. Pfizer, BioNTech, and UTMB are encouraged by these early, in vitro study findings. Further data are needed to monitor the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine's effectiveness in preventing COVID-19 caused by new virus variants. If the virus mutates such that an update to the vaccine is required to continue to confer protection against COVID-19, we believe that the flexibility of BioNTech's proprietary mRNA vaccine platform is well suited to enable an adjustment to the vaccine.06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- Markets trade higher ahead of US jobs reportThe global equity markets are mostly higher with US futures pointing to modest gains to begin the day.

Accompanying secondary biological endpoints including vector genome copies per nucleus, percent positive fibers, intensity, and reduction in creatine kinase (exploratory) were also met.In the primary functional endpoint, SRP-9001-treated participants showed an increase in NSAA total score compared to placebo at 48 weeks; however, the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.37). At every time point measured, the cohort of SRP-9001 treated participants outperformed the placebo group, and, at 48 weeks, participants in the treatment group demonstrated a statistically significant increase of 1.7 points in NSAA total score compared to baseline (P=0.009), while participants in the placebo group saw an increase of 0.9 points on the NSAA total score compared to baseline, which was not statistically significant (n=21, P=0.1411).In the pre-specified analysis by age-group, by which the randomization was stratified, participants aged 4-5 years at time of treatment with SRP-9001 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in NSAA total score versus the age-matched placebo cohort, achieving a 4.3-point improvement on NSAA at 48 weeks post-treatment from baseline.The results from Study 102 reinforce the "favorable" safety and tolerability profile of SRP-9001, with no new safety signals identified.16:16WRAPX Closing Stock Market SummaryEach of the major indices closed at record highs on Thursday in a momentum trade led by the technology stocks. The Nasdaq Composite outperformed with an impressive 2.6% gain, followed by solid gains in the Russell 2000 (+1.9%), S&P 500 (+1.5%), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%).Risk sentiment broadened out to nine of the 11 S&P 500 sectors. The information technology (+2.7%), consumer discretionary (+1.8%), energy (+1.5%), and financials (+1.5%) sectors were the best-performing sectors; conversely, the utilities (-1.3%) and consumer staples (-0.3%) sectors closed lower.Investors bought yesterday's dip in the broader technology space and continued to bid up shares of Tesla (TSLA 816.04, +60.06, +7.9%), which was upgraded to Sector Perform from Underperform at RBC Capital Mkts after the firm conceded it was wrong about the stock.In addition, the oft-repeated recovery narrative was on display after Democrats flipped both Senate seats in Georgia yesterday, giving them slim majority in the Senate, and the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index rose to a better-than-expected 57.2% in December (Briefing.com consensus 54.7%) from 55.9% in November.The projected Democratic majority in the Senate contributed to the continued selling pressure in longer-dated Treasuries amid the possibility for more fiscal stimulus. These respective yields moved higher.The 10-yr yield increased three basis points to 1.07%, while the 2-yr yield was flat at 0.14%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 89.84. WTI crude futures increased 0.5%, or $0.24, to $50.81/bbl.In other corporate news, shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA 45.26, +2.23, +5.2%) rose 5% after beating top and bottom-line estimates, while DXC Technology (DXC 28.91, +2.46, +9.3%) received an acquisition proposal from French IT firm Atos for reportedly more than $10 billion.Reviewing Thursday's economic data:The ISM Non-Manufacturing Index rose to 57.2% in December (Briefing.com consensus 54.7%) from 55.9% in November. The dividing line between expansion and contraction is 50.0%. The December reading reflects a faster pace of expansion than the prior month, and it is the seventh consecutive reading above 50.0%.The key takeaway from the report is that the Employment Index, which dipped below 50.0%, blemished an otherwise solid snapshot of the services sector in December.Initial claims for the week ending January 2 decreased by 3,000 to 787,000 (Briefing.com consensus 752,000). Continuing claims for the week ending December 26 decreased by 126,000 to 5.072 million.The key takeaway from the report is that initial claims are still coming in at a stubbornly high level, which sends a poor signal about the state of the labor market.The U.S. trade deficit widened to $68.1 billion in November (Briefing.com consensus -$67.1 billion) from an unrevised $63.1 billion in October.The key takeaway from the report is that it showed another increase in exports and imports, indicating an uptick in global trade.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Employment Situation Report for December, Consumer Credit for November, and Wholesale Inventories for November on Friday.Russell 2000 +6.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +1.4% YTDNasdaq Composite +1.4% YTDS&P 500 +1.3% YTD16:14AIRG Airgain reports preliminary Q4 revenue inline with consensus; also announces acquisition of NimbeLink (17.19 -0.08)Co reports in-line preliminary Q4 revenue of $12.8 mln vs. the $12.82 mln S&P Capital IQ consensus.

The financials (-0.6%), communication services (-0.4%), and materials (-0.6%) sectors lag with modest declines.Specifying the jobs data, December nonfarm payrolls decreased by 140,000 (Briefing.com consensus +112,000), private sector payrolls decreased by 95,000 (Briefing.com consensus +100,000), and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 6.7%, as expected.The disappointing data has been partially offset by large upward revisions to November payrolls, an appreciation for the vaccination efforts that should hopefully reopen the economy later this year, and expectations for more fiscal stimulus under a Biden Administration and Democrat-controlled Congress.On a related note, reports indicate that President-elect Biden will propose a $3 trillion infrastructure package and will prioritize passing $2000 stimulus checks when he takes office. This has supported the continued selling in longer-dated Treasuries where the 10-yr yield is up four basis points to 1.11%.In other positive corporate developments, Union Pacific (UNP 219.15, +6.43, +3.0%) issued upside Q4 revenue guidance, Micron (MU 79.91, +0.82, +1.0%) topped earnings and revenue expectations and issued upside quarterly guidance, and Chevron (CVX 91.77, +1.55, +1.7%) was upgraded to Overweight from Neutral at Piper Sandler.Reviewing today's economic data:The December employment report disappointed on the headline level as nonfarm payrolls declined by 140,000 (Briefing.com consensus 112,000) against expectations for an increase. However, the drop was partially offset by a large upward revision to November figures and an increase in December average hourly earnings. December private sector payrolls decreased by 95,000 (Briefing.com consensus 100,000). December unemployment rate was unchanged at 6.7% (Briefing.com consensus 6.7%)Capital markets are likely to look past this report and focus on the expected increase in fiscal spending once a new administration is inaugurated, but the December report shows that the labor market is facing an uphill climb.Wholesale inventories were unchanged in November (Briefing.com consensus -0.1%) following an upwardly revised 1.3% increase (from +1.1%) in October.12:36EFX Equifax agrees to acquire Kount for $640 mln (182.29 +1.00)Equifax has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Kount, a provider of Artificial Intelligence-driven fraud prevention and digital identity solutions, for $640 mln.

The largest sector member-Amazon (AMZN 3150.94, -11.22, -0.4%)-holds a modest loss but seven of the next eight largest components sport solid gains. Continuation of this week's show of relative strength. The sector has extended this week's gain to 3.3% versus a 1.5% week-to-date gain in the S&P 500 (+0.2%).Notable movers:Etsy (ETSY 176.76, +5.97, +3.5%): best performer in the sector, rising toward its high from Monday. CarMax (KMX 102.64, +2.34, +2.3%): rising to its best level since late September. L Brands (LB 47.24, +1.07, +2.3%): rising to its best level since March 2018 after Telsey Advisory Group raised its target for the stock to $50 after the company issued above-consensus guidance for Q4. Hasbro (HAS 96.49, +1.67, +1.8%): revisiting its high from December. Home Depot (HD 268.90, +2.64, +1.0%): touched its 50-day moving average (270.93). McDonald's (MCD 214.29, +2.31, +1.1%): rising above its 50-day moving average (213.59). Lowe's (LOW 164.61, +0.90, +0.6%): approached its December high before narrowing its gain. Amazon (AMZN 3150.94, -11.22, -0.4%): slipping back below its 50-day moving average (3169.05) after oscillating near that level throughout the week. NVR (NVR 3941.56, -84.38, -2.1%): weakest performer in the sector, returning to this week's low after finding resistance near its 50-day moving average (4099.44).11:11INSID Insider Trading: notable purchases -- 10% Owner adds to HOME; notable sales -- Chairman & CEO active in TITNBuyers:GEF CFO bought 4,900 shares at $53.08 worth ~ $260K.HOME 10% Owner bought 169,993 shares at $16.37 worth ~ $2.8 mln.PRTY 10% Owner bought 316,500 shares at $6.63 worth ~ $2.1 mln.Sellers:ASO Chairman & CEO sold 120,729 shares at $19.90 - $21.20 worth ~ $2.5 mln.TITN Chairman & CEO sold 94,574 shares at $20.09 - $21.24 worth ~ $2.0 mln.For regular updates on our insider summaries and commentary, please add Briefing ticker INSID to ticker alerts.

The Nasdaq (+0.7%) and S&P 500 (+0.3%) continue hanging onto gains while the Dow (-0.1%) has turned negative.The early dip from highs represents a pullback after a strong start to 2021. The S&P 500 remains higher by 1.6% for the week while the Russell 2000 has jumped more than 6.0% in the first week of the year.Today's biggest story was the disappointing Employment Situation report for December, but it took a back seat to today's second biggest story, which was an Axios report that President-elect Biden will seek a $3 trln fiscal package that would call for about $2 trln in spending on green jobs and infrastructure.The December jobs report showed the loss of 140,000 payrolls (Briefing.com consensus +112,000) but some of the initial sting was offset by a large upward revision to November data and a larger than expected increase in average hourly earnings. Still, the report painted a bland picture of the labor market in December. However, the stock market is looking past the news thanks to the prospect of more fiscal spending.Seven out of eleven sectors trade with early gains, led by consumer discretionary (+1.5%) and real estate (+1.2%). On the downside, communication services (-0.7%) and financials (-0.4%) are the two weakest performers.10:24BAYRY Bayer AG announces FDA approval of sNDA for NUBEQA (15.84 -0.37)Bayer today announced that the FDA approved a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to add overall survival (OS) and other secondary endpoint data from the Phase III ARAMIS trial to the NUBEQA (darolutamide) Prescribing Information.

Additional data include time to pain progression and time to initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy. The Prescribing Information was also updated to include additional guidance on drug interactions. The final analysis reinforced NUBEQA's safety profile with an extended follow-up of median 29 months for the overall study population.10:23OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:EXEL Jan 25 calls are seeing interest with 4060 contracts trading vs. open int of 70, pushing implied vol up around 20 points to ~88%.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.2%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows energy (+1.0%), consumer discretionary (+1.0%), and information technology (+0.8%) outperforming in early action, while the communication services (-0.2%), financials (-0.1%), and materials (-0.1%) sectors trade lower.Longer-dated Treasuries have extended their recent retreat on the prospects for more fiscal stimulus, driving yields higher. The 10-yr yield is up three basis points to 1.10%, while the 2-yr yield is down one basis point to 0.13%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.2% to 89.69. WTI crude is up 1.2% to $51.44/bbl.09:30CSCO Cisco provides update on Acacia Communications (ACIA) deal; affirms that Chinese regulators informed Cisco that its submission was "sufficient to address the relevant competition concerns" (44.63 -0.33)Cisco today announced that it is seeking confirmation from the Delaware Court of Chancery that it has met all conditions for closing of its acquisition of Acacia Communications, including approval of China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR).

The results were published on the preprint server bioRxiv and are available here.Rapidly spreading variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, initially in the United Kingdom and South Africa. These variants have multiple mutations in their spike or S glycoproteins, which are key targets of virus neutralizing antibodies. Though these two rapidly spreading viruses are different, they share the N501Y mutation, which is located in the receptor binding site of the spike protein and results in the virus's spike protein binding more tightly to its receptor. It has been shown to infect mice more efficiently.iTo determine if sera of people who had received the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine could neutralize SARS-CoV-2 with the N501Y mutation, a virus with this substitution was generated in UTMB's laboratory. The sera of 20 participants from the previously reported Phase 3 trial neutralized the virus with the mutation as well as they neutralized virus without the mutation. While the virus tested in this experiment did not include the full set of spike mutations found on the rapidly spreading strains in the U.K. or South Africa, neutralization of virus with the N501Y mutation by the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine-elicited human sera is consistent with preserved neutralization of a panel of 15 pseudoviruses bearing spikes with other mutations found in circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains. This indicates that the key N501Y mutation, which is found in the emerging U.K and South Africa variants, does not create resistance to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine induced immune responses. Pfizer, BioNTech, and UTMB are encouraged by these early, in vitro study findings. Further data are needed to monitor the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine's effectiveness in preventing COVID-19 caused by new virus variants. If the virus mutates such that an update to the vaccine is required to continue to confer protection against COVID-19, we believe that the flexibility of BioNTech's proprietary mRNA vaccine platform is well suited to enable an adjustment to the vaccine.06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- Markets trade higher ahead of US jobs reportThe global equity markets are mostly higher with US futures pointing to modest gains to begin the day.

SRP-9001 is an investigational gene transfer therapy intended to deliver its micro-dystrophin-encoding gene to muscle tissue for the targeted production of the micro-dystrophin protein.At 12 weeks post-treatment compared to baseline, the study met its primary biological endpoint of micro-dystrophin protein expression (P<0.0001). Participants who received SRP-9001 (n=20) had mean micro-dystrophin expression of 28.1%, as measured by western blot. Accompanying secondary biological endpoints including vector genome copies per nucleus, percent positive fibers, intensity, and reduction in creatine kinase (exploratory) were also met.In the primary functional endpoint, SRP-9001-treated participants showed an increase in NSAA total score compared to placebo at 48 weeks; however, the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.37). At every time point measured, the cohort of SRP-9001 treated participants outperformed the placebo group, and, at 48 weeks, participants in the treatment group demonstrated a statistically significant increase of 1.7 points in NSAA total score compared to baseline (P=0.009), while participants in the placebo group saw an increase of 0.9 points on the NSAA total score compared to baseline, which was not statistically significant (n=21, P=0.1411).In the pre-specified analysis by age-group, by which the randomization was stratified, participants aged 4-5 years at time of treatment with SRP-9001 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in NSAA total score versus the age-matched placebo cohort, achieving a 4.3-point improvement on NSAA at 48 weeks post-treatment from baseline.The results from Study 102 reinforce the "favorable" safety and tolerability profile of SRP-9001, with no new safety signals identified.16:16WRAPX Closing Stock Market SummaryEach of the major indices closed at record highs on Thursday in a momentum trade led by the technology stocks. The Nasdaq Composite outperformed with an impressive 2.6% gain, followed by solid gains in the Russell 2000 (+1.9%), S&P 500 (+1.5%), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%).Risk sentiment broadened out to nine of the 11 S&P 500 sectors. The information technology (+2.7%), consumer discretionary (+1.8%), energy (+1.5%), and financials (+1.5%) sectors were the best-performing sectors; conversely, the utilities (-1.3%) and consumer staples (-0.3%) sectors closed lower.Investors bought yesterday's dip in the broader technology space and continued to bid up shares of Tesla (TSLA 816.04, +60.06, +7.9%), which was upgraded to Sector Perform from Underperform at RBC Capital Mkts after the firm conceded it was wrong about the stock.In addition, the oft-repeated recovery narrative was on display after Democrats flipped both Senate seats in Georgia yesterday, giving them slim majority in the Senate, and the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index rose to a better-than-expected 57.2% in December (Briefing.com consensus 54.7%) from 55.9% in November.The projected Democratic majority in the Senate contributed to the continued selling pressure in longer-dated Treasuries amid the possibility for more fiscal stimulus. These respective yields moved higher.The 10-yr yield increased three basis points to 1.07%, while the 2-yr yield was flat at 0.14%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 89.84. WTI crude futures increased 0.5%, or $0.24, to $50.81/bbl.In other corporate news, shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA 45.26, +2.23, +5.2%) rose 5% after beating top and bottom-line estimates, while DXC Technology (DXC 28.91, +2.46, +9.3%) received an acquisition proposal from French IT firm Atos for reportedly more than $10 billion.Reviewing Thursday's economic data:The ISM Non-Manufacturing Index rose to 57.2% in December (Briefing.com consensus 54.7%) from 55.9% in November. The dividing line between expansion and contraction is 50.0%. The December reading reflects a faster pace of expansion than the prior month, and it is the seventh consecutive reading above 50.0%.The key takeaway from the report is that the Employment Index, which dipped below 50.0%, blemished an otherwise solid snapshot of the services sector in December.Initial claims for the week ending January 2 decreased by 3,000 to 787,000 (Briefing.com consensus 752,000). Continuing claims for the week ending December 26 decreased by 126,000 to 5.072 million.The key takeaway from the report is that initial claims are still coming in at a stubbornly high level, which sends a poor signal about the state of the labor market.The U.S. trade deficit widened to $68.1 billion in November (Briefing.com consensus -$67.1 billion) from an unrevised $63.1 billion in October.The key takeaway from the report is that it showed another increase in exports and imports, indicating an uptick in global trade.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Employment Situation Report for December, Consumer Credit for November, and Wholesale Inventories for November on Friday.Russell 2000 +6.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +1.4% YTDNasdaq Composite +1.4% YTDS&P 500 +1.3% YTD16:14AIRG Airgain reports preliminary Q4 revenue inline with consensus; also announces acquisition of NimbeLink (17.19 -0.08)Co reports in-line preliminary Q4 revenue of $12.8 mln vs. the $12.82 mln S&P Capital IQ consensus.

Four of the five largest components by weight trade lower, weighing the sector down. Extension of this week's underperformance. The sector is now down 1.0% for the week, which leaves the group only ahead of real estate (+0.8%; -2.8% week-to-date), consumer staples (-0.2%; -1.7% week-to-date), and utilities (+0.5%; -1.0% week-to-date) on this week's leaderboard.Notable movers:Fox Corporation (FOXA 29.99, -0.95, -3.1%): weakest performer in the sector, deepening its pullback from a seven-month high. Twitter (TWTR 50.76, -1.57, -3.0%): falling to one-month low. Verizon (VZ 57.48, -1.06, -1.8%): falling below its 200-day moving average (57.86). AT&T (T 28.86, -0.53, -1.8%): falling below its 200-day (29.44) and 50-day moving averages (28.91). Facebook (FB 265.89, -2.86, -1.1%): returning to yesterday's session low. Disney (DIS 177.70, -0.88, -0.5%): slipping past yesterday's low despite being upgraded to Neutral from Sell at Lightshed Partners. DISH Network (DISH 32.98, +0.56, +1.7%): best performer in the sector, rising to its best level since mid-December.12:58SCANX Earnings Out Next WeekMonday (Jan 11) Morning: AZZ CMC Afternoon: SNX Tuesday (Jan 12) Morning: ACI Afternoon: KBH Wednesday (Jan 13) Morning: INFO SJR Afternoon: WAFD Thursday (Jan 14) Morning: APHA BLK DAL FRC TSM Afternoon: PRGS Friday (Jan 15) Morning: C JPM PNC WFC12:58WRAPX Midday Market Summary: Another record-setting advance despite weak jobs dataThe S&P 500 (+0.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+0.6%), and Russell 2000 (+0.1%) set fresh all-time highs at the open despite a weak December employment report, but they are off prior highs and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.2%) is trading in negative territory.Currently, the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (+1.5%), real estate (+0.8%), energy (+0.6%), and information technology (+0.4%) sectors are leading the broader advance, with the former driven higher by Tesla (TSLA 881.72, +65.61, +8.0%) again. The financials (-0.6%), communication services (-0.4%), and materials (-0.6%) sectors lag with modest declines.Specifying the jobs data, December nonfarm payrolls decreased by 140,000 (Briefing.com consensus +112,000), private sector payrolls decreased by 95,000 (Briefing.com consensus +100,000), and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 6.7%, as expected.The disappointing data has been partially offset by large upward revisions to November payrolls, an appreciation for the vaccination efforts that should hopefully reopen the economy later this year, and expectations for more fiscal stimulus under a Biden Administration and Democrat-controlled Congress.On a related note, reports indicate that President-elect Biden will propose a $3 trillion infrastructure package and will prioritize passing $2000 stimulus checks when he takes office. This has supported the continued selling in longer-dated Treasuries where the 10-yr yield is up four basis points to 1.11%.In other positive corporate developments, Union Pacific (UNP 219.15, +6.43, +3.0%) issued upside Q4 revenue guidance, Micron (MU 79.91, +0.82, +1.0%) topped earnings and revenue expectations and issued upside quarterly guidance, and Chevron (CVX 91.77, +1.55, +1.7%) was upgraded to Overweight from Neutral at Piper Sandler.Reviewing today's economic data:The December employment report disappointed on the headline level as nonfarm payrolls declined by 140,000 (Briefing.com consensus 112,000) against expectations for an increase. However, the drop was partially offset by a large upward revision to November figures and an increase in December average hourly earnings. December private sector payrolls decreased by 95,000 (Briefing.com consensus 100,000).

The results were published on the preprint server bioRxiv and are available here.Rapidly spreading variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, initially in the United Kingdom and South Africa. These variants have multiple mutations in their spike or S glycoproteins, which are key targets of virus neutralizing antibodies. Though these two rapidly spreading viruses are different, they share the N501Y mutation, which is located in the receptor binding site of the spike protein and results in the virus's spike protein binding more tightly to its receptor. It has been shown to infect mice more efficiently.iTo determine if sera of people who had received the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine could neutralize SARS-CoV-2 with the N501Y mutation, a virus with this substitution was generated in UTMB's laboratory. The sera of 20 participants from the previously reported Phase 3 trial neutralized the virus with the mutation as well as they neutralized virus without the mutation. While the virus tested in this experiment did not include the full set of spike mutations found on the rapidly spreading strains in the U.K. or South Africa, neutralization of virus with the N501Y mutation by the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine-elicited human sera is consistent with preserved neutralization of a panel of 15 pseudoviruses bearing spikes with other mutations found in circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains. This indicates that the key N501Y mutation, which is found in the emerging U.K and South Africa variants, does not create resistance to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine induced immune responses. Pfizer, BioNTech, and UTMB are encouraged by these early, in vitro study findings. Further data are needed to monitor the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine's effectiveness in preventing COVID-19 caused by new virus variants. If the virus mutates such that an update to the vaccine is required to continue to confer protection against COVID-19, we believe that the flexibility of BioNTech's proprietary mRNA vaccine platform is well suited to enable an adjustment to the vaccine.06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- Markets trade higher ahead of US jobs reportThe global equity markets are mostly higher with US futures pointing to modest gains to begin the day.

SRP-9001 is an investigational gene transfer therapy intended to deliver its micro-dystrophin-encoding gene to muscle tissue for the targeted production of the micro-dystrophin protein.At 12 weeks post-treatment compared to baseline, the study met its primary biological endpoint of micro-dystrophin protein expression (P<0.0001). Participants who received SRP-9001 (n=20) had mean micro-dystrophin expression of 28.1%, as measured by western blot. Accompanying secondary biological endpoints including vector genome copies per nucleus, percent positive fibers, intensity, and reduction in creatine kinase (exploratory) were also met.In the primary functional endpoint, SRP-9001-treated participants showed an increase in NSAA total score compared to placebo at 48 weeks; however, the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.37). At every time point measured, the cohort of SRP-9001 treated participants outperformed the placebo group, and, at 48 weeks, participants in the treatment group demonstrated a statistically significant increase of 1.7 points in NSAA total score compared to baseline (P=0.009), while participants in the placebo group saw an increase of 0.9 points on the NSAA total score compared to baseline, which was not statistically significant (n=21, P=0.1411).In the pre-specified analysis by age-group, by which the randomization was stratified, participants aged 4-5 years at time of treatment with SRP-9001 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in NSAA total score versus the age-matched placebo cohort, achieving a 4.3-point improvement on NSAA at 48 weeks post-treatment from baseline.The results from Study 102 reinforce the "favorable" safety and tolerability profile of SRP-9001, with no new safety signals identified.16:16WRAPX Closing Stock Market SummaryEach of the major indices closed at record highs on Thursday in a momentum trade led by the technology stocks. The Nasdaq Composite outperformed with an impressive 2.6% gain, followed by solid gains in the Russell 2000 (+1.9%), S&P 500 (+1.5%), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%).Risk sentiment broadened out to nine of the 11 S&P 500 sectors. The information technology (+2.7%), consumer discretionary (+1.8%), energy (+1.5%), and financials (+1.5%) sectors were the best-performing sectors; conversely, the utilities (-1.3%) and consumer staples (-0.3%) sectors closed lower.Investors bought yesterday's dip in the broader technology space and continued to bid up shares of Tesla (TSLA 816.04, +60.06, +7.9%), which was upgraded to Sector Perform from Underperform at RBC Capital Mkts after the firm conceded it was wrong about the stock.In addition, the oft-repeated recovery narrative was on display after Democrats flipped both Senate seats in Georgia yesterday, giving them slim majority in the Senate, and the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index rose to a better-than-expected 57.2% in December (Briefing.com consensus 54.7%) from 55.9% in November.The projected Democratic majority in the Senate contributed to the continued selling pressure in longer-dated Treasuries amid the possibility for more fiscal stimulus. These respective yields moved higher.The 10-yr yield increased three basis points to 1.07%, while the 2-yr yield was flat at 0.14%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 89.84. WTI crude futures increased 0.5%, or $0.24, to $50.81/bbl.In other corporate news, shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA 45.26, +2.23, +5.2%) rose 5% after beating top and bottom-line estimates, while DXC Technology (DXC 28.91, +2.46, +9.3%) received an acquisition proposal from French IT firm Atos for reportedly more than $10 billion.Reviewing Thursday's economic data:The ISM Non-Manufacturing Index rose to 57.2% in December (Briefing.com consensus 54.7%) from 55.9% in November. The dividing line between expansion and contraction is 50.0%. The December reading reflects a faster pace of expansion than the prior month, and it is the seventh consecutive reading above 50.0%.The key takeaway from the report is that the Employment Index, which dipped below 50.0%, blemished an otherwise solid snapshot of the services sector in December.Initial claims for the week ending January 2 decreased by 3,000 to 787,000 (Briefing.com consensus 752,000). Continuing claims for the week ending December 26 decreased by 126,000 to 5.072 million.The key takeaway from the report is that initial claims are still coming in at a stubbornly high level, which sends a poor signal about the state of the labor market.The U.S. trade deficit widened to $68.1 billion in November (Briefing.com consensus -$67.1 billion) from an unrevised $63.1 billion in October.The key takeaway from the report is that it showed another increase in exports and imports, indicating an uptick in global trade.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Employment Situation Report for December, Consumer Credit for November, and Wholesale Inventories for November on Friday.Russell 2000 +6.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +1.4% YTDNasdaq Composite +1.4% YTDS&P 500 +1.3% YTD16:14AIRG Airgain reports preliminary Q4 revenue inline with consensus; also announces acquisition of NimbeLink (17.19 -0.08)Co reports in-line preliminary Q4 revenue of $12.8 mln vs. the $12.82 mln S&P Capital IQ consensus.

Four of the five largest components by weight trade lower, weighing the sector down. Extension of this week's underperformance. The sector is now down 1.0% for the week, which leaves the group only ahead of real estate (+0.8%; -2.8% week-to-date), consumer staples (-0.2%; -1.7% week-to-date), and utilities (+0.5%; -1.0% week-to-date) on this week's leaderboard.Notable movers:Fox Corporation (FOXA 29.99, -0.95, -3.1%): weakest performer in the sector, deepening its pullback from a seven-month high. Twitter (TWTR 50.76, -1.57, -3.0%): falling to one-month low. Verizon (VZ 57.48, -1.06, -1.8%): falling below its 200-day moving average (57.86). AT&T (T 28.86, -0.53, -1.8%): falling below its 200-day (29.44) and 50-day moving averages (28.91). Facebook (FB 265.89, -2.86, -1.1%): returning to yesterday's session low. Disney (DIS 177.70, -0.88, -0.5%): slipping past yesterday's low despite being upgraded to Neutral from Sell at Lightshed Partners. DISH Network (DISH 32.98, +0.56, +1.7%): best performer in the sector, rising to its best level since mid-December.12:58SCANX Earnings Out Next WeekMonday (Jan 11) Morning: AZZ CMC Afternoon: SNX Tuesday (Jan 12) Morning: ACI Afternoon: KBH Wednesday (Jan 13) Morning: INFO SJR Afternoon: WAFD Thursday (Jan 14) Morning: APHA BLK DAL FRC TSM Afternoon: PRGS Friday (Jan 15) Morning: C JPM PNC WFC12:58WRAPX Midday Market Summary: Another record-setting advance despite weak jobs dataThe S&P 500 (+0.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+0.6%), and Russell 2000 (+0.1%) set fresh all-time highs at the open despite a weak December employment report, but they are off prior highs and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.2%) is trading in negative territory.Currently, the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (+1.5%), real estate (+0.8%), energy (+0.6%), and information technology (+0.4%) sectors are leading the broader advance, with the former driven higher by Tesla (TSLA 881.72, +65.61, +8.0%) again. The financials (-0.6%), communication services (-0.4%), and materials (-0.6%) sectors lag with modest declines.Specifying the jobs data, December nonfarm payrolls decreased by 140,000 (Briefing.com consensus +112,000), private sector payrolls decreased by 95,000 (Briefing.com consensus +100,000), and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 6.7%, as expected.The disappointing data has been partially offset by large upward revisions to November payrolls, an appreciation for the vaccination efforts that should hopefully reopen the economy later this year, and expectations for more fiscal stimulus under a Biden Administration and Democrat-controlled Congress.On a related note, reports indicate that President-elect Biden will propose a $3 trillion infrastructure package and will prioritize passing $2000 stimulus checks when he takes office. This has supported the continued selling in longer-dated Treasuries where the 10-yr yield is up four basis points to 1.11%.In other positive corporate developments, Union Pacific (UNP 219.15, +6.43, +3.0%) issued upside Q4 revenue guidance, Micron (MU 79.91, +0.82, +1.0%) topped earnings and revenue expectations and issued upside quarterly guidance, and Chevron (CVX 91.77, +1.55, +1.7%) was upgraded to Overweight from Neutral at Piper Sandler.Reviewing today's economic data:The December employment report disappointed on the headline level as nonfarm payrolls declined by 140,000 (Briefing.com consensus 112,000) against expectations for an increase. However, the drop was partially offset by a large upward revision to November figures and an increase in December average hourly earnings. December private sector payrolls decreased by 95,000 (Briefing.com consensus 100,000). December unemployment rate was unchanged at 6.7% (Briefing.com consensus 6.7%)Capital markets are likely to look past this report and focus on the expected increase in fiscal spending once a new administration is inaugurated, but the December report shows that the labor market is facing an uphill climb.Wholesale inventories were unchanged in November (Briefing.com consensus -0.1%) following an upwardly revised 1.3% increase (from +1.1%) in October.12:36EFX Equifax agrees to acquire Kount for $640 mln (182.29 +1.00)Equifax has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Kount, a provider of Artificial Intelligence-driven fraud prevention and digital identity solutions, for $640 mln.

The largest sector member-Amazon (AMZN 3150.94, -11.22, -0.4%)-holds a modest loss but seven of the next eight largest components sport solid gains. Continuation of this week's show of relative strength. The sector has extended this week's gain to 3.3% versus a 1.5% week-to-date gain in the S&P 500 (+0.2%).Notable movers:Etsy (ETSY 176.76, +5.97, +3.5%): best performer in the sector, rising toward its high from Monday. CarMax (KMX 102.64, +2.34, +2.3%): rising to its best level since late September.

The Nasdaq (+0.7%) and S&P 500 (+0.3%) continue hanging onto gains while the Dow (-0.1%) has turned negative.The early dip from highs represents a pullback after a strong start to 2021. The S&P 500 remains higher by 1.6% for the week while the Russell 2000 has jumped more than 6.0% in the first week of the year.Today's biggest story was the disappointing Employment Situation report for December, but it took a back seat to today's second biggest story, which was an Axios report that President-elect Biden will seek a $3 trln fiscal package that would call for about $2 trln in spending on green jobs and infrastructure.The December jobs report showed the loss of 140,000 payrolls (Briefing.com consensus +112,000) but some of the initial sting was offset by a large upward revision to November data and a larger than expected increase in average hourly earnings. Still, the report painted a bland picture of the labor market in December. However, the stock market is looking past the news thanks to the prospect of more fiscal spending.Seven out of eleven sectors trade with early gains, led by consumer discretionary (+1.5%) and real estate (+1.2%). On the downside, communication services (-0.7%) and financials (-0.4%) are the two weakest performers.10:24BAYRY Bayer AG announces FDA approval of sNDA for NUBEQA (15.84 -0.37)Bayer today announced that the FDA approved a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to add overall survival (OS) and other secondary endpoint data from the Phase III ARAMIS trial to the NUBEQA (darolutamide) Prescribing Information.

The results were published on the preprint server bioRxiv and are available here.Rapidly spreading variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, initially in the United Kingdom and South Africa. These variants have multiple mutations in their spike or S glycoproteins, which are key targets of virus neutralizing antibodies. Though these two rapidly spreading viruses are different, they share the N501Y mutation, which is located in the receptor binding site of the spike protein and results in the virus's spike protein binding more tightly to its receptor. It has been shown to infect mice more efficiently.iTo determine if sera of people who had received the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine could neutralize SARS-CoV-2 with the N501Y mutation, a virus with this substitution was generated in UTMB's laboratory. The sera of 20 participants from the previously reported Phase 3 trial neutralized the virus with the mutation as well as they neutralized virus without the mutation. While the virus tested in this experiment did not include the full set of spike mutations found on the rapidly spreading strains in the U.K. or South Africa, neutralization of virus with the N501Y mutation by the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine-elicited human sera is consistent with preserved neutralization of a panel of 15 pseudoviruses bearing spikes with other mutations found in circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains. This indicates that the key N501Y mutation, which is found in the emerging U.K and South Africa variants, does not create resistance to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine induced immune responses. Pfizer, BioNTech, and UTMB are encouraged by these early, in vitro study findings. Further data are needed to monitor the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine's effectiveness in preventing COVID-19 caused by new virus variants. If the virus mutates such that an update to the vaccine is required to continue to confer protection against COVID-19, we believe that the flexibility of BioNTech's proprietary mRNA vaccine platform is well suited to enable an adjustment to the vaccine.06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- Markets trade higher ahead of US jobs reportThe global equity markets are mostly higher with US futures pointing to modest gains to begin the day.

SRP-9001 is an investigational gene transfer therapy intended to deliver its micro-dystrophin-encoding gene to muscle tissue for the targeted production of the micro-dystrophin protein.At 12 weeks post-treatment compared to baseline, the study met its primary biological endpoint of micro-dystrophin protein expression (P<0.0001). Participants who received SRP-9001 (n=20) had mean micro-dystrophin expression of 28.1%, as measured by western blot. Accompanying secondary biological endpoints including vector genome copies per nucleus, percent positive fibers, intensity, and reduction in creatine kinase (exploratory) were also met.In the primary functional endpoint, SRP-9001-treated participants showed an increase in NSAA total score compared to placebo at 48 weeks; however, the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.37). At every time point measured, the cohort of SRP-9001 treated participants outperformed the placebo group, and, at 48 weeks, participants in the treatment group demonstrated a statistically significant increase of 1.7 points in NSAA total score compared to baseline (P=0.009), while participants in the placebo group saw an increase of 0.9 points on the NSAA total score compared to baseline, which was not statistically significant (n=21, P=0.1411).In the pre-specified analysis by age-group, by which the randomization was stratified, participants aged 4-5 years at time of treatment with SRP-9001 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in NSAA total score versus the age-matched placebo cohort, achieving a 4.3-point improvement on NSAA at 48 weeks post-treatment from baseline.The results from Study 102 reinforce the "favorable" safety and tolerability profile of SRP-9001, with no new safety signals identified.16:16WRAPX Closing Stock Market SummaryEach of the major indices closed at record highs on Thursday in a momentum trade led by the technology stocks. The Nasdaq Composite outperformed with an impressive 2.6% gain, followed by solid gains in the Russell 2000 (+1.9%), S&P 500 (+1.5%), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%).Risk sentiment broadened out to nine of the 11 S&P 500 sectors. The information technology (+2.7%), consumer discretionary (+1.8%), energy (+1.5%), and financials (+1.5%) sectors were the best-performing sectors; conversely, the utilities (-1.3%) and consumer staples (-0.3%) sectors closed lower.Investors bought yesterday's dip in the broader technology space and continued to bid up shares of Tesla (TSLA 816.04, +60.06, +7.9%), which was upgraded to Sector Perform from Underperform at RBC Capital Mkts after the firm conceded it was wrong about the stock.In addition, the oft-repeated recovery narrative was on display after Democrats flipped both Senate seats in Georgia yesterday, giving them slim majority in the Senate, and the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index rose to a better-than-expected 57.2% in December (Briefing.com consensus 54.7%) from 55.9% in November.The projected Democratic majority in the Senate contributed to the continued selling pressure in longer-dated Treasuries amid the possibility for more fiscal stimulus. These respective yields moved higher.The 10-yr yield increased three basis points to 1.07%, while the 2-yr yield was flat at 0.14%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 89.84. WTI crude futures increased 0.5%, or $0.24, to $50.81/bbl.In other corporate news, shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA 45.26, +2.23, +5.2%) rose 5% after beating top and bottom-line estimates, while DXC Technology (DXC 28.91, +2.46, +9.3%) received an acquisition proposal from French IT firm Atos for reportedly more than $10 billion.Reviewing Thursday's economic data:The ISM Non-Manufacturing Index rose to 57.2% in December (Briefing.com consensus 54.7%) from 55.9% in November. The dividing line between expansion and contraction is 50.0%. The December reading reflects a faster pace of expansion than the prior month, and it is the seventh consecutive reading above 50.0%.The key takeaway from the report is that the Employment Index, which dipped below 50.0%, blemished an otherwise solid snapshot of the services sector in December.Initial claims for the week ending January 2 decreased by 3,000 to 787,000 (Briefing.com consensus 752,000). Continuing claims for the week ending December 26 decreased by 126,000 to 5.072 million.The key takeaway from the report is that initial claims are still coming in at a stubbornly high level, which sends a poor signal about the state of the labor market.The U.S. trade deficit widened to $68.1 billion in November (Briefing.com consensus -$67.1 billion) from an unrevised $63.1 billion in October.The key takeaway from the report is that it showed another increase in exports and imports, indicating an uptick in global trade.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Employment Situation Report for December, Consumer Credit for November, and Wholesale Inventories for November on Friday.Russell 2000 +6.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +1.4% YTDNasdaq Composite +1.4% YTDS&P 500 +1.3% YTD16:14AIRG Airgain reports preliminary Q4 revenue inline with consensus; also announces acquisition of NimbeLink (17.19 -0.08)Co reports in-line preliminary Q4 revenue of $12.8 mln vs. the $12.82 mln S&P Capital IQ consensus.

Global $1.2 Billion E-Beam Wafer Inspection Systems Market to 2025: Focus on Applied Materials, ASML, Hitachi High-Technologies, KLA, Lam Research, & Photo Electron SoulPR NewswireMarch 9, 2021 Tuesday 12:45 PM ESTCopyright 2021 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1231 wordsDateline: DUBLIN, March 9, 2021 BodyPR NewswireThe"E-Beam Wafer Inspection Systems - Global Market Trajectory & Analytics"report has been added toResearchAndMarkets.com'soffering.The global market for E-Beam Wafer Inspection System is projected to reach US$1.2 billion by 2025, driven by the growing demands placed on semiconductor companies to optimize yield management.The focus on metrology and high performance quality control is therefore increasing. Rapid digitalization and evolution of Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and machine learning technologies are driving the need for faster, smaller, low power devices, bringing in new challenges for semiconductor manufacturers.While wafer size is increasing from 200 mm to 300nm, critical dimensions of semiconductor circuits (patterns) is rapidly shrinking to 0.13 um and 0.10 um. As critical dimensions shrink, identifying defects becomes more difficult and time-consuming. However, in order to ensure profitability and production efficiency, yield limiting defects need to be identified early on in the manufacturing flow.Wafer defect inspection is therefore emerging into an important step in the semiconductor manufacturing process. Intrinsic defects on bare wafers if left undetected can lead to killer defects on final processed wafer/chips. Early detection of physical defects and pattern defects on wafers can help save companies millions of dollars in production losses.E-Beam Wafer Inspection System, in this regard, is witnessing strong growth and adoption supported by benefits such as minimized total time for detecting and fixing defects on processed wafers; higher return-on-investment for semiconductor fabricators; high resolution; effective for inspecting nodes at 10 nm and below; ability to identify defects residing deep within the wafer structures; and effectively identifies electrical defects that impact yield. Technology developments aimed at enhancing throughput speeds are of vital importance, given that slow throughput is the Achilles Heel of the technology.Other major noteworthy trends in the market include innovations in multi-beam e-beam inspection brings the promise of reduced cost of inspection for each node; growing replacement of optical inspection with e-beam inspection as new architectures like finFETs & 3D NAND emerge. Asia-Pacific excluding China represents the largest market worldwide with a 30.3% share. U.S., Japan and China represent the other major markets with a combined share of 43.6%.China ranks as the fastest growing market with a 22.3% CAGR over the analysis period supported by the Chinese governments efforts to build a self-sufficient, homegrown semiconductor industry against the backdrop of intensifying U.S.-China trade war. Funding support, favorable policies and R&D push have already resulted in the establishment of several start-ups focusing on AI and machine learning hardware.As the country initiates its long-term plan of reducing dependence on US chip technology, semiconductor infrastructure in the country will receive a boost spurring opportunities for production technologies like e-beam inspection.Asia-Pacific excluding China follows next with a 21.4% CAGR led by established semiconductor manufacturing giants such as Taiwan and South Korea.Key Topics Covered:I.

WHO team visits Wuhan hospital where first cases of COVID-19 were treatedCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 30, 2021 SaturdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 768 wordsBodyThe World Health Organization expert group travelled to Wuhan, China, with the aim of conducting research to determine the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the pandemic leader. At the hospital, his purpose was to interview the first doctors who treated patients with COVID-19.After a year of pandemic, several unknowns of the SARS-CoV-2 virus have already been established as what its rate of infection is, how it spreads, how communicable and lethal it is, what its symptoms or sequelae are and how long immunity lasts. Even several pharmacists have managed to develop a vaccine to stop its spread. For science, however, the origin of the virus remains a mystery. (Read: Wuhan, the first major pandemic quarantine a year later)To try to establish how the outbreak of this virus took place in Wuhan, China, a world health organization (WHO) expert group visited Xinhua Hospital in Hubei Province, Wuhan, where the first cases of COVID-19 were addressed in December 2019. Peter Daszak, one of the members of the delegation, wrote on his Twitter account that "the first extremely important visit (...) We're at the hospital that dealt with some of the first known cases of covid-19, meeting with the doctors and staff who worked at the time. A frank discussion about the details of his work."According to data published by Chinese media, Zhang Jixian, director of his department of intensive and respiratory care, was the first physician to report on the case of a possible new coronavirus after reviewing a pair of older adults. Patients' CT scans, the doctor explained, showed differences with typical pneumonia.In addition to the hospital, the WHO delegation has several visits, one of which is to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, where coronavirus was reportedly manipulated. This site is perhaps the most controversial because of the hypotheses that were generated, one of them picked up by former President Donald Trump, who assured that the virus could have escaped from that lab. However, this thesis, for now, is not supported by any serious evidence. (You can see: WHO experts arrive in Wuhan to investigate the origin of COVID-19)The group will also be in a Huanan food market linked to one of the first groups of cases of this coronavirus. This place, where live wild animals were sold, has been closed since 2020. At the visit of the places, which will be held for several weeks, the meetings with scientists, lifeguards and some of the first patients who were infected are added. Although the delegation's itinerary is unknown exactly, the organization, through its Twitter account, has been reporting the activities it has carried out. In fact, he reported that the group cannot leave freely in Wuhan and can only meet with people who are enrolled in the itinerary established by the Chinese government. Margaret Harris, WHO spokesperson, through a briefing in Geneva, noted that "the team will leave, but they will be bused anywhere, so they will have no contact with the community (...) They will only have contact with several people who are organizing as part of the study."WHO's visit has generated controversy in China, mainly over political issues. Zhao Lijian, spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, denied that Chinadirectly identified and minimized the scope of WHO's mission. "I would like to stress that cooperation and exchanges between WHO experts and Chinese experts are a chapter in the global search for the origins of the coronavirus. This is not an investigation against China," he added. The ministry's statements are supported by complaints from the relatives of the victims, who reported that the country's authorities had eliminated their social media group and told them to remain silent during the stay of the country's delegation. (You may be interested in: 'The world is not doing enough to curb contagion,' WHO's ear pull)A WHO spokesperson said that "the team is deeply sympathetic to patients who have survived COVID-19 and the families of those who lost their lives to Covid-19. The team will talk to some of the first COVID-19 patients and possibly some families of the deceased."WHO's mission comes a year after Wuhan doctors announced several cases of a disease caused by a new coronavirus that was not yet available. To date, coronavirus has killed more than 2 million people, the United States (with 430,000), is the country where more dead people are recorded. Brazil (with 220,000) and Mexico (with 150,000) follow. Interestingly in China, where the outbreak arose, only 4,636 people have died, according to data from the Chinese National Health Commission. Load-Date: January 31, 2021End of Document

However, in order to ensure profitability and production efficiency, yield limiting defects need to be identified early on in the manufacturing flow.Wafer defect inspection is therefore emerging into an important step in the semiconductor manufacturing process. Intrinsic defects on bare wafers if left undetected can lead to killer defects on final processed wafer/chips. Early detection of physical defects and pattern defects on wafers can help save companies millions of dollars in production losses.E-Beam Wafer Inspection System, in this regard, is witnessing strong growth and adoption supported by benefits such as minimized total time for detecting and fixing defects on processed wafers; higher return-on-investment for semiconductor fabricators; high resolution; effective for inspecting nodes at 10 nm and below; ability to identify defects residing deep within the wafer structures; and effectively identifies electrical defects that impact yield. Technology developments aimed at enhancing throughput speeds are of vital importance, given that slow throughput is the Achilles Heel of the technology. Other major noteworthy trends in the market include innovations in multi-beam e-beam inspection brings the promise of reduced cost of inspection for each node; growing replacement of optical inspection with e-beam inspection as new architectures like finFETs & 3D NAND emerge. Asia-Pacific excluding China represents the largest market worldwide with a 30.3% share. U.S., Japan and China represent the other major markets with a combined share of 43.6%.China ranks as the fastest growing market with a 22.3% CAGR over the analysis period supported by the Chinese governments efforts to build a self-sufficient, homegrown semiconductor industry against the backdrop of intensifying U.S.-China trade war. Funding support, favorable policies and R&D push have already resulted in the establishment of several start-ups focusing on AI and machine learning hardware.As the country initiates its long-term plan of reducing dependence on US chip technology, semiconductor infrastructure in the country will receive a boost spurring opportunities for production technologies like e-beam inspection.Asia-Pacific excluding China follows next with a 21.4% CAGR led by established semiconductor manufacturing giants such as Taiwan and South Korea.Key Topics Covered:I.

TikTok's U.S. sale is suspended by Joe BidenCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 10, 2021 WednesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 272 wordsBodyByteDance breathes. Joe Biden's administration has just suspended Donald Trump's plan indefinitely that required TikTok's creators to sell their app to a U.S. company to make it work in that country.According to information published by The Wall Street Journal, Joe Biden's administration has just announced that it will review the actions promoted by Donald Trump, former president of the United States, against the well-known short video app Tiktok.According to Trump, Chinese technology companies meant a risk to U.S. national security, so on August 6 he issued a decree requiring that the application in question be separated from ByteDance, its parent company, if it wanted to continue operating in that country.While the government will continue to monitor Chinese applications closely, several U.S. national security officials will continue to be in talks with ByteDance, to address issues such as data collection, its security, and how to prevent the Chinese government from accessing this information."We plan to develop a holistic approach to securing U.S. data that addresses the full range of threats we face," says National Security Council spokeswoman Emily Horne. In this way, it confirms that the administration seeks to know what is the risk of using Chinese applications and other software programs in the country.On the other hand, the Hypertextual portal adds that decisions regarding TikTok and other apps in China will not change overnight. This is because Horne indicated that in the coming months they will start reviewing specific cases, in order to have a comprehensive understanding of the risks they face.Load-Date: February 11, 2021End of Document

MWC falters at Facebook's downs, which adds to those of Sony and NokiaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 11, 2021 ThursdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 592 wordsBodyJust three weeks ago, Mobile World Congress was held in Shanghai in its Asian edition. China's fierce health discipline led to the organization of an event that begins to wobble in its Barcelona version. The situation, at this stage, is dangerously reminiscent of what happened last year, at the dawn of the pandemic, when the first doubts sparked a cascade of annulments that led to the fret with the contest. The organizers, GSMA, and the Catalan administrations closed ranks to organize an event compatible with health requirements. But neither Barcelona is Shanghai nor Spain, China. It has done little good, on Tuesday Ericsson was unsubscribed, and in just two days Nokia, Sony and Facebook have joined. The looks, like last year, are now aimed at industry greats, such as Google or Samsung, to take the pulse of mobile world congress, which would be held in the Catalan capital from June 28 to July 1.On February 5 last year, the Korean LG opened the pandora's box and annulled her presence at the MWC for fear of the "Wuhan coronavirus". It was only 20 days before the opening of the contest. On February 10, they had already cancelled germany's Gigaset, Us And Nvidia, Japan's Sony and NTT Docom, China's Umidigi and Sweden's Ericsson. The visionary conseller of Digital Policies of the Generalitat, Jordi Puigneró, assured that they were prepared "to be able to organize the event and also to prevent and detect any suspected coronavirus". "We cannot allow the virus of fear to be inoculated," he added. Three days later GSMA officially cancelled the contest, following the removal of AT&T, Vodafone, Deutsche Telekom, Intel or Facebook. Conspiracy theories about the hidden interests of moving the Mobile World Congress from the city were unleashed, even from public administrations themselves. The then Secretary of Public Health of Catalonia, Joan Guix, denounced a "media and fear epidemic" motivated by economic, competitive and political interests against Mobile. Nothing further from reality. A month later Spain closed to lime and singing to try to contain the havoc of the pandemic.To launch the Shanghai MWC, in addition to unwavering support from the Chinese government and technology, the organizers imposed strict access control, records but above all a kind of viral passport in the form of QR code, i.e. the participants' medical history.For Barcelona, GSMA has halved the usual attendance, so between 45,000 and 50,000 people are expected, negative covid tests will be asked to all those who attend, who must also wear FFP2 masks. The GSMA has prepared a health and safety plan endorsed by health authorities to ensure that there are no contagions at the event. Among the measures included in the plan, in addition to those mentioned, is the optimization of human traffic flows to ensure a minimum distance between people of 1.5 meters, a design of spaces so that there is no audience density less than 2.5 square meters per person, frequent hand washing and reinforcement of ventilation and cleaning. In addition, the MWC will require a negative result to a PCR test performed a maximum of 72 hours before access to the venue, and another every 72 hours in order to continue accessing the facilities in which the event is held, which in 2022 hopes to be able to return to its usual dates in Barcelona: the month of February.In this context, Facebook's decision is a new jug of cold water for theEvent. At least it is even for the small format of this edition as the platform is studying its virtual participation in the event.Load-Date: March 12, 2021End of Document

Short video of Jack Ma sparks US$58,000M relief signalCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 20, 2021 WednesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 473 wordsBody(Bloomberg) -- Jack Ma showed up for less than a minute and said nothing about the Chinese government's crackdown on his business empire.But for investors who had been waiting months to see it, the entrepreneur's participation in a video conference broadcast Wednesday live was enough to provoke a $58 billion distress signal. That's what increased the market value of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. after a video of Ma talking to a group of teachers began circulating on the net, his first public comments since he disappeared late last year.Not much is yet known about the future of China's most famous businessman. However, analysts said Wednesday's video was a sign that the worst-case scenarios—such as Ma incarcerated or the government taking control of their companies—are probably out of consideration now. Ma was unlikely to have participated in the event without at least Beijing's tactical approval; state media outlets such as the Global Times were among those who published excerpts from their conference or wrote articles about their appearance."There is still a lot of uncertainty about the upcoming regulators' actions, but this means jack Ma's condition is much better than many people speculated," said Fang Kecheng, a professor at The Chinese University of Hong Kong.Ma's conference focused on philanthropic issues, such as the importance of reducing income inequality and reviving rural china, two major priorities for xi Jinping's Communist Party. Although far from a mea culpa, his words showed a strong contrast to Ma's last public comments in October, when the billionaire harshly criticized Chinese regulators and state banks.A few days after that speech at the Bund Summit in Shanghai, the government blocked Ma's plan to bring Ant Group Co. publicly at what would have been the world's largest public offering of shares. In the following weeks, authorities ordered a reorganization of Ant's operations and initiated an Alibaba antitrust investigation.Few expect Ma's tone change to make Beijing stand behind in his campaign to subject Ant, Alibaba and the rest of China's tech giants to stricter regulations. But Wednesday's market response suggests that investors are beginning to discount the risk of a crackdown that would put wealthiest entrepreneurs and the country's most innovative companies at serious risk.Speculation about Ma's whereabouts had intensified in recent weeks after it was known that he had not participated in the recording of a television show he had founded himself. Chinese authorities in the past have quietly arrested billionaires who conflict with the Communist Party.Ant, controlled by Ma and partly owned by Alibaba, confirmed the authenticity of the video, but declined to comment further.Original Note:Jack Ma's Brief Video Chat Prompts at $58 Billion Sigh of Relief©2021 Bloomberg L.P.Load-Date: January 22, 2021End of Document

I think there's a great deal of optimism in the stock market based on things improving and we're starting to see that in a moderate way. We're still a long way from where we were expected to be in 2020 for earnings on the market and so that closing that gap is going to be really important.You know I think we're still not quite to that 165 level. Current earnings are expected to be somewhere about $12 or $13 less than that. So we got a ways to go and I think the markets are looking forward to some parts of the new President Biden's agenda.The stimulus for example and the $1400 checks and the continuation of the added unemployment benefits that add up to a little bit of optimism and then on the technology side, there's things that are happening that you know are good, solid long term growth opportunities.BARTIROMO: So Joe Biden inaugurated as the nation's 46th president yesterday. As soon as he was inaugurated, he is expected to prioritize additional coronavirus stimulus and aid for Americans. The administration could also rollback regulation cuts put in place by the former President Trump.What's your outlook in terms of these executive orders that we're expecting which will create more bureaucracy for business and perhaps slow things down?O'HARA: Well, I think you know, there's - there's sort of two competing trends, one is the stimulus which is seen as a positive but we have a philosophical change going on in terms of the way we're going to be governed and the way the economy is going to be left at.President Trump's view was to open up and unleash the economy and provide incentives. I think the new administration's going to be a little bit more punitive, you know they're going to as you said roll back those regulatory reliefs that the president - previous President Trump put in place and they're going to eventually raise taxes.I'm hoping that in the short run, that they do this in a moderate way. I don't think they'll go right for the tax thing initially, especially with the economy where it is but I think we need to start thinking about what the markets look like, what earnings look like going forward if we in fact do have an increase in an overall taxes from corporations just all the way down to individuals because I think that will slow some of the optimism that is baked into this market currently.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Sean, it's Dagen McDowell. We've got a lot of economic numbers coming up but especially today the weekly jobless claims out at 8:30 AM eastern time as always estimates are expecting that 910,000 people filed first time claims for unemployment benefits as the country remains hard hit by the coronavirus epidemic or pandemic.Last week the latest numbers were that about 18.5 million people are collecting unemployment in some way so what are your expectations here?O'HARA: Well, I think - I think the trend will probably continue as it relates to the long term unemployment numbers. I just don't see the economy opening up in some parts as quickly as we would like it to be at this time.Although you know normally Dagen, that would be seen as a negative. I think the market, the way it's reading these things, it's going to look at that and say well, great things are continuing to be slower than we thought so we'll get more government intervention, we'll get more Fed intervention.I mean that's been the real narrative in the market is that you know that that the government and the Fed have been there to kind of prop things up and so until we go back to a system where bad news is viewed as bad news and good news is viewed as good news, I think we'll continue along the same lines.BARTIROMO: Sean, do you see - have you seen an impact on the energy space? Of course Joe Biden one of his executive orders yesterday was to kill the Keystone Pipeline. That's going to mean you know job losses throughout the energy sector. Are you seeing that in ETFs? Are you seeing that in money flow yet?O'HARA: Well, it's kind of interesting. Not yet. You know we have a strategy that uses free cash flow yield as a screen and we will go over weighed and under weighed energy from time to time based on that free cash flow yield and free cash flow yield to let your listeners know is the total amount you pay to buy company stock and debt minus cash and then how much annual cash you get back as far as cash flow.The higher the percentage for our view, the better that is so if I pay 100 bucks and I get 10 Bucks back, that's a 10 percent free cash flow yield. As we see more regulation in the energy sector, it's sort of a counter intuitive thing, it will clamp down production and so supply demand dynamics will take place and so the price of oil and energy will go up which is not good for the consumer and not necessarily great for the economy but it is good for the energy producers.BARTIROMO: OK. All right Sean, we'll keep watching. Great to see you this morning. Thank you so much. Sean O'Hara joining us--O'HARA: Good morning, thanks.BARTIROMO: - for Pacers ETF.O'HARA: Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: All right, we'll see you soon Sean. Let's check the morning mover. It's United Airlines this morning hitting some turbulence premarket after posting a bigger than expected loss yesterday. The airline reporting a loss of $7.1 billion for 2020 and warning that the coronavirus will continue to impact travel demand in 2021.The company expecting revenue for the first quarter of 21 to be down 65 to 70 percent calling 2021 a transition year focused on preparing for a recovery. The stock this morning down better than 2 percent. We are just getting started this morning. We got a lot coming up. Former New York police lieutenant Darrin Porcher is here on the rioting we're seeing in the Pacific Northwest.Texas congressman August Pfluger will join me on the President's new executive orders on immigration and then next hour former acting commissioner for the customs and border protection agency, Mark Morgan will discuss the end of the border wall construction. It's already 450 miles built. What does that mean?In the 8:00 AM hour, Texas congressman Henry Cuellar will talk to Joe Biden's calls for unity during the inauguration speech. Then House minority whip Steve Scalise with the future of the political parties now that all levels of government are controlled by the Democrats, what will policy look like. Don't miss a moment of it. You're watching Mornings with Maria live on Fox business.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: I will be a president for all Americans, all Americans and I promise you, I will fight as hard for those who did not support me as for those who did.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: At his start today in Washington yesterday, Joe Biden sworn in as the 46th President of the United States, calling for unity and an end to the uncivil war. The President wasting no time in getting to work, signing 15 executive orders and two executive actions following his inaugural address including halting funding for the border wall, rejoining the Paris Climate Accord and imposing a mask mandate on federal property.Joining me right now is The Federalist's Senior Editor Christopher Bedford. Chris, it's great to see you. Your reaction to all the proceedings yesterday.CHRISTOPHER BEDFORD, SENIOR EDITOR, THE FEDERALIST: Joe Biden got a lot of praise yesterday. President Joe Biden got a lot of praise for his nice words and it was a nice speech but I don't think the Democrats are very serious about unity right now.In addition to these executive orders which are going to change a huge amount of how our bureaucracy works and how even schools work, Joe Biden's pursuing a second impeachment or at least allowing the Senate Democrats and House Democrats to pursue a second impeachment, literally going after former enemies.In addition to that, none of them have said really a word about the massive censorship or the move by tech companies to silence any of their critics. He gave this speech surrounded by somewhere between 15,000 and 25,000 national guardsmen to a completely empty mall and huge amounts of the corporate media completely ate it up and spit it out as if it was absolutely completely normal.I mean Susan Rice who is someone who's not even going to be put up for Senate confirmation. You might remember her from the Barack Obama years. I don't want to put in from the front of the Senate confirmation because she's such a controversial figure. One of his executive orders puts her in charge of making sure every government action is done through the lens of equity.Now equity doesn't mean equality. Equity as a left wing term for equality of outcome and that means that they're going to treat different people differently in America based on their race. This is a very strange time to be returning to policies some 60-70 years ago in 2021.BARTIROMO: Yes, it's interesting. We will really see the priorities of this administration whether the unity call is for real when we - when we start hearing more about that impeachment trial but you're right about the media. A real change in tune with a new leader in the White House.The pandits were not hiding their excitement during yesterday's event. Take a listen. We've got a little montage here, watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A welcome sight for many Americans. President Trump is leaving Washington.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: 46th President of the United States putting his soul into his first address.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's going to be a little pathetic, a tiny little crowd at Joint Base Andrews.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We saw this steely determination and compassion of President Joe Biden.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Are you surprised Chris? A complete 360 when you see the media discussing the new president?BEDFORD: The only thing that actually did kind of surprise me a little bit about yesterday's coverage was the pathetic tiny little crowd comment from Wolf Blitzer. That seriously sounded to me like a tweet from Kim Jong-un taunting American politicians. It was so over the top.I'm somewhat just a little bit rattled but not surprised at how quickly this reversals happened. I was just looking at some of the coverage for example in the Washington Post on Mrs. Biden's - Dr. Biden's education job. They call her Mrs. B, the cool compassionate teacher. Now compare that to the Washington Post coverage of Karen Pence's job as a teacher where Mile Pence, the vice president Mike Pence had to respond quote to the outrage that had been raised over her returning to her - returning to work at a Christian school.I mean CBS had Kamala Harris and her husband on to talk about her sneakers and their marriage. There all these reviews of the fashion aspect and they're in - this New York Times editor has already deleted her Twitter account because she said that she got the chills just seeing Biden landing at the airport.This is a really swift reversal and I think we're going to have to deal with four more years of feeling like we're butting in of someone's romantic date as far as the media coverage of this White House goes.MCDOWELL: Chris, it's Dagen McDowell. When I saw that tweet about oh, I got the chills; I thought you know you should never tell anybody that in the COVID era because people going to think that you have a temperature or fever. I just but - so you get endless effusive praise of anything that comes out of the Biden administration.Quite frankly anybody on the left which is the right for those left wing liberals, right in their truest sense but what about - again, it was never about just hatred of Trump, it really was about hatred of his supporters of anybody who voted for him and you're seeing that. Are we going to get any push back from this administration?You brought up the big tech censorship. But what are we going to have anyone stand up for truly all Americans?BEDFORD: No, I think they're going to - this is one of the most telling signs of where we're going with this administration because of all the nice talk and all the warm words we heard yesterday and absolute silence on this front and you're exactly right.In 2016, after President Trump won his first term, the media and the Democratic Party took a step back and said why do we spend so much time vilifying Trump supporters instead of trying to understand them and they spent the next four years vilifying Trump's supporters instead of trying to understand them.We saw a doubling down of that with anchors and other channels calling his supporters Klansmen so when you think someone's a Klansmen and "on the wrong side of history," it's completely justifiable in your mind to shut them down. What they don't realize is that shutting down 74 million people - 75 million people and trying to silence their views is the kind of thing that will really backfire.It certainly doesn't lead to unity and I expect a rise in populism to--BARTIROMO: And it's the kind of - and it's the kind of thing you see in Communist China. Let's face it Chris. It's good to see you this morning. We'll talk soon. Christopher Bedford. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The new president's new plans. President Joe Biden implementing 17 executive orders after being sworn in yesterday. He ceased all withdraw from the World Health Organization. He stopped the construction of the border wall. He put in place a national mask mandate on federal property.These are only a few of the orders that undo parts of President Donald Trump's legacy. Dagen McDowell, let's go through the impact. What do you say?MCDOWELL: The two most - I think the two things that send the biggest message to the American people that will hurt the American people more than anything else would be rejoining the Paris Climate Accord.Again, that puts pressure on the United States which is already reduced its emissions back per capita to where they were and 1950. It gives a pass to the biggest polluter in the world, China for at least a decade. That's burn some, that's a tax but also killing the Keystone Pipeline. That sends a horrific message to our ally, to the north Canada and will also cost America, the United States potentially thousands of jobs.And by the way that oil will just simply be put on own rail cars and on trucks which increases pollution, not reducing it.BARTIROMO: That's right. I think - that is such a great point that you're going from the pipeline to putting it on trucks which actually are more likely to have an accident, God forbid on the trucks or on the train tracks so that's also I totally agree Dagen.That is probably the most impactful but I have a Cowen and co report in my hand right now and here's the title. Inauguration Day, what did President Biden do that impacts financials and housing? And here's their list.The fair access rule stop. The White House issuing an executive order freezing rules that have not yet been finalized published in the Federal Register. That means the OCC's fair access rule will not take effect. It would require banks to service all companies including those in out of favor industries such as private prisons, chemical companies and gun makers. There's the new CFPB leadership. Kathy Kraninger resigning as Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau giving the Biden administration immediate control of that agency.That already has announced the intent to nominate FTC commissioner Rohit Chopra as the next director. Student loan repayments are frozen through September. One Biden executive order will direct the Department of Education to freeze the repayment of government issued student loans through September 30.Generally positive for other creditors and economic activity. No foreclosures through March, another order directing the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Federal Housing Finance Agency to refrain from foreclosing on borrowers who are not repaying loans backed by the FHA.Rethink ESG limit for pension investments. This is an important one. The Labor Department had a rule that became final on January 12 that requires ESG focused mutual funds to have a financial rationale for why ESG investment is preferable to non- ESG investment. Labor has jurisdiction as it implements the Fiduciary standard of investors of retirement money.Dagen, here is where they're getting involved in perhaps what you may or may not invest in and then FHA opened to DACA recipients is the other one. This is - this is interesting on the immigration front so there are a lot of executive orders on day one that will impact financials and the market and certainly people's money.This is what we're going to be poking holes in and scrutinizing. Anything there that stands out Dagen?MCDOWELL: Just the government overreach quite frankly and right now you've been talking about this. The markets are at record highs because the massive amount of stimulus but once Americans start spending all of that money that they stocked away, do we worry about inflation as we're on the other side of this pandemic.Do longer term interest rates, do they go higher and all of a sudden - I think that you have to start thinking about that.BARTIROMO: Great Op-Ed from Jeremy Siegel in the Financial Times yesterday on inflation is on the horizon and that will impact markets. Mark Tepper, real quick from you on executive orders, anything stand out for you?MARK TEPPER, PRESIDENT & CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, STRATEGIC WEALTH PARTNERS: Yes, I mean, this is a complete 180 from what President Trump had set up. You know, there's all this talk about unity, and it seems like Biden is going straight towards undoing the right policies, basically if you don't comply with the left, you're either a white supremacist or a terrorist, right? So, the biggest things that stand out to me, you know, kind of talking out of both sides of your mouth as it relates to COVID. We want to get strong, we want to fight COVID, but let's open up the borders and let everyone in who hasn't been subjected to a 100-day mask challenge. So, you know, lots of talking out of both sides of your mouth is what I'm seeing here.BARTIROMO: Yes, well, we'll see. The executive orders are expected to continue. Let's slip in a short break, now former New York Police Lieutenant Darrin Porcher is here on all of the rioting in the Pacific Northwest and what is happening to our big cities, we'll get into it, stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, good Thursday morning everybody, thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, January 21st, a look at markets this half an hour. We've got some firmer tones going on this morning. Take a look at futures, indicating a gain of about 50 points on the Dow Industrials, Nasdaq up 53 and the S&P higher by 8.25. We are awaiting some economic data this morning, initial jobless claims could have impact, we'll see if that has an impact on markets, but it all finishes after a huge record session yesterday, all three major indices finishing in record territory yesterday on earnings and stimulus hopes. Take a look, Dow Industrials up 257 points at the close yesterday. We are at 31,188 on the Dow.Today, we begin a new day in record uncharted territory. The Nasdaq up 260 points yesterday at 13,457 and the S&P 500 higher by 53, at 38.51. European markets this morning also fractionally moving this morning, a little positive in the -- in London. FTSE 100 up 7, the Dax Index in Germany up 70 points, but the big story here is the European Central Bank meeting. We will get news and a decision from the ECB in about an hour, and we will also get some commentary about how the economy in the Eurozone is doing. That will move markets. In Asia overnight, stocks higher except for Hong Kong, take a look, fractional moves, but in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng was down a fraction, the best performer was in Korea, Kospi index up 1.5 percent.And now this, three National Guard members killed in a helicopter crash in Upstate, New York. Cheryl Casone now with these details. Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS: Yes, it's such a sad story, Maria. Good morning to you. The military says the UH60 medical evacuation chopper was on a routine training mission when it went down in a field near Rochester, this happened about 6:30 p.m. last night, no word yet on what caused that crash. Witnesses say the chopper was flying very low, New York Governor Cuomo has ordered state buildings to fly flags at half staff today to honor those victims. Well, Twitter blocking another account, locking up a Chinese Embassy in the United States after it made a post referring to the Chinese government controversial treatment of the Uyghurs. The tweet calling them, quote, "baby-making machines". To regain control of the account, the embassy has to delete the tweets, but so far they have refused. They call Twitter's decision a double standard.Well, the Internal Revenue Service missing out on a big chunk of change. According to an audit by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, the IRS may have let thousands of people take $57 million worth of tax deductions that they were not eligible for. The IRS defending its practices. They say the filings in question account for just about 0.1 percent of all business filings. And finally, Maria, someone is waking up a multi-millionaire in Maryland. One lucky ticket matched all 6 numbers taking home the $731 million Powerball jackpot. Comes out to be a cash option of nearly $547 million, but you do have another shot at striking gold because mega millions, that jackpot which is now $970 million is still up for grabs, that drawing is tomorrow night. So I guess, Maria, as I send it back to you, I will tear this losing ticket up, but I did go and buy my ticket, just so you know.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: So that one individual, did she get a lump sum, imagine getting a lump sum, $500 million? This is -- this is incredible.CASONE: It is.BARTIROMO: One person won, wow.CASONE: Yes --BARTIROMO: Hey, we said it yesterday, Cheryl, you've got to be in it to win it.CASONE: I'll try again.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: Me too, thank you, Cheryl. All right, meanwhile, we want to turn to another disturbing story, unrest in Portland and in Seattle. The two cities seeing destruction last night with rioters damaging an ICE building in Portland, and a march in Seattle turning chaotic with multiple arrests and a group of people burning the American flag. Joining me right now is the former NYPD Lieutenant and Pace University Law Enforcement Professor Darrin Porcher. Darrin, it's wonderful to have you back, thanks so much for joining us. To what do you attribute all of this? How should these cities tackle this problem of unrest? I feel like we're in the Summer time again or in the CHOP zone in Seattle.DARRIN PORCHER, PROFESSOR OF LAW ENFORCEMENT, PACE UNIVERSITY: Well, it should bifurcate into two components. You should have an intelligence piece where as you have officers that are on the ground gathering intelligence in connection with what the pause of the community is. You want to also marry that into technological innovations such as cameras. And cities like Seattle and Portland, you have cameras all over the place, so you can see when these groups amass, therefore you can deploy the necessary personnel accordingly. But the key is, you want to get to these demonstrations before they happen, and that's where the intelligence gathering comes into play. And unfortunately, we have democratically-elected mayors in both Seattle and Portland that have seen this, they've turned a blind eye to public safety and that's what's creating what we see occurring as a result.BARTIROMO: Well, I mean, that's the problem. There's no accountability here, Darrin, right? I mean, if you knew that you were going to get in trouble, you were going to be arrested, you could be facing jail time, if you go decide to get up and throw bricks in small businesses' windows, you wouldn't do it. But they know that there's no accountability. You've got these Democrat leaders in these cities not doing squad about it, and what about the people living there?PORCHER: Well --BARTIROMO: They're the real losers --PORCHER: It's a combination of two components -- absolutely. Ultimately, the voters are the losers. They're disenfranchised in connection with what's happening. It comes in two components. One, the court system is operating a catch and release stream. When I say a catch and release stream, meaning as soon as people get arrested for demonstrating and rioting, they're immediately released. That's the problem and therefore that localized legislation needs to inept the policies that are necessary to keep these people in jail. The voters are constantly under siege, and it's somewhat of a difficult landscape because they keep electing people into office that are committing to the same acts. There needs to be a change and it needs to happen --BARTIROMO: Terrible --PORCHER: Now.BARTIROMO: I mean, you're talking about those two cities, but it's on the rise in many cities, Darrin, look at New York -- I mean, look at 2021. We're talking 21 days, crime is rising in New York, the Big Apple begins searching for successor to Bill de Blasio. The question remains what needs to be done to resolve this problem, shooting is up in the double digits, murder up in the double digits and you heard me right. Just in 2021, that's on top of 2020 and the disgusting numbers we saw that. But this is just in the first few days of the new year, rise in crime, up 29 percent just from December 31, Darrin. What needs to be done in New York City?PORCHER: Well, I think we all agree is that Mayor de Blasio in the city of New York is the worst mayor that we've ever seen. That being said, what's the unfortunate piece is the collection of lunatics that are running for the mayoral seat coming up this year are just as bad if not worse. This is what we need, a ground-swell from the 8.5 million residents to produce a candidate that has a viable strategy for public safety. Public safety seems as if it's been taken a backseat in connection with the de Blasio administration. We need targeted enforcement. When I say targeted enforcement, meaning, we need to look to those areas, we have these hot spots such as shootings and robberies and deploy personnel as we see -- as we see fit. That's just not happening under the de Blasio --BARTIROMO: Yes --PORCHER: Administration. And we need an effective crime-fighting strategy moving forward.BARTIROMO: But wasn't it the smallest electorate that even came out to vote for de Blasio? I mean, it's the smallest electorate. It's Democrat, you know, I mean, are you ever going to get a moderate? I mean, you did have a moderate in Rudy Giuliani, he was a conservative and Michael Bloomberg was a moderate. Can you get back there in terms of leadership, not someone so progressive like Bill de Blasio who is constantly talking about defunding the police and obviously we're seeing its impact?PORCHER: Well, it's a different -- it's a difficult narrative when we look to the grassroots of the city of New York. We see the evolution of the population that's ever so changing. A lot of that is going to be depended upon who the elector is and those individuals that are willing to vote for that plausible candidate. When we go back to the early '90s, Giuliani was the mayor, and he had something referred to as zero tolerance. And that's when that zero tolerance police in focused on those low-level offenses, taking the bad guys off the street before they commit to the greater offenses. We need something to come in this city right now that reflects that.BARTIROMO: Yes, absolutely. Darrin Porcher, it's good to see you this morning, we'll keep talking about this and certainly spotlighting it, Darrin Porcher joining us this morning, we'll see you soon, sir. Coming up, Texas Congressman August Pfluger is here to discuss the president's new executive orders on immigration. What is the impact and how about that 450 million miles -- 450 miles of wall? We're going to talk about that being stopped. And then the word on Wall Street, top investors eyeing your money and earnings this morning, plus the Biden administration's economic policy and their impact. Don't miss it, you're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business, stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Executive order bonanza. President Joe Biden signs 17 executive orders yesterday, orders and actions on his first day on the job. Many of those orders undo the policies of the previous administration on issues from climate to border security. There are more coming today we are told focused on coronavirus.Joining me right now is Texas Congressman and retired Air Force Colonel August Pfluger. Congressman, it's good to see you this morning, thanks for being here. Give us your reaction to all of these executive orders and I'd love to go through them to find out what strikes you most in terms of its impact.REP. AUGUST PFLUGER (R-TX): Well, good morning and good to be with you this morning. You know, yesterday, a great day for a peaceful transition of power, but one thing that struck me was Joe Biden's words that he said, you know, give me a chance, give me a minute, hear me out, but then within a couple of hours, he had all of these executive orders a couple which affect us directly in my district which is the border security, rejoining the Paris Climate Accords, you know, looking towards the Iranian nuclear deal. I mean, all of these undercut our national security and put us in a position where we might be less secure in just days.BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, one of the president's major priorities for his first days in office was a sweeping immigration bill. I want to talk about this because this has a big impact, it provides a path for citizenship for over 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States. He's also deciding to stop all construction of the border wall, congressman. What is the impact of these two actions?PFLUGER: Well, again, it just puts us into a position where our country is going to be less secure for the last couple of years. We've really made a concerted effort to take that southern border to stop the human trafficking, the drugs, all the issues that we have coming through the border, whether it's the law or it's, you know, increasing the funding and the training for ICE, making sure that our law enforcement have the resources to defend that border. I mean, it really does put us into a position where now we have to question the motives, and try to understand that we're providing amnesty for everybody including criminals? I mean, what's the -- what is the end result of this going to be?BARTIROMO: Yes, and then there's a whole host of executive orders that will impact business and the economy. I'm going to tell you about the comptroller pick in a second. But first, the president is killing the Keystone Pipeline again. Congressman, he signed several executive orders, all having to do with climate change including reversing vehicle emission standards, rollbacks, setting up a moratorium on oil and natural gas leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, what do you think the president's climate policy means for the energy sector? We are talking about a real impact to lots of different levels of jobs just from killing the pipeline, but what about all these new regulations that are going to be regulating the auto sector, trucks as well as energy in general?PFLUGER: Maria, this is so important. I mean, it affects my district directly especially considering we have the Permian Basin which produces 40 percent of the country's oil. Energy security is national security. I was the first freshman to introduce a bill, legislation and it was aimed at preventing the Biden administration from placing a moratorium on federal lands. We already see that on day one, he's taking action to try and undermine the energy business. And the fact that we are the number one producer in the world, that we provide affordable, reliable energy not just for our country, but also for billions of people around the globe, is just mind boggling. And so, you're right, all of the secondary --BARTIROMO: Yes --PFLUGER: And tertiary effects are extremely concerning.BARTIROMO: Yes, and then there's another one that's a big impact on the mayor banks. We're going to talk about that and the word on Wall Street. Congressman, it's good to see you this morning. We of course, will continue to spotlight all of these impactful orders. Congressman August Pfluger joining us. Quick break, and then there were fashion icons at the inaugural address as well, we will walk through all the most talked about looks, that's in the Morning Buzz coming up, stay with us.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LAUREATE AMANDA GORMAN, POET: Our people diverse and beautiful will emerge battered and beautiful when day comes, we step out of the shade of flame and unafraid, the new dawn blooms as we free it. For there is always light if only we're brave enough to see it. If only we are brave enough to be it.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: That was Amanda Gorman reciting her poem "The Hill We Climb", who at 22 years old became the youngest inauguration poet in U.S. history. Gorman's poem was not the only moment making a buzz, it was one of the best moments, though, of yesterday's inauguration. Let's get into the fashion, first lady Dr. Jill Biden wearing a custom Makarian Aquamarine coat, Vice President Kamala Harris giving a nod to Shirley Chisholm, wearing a purple Christopher John Rogers coat and pearls as a reference to her sisterhood in the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, she said. Michelle Obama broke the internet with her Sergio Hudson attire, and even Lady Gaga's golden dove brooch, people were talking about. It wasn't all about the women either.Senator Bernie Sanders, he went viral because he wore a Parka Mittens. There he is, and there's Lady -- look at Lady Gaga's brooch. Dagen, what do you think about all of the fashion we saw yesterday?DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS: The most must-have fashion were those Mittens that Bernie Sanders was wearing, but both the first lady and Vice President Harris wore emerging American designers. The same goes for the former first lady Michelle Obama, but J.Lo was in an all-white Chanel, so, she had to go European on this great American day. And then Lady Gaga had on, again, that gigantic gown from Elsa Schiaparelli which is also European. So couldn't you find an American designer, ladies, like the first lady and like the vice president? I thought everybody looked great, though.BARTIROMO: Well, look, I don't think that you could do fashion without showing Melania Trump. She was absolutely gorgeous yesterday as they left the White House and then landed in Palm Beach. Melania Trump was sporting her Chanel jacket on her exit and then when she landed in Palm Beach, she was sporting a Gucci caftan, and I loved it all from Melania Trump.

What was the good, the bad and the worst of the Trump administration in America?CE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 20, 2021 WednesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 2501 wordsBodyThis Wednesday, Donald Trump's term ends after four years at the helm of the White House. Compared to several of his predecessors who achieved re-election and remained for up to 8 years, the still Republican lost to Democrat Joe Biden, who will assume the presidency.Trump's tenure could pass among one of the most controversial, most journalistic, and that according to some American historians could be one of the worst representatives in American history.What was the good thing Trump did?Trump's frantic presidency, which was most plagued by democratic errors and damage, also has certain successes that have even been recognized by his critics. However, they were not enough for him to save his legacy in the distant future.m{1197586}The diplomatic agreements of Israel and the Arab worldTrump's presidency was strongly linked to the situation in Israel, influenced primarily by his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who managed together with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to establish diplomatic relations with the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Sudan Bahrain and Morocco, the latter being a reinstatement.m{1197561}Israel had only diplomatic relations with its neighbors in Jordan and Egypt. However, many of the countries keep it in common to have Iran as a threat to the region, as it has ties to Hezbollah, which controls sections of the West Bank, Lebanon and Syria. All agreements were managed under Mike Pompeo, who was as his secretary of state.m{1197587}Judicial reform in the United StatesThe First Step Act is one of the biggest criminal reforms that were passed during his administration, which was even driven by TELEVISION star and social media influencer Kim Kardashian.The measure allows judges to have more sympathy in sentenced to certain people, who were generally victims of crime and drug trafficking, as well as misdemeanors that are charged in some cases with institutional racism. Nonviolent offenders have the opportunity to re-enter society as productive and law-abiding citizens.m{1197588}Economic support at the start of the pandemicDespite his questioned handling of the covid-19 pandemic, the representative pushed for an economic package in the early months of the health emergency, with which he was endorsed by both Republicans and Democrats, as well as his Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin.Financial support was earmarked for families to have payments of up to $1,200, after losing their jobs or business during confinement. As well as assist in the financing of medical coverage for people who became ill with covid-19.Democrats have sought to pass more packages to bail out the U.S. economy, with the aim of avoiding further trade closures and rising levels of unemployment.m{1197589}? Dialogue with North KoreaDonald Trump has been the first U.S. president to step on North Korea while in office. Having maintained an initial conflict with leader Kim Jong-un, where there were threats to start a nuclear war.m{1197562}Trump met three times with Kim in order to stop his nuclear weapons plan, as well as foster dialogue with his neighbor South Korea. Although there was no progress in dismantling, he became the first representative not to have a position against the communist regime.m{1197590}The Trade War with China and the T-MECDespite the rejection of much of the international community, in the United StatesThey saw with good eyes, both Democrats and Republicans, how the Trump administration faced China's economic growth, which was even championed by some of its allies in Europe.The measure, which tightened international markets and diplomatic relations, generated some winners on the issue of exports, mainly with Mexico, which after the adoption of the Mexico-U.S.-Canada Treaty (T-MEC), strengthened the economic link in the region.After rejecting NAFTA, which he considered "the worst agreement in history," he decided to renegotiate a new economic treaty that will not only be the update of the agreement signed since 1993, but also seek to increase regional ties between the three partners, in order to mainly favour American manufacturing.What was wrong with Trump?Trump will be remembered for being one of the presidents, not only of the least diplomatic, but also of the most controversial. His management was plagued by attempts to evade justice, as well as break treaties and conflict with America's allies.m{1197591}Abandoning the Paris Agreement and the Iran Nuclear TreatyThe representative managed to get the United States to abandon the Paris Agreement against the climate crisis, this in order to benefit economic growth through polluting energies, mainly linked to other members of the representative. Trump's decision criticized by both environmental organizations and several countries signing the agreement.Trump was one of the most skeptical of global overheating, along with his Brazilian counterpart Jair Bolsonaro. The U.S. government also abandoned the Open Skies Treaty, which facilitates the recognition of non-arms flight and which Russia would also leave months later, as well as nuclear agreements with Moscow.However, the biggest breakup was the Iran Nuclear Agreement, which had been signed by its predecessor Barack Obama and other European countries.The U.S. exit caused Tehran to resume its activities at its plants and increase the acquisition of enriched uranium, as well as raise the diplomatic tension that nearly generated an armed conflict following the assassination of Iran's Revolutionary Guard leader Qasem Soleimani.m{1197592}The 'Russian plot' and the 'Ukrainian plot'Having won the election in 2016, Democrats and US authorities investigated the possible links between the Trump campaign and Vladimir Putin's administration. He was even favored after the scandal between Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.The prosecutor of the case, Robert Mueller, ruled that there was evidence of possible ties between Moscow and members of the Trump campaign, with which several of his close associates, such as Roger Stone and Michael Flynn, were sentenced, who were pardoned by the representative himself.m{1197576}However, Trump would face his first political trial until the unveiling of the 'Ukrainian plot' this for having pressured the government of Volodimir Zelenski and several U.S. officials to investigate Joe Biden's son Hunter, who was working in Ukraine, in order to link the Democrat to ties in Moscow.Trump was exonerated of his first political trial after not reaching enough votes in the Senate so that he could be removed from office for "obstruction of justice" and "abuse of power," thanks to Republican support.m{1197593}The stance against its historical allies in EuropeTrump's outings with G7 leaders, as well as NATO and G20, were evident several times, mainly against French President EmmanuelMacron, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel; in addition to supporting governments and leaders who shared their ideology as in Brazil, India and the United Kingdom.Trump not only used Twitter to express his views, but also to criticize governments and officials such as his neighbors Canada and Mexico, as well as the Iranian and Chinese government, which was aggravated in the latter due to the covid-19 pandemic.m{1197594}Constant conflicts with DemocratsDuring Trump's management, there were also deep political divisions between Republicans and Democrats, both in the U.S. Congress and mayors and governors in the country, mainly because of the state of his political trial, and which were aggravated by the covid-19 pandemic and the 2020 election.Trump directed his attacks primarily on Democratic leaders in Congress, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, former President Barack Obama, former first lady Hillary Clinton, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, and even Washington D.C.mayor Muriel Bowser.Several of the representative's political projects, such as the construction of the border wall and the elimination of Obamacare, faced resistance even within the U.S. Supreme Court, coupled with the government's constant closures in the face of a lack of agreement for the federal budget.m{1197595}Your tax evasions and allegations of sexual assaultOne of the most controversial issues during his presidency was his tax returns, which were concealed by the representative during his presidency at various requests from the New York Public Prosecutor's Office. Therefore, the representative left his official residence in the Big Apple to be officially a resident of Florida.The New York Times revealed the representative's financial statements, which found that he did not pay taxes for more than a decade, and that even when he won the presidency, he paid only about $700 in levies. His companies also faced red numbers prior to his presidential victory.m{1197578}Trump was also charged during his management with committing sexual assaults prior to his presidential candidacy, including a rape allegation by writer E. Jean Carroll in the 1990s.The representative also sought to buy the silence of porn actress Stormy Daniels through her former lawyer Michael Cohen, who also ended up in prison for favoring tax fraud of the tax-evading representative and violating the campaign finance law.What was the worst thing Trump did?Compared to other U.S. representatives, where they had lights and shadows, Donald Trump would have a category where he performed his worst actions, which was even labeled by thousands of columnists in the world and intellectuals as a "fascist" and an "authoritarian" person.m{1197596}Taking the Capitol under alleged electoral fraudAfter not recognizing Democrat Joe Biden's victory, accusing without evidence of alleged voter fraud in local courts and the U.S. Supreme Court, his far-right fans ended up being convinced and provoked an attack on the Capitol in which five people died and put members of the United States Congress at risk.Some of the protesters, who attended Trump's speech on the day of Biden's victory certification, were fully armed. The attack caused Biden's inauguration to strengthen the security and detention of a hundred people who entered the compound.m{1197579}Twitter and Facebook had to suspend the social media accounts of the representative and thousands of their believing fanatics under conspiracy theoryQAnon, after pushing for the spread of fake news and inciting violence by unaware of Biden's victory.The Republican, who garnered more votes compared to his 2016 election, lost to the Democrat in key states such as Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Arizona in both suffrage and polling stations.m{1197597}Anti-migration policyTrump had the repudiation of dozens of organizations for imposing the biggest restrictions to prevent migration to the United States, from building a new border wall in the south of the country to limiting the asylum policies of Central American migrants and banning citizens of some Muslim countries from entering.Not only did he seek to impose safe third-country policies on Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, he also sought to threaten the imposition of tariffs on Mexico if he did not control migrant caravans, as well as promise that his southern neighbor would pay for the border wall. Thousands of Central Americans, Haitians and Cubans remained in mexico border towns waiting for their request for humanitarian asylum to be received.m{1197583}The Immigration and Customs Service (ICE), together with the Border Patrol, favored the separation of migrant families staying in detention centres with deplorable conditions, as well as conducting raids to stop undocumented people working in industries and plans to disappear "sanctuary cities" to prevent them from being protected by the authorities.With the pandemic, the Trump administration sought to limit as many work visas as possible to favor U.S.-born job-seeking. The government of Mexico, after the arrival of President López Obrador, was able to maintain good relations, and in which it also instructed the National Guard to stop migrant caravans on the border between the state of Chiapas and Guatemala.m{1197598}Managing the covid-19 pandemicThe United States is the country most affected, in total numbers, by the covid-19 pandemic, which left more than 400,000 dead and surpassing 24 million cases. Some states, such as California and New York, had collapses in their health systems, and governors imposed measures according to their ideology.Trump not only ignored international recommendations to contain the pandemic, he stopped funding the World Health Organization (WHO), accusing him of favoring the "Chinese-virus" after sprouting in Wuhan City.m{1197584}Although it concentrated its efforts and resources on the development of Modern Inc.'s covid-19 vaccine, its administration sought to resume activities as soon as possible to prevent further decline in the economy with figures that had not been recorded since the Great Depression of 1929.The representative sought the face-to-face return of the schools, did not maintain large restrictions at airports, conducted his re-election campaign with the presence of attendees, and minimized the impact of the pandemic by stating that the covid-19 would "leave one day" in order not to generate panic.m{1197599}Suppress Black Lives Matter protestsFollowing the assassination of African-American George Floyd "at the feet" of Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, protests were recorded around the United States against police racism prevailing in the country, in which the Black Lives Matter movement was born.The protest even prompted Trump himself to be guarded by the Secret Service following protests outside the White House. The representative did not mediate any dialogue with the protesters, even accusing them of being supporters of the far left and used elements of the Guardto suppress demonstrations in cities such as Minneapolis, New York and Portland.His supporters, seeing the scenes of protests on the streets, carried out various armed attacks on the protesters and ended up radicalizing as the U.S. presidential campaign progressed. Police racism cases did not subside after Floyd's death.m{1197600}Climate emergency responseTrump was criticized for his responses to climate emergencies, mainly in California wildfires and hurricanes in the southern United States.Unfortunate events such as throwing toilet paper at the victims of Hurricane 'Maria' over Puerto Rico, in which during his administration he had some contempt for the Caribbean island to the extent that he wanted to sell the territory in order to buy Greenland from Denmark, until he gave an autograph to a Louisiana policeman to sell it on the internet during the damage of Hurricane 'Laura' , were criticized for "lack of empathy."During the fires in California, Trump claimed that the climate crisis would disappear as would the covid-19 pandemic. In recent years, fires in the region have intensified due to high temperatures and the absence of moisture that favors incidents that would cause fires.m{1197582}?dmrLoad-Date: January 21, 2021End of Document

The Dow at 33 percent, Nasdaq up 50.25 percent (ph). S&P is up 8.5 percent. Markets finishing the day lower yesterday actually. Big tech weakness and disappointing economic data weighing on investors.And straight ahead in the Word on Wall Street, one of our market insiders celebrating a major milestone.

On the hot seat, Robinhood's CEO yesterday facing questions from lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Vlad Tenev apologizing for his company's January 29 decision to temporarily curb trading in some stocks including GameStop amid extraordinary volatility.Also grilled was Keith Gill. He is the once anonymous trader who led the hoards of individual investors into GameStop under the online alias `Roaring Kitty'.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KEITH GILL, AMERICAN FINANCIAL ANALYST: I'm not a cat. I am not an institutional investor, nor am I a hedge fund. I'm just and individual whose investment in GameStop and posts on social media we're based upon my own research and analysis.VLADIMIR TENEV, ROBINHOOD CEO: Look. I'm sorry for what happened. I apologize, and Robinhood as an organization will learn from this and improve to make sure it doesn't happen again.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Well the hearing is the first of three according to House Financial Services Committee Chairwoman, Maxine Waters. Futures hearing - future hearings - excuse me - are likely going to feature representatives from the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.Well days without power and freezing temperature sparking chaos in Texas. San Antonio firefighters had to truck in water to battle an apartment- building fire because hydrants were frozen. The fire devastating the building and more than 80 people are now displaced. Thankfully there are no injuries, but much of that state remains in survival mode this morning.13 million Texans now without safe drinking water and are being asked to boil it before use. Over 197,000 homes and businesses still without power, but it's a major improvement from the over four million outages reported Tuesday.Well some residents even using their Ford F-150 hybrid pickup trucks to power their homes thanks to the onboard generator in the vehicle. Grocery stores also running out of food with blackout spoiling some of it and icy roads preventing trucks from replenishing their shelves.Well the Trump era remain in Mexico policy officially coming to an end as the first wave of some 25,000 asylum seekers start crossing the border today as Democrats introduce their Biden-backed immigration plan. The bill offers and eight-year path to citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants and also grants an immediate green card for farm workers, TPS holders, and DACA recipients.Meanwhile, ICE issuing new guidelines narrowing enforcement actions like arrest and removals. ICE officers will now have to get preapproval from supervisors before arresting or deporting anyone who is not convicted of an aggravated felony. As for those currently detained, some immigrants are now getting COVID vaccines on state-by-state cases.President Biden gearing up for his G7 summit later this morning. The global response to the pandemic, climate change, and China all on the agenda during today's virtual meeting. This as the Biden administration formally offers to restart talks with Iran and other world powers over Tehran's nuclear program. Iran had set a Sunday deadline vowing that if oil and banking sanctions are not lifted it will expel the U.N.'s nuclear inspectors from the country, ending outside access to its nuclear sites.Well a single shot of Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine is 85 percent effective after just two weeks, potentially fueling a debate over the recommended two-dose schedule as government is trying to stretch out their, well, limited supplies. The finding's part of a health study of healthcare workers at an Israeli hospital. That trial showed just 52 percent effectiveness after one shot, but it didn't differentiate between before and after two weeks.Well time for the Word on Wall Street. Top investors watching your money this week. Joining me now, Rosecliff Capital CEO and Managing Partner, Mike Murphy, is here, and Stifel Chief Economist, Lindsey Piegza. Guys, good morning.LINDSEY PIEGZA, STIFEL CHIEF ECONOMIST: Good morning.MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL CEO, MANAGING PARTNER: Good morning. Nice to see you, Cheryl.CASONE: Nice to see you both. Well Lindsey, I do want to kick it off with you. Taking a look at futures this morning, we do have some green arrows, and there's certainly concerns about the economy, but you've got Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, speaking out yesterday.She said that basically a large stimulus package is necessary to get the economy to full strength, and there was new data that showed the number of Americans filing claims, yesterday we had it on the show, rose to 861,000. That number hotter than expected. That contrasts with strong January retail sales numbers from earlier in this week, so we've had a lot to digest this week. Lindsey, your thoughts?PIEGZA: Oh absolutely, and I think broadly speaking the U.S. economy has made considerable steps in the right direction. We saw job creation move back into positive territory in January. Manufacturing still expanding, very robust metrics when it comes to housing, and of course the latest retail sales report surging past expectations up over 5 percent.That being said, we also saw that significant jump higher in jobless claims with millions of Americans still out of work, millions more reliant on federal unemployment assistance, so we're far from out of the woods.Now many look at this lingering weakness, including Treasury Secretary Yellen, as justification for further government spending, but at this point nearly a year into the pandemic with trillions upon trillions already spent, not to mention billions still waiting to be allocated from the previous stimulus package, we really need to be focused on a longer-term reopening plan as opposed to ways to supplement short-term growth, which I do fear will potentially create insurmountable barriers in terms of deficits and debts as we do attempt to reach a more organic pathway at the end of this crisis.CASONE: Yes, and in past months we've seen, you know, Wall Street cheer on, you know, more stimulus, but now there's question marks about, you know, too much basically and the debt we're taking on as a country.I do want to talk about GameStop with both of you. You know, lawmakers on the House Financial Services Committee grilled those top executives of Robinhood and some other players in that short squeeze if you will. Vlad Tenev actually apologized to customers for restrictions that they imposed in late January preventing them from buying shares in hot stocks like GameStop.Keith Gill also is in the hot seat. He was that once anonymous trader. He led that Reddit army into GameStop under the online alias `Roaring Kitty'. Mike, your reaction to what you heard in that hearing yesterday?MURPHY: You know, I thought it was really interesting, Cheryl, because, you know, a lot of times when we have these hearings, you know, whether it's the heads of banks or whether it was Roger Clemens, you know, a lot of times it's fluff. And I think a lot of this is also grandstanding, but in the internet age trading and how people get information is changing, and I think that's the one thing that's going to come from this.So you know, to see Vlad come out and offer an apology, I think that's just crisis management there. I really thought Ken Griffin's comments were very interesting, but at the end of the day I think the market is going to move past this. You know, that type of trading worked for some. The GameStop trading worked for some. It didn't work for others, but I think ultimately people are going to be active in the market. They're going to be sharing information online, and regulators are going to have to figure out the best way to regulate that so they know securities laws are broken (ph).CASONE: Well and Lindsay, that's the question mark for everyone right now is are we going to get more regulations or even just rules out of this committee, some new rules?PIEGZA: Well certainly not out of the committee, but the SEC could step in. But of course, I think this is going to as just noted really reflect I think the ongoing pressure on representatives to continue the pressure on different agencies in the government to make sure that there is more regulation, more oversight in these types of issues and we don't see this happen again.So I do think there's more of an appetite for oversight, but it won't come necessarily from this committee but more to those regulatory bodies.CASONE: Right, right, right. And some - the SEC's going to be - there's just going be - Waters is going to be calling them to task as well. Mike, I want to switch gears. I love this. You rang the closing bell remotely yesterday. You celebrating Rosecliff Capital going public. Tell us about it. There you are. It looks great.MURPHY: Thank you. Thanks, Cheryl. Yes, really exciting. You know, you've been with me almost from the beginning and there with Maria. You know, as we started investing in some great private companies, companies like Wheels Up that just went public a couple of weeks ago, Casper, Allbirds who came on the show with Maria when they were nothing. Now they're a multibillion dollar business.So as we were investing in these private companies we saw an opportunity with what's happening in the SPAC market to create a vehicle, to take it public, and now we're going to merge with one of these high-growth companies and bring it to the public markets.So you know, we're really excited to do it. I have a great team working with me to do this, and you know, as I told Maria, stand by because when the news breaks we're going to be here live doing this again and we're going to bring a great private company into the public markets and look to create a high-growth, long-term business that hopefully can have a major impact on investors.CASONE: Now I got to ask you which one, Mike?(LAUGHTER)Yes, tell them.MUPRHY: Yes, so I - we don't have a - no comment is my official answer. We don't have the signed letter of intent yet, but we have a very short list of businesses that I think any one of them would be great. So this is something that with the market where it is right now we want to do this and go it right the first time and then, you know, hopefully look to do it again because there are so many great, private businesses out there as we talk about all the time.CASONE: Mike, you know that you have to come back on the show and break the news with Maria.MURPHY: Absolutely.CASONE: Mike Murphy, congratulations. Mike, that was great yesterday.MURPHY: Thanks, Cheryl.CASONE: Lindsay Piegza, always great to see you as well. Thanks, guys.PIEGZA: Thank you.CASONE: We've got a lot more coming up this morning. Things getting worse for New York Governor, Andrew Cuomo, as people from both sides of the aisle are citing against him and want answers for the nursing home COVID cover- up. We're going to talk to one New York State senator coming up.The deep freeze - Texas remains in survival mode as thousands remain without power or fresh water. How the brutal cold stands to affect the energy sector ahead. Grilled on the Hill, we've got a recap of the GameStop hearing.We're going to talk about it for WallStreetBets founder, Jamie Rogozinski, later on this hour. Plus hello Mars. The Perseverance touching down on the red plant. The world's reaction making a buzz this morning. We're going to tell you all about it.And joining the conversation all morning long, I got the A-team with me this Friday - James Freeman and Brian Brenberg. You're watching Mornings with Maria live on Fox Business.Democrats introducing the Biden-backed immigration plan yesterday. The bill includes an eight-year path to citizenship for over 11 million undocumented immigrants and grants immediate green cards for farm workers, TPS holders, and DACA recipients. Today, thousands of asylum seekers are going to start to cross the border to await processing as the Trump era remain in Mexico policy ends.I want to bring in Tennessee Congressman and House Foreign Affairs and Armed Services Committee member, Mark Green. Congressman, good morning.REP. MARK GREEN (R), TENNESSEE CONGRESSMAN: Thanks, Cheryl, for having me on the show. Good morning to you.CASONE: Your reaction to this move on immigration from President Biden?GREEN: Well I think it's pretty crazy. You know, it's going to create this massive incentive for just, you know, a flood of people coming across the southern border. Right now they're not even testing people, just releasing them, for COVID.So it's pretty crazy, but I mean, even what they did with ICE - you didn't mention that, but they're talking about now restricting ICE agents. You know, Pelosi's defunding and I guess now Biden's going to defang the police, the law enforcement. They can't even deport people unless they get special permission for it, people who have committed multiple crimes. So it's pretty crazy what the administration's doing.CASONE: I want to bring in my colleague, James Freeman. He and Maria Bartiromo wrote a book about the topic of China, and you know, James, you do have President Biden at the G7 virtually today.JAMES FREEMAN, WALL STREET JOURNAL ASSIST. EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR: That's right. Thanks, Congressman. Right, as you -(CROSSTALK)GREEN: Thanks.FREEMAN: -- look at the emerging China policy from the Biden administration, some perhaps surprisingly tough rhetoric in terms of related to the Chinese government's treatment of the Uyghurs, Hong Kong, et cetera. Are you encouraged by that or are you still concerned that there's not really any action behind it?GREEN: I think they've been a little bit inconsistent. So there has been some rhetoric about the human rights stuff, but then you hear him say that it's accustom, you know, some kind of cultural norm to do what Xi Jinping is doing out west. It's just crazy. That inconsistency makes all of us scratch our heads.I think we need a very hard stance with our China is - I mean, if you read some of the stories coming out of those camps, those internment camps it's horrific. It's almost mid - you know, twentieth century stuff. We can't - we can't support that.CASONE: You know, U.S. officials by the way announcing that they're going to meet with Iran, another world leader, to discuss this diplomatic approach to Tehran's nuclear program. I want to get your thoughts on that because, you know, Iran has vowed it would expel U.N. nuclear inspectors if sanctions are not lifted by Sunday. Your reaction to this?GREEN: Well this is what we should expect from this president because when he was vice president remember that he - they announced - they actually announced they were withdrawing missile defense systems from Poland on the sixtieth anniversary if the USSR's invasion of Poland.So now only days after - days after Americans are killed by Iranian-backed militia in Erbil they're talking about meeting with Iran? I mean, this is - that's insane. It makes no sense. No one - no one would do this. No student of international relations would say, hey, yes. Let's meet with the guys who just killed Americans.CASONE: Brian Brenberg -PROFESSOR BRIAN BRENBERG, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: Congressman, I just - I want to emphasize that point. When I watch what happened this week and then I see these plans, it looks to me like Iran is in the driver's seat on this negotiation. Given all of the threats they've made, that's what it looks like. Am I wrong on that? Is Iran now in the driver's seat given the kind of policy the Biden administration is talking about pursuing?GREEN: It certainly appears so. I mean, if you look at the JCPOA, I mean, that whole thing really enforced nothing. Iran could inspect themselves and they're talking about reinstating something like that. It's absurd. I mean, it's really absurd.And you think of the American - I served in the military. I was in a special operations unit. I deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan. My brothers and sisters were killed in Iraq by Iranian-backed specialized IEDs. I mean, as many as 700, and here we are, you know, wanting a handshake. I have a problem with that.CASONE: Congressman Mark Green, it's great to have you on all these topics this morning. We appreciate it.GREEN: Thanks, Cheryl. Have a good day.CASONE: All right. You as well. We've got a lot more coming up. Caught on camera. New video shows members of the California School Board appearing to mock parents who are desperate to get their kids back in the classroom. We've got that shocking video coming up next.Plus stream on. All this staying at home has proven to be a boom for the streaming sector. We're on it coming up.The battle between parents and teachers reaching a new level. California School Board members caught on video mocking students' parents not realizing the meeting had been open to the public. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Bitch, if you're going to call me out I'm going to fuck you up.(LAUGHTER)Sorry! That's just me.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They want to pick on us because they want their babysitters back.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We have the meeting open to the public right now.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No (ph)?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That's what Lori (ph) just said. Great.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Yes (ph). Oakland - Oakley Union Elementary Superintendent had to apologize for these comments saying in a statement, "These comments aren't typical and more importantly they aren't what the community should expect from our school district. I know that we lost trust with the community. I won't make excuses for what happened or why it happened. I'm the superintendent. I'm responsible and accountable, and I'm truly sorry for what took place. I have been and continue to be committed to working together for the betterment of the school district."Brian, what do you make of this?BRENBERG: So are those comments not typical? I mean, that's what the superintendent says, but these are the board members, you know, thinking they're behind closed doors talking about how they really feel about the parents in their district. I think a lot of parents actually look at this and say, you know, that's what I thought you thought because that's how you're treating me.Big problems here in big institutions. When the curtain gets pulled back and people get to really see what the public servants think about them, and I think it's important because people got to know what we're in for when it comes to things like these schools in California. Students are not being prioritized, they're not being served, and parents are held in contempt.CASONE: You know, and James, it's happening all across the country. We've seen it in Chicago. We've seen it here in New York. I mean, the - it's gotten to a fever pitch this issue of reopening the schools, which President Biden, you know, maintains he wants to do, but the battle is just - it's just gotten really - well it's ugly.FREEMAN: Yes. It's - and it's a horrible disservice to children. I mean, one thing that makes this video so disturbing, so appalling or this meeting is that the school boards are supposed to be the ones standing up for parents and children. You can count on the Teachers Union leadership to put their members first, and obviously they've been driving this message that was repeated - had been repeated over and over again by President Biden that you can't reopen schools until you make huge new investments in equipment, make smaller class sizes, make more room on the bus between children.And it's - it doesn't make any sense. It's not science-based. Children are at little risk. Most of the teachers are at little risk. They should be reopened, but to see the school board, which you would hope would put - be pushing back on some of this union nonsense basically agreeing that this horrendous closure policy should continue is really disappointing.CASONE: And Brian, it does show you the power of teachers unions.BRENBERG: It shows you the power of teachers unions, but it also shows you how messed up the incentives in this system are. The incentive is not - parents aren't looking for babysitters. They're not. They're looking for people to educate their kids, and they're paying a lot of money for that to happen, especially in California. Treat parents with respect. Treat kids like they matter. Do your job. Don't sit there and mock people who are crying out for public servants to serve the public.CASONE: Meanwhile, kids are suffering.BRENBERG: Yes.CASONE: They're suffering. Guys, thank you to both of you. Well coming up grilled on the Hill. We've got a recap of the GameStop hearing. We're going to talk about it with WallStreetBets Founder, Jamie Rogozinski. That's coming up next.Plus popping the question in a big way. The new giveaway promising couples their dream proposal. It's making a buzz this morning. We're going to tell you all about it.CASONE: And welcome back. I'm Cheryl Casone. I'm in for Maria Bartiromo. It is Friday, February 19th.A look at markets this half hour. We have got green arrows today as you can see. The Dow higher by a little more than 100 points this morning; NASDAQ is up 74 and three quarters; S&P is up 16 and three quarters. Markets finishing the day lower yesterday, Big Tech weakness and disappointing economic data weighing on investors, the Dow losing 119 points.Now let's take a look at global action. First to those European markets. We are seeing green again. For the FTSE 100, we've kind of been teetering back and forth in London, if you will. CAC 40, that market is up almost three quarters of a percent. The DAX in Germany up more than half a percent.Earnings from fashion house, HermŠs, that's boosting confidence about the COVID-19 economic recovery there. And then in Asia overnight, stocks all seeing green except for Japan's Nikkei down just over seven tenths of 1 percent.And now to some top stories we're following for you this morning. Bob Dole says that he has been diagnosed with stage four lung cancer. The 97-year- old says, he will begin treatment next week. Dole served as a U.S. Senator for nearly 30 years and was the Republic presidential nominee in 1996.Well, this morning, Ford is recalling more than 150,000 vehicles. This is the first recall impacting about 1600 of its new 2021 bronco sport vehicles. The company says there were suspension modules, may not be properly attached. The company also recalling about 153,000 Ford rangers for model years 2004 to 2011 due to issues with the air bag systems and the last recall is much smaller. The last recall, excuse me, is much smaller, but affects vehicles across a number of product lines, including Ford's Ranger, the Mustang, the Fusion, Edge, and other vehicles. So they are on your screen.All of these are part of last year's Takata airbag recall. Let's take a look at the stock right now if we can. This is Ford in the premarket. Stock is actually higher by a quarter percent.Well, Roku seeing a revenue surge. The streaming service saw a 58 percent increase during the holiday quarter. It controls at least 30 percent of the streaming market. Roku's total profit rose to $649.9 million in the fourth quarter, that is up from $411.2 million a year earlier. Streaming services have seen an increase due to more people staying at home due to the pandemic.And finally, Walmart is giving raises to 425,000 of its employees. This following strong holiday sales during the pandemic. In a memo, Walmart's CEO said that wages would increase for store associates in the digital and stocking work groups. Wages will be in a range from $13 to $19 per hour depending on location and market. There is Walmart. The stock was a drag on the Dow yesterday. It's bouncing back just a little bit this morning, up about a half a percent.Well, probing WallStreetBets, Reddit CEO and Co-Founder Steve Huffman answered questions surrounding the sub Reddit's role in the retail trading frenzy during yesterday's House Financial Services Committee hearing.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)STEVE HUFFMAN, CO-FOUNDER & CEO, REDDIT: I will stress that WallStreetBets is first and foremost a real community. The self-deprecating jokes, the memes, the crass-at-times language, all reflect this. With the increase in attention, WallStreetBets unsurprisingly faced a surge in traffic and new users.At Reddit, our first duty in these situations is to our communities and our role interesting his moment was to keep WallStreetBets online. We have sensed analyzed activity in WallStreetBets to determine whether bots, foreign agents or other bad actors played a significant role. They have not.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Joining me now, WallStreetBets Founder, Jaime Rogozinski. Jaime, good morning.JAIME ROGOZINSKI, FOUNDER, WALLSTREETBETS: Good morning. Thanks for having me.CASONE: Yes. I'm so glad you're here. What was your reaction to the testimony yesterday?ROGOZINSKI: Well, I watched it on and off throughout the day. These testimonies sometimes remind me of a few good men with the congressmen asking, yes or no, did you order code red? But all around, I felt there was a well-rounded panel, a lot of great questions were asked and a lot of interesting and insightful answers were given as well.CASONE: Well, do you think that there's going to be regulation coming and do you think that the industry needs regulation? One of the things that we have seen, in particular, with Robinhood has been the emergence of the younger investor. But a lot of times those younger investors particularly don't know the risk associated with being in a market like this.ROGOZINSKI: Yes. Well, when it comes to regulation, I'm hoping that there's not a lot of regulation with the way that Wall Street functions, because there's a lot of unintended consequences, as was highlighted yesterday. But this entire GameStop saga has highlighted a bunch of weaknesses in the system - systemic problems now that retail traders are such a big force. So I hope they're able to address some of that to make sure that there's protections in place for the retail traders.BRIAN BRENBERG, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR: Jamie, when you got on this, when you started WallStreetBets, my understanding is you had some disposable income, you wanted to look at some riskier investments, you wanted to learn, you wanted to collaborate. It was a learning venture for you in a lot of cases. It's the same thing for people today who are getting into the market, who have a little bit of disposable income, who are young.My concern is the crackdown here doesn't happen in the part of the market where it needs to happen perhaps at the level of how trades are settled. But it's going to happen in a way that actually keeps younger investors from getting involved in learning. Do you see that risk and does it concern you?ROGOZINSKI: It doesn't concern me, because now the retail traders have had a taste of what it's like to control their own finances, and granted a lot of people take this risky approach to it, but a lot of people don't. That's the thing about the market. You can still be a warren buffet and you can diversify and you can buy and hold and wait for dividends, or you can make these shorter-term plays as well.And so now that these retail traders have gotten a taste for it, it's going to be really difficult to put the cap back on that bottle, especially now that there's such a huge, huge collective number of them.CASONE: Well, do you think that this is going to change retail investing with WallStreetBets? Now there's a lot of focus on these groups, these platforms. So what do you think happens? Do you think that it actually hurts retail investing?ROGOZINSKI: No. I think the retail investors have carved out a whole new niche in the market. So they're not mutually exclusive. You can still have the serious investors that take fundamental approach for evaluating stocks and trying to figure out their book value based off of whatever metrics they're able to use.But retail investors have carved out their own way of using the market, this "meme stocks", right? They've actually made it work. A lot of people have been able to make money. Even since before GameStop, companies like Hertz or companies like Zoom, they've been able to create a whole new approach for it and it works for a lot of people.CASONE: James Freeman, jump in here.JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL: Yes, thanks. I'm wondering sort of the - when you talk about these young investors and you obviously know this community very well, Jaime, I'm trying to get a sense of - for those people who have gotten into the market here, you got GameStop now, I think it's about 88 percent off its high. Is this a valuable lesson, losing their first 500 bucks and they can go forward and do better? Or do you think a lot of these people have sort of thrown away the life savings or the rent money?ROGOZINSKI: I'm hoping that it's closer to the first example of it. There are so many people that were involved. It's very possible that you have some people that took a risk with money that they weren't or shouldn't have been able to use, but it's a valuable lesson. Everybody loses money in the stock market at some point in time. And as far as I'm concerned, it's much better when you're starting in the market to be humbled by it by taking a loss and realizing that actually you're feeling that risk that you assume is there when you go into it. I think it's a lot more dangerous when people make money in the beginning.CASONE: Well, I think it was worrisome for me when Robinhood, kind of, really came into provenance last year is - it does resemble gambling and it's on the phone and people are just, you get obsessive about it. And that has led to some serious financial losses.ROGOZINSKI: Yes. It's always been gambling, even since before Robinhood, right? It's a speculative market. You make some assumptions based off of what you think. You have your criteria. Investors, no matter how great they've been, or no matter how conservative they have been, they've all taken a hit at some point. So the concept of speculation has always been there. The fact that they're using language that resembles gambling is just calling it what it is. The unapologetic approach to something that people have been doing forever.BRENBERG: The story has been full of caricatures, Jaime, and one of them is the retail investor is dumb money. Are you concerned about that? Does that need to change, because the world of investing has changed and retail investors are going to play a bigger role? We've got to stop caricaturing them. I'd love to hear your thoughts on that.ROGOZINSKI: They need to rethink their approach to it, right? So let's go before GameStop. When the pandemic first started, a lot of retail investors flocked to Zoom assuming - with the pandemic started and everyone was locked in, they bought the wrong Zoom, they (inaudible) taken into the stock and the "smart money" is laughing at the dumb money by saying, "Ha ha, you bought the wrong stock".Well, the wrong Zoom went up higher than the actual Zoom did and these retail traders, they're going in and out. They're not waiting for dividends. And so they actually made more money than the "smart money". Same goes with, once again, Hertz. It's a bankrupt company that took the share from $2 to $5. They got out. They're not going to wait forever. So this dumb money seems to be making a bunch of money and if the name of the game is making money, then who is really the dumb one?CASONE: We'll leave it there. Great answer. Jaime, thank you very much for being here this morning.ROGOZINSKI: Thank you for having me.CASONE: Jaime Rogozinski.Well, coming up. Things getting worse for New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, as people from both sides of the aisle are siding against him, wanting answers for the nursing home, COVID cover-up. We are going to talk to one New York State Senator, coming up next.And in the next hour, Kudlow-host, Larry Kudlow, is here to talk about his new show and give his reaction to yesterday's GameStop hearing and a lot of other questions.Plus, "Hello, Mars", the perseverance touches down on the red planet. The world's reaction is making a buzz this morning. We're going to tell you all about it.You're watching "Mornings with Maria" live on Fox Business.CASONE: The ongoing Cuomo investigation. New York Democratic assemblyman, Ron Kim says, he has received support from other lawmakers after saying that Governor Cuomo threatened him on a phone call over the alleged cover- up under the nursing home COVID-19 deaths.Cuomo and his representatives have denied Kim's accusations, even Alec Baldwin weighing in tweeting this, "If Cuomo threatened Ron Kim's career, Cuomo should resign."I want to bring in New York State Senator, Jim Tedisco. And it's great to have you here, sir. And I first want to get your reaction to what seems to be a bipartisan attack on Cuomo and these calls for him to resign.SEN. JIM TEDISCO (R-NY): Well, absolutely. I think when you're a progressive Democrat, a liberal, and you lose Alec Baldwin, you know you're in big trouble. But he was in big trouble before Alec Baldwin decided to disown him. This has been a complete cover-up over the last eight to 10 months of a monumental disaster beyond just the pandemic. This is a loss, as we research this thing and finally get information, of a complete cover- up.And as you know, for a public servant, and what Andrew Cuomo began the cover-up is always mostly worse than what you're trying to cover up and it dated as 15,000 of our most vulnerable population, our nursing home and congruent living individuals lost their lives. And this governor has been covering up the numbers and now we've been calling for investigations. They've been calling for - to move my bill for an outside, independent investigation, bipartisan with subpoena powers.And actually, Ron Kim, who the governor has attacked, a Democrat in the majority, has sponsored my bill. So what the governor has managed to do is not only a gigantic cover-up, he's managed to do something very difficult in New York State to bring Democrats and Republicans together. We're all calling now for a complete investigation of course, supporting what's happening in Brooklyn, down state New York now with the FBI and U.S. attorneys for an investigation.One shoe after another is dropping right now. So many shoes are dropping. You may call this whole thing a centipede right now. The AG, who is one of his allies, did an investigation and came out and said, it was 50 percent undercount of the loss of lives he's been hiding. And the fact that on March 25th, he put forth a mandate, an executive order that said [ph] contaged individuals would have to be accepted into nursing homes and he himself defined that as a wildfire going through dry grass.And of course, we have his chief of staff, as you know, thinking she was talking to allies, Democrats from the legislature. She admitted, that it wasn't what the Commissioner Zucker was saying, why they weren't putting forth these numbers for giving us the information, because they thought they wanted to count the numbers completely or find out if there were duplications in that. She said we covered it up because there was a DOJ investigation. Well, that was an inquiry. There is really an investigation taking place right now. And this is not going to end well for the governor.And he is illustrating he's got more angles than a geometry book. He has another excuse every day why we lost 15,000 of our most vulnerable populations. And I can commensurate Ron Kim because I experienced a governor that was a bully, a liar, a distortioner, and the fact that this governor won't accept any criticism, he won't apologize to the loved ones.His top chief of staff, Melissa DeRosa, as I mentioned, brought those individuals in and thought they would become allies, those Democrats from the legislature, they were just the opposite. They were outraged that she would apologize to them, but wouldn't apologize to the family members who lost their lives.CASONE: Well, let me pick up on something now that you said because I want to go down this road. Because there is talk of impeachment, but to your point about Governor Cuomo being a bully, we've seen him deflect, fight back, consistently, when asked by reporters about whether it's the coronavirus, the nursing home directive from last March, Republican lawmakers obviously in the state assembly know they want this impeachment commission now to investigate his handling of the crisis with the nursing homes.But Democratic lawmakers are looking into stripping him of his emergency powers. That seems to me, like I said, I watched this governor for a year, that seems to me more likely that at least his emergency powers would be stripped.TEDISCO: Well, I think they plan on and we plan on putting that forth again on Monday anyway. Every day we've been in session, my Republican conference has put forth an amendment on the floor to take back our duly-elected power and take back what is so-called emergency powers from this governor. Because what we're finding out now, this was now a lies, distortions and the cover-up. This - every shoe dropping is leading towards an obstruction of justice by this governor.And yes, I believe the first thing we have to do is take back these powers that we have given to the governor, because that was early on in the emergency. He hasn't handled it well in terms of his area. But we have to have an internal, complete investigation. A deep dive into this to make sure that we not only give closure to the loved ones who lost their family members, but we figure out how to do this better.This is one of the worst disasters in the history of New York State, maybe this nation. 15,000 of our most vulnerable population have lost their lives. The governor has got himself so deep into this cover-up, he is not facing reality right now. And we know it never ends well when you try to cover up what's taking place, and what you cover up usually ends up making it worse for you and this is making it worse for the governor.And the final analysis, I think, there's going to be three options. He's going to have to resign, there's going to be impeachment, which we're ready to probably bring forth shortly ourselves in the New York State Senate, or this is going to be a criminal investigation and a dereliction of duty type of thing, or obstruction of justice brought forth by the federal government and the DOJ, and maybe internally from us in the legislature.CASONE: I would love to keep talking with you. We're up against a hard break.Jim Tedisco. Thank you very much, Jim, for being here. Please come back.All right. Coming up, popping the question in a big way. The new give-away promising couples their dream proposal that is making a buzz this morning. We're going to tell you about it.CASONE: It is time for the morning buzz. First up, Mars has a new visitor. The Perserverance rover made a successful landing on Mars after traveling 293 million miles over the past six months. It's going to spend two years on the red planet searching for signs of life and exploring the surface. This is NASA's most technologically advanced robot ever to be sent into space. The rover even sent its first photo to all of us back on earth.Really exciting, James. Did you watch any of this yesterday?FREEMAN: Yes. It's another engineering triumph and it's a reminder. We're watching in Texas right now what happens when politics gets in the way of engineering. And fortunately, we have a counter example here where politicians and bureaucrats have stayed out of the way of the engineers at NASA's jet propulsion laboratory enough to let them create this marvel. So a lot of amazing technology and it should answer one of the biggest questions we've had.CASONE: Yes. Who is out there?Next up, the dream--FREEMAN: --or what is out there?CASONE: The dream proposal. Wedding magazine, The Knot, is gifting 21 essential workers with the proposal of a lifetime. Selected couples are going to receive a personalized proposal, but put together by a local florists, caterers, and event planners to be eligible. Both partners must be essential workers and submit their story.Pretty nice, Brian.BRENBERG: Yes. I love this. I love the idea of workers who have put a lot on the line, getting a chance to have a very special proposal. I think the only challenge is when the proposal is so wonderful, what happens with the wedding? It has to be equally great. Maybe get help for that as well.CASONE: You tell us. Guys, thanks to both of you.Coming up, the deep freeze. Former Energy Secretary and Former Governor of Texas, Rick Perry is going to be here as his home state stays in survival mode and how the brutal cold stands to affect the energy sector.That's all in the next hour, "Mornings with Maria" live on Fox Business.Load-Date: February 19, 2021End of Document

Outlook on the Infrared Cameras Global Market to 2027 - by Type, Component, Wavelength and Application - ResearchAndMarkets.comBusiness WireMarch 12, 2021 Friday 1:54 PM GMTCopyright 2021 Business Wire, Inc.Length: 892 wordsDateline: DUBLIN BodyThe "Infrared Cameras Market Forecast to 2027 - COVID-19 Impact and Global Analysis By Type, Component, Wavelength, and Application" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.According to this report the market is expected to reach US$ 9,055.58 million by 2027 and is likely to register a CAGR of 7.1% from 2020 to 2027.Several industries such as aerospace and defense, automotive, healthcare, and others are investing heavily in advanced technologies to strengthen their capabilities with advanced machinery and offer enhanced services to customers. The market players present in countries such as Russia, the US, and France are developing advanced infrared cameras for the global market. Rising procurement of infrared cameras by the US Army is propelling its market growth. Developing nations such as India, China, and Indonesia are strengthening their military capabilities due to rising border clashes with neighboring countries. Furthermore, the adoption of infrared cameras has increased in the automotive sector due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, in March 2020, the Chinese government planned to install temperature monitoring infrared cameras on the public transport.Furthermore, the rising defense expenditure of countries such as the US, China, and India is expected to drive the growth of the market. Additionally, the increasing number of product launches by companies such as FLIR Systems, Inc. is expected to drive the growth of the market. For instance, in April 2020, FLIR Systems, Inc. launched FLIR Ranger HDC MR high-definition medium-wave infrared (MWIR) border-security surveillance system. The system assists in countering illegal drug smuggling, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and human trafficking. Therefore, these factors are expected to drive the growth of the market.Manufacturing, automotive, semiconductor and electronics, oil & gas, mining, aviation, and other industries have witnessed a decline in their operations due to the temporary shutdown of activities. The infrared cameras market players also experienced a slowdown in the volumes because the manufacturing facilities were operating with a limited workforce. This has had a negative impact on the market. Additionally, the temporary closure has resulted in reduced procurement of infrared cameras among industries during the first quarter of 2020, and the scenario is likely to continue in the first six months of 2021.The automotive OEMs are increasingly emphasizing non-destructive testing (NDT) methods to detect flaws on a developed component or product. The use of infrared camera facilitates the auto maker to visualize defects, also reduce the cost and time for detecting defects or flaws. The functions of catalysts and electric systems of cars and motor assemblies can also be tested with the help of infrared camera systems. Moreover, several defects of multiple products and components in the automotive industry are detected through temperature changes. Therefore, various auto makers are focusing on infrared cameras to detect defects on windows and seats. This practice is foreseen to grow among the automotive industry players across the world, which would boost the infrared camera market in terms of value and volume.The introduction of advanced infrared cameras is set to generate substantial demand among the end users owing to the benefits of enhanced sensing and imaging capabilities. As the advantages of infrared cameras over traditional systems or products have been attracting end users, the infrared camera manufacturers are continuously upgrading their products for end users can procure advanced IR cameras. This factor is foreseen to bolster the growth of the infrared cameras market.Reasons to Buy• Save and reduce time carrying out entry-level research by identifying the growth, size, leading players and segments in the infrared camera market.• Highlights key business priorities in order to assist companies to realign their business strategies• The key findings and recommendations highlight crucial progressive industry trends in the infrared camera market, thereby allowing players across the value chain to develop effective long-term strategies• Develop/modify business expansion plans by using substantial growth offering developed and emerging markets• Scrutinize in-depth global market trends and outlook coupled with the factors driving the market, as well as those hindering it• Enhance the decision-making process by understanding the strategies that underpin commercial interest with respect to client products, segmentation, pricing and distributionMarket DynamicsDrivers• Accentuation in Use of IR Cameras at Borders and Airports• Stimulating Demand from Automotive SectorsRestraints• Export Restrictions to Hinder the Market GrowthOpportunities• Continuous Development of Robust IR Cameras• COVID-19 has Spurred the Procurement of IR CamerasFuture Trends• Artificial Intelligence-enabled IR CamerasCompanies Mentioned• Leonardo• Opgal Optronic Industries Ltd• Teledyne DALSA• Seek Thermal, Inc.• LYNRED• Thermoteknix Systems Ltd• Axis Communications AB• FLIR Systems, Inc.• Fluke Corporation• Infrared Cameras Inc.For more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/gavw39View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210312005291/en/CONTACT: ResearchAndMarkets.comLaura Wood, Senior Press Managerpress@researchandmarkets.comFor E.S.T Office Hours Call 1-917-300-0470For U.S./CAN Toll Free Call 1-800-526-8630For GMT Office Hours Call +353-1-416-8900http://www.businesswire.comLoad-Date: March 12, 2021End of Document| About LexisNexis | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions | Copyright © 2021 LexisNexis Page 26 of 694Pres Biden asks court to pause move to ban TikTok in US  Page 29 of 694The9 Limited Reports 2020 Audited Financial Results  Page 31 of 694China urges WTO to appoint new Director-General  Page 35 of 694Industrial Robots Market 2021 Global Trends, Share, Growth, Analysis, Opportunities and Forecast To 2025  Page 37 of 694RUBIO, SCOTT, COLLEAGUES REINTRODUCE AMERICAN SECURITY DRONE ACT  Page 39 of 694Sens.
