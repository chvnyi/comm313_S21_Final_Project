CLOSED-DOOR HEARING OF SECOND CANADIAN CHARGED WITH ESPIONAGE BEGINS IN CHINAStates News ServiceMarch 22, 2021 MondayCopyright 2021 States News ServiceLength: 297 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the Voice of America (VOA):The espionage trial of former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig began Monday behind closed doors in a Beijing courtroom.Kovrig's trial is being held just three days after another Canadian, entrepreneur Michael Spavor, was put on trial in a closed door hearing on espionage charges in the northeastern city of Dandong.Both Kovrig and Spavor were arrested separately in December 2018 days after Canadian authorities arrested Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of China's Huawei Technologies, in Vancouver on a U.S. warrant.Diplomats from several nations, including Canada and the United States, gathered outside the Beijing courthouse where Kovrig is being tried. The diplomats said they have been barred from attending the trial on what China claims are national security reasons.Policemen wearing face masks chat each other at No. 2 Intermediate People's Court in Beijing, March 22, 2021.Spavor's trial last Friday, in which diplomats were also barred, ended without a verdict being rendered.The arrests of Kovrig and Spavor have plunged relations between Ottawa and Beijing to their lowest levels in decades. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has denounced China's actions as "completely unacceptable, as is the lack of transparency around these court proceedings."Meng remains under house arrest in Vancouver as she fights the extradition warrant from the U.S. As chief financial officer of Huawei one of the world's largest manufacturers of smartphones Meng is accused of lying to U.S. officials about Huawei's business in Iran, which is under U.S. sanctions.The U.S. has also warned other countries against using Huawei-built products, suspecting the Chinese government of installing spyware in them.Load-Date: March 22, 2021End of Document

In China, a man will have to compensate his ex-wife for household choresCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 24, 2021 WednesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 321 wordsBodyA court in China convicted a man who must pay $7,700 as "domestic homework compensation" to his ex-wife,in a historical divorce case. The fact generated a strong debate on Chinese social networks, where some users called for visibility into inequalities.The chinese justice decision is based onChina's n.n. civil code, which, according to the Chinese government and legal experts, seeks to better protect people's rights. This legislation took effect in January and includes a clause that allows a spouse to seek compensation from their partner during divorce for assuming greater responsibility for the care of elderly children and relatives.The caseThe woman, Wang,is a housewife who, after her husband filed for divorce, demanded compensation equivalent to $24,700. This figure is based on the fact that Wang claims that for five years she was left alone in charge of the care of the couple's child and household chores, because her husband "barely cared about or participated in any kind of household chores",Chinese media reported.The district court in Beijing ordered the husband to pay him about $7,700, after splitting his joint property equally. In addition, Wang received custody of his son and $300 per month in food pensionreported.ControversyOn Weibo, a Chinese social network similar to Facebook and Twitter, Wang's case was trending, generating a debate on the subject. On the one hand, some users applauded the ruling as a recognition of unpaid work at home and referencing that it is the first ruling to appeal to the new civil code legislation.However, many others expressed dissatisf with the amount granted, mentioning that it was too small to cover five years of household chores and childcare. They added that the cost of living in China's capital is one of the highest in the country.In both China and most parts of the world, women are still expected to take responsibility for childcare and house cleaning.Load-Date: February 25, 2021End of Document

Us future trade secretary promises to be "aggressive" with ChinaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 27, 2021 WednesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 375 wordsBodyNew U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, who appeared to the Senate tuesday for confirmation at the post, expressed her intention to stand firm and even "aggressive" with China and regretted the Asian giant's unfair practices.Raimondo, the first female governor of Rhode Island, stated that China has "clearly had anti-competitive behavior," as in the case of the steel and aluminum sector, "which harmed American workers.""As a result, if I am confirmed (in office), I anticipate being very aggressive, helping Americans fight China's unfair practices," he promised.However, it has endorsed the position of President Joe Biden, who prefers the United States not to ride alone and will consult its allies to restore fair trade with Beijing.On Wednesday, the Chinese government urged Washington to "correct its mistakes," without referring directly to Raimondo's statements."The last U.S. government opted for protectionism and intimidation and maliciously started a trade war" against China, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Zhao Lijian, told the press.Zhao said, without giving details, that Beijing would take the "necessary measures to protect the legitimate rights and interests" of its country's businesses.Although Republican and Democratic congressmen have pointed out that some Chinese companies pose a risk to national security, Raimondo is not committed to keeping the Huawei giant and other Chinese companies blacklisted.It has simply promised to use the powers of its Commerce department to "protect Americans from Chinese interference."With Donald Trump's administration, the Commerce Department, led by Wilbur Ross, had frequently used its prerogatives to take severe action against Chinese tech companies suspected of industrial espionage and to undermine U.S. national security.Thus, it expanded the list of companies that could not trade with U.S. companies without a prior license. Dozens of companies were added, such as telecom giants Huawei and ZTE.In December, a few weeks before leaving the White House, the Trump administration also added Chinese computer card manufacturer Smic and limited the company's access to state-of-the-art U.S. technologies because of its alleged ties to the Chinese military.Source: AFPLoad-Date: January 28, 2021End of Document

CAIR Welcomes Twitter's Decision to Remove 'Horrific' Chinese 'Post Celebrating Uyghur GenocideTargeted News ServiceJanuary 12, 2021 Tuesday 9:40 AM  ESTCopyright 2021 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 368 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Council on American-Islamic Relations issued the following news release on Jan. 11:The Council on American-Islamic Relations, the nation's largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, today welcomed Twitter's decision to remove a "horrific" statement celebrating the ongoing genocide of Uyghur Muslims posted by the Chinese Embassy to the United States.Last Thursday, China's U.S. Embassy posted a state media report defending China's oppression of Uyghur Muslims and other Turkic ethnic minorities in China by claiming that Muslim women in Xinjiang are "no longer baby-making machines" and that the decreased population growth in the province led to a drop in terrorism.CAIR and other organizations condemned the tweet as an admission and celebration of genocide, and called on Twitter to remove the post, which the social media platform did on Saturday.In a statement, CAIR National Executive Director Nihad Awad said:"We welcome Twitter's decision to stand up to China by removing this horrific post, which celebrated the Chinese government's ongoing genocide of Uyghur Muslims, including forced sterilizations and abortions carried out in concentration camps. Twitter did the right thing in this case, and now leaders and nations around the world must do the same by taking concrete action to end China's genocide of Uyghur Muslims."Last month, CAIR joined the US Council of Muslim Organizations (USCMO), Free Uyghur Now, and other global allies in a virtual press conference calling on the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) to join the international community in standing with Uyghur Muslims and other Turkic ethnic minorities.According to human rights monitors, there are at least 1.8 million and as many as 3 million Uyghurs and other ethnic Turkic minorities that are being detained in concentration and forced labor camps. In these facilities, they are forced to renounce their faith, stripped of their human rights, and face torture and other abuses. Through mass detention, forced labor, and forced sterilization, the Chinese government is destroying the Uyghurs' ethnic and religious identities.[Category: International]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7348263 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: January 12, 2021End of Document

Its host, Duncan Bartlett, is the Editor of Asian Affairs magazine and a former BBC presenter.In the first episode of the podcast, Professor Steve Tsang, Director of the SOAS China Institute discusses the mounting tension between China and the United States and how it threatens to spill over into armed conflict, with Taiwan as the flashpoint.Professor Tsang believes that China is preparing to mount an invasion of Taiwan, which could draw the Americans into a battle for its defence."No country has invested more in building up an amphibian assault capability than China," Professor Tsang told the China In Context podcast. "I therefore think it's reasonable to expect that sometime in the next ten to twenty years, when those capabilities are fully in place, the Chinese will move to Taiwan," he said.When asked about how the current situation compares to the Cold War between America and the USSR, Professor Tsang said he is "much more concerned about now".He told podcast host Duncan Bartlett that "the Chinese government has made it very clear they would like the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to win wars" and that "Xi Jinping wants China to be regarded as the top power in the world."President Biden invited the de facto Taiwanese ambassador to attend its inauguration ceremony and a spokesman said his commitment to Taiwan is "rock solid."China sees democratic Taiwan as a breakaway province and recently flew military aircraft, including eight bombers, into Taiwan's air defense identification zone.Listen to the podcast on Soundcloud, Spotify, or via Buzzsprout.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7382891 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: February 12, 2021End of Document

Xi Jinping endorses revamping China's legal system amid crackdown on AlibabaUPIJanuary 12, 2021 Tuesday 11:17 AM ESTCopyright 2021 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 376 wordsByline: ELIZABETH SHIMDateline: Jan. 12 BodyChinese leader Xi Jinping could be consolidating power as the Chinese Communist Party reveals a new policy to revamp its legal system amid a crackdown on Alibaba, the country's biggest e-commerce company.According to China's state-owned news agency Xinhua, China's ruling party on Sunday released a 15,000-word document that proposed a "system of distinctively Chinese socialist rule of law."The Chinese government has set a deadline of 2035, the South China Morning Post reported Tuesday, when "the state, government and a society governed by the rule of law will be basically completed, a socialist rule of law system with Chinese characteristics will be basically formed."Beijing claimed the restructuring would guarantee the Chinese people's "right to equal participation and development will be fully guaranteed, and the modernization of the nation's governance system and capabilities will be largely achieved," the report said.News of the Chinese plan to place the party's leadership, or Xi, at the center of the country's legal system, comes after Xi stressed "self-reliance" at a meeting in Beijing on Monday in a speech that called for the development of the domestic economy."Only by being self-reliant and developing the domestic market and smoothing out internal circulation can we achieve vibrant growth and development, regardless of the hostility in the outside world," Xi said, according to the Post.Xi did not address Monday's one-year anniversary of the first COVID-19 death in the Chinese city of Wuhan.Beijing's statement on greater government involvement in economic planning, which Xi justified amid a "turbulent time" comes as Alibaba founder Jack Ma remains missing.Ma has not been seen in public since October, after he gave a speech criticizing China's banking regulations, the Financial Times reported Tuesday."To innovate without taking risks is to strangle innovation," Ma had said. "There is no such thing as riskless innovation in the world."Last year, China's financial regulators canceled an initial public offering of Ant Group, a money market fund founded by Ma. Alibaba's shares have fallen nearly 30% and Ma's net worth has declined from $62 billion to $49 billion, according to Bloomberg data and the Financial Times.Load-Date: January 12, 2021End of Document

China calls for Alibaba to sell its assets in the media sectorCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 15, 2021 MondayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 229 wordsBodyThe Chinese government has asked online commerce giant Alibaba to sell its assets in the media sector, concerned about the influence exerted by the group founded by Jack Ma, said the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) on Monday (15).The billionaire, who officially retired from Alibaba in 2019 but remains a major shareholder, has been in the crosshairs of his country's authorities for several months.Chinese regulators suspended a colossal $34 billion IPO of Ant Group, an Alibaba subsidiary for online payments, in November. And a month later, regulators opened an investigation into the company's business practices, considered monopolistic.Now, authorities are asking Alibaba to drastically reduce its media participation, according to the American newspaper, which does not cite sources.It was not specified whether Alibaba should withdraw entirely from the media or give up part of its shares.Alibaba is also in danger of receiving the largest fine in Chinese history for its monopolistic practices, the WSJ said on Friday.That could exceed the $975 million paid in 2015 by U.S. microchip maker Qualcomm, the largest anti-monopoly fine ever imposed by Beijing.According to the newspaper, authorities accuse Alibaba of forcing the granting of exclusivity to entrepreneurs who sell on its online sites and refraining from marketing products or services on other similar platforms.Load-Date: March 16, 2021End of Document

SEN. RICK SCOTT TO BRAZILIAN PRESIDENT BOLSONARO: DON'T LET COMMUNIST CHINA INTO BRAZIL'S NETWORKSStates News ServiceJanuary 25, 2021 MondayCopyright 2021 States News ServiceLength: 560 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, D.C. BodyThe following information was released by Florida Senator Rick Scott:Today, Senator Rick Scott sent a letter to Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro urging the him to reconsider Brazil's decision to open the country's 5G network auctions to Chinese telecom equipment maker Huawei Technologies, which the U.S. Government has determined to be a national security threat and continues to be a bad actor across the globe. Companies that allow Huawei into their networks risk their national security and give Communist China direct access to the most sensitive data of their citizens, including medical records, financial information, and social media accounts.Read the Senator's letter HERE or below.January 25, 2021The Honorable Jair BolsonaroPresident of BrazilDear President Bolsonaro:Thank you for the great work you are doing as we continue to strengthen the economic partnership between the United States and Brazil. I appreciated our discussions both during my last trip to Brazil and your visit to Miami last year on how we can work together to promote freedom throughout Latin America and end Maduro's ruthless regime in Venezuela. I look forward to continuing to boost the economic partnership between Florida and Brazil and grow our great trade and commerce relationship.I write today to express my concern about Brazil's decision to open the country's 5G network auctions to Chinese telecom equipment maker Huawei Technologies Co Ltd.I know you understand the dangers of Chinese technology. General Secretary Xi has set up a massive surveillance infrastructure masked as technology "businesses," like ZTE and Huawei, which threaten national security and give Communist China invaluable information to further their mission to surveil and influence governments and individuals all over the world. There is no separation between the Communist Chinese government and Huawei. This is one bad actor operating across the globe.Huawei's goal is to squeeze out competitors around the world so countries have no choice but to allow Huawei in. It's a false choice. There are alternatives to Huawei. They may not enjoy the same government backing as Huawei and thus may cost more. But the cost of allowing Huawei to gain a foothold in Brazil would be far greater.Countries that do business with Huawei put their citizens' and country's privacy rights at grave risk. Countries that allow Huawei in give Communist China direct access to the most sensitive data of their citizens, including medical records, financial information, and social media accounts. It also presents a significant national security concern for the United States and the ability of our military to share information with trusted partners.Admiral Craig Faller, Commander of the U.S. Southern Command, warned that "If governments in Latin America and the Caribbean continue to gravitate toward using Chinese information systems, our ability and willingness to share information over compromised networks is likely to suffer."I value the partnership our nation has with Brazil, and look forward to further strengthening that relationship moving forward. I hope that you will give serious consideration to the concerns I have presented here. I urge Brazil to heed this warning about the dangers of Communist China, and refuse to allow Huawei in your 5G networks.Sincerely,Rick ScottUnited States SenatorLoad-Date: January 26, 2021End of Document

Furor for the "Chinese Teslas" on Wall StreetCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 25, 2021 MondayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 747 wordsBody          By Miguel Boggiano       Tesla could stop being the king of electric cars very soon. More and more competitors, 100% electric car manufacturers, are launching into the market in hopes of snating the throne from Elon Musk's company. And the vast majority of them are Chinese.The story of electric cars is fashionable. And if there's one thing Wall Street loves, it's the stories. Today there are several and very popular: cloud services, renewable energies, cryptocurrencies. The actions of companies linked to these stories keep going up.Tesla is a clear example of this. In the last year his shares rose more than 640%.However, there is another electric car manufacturer that performed even more dramatically: NIO Limited (NIO), known as the Chinese "Tesla", had a growth of almost +1200% over the same period.Below we can see the evolution of the two: What exactly does NIO do?The company was founded in 2014, under the name NextEV, and is headquartered in Shanghai. In 2017, it changed its name to NIO Limited. The company manufactures luxury SUVs that it sells in China, Hong Kong, the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany.NIO has a market capitalization of approximately $100 billion, an eighth of what Tesla is worth. This is not a minor fact, as today it is the third highest value car manufacturer on the US stock exchange (after Tesla and Toyota).However, the number of cars sold by NIO is small: 12,200 vehicles delivered in the third quarter of 2020, versus 139,000 sold by Tesla in the same period. Color data: In the same quarter, General Motors delivered more than 660,000 and Ford 550,000 (and Tesla has a market value equivalent to 10 times General Motors and 17 times Ford).But that's not all. NIO is a money loss machine. In 2019, prior to the pandemic, the company reported losses of $1.6 billion. And in 2020, he continued to lose in every quarter.The company survives, in large part, thanks to the financing given to it by the Chinese government but, if the free money were finished, it would have huge problems to survive.In simple words, in NIO we find a small car manufacturer but it has a huge story: to be the Chinese "Tesla".This is indicated by its valuation: this company is more expensive than Tesla (which is already a lot to say!). To give you an idea, NIO has a Price-to-Sales ratio of 55, while Tesla is 28. If you don't know if this is much, I'm telling you that Ford has a P/S ratio of 0.36 and General Motors is 0.71. How is it going? The case of NIO is not the onlyIn 2020, XPeng (XPEV) and Li Auto (LI), other Chinese electric car manufacturers looking to compete with NIO for the title "the new Tesla", began trading on the stock exchange.Of course, these companies also systematically lose money and have astronomical valuations.For example, XPeng has a Price-to-Sales of 115 and a market value of $47 billion, while Li Auto P/O is "only" 38 and is worth $33 billion.Since they began listing on the stock exchange in July and August 2020, Li has climbed +109% and XPeng +165%. What can we expect for the future?In the short term, these companies are likely to be in luck similar to Tesla and the account of electric cars in general. They can keep going up, as long as euphoria continues in the sector.Forthe long run, they're a real pandora's box.I say this not only because of the correction they may suffer if the story is pricked (since they have extreme valuations and lose money), but also because of the uncertainty generated by Chinese companies in general.Many may not know it, but Chinese companies are under no obligation to report certain data in the US under Chinese law. I mean, Chinese executives don't go to jail in that country if they lie on Wall Street.And those who audit for U.S. balance sheets are the Chinese subsidiaries of large audit firms, which rarely be transparent.There's a great documentary that covers this topic and I recommend it: it's called "The China Hustle" and it's on Netflix.For now, it seems that the party will continue at least a little longer. But to be attentive, because the large and forgotten cars (Ford, General Motors, etc.) are also starting to manufacture electric cars. Soon we will have enormous competition in the sector.Finally, I would like to tell you that I prepared a special report for financial sector readers, 100% free, with 10 shares of companies that I believe, can perform well in 2021. You can download it in this link: Financial Letter - 10 shares for 2021.Load-Date: January 26, 2021End of Document

Donald Trump signs order banning transactions with eight Chinese apps including AlipayStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeJanuary 8, 2021 FridayUniversity WireCopyright 2021 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: MARKETS; Pg. 1Length: 641 wordsByline: Jean GarciaBody"The United States must take aggressive action against those who develop or control Chinese connected software applications to protect our national security", the order said.The apps targeted are AliPay, CamScanner, QQ Wallet, SHAREit, Tencent QQ, VMate, WeChat Pay and WPS Office.But with the mandate not going into effect for another 45 days - long after Trump's out of office - its actual implementation would require the buy-in of the incoming Biden administration.Ultimately, though, if the ban is enacted it presents more of a political problem in U.S.The United States has assessed that a number of Chinese connected software applications automatically capture vast swaths of information from millions of users in the United States, including sensitive personally identifiable information and private information, which would allow the Chinese Army and the Chinese Community Party access to Americans' personal and proprietary information.It flags the possibility that the apps could be used to track and build dossiers on USA federal employees."The Trump administration is still rushing through its list of penalties to restrict the US-China relationship in hope of inducing China into retaliating, further worsening ties, and tying [President-elect Joe] Biden's hands", said Scott Kennedy, senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.A representative for Biden's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.The order tasks the Commerce Department with defining which transactions will be banned under the directive within 45 days, but a US official told Reuters that the Commerce Department plans to act before January 20, when Trump leaves office.Trump's order seeks to prohibit transactions with eight companies including Alipay, owned by Chinese billionaire Jack Ma; the payment platform on the popular app WeChat; and a Chinese messaging service called QQ owned by the Chinese tech giant Tencent.Trump said that India has banned the use of more than 200 Chinese connected software applications throughout the country.The restrictions, however, were blocked by courts mainly on freedom of speech grounds.He added, " stand with President Trump's commitment to protecting the privacy and security of Americans from threats posed by the Chinese Communist Party, and the Department of Commerce will leverage the authorities of the E.O.to continue our mission to secure the nation, the economy, and the people of the United States".Alipay has been in Washington's cross hairs for months.Reuters reported in November that the U.S. State Department had submitted a proposal to add Ant Group to a trade blacklist in order to deter U.S. investors from taking part in its lucrative initial public offering. But the Commerce Department, which oversees the blacklist, shelved the proposal after Alibaba Group Holding Inc President Michael Evans urged Ross to reject the bid. While billions use the apps in China, Bloomberg notes that in the U.S. WeChat only had 1.6 million downloads a year ago and AliPay just over 207,000, according to data from Sensor Tower. Tuesday's move is the latest in a raft of tough new curbs on Chinese companies.TikTok has repeatedly defended itself against allegations of data transfers to the Chinese government, saying it stores user information on servers in the United States and Singapore.Last month, Washington slapped harsh restrictions on chipmaker SMIC and other companies that effectively cut them off from USA suppliers and technology.OnePlus Nord now receives Android 11 and OxygenOS 11 in open betaOnePlus usually takes up to a month in releasing the stable update of a new Android version following the first beta launch . The first open beta build also optimises the stability of some third-party applications and improves user experience.Load-Date: January 9, 2021End of Document

Trump's policy makes a dent at Huawei: 24.5% of his business in America disappeared during 2020CE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 31, 2021 WednesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 620 wordsBodyHuawei, the world leader in telecommunications equipment, has announced a record profit in 2020, despite the veto imposed since donald Trump's administration, which has managed to prevent a normal development of the Chinese giant's business activities, as seen in the company's turnover.This firm improved its net profit by 3.2% to reach a data of 64.6 billion yuan (approximately 8.39 billion euros). Turnover also continues to rise, but that revenue is already growing dimly, a 3.8% contrasting with the positive pace of 19.1% recorded a year earlier. Thus, the company's annual turnover is 891.4 billion yuan(115.9 billion euros).In the 2020 results, released on Wednesday, Huawei has omitted the number of phones sold, a detail that was released a year earlier. In the sector, the Chinese are estimated to have dispatched 20% fewer phones in 2020 than in 2019, as collected by different consultants. Business in China has improved by 15%, but in the Americas turnover has dwindled by 24.5%."Firm in the face of adversity""Over the past year, we have stood firm in the face of adversity," said Ken Hu, president of the company, "Life hasn't been easy for us." The leader thus refers to the campaign of accusations and smears led by the UNITED States since 2018 and to which the new President Joe Biden has not finalized. The battery of accusations, espionage included, has been a brake on Huaweu's previously fired revenue growth, with upticks of around 30% in year-on-year comparisons.US authorities began to draw attention in 2018 to Huawei's possible leaks to the Chinese government, a criticism that gained strength in May 2019 under Trump's mandate, with the company being blacklisted. Since the Chinese company, it has repeatedly insisted that it is a private company and it is recalled that none of these accusations are accompanied by any evidence. The damage is especially strong when the deployment of 5G networks for the new mobile phone technology, in which Huawei was a leader, has begun.This US policy has hurt companies in that country that used to maintain normal business relationships with Huawei that had to set distances. For example, Huawei phones have been deprived of the Californian app store Google, Google Play, and Chinese brand phones have released an operating system (HarmonyOS) that serves as an alternative to Android, also developed by Google. On Wednesday, Ken Hu explained that they have had to change their supply chain and focus on business diversification, for example by approaching the booming realm of cloud computing. Shenzen's firm is present in 70 countries and has around 197,000 employees.The heiress, in the courtsIn addition, the company's chief financial director, Meng Wanzhou, considered heir to the empire raised by her father, Ren Zhengfei, is pending extradition from Canada,where she was arrested, to the US, where she is accused of omitting information about Huawei's business in Iran, which would have contravened the sanctions policy established by Washington. E later this week, the board has gone back to the Vancouver courthouse.All these circumstances have contributed to Huawei's retreat in China, where its sales continue to grow, while in the western markets of Europe and North America its business has been reduced.Data from some industry consultants, such as IDC, yields strong conclusions: from being the second global brand in units sold in 2019 (only surpassed by Samsung), Huawei has moved to third place (surpassed in 2020 by Apple). IDC estimated that Huawei's drop in smartphones sold was -21% in 2020, with a special impact in the last quarter (-42%). Another consultancy, Canalys, calculates similar data: a drop of -22% per annum by 2020. Load-Date: April 1, 2021End of Document

Biden candidate for CIA chief underscores China threatCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 24, 2021 WednesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 658 wordsBodyChina is the biggest threat to the United States, President Joe Biden's candidate to lead the CIA, William Burns, said Wednesday, promising to secure the spy agency's independence from the political world.In an "increasingly complex and competitive" international scenario, the Chinese government's "predatory" attitude represents "our greatest geopolitical challenge," the former professor declared during his hearing before the Senate intelligence committee, which must approve his appointment."Overcoming China will be key to our security in the coming decades," he said. "That will require a long-term, lucid, bipartisan strategy, underpinned by a domestic renewal and strong intelligence," he said.Although Washington can cooperate with Beijing on key issues such as climate change or the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, the former State Department number two (2011-2014) warned that the Chinese regime "methodically strengthens its intellectual property theft capabilities, suppresses its people, harasses its neighbors, extends its power in the world, and builds its influence within American society."The CIA has in recent years been targeted by Chinese intelligence operations, which recruited several U.S. agents and diplomats.A decade ago, Beijing managed to dismantle a network of us agency informants in China.Burns stated that the battle for technological superiority in intelligence, including the use of artificial intelligence, will be a key element of his mission. He also advocated recruiting Mandarin-speaking agents.In addition to China, Russia, which he called "aggressive" and Iran, which he called "hostile," are the other major threats to his country, according to Burns.Recalling his years as U.S. ambassador to Moscow, between 2005 and 2008, the former artist said he had learned "that it is always a mistake to underestimate Vladimir Putin's Russia.""While, in many respects, Russia is a declining power, it can be as disruptive" as emerging powers as China, he considered.- An atypical profile -Burns, the driver of the dialogue with Iran that allowed the 2015 nuclear program agreement, believed that the United States should "do all it can to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon."If the Senate confirms his appointment, as expected, Burns, 64, will replace Gina Haspel, the first woman to lead the CIA, whose career has been tarnished by her controversial role in the post-September 11, 2001 torture programs.Biden's candidate assured that reinforced interrogation methods, employed in the wake of these attacks, "will never be used by the CIA" under his leadership, and called simulated drowning, one such technique, an "act of torture."Burns' election seeks to restore the agency's independence, after former President Donald Trump's detractors accused the agency of wanting to politicize the CIA."Politics must stop where intelligence work begins," said Burns, who recalled his long career in the Middle East and Russia."I learned that intelligence professionals have to tell politicians what they need to hear, even if they don't want to hear it," he added.A diplomat for 33 years, Burns retired in 2014 before chairing the Carnegie Foundation for International Peace, a think tank on inter-country relations, whose exchange program with a Chinese organization considered a propaganda body was criticized by members of the Senate intelligence committee.Although his profile is atypical for the post -- he is neither military nor political and never worked in theBurns assured the committee that he knew the CIA very well, which he often dealt with during his career.He also emphasized the need for the CIA to work with U.S. allies, especially to oppose Russia, as opposed to Trump's conciliatory attitude toward Moscow."We will have more impact on Putin's calculations if we see strong responses not only from the United States, but also from our European allies and others," he said.pmh/st/gm/gma/rsrLoad-Date: February 25, 2021End of Document

BENNET, BIPARTISAN COLLEAGUES INTRODUCE LEGISLATION TO REASSERT AMERICAN LEADERSHIP AND VALUES IN EMERGING TECHNOLOGIESStates News ServiceMarch 4, 2021 ThursdayCopyright 2021 States News ServiceLength: 1256 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Colorado Senator Michael Bennet:Colorado U.S. Senator Michael Bennet, a member of the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and U.S. Senators Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), and Todd Young (R-Ind.) introduced legislation to develop a strategic partnership among democratic countries to compete against the growing technological influence of the Chinese Communist Party and other authoritarian regimes. The Democracy Technology Partnership Act would establish a dedicated office at the State Department tasked with creating a partnership among democratic countries to help set international standards and norms, conduct joint research, and coordinate export controls and investment screening on emerging and critical technologies."The Chinese Communist Party is working rapidly and strategically to dominate in technologies that will underpin our economic and national security, and to export its illiberal technology across the globe," said Bennet. "America's competitiveness and security require an international technology strategy that leads with our values and allies. This bipartisan approach will empower the United States and our democratic partners to compete with China and set the rules of the road for next generation technologies.""The Chinese Communist Party is working to surpass the U.S. technologically and economically and to export their technologies globally. In order to compete and counter the expansion of Chinese dominance in critical technology sectors, we need to create a strategy that leverages the power of American partnerships to protect and advance our technological edge," said Warner. "This bipartisan legislation will help foster partnerships among the U.S. and like-minded democratic countries to better protect and compete against China in critical emerging technologies while helping set global rules, standards, and protocols for the market.""After four years of consistent failure under the Trump administration, one of our most important challenges will be to forge a coherent new national security strategy, particularly on cybersecurity and emerging technology, led by our values, centered on our democratic allies and partners, and implemented with consistency," said Menendez . "The Democracy Technology Partnership Act is a bipartisan recognition that we have entered a new era of technology and geo-economic strategic competition with Beijing, and an acknowledgement that we will not overcome this challenge without technology partnerships and shared human ingenuity. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to invest in a broad diplomatic and security architecture that restores our nation's position as the world's greatest innovator and allows us to actually outperform China.""Both Democrats and Republicans know that competing with China is one of the biggest challenges in the 21st Century," said Schumer . "For years, I have been committed to confronting the Chinese government for cheating and stealing its way to economic growth. That's why I am proud to help champion the bipartisan Democracy Technology Partnership Act, which will give like-minded democracies the edge needed to compete with the Chinese Communist Party. This initiative is an important next step in our mission to boost American competitiveness, leverage our alliances abroad and fight China's predatory practices.""It's no secret the Chinese Communist Party wants to reshape the emerging technology landscape to benefit their authoritarian aims. It is essential that the United States and our like-minded democratic allies around the world work together to set global standards that uphold our universal values," said Young . "This bipartisan legislation marks a significant step forward for the United States in our ongoing effort to out-compete China and I look forward to working with my colleagues to see this passed into law.""Winning the long-term tech race with the Chinese Communist Party is foundational to our strategic relevance in the world. Chairman Xi has laid out an ambitious plan to displace the United States as the world's preeminent superpower and install his version of techno-authoritarianism in its place. The United States cannot meet this challenge alone and must lead our freedom-loving allies and partners to craft creative solutions to our shared technological challenges. This bill is a good step towards that goal," said Sasse."It's critical for democracies around the world to collaborate in research and development as well as manufacturing of advanced technologies to compete against China," said Rubio. "Too many nations fall prey to the trap of incentives associated with Chinese tech that only results in lost privacy, reduced autonomy, and greater dependence on Beijing. The U.S. must lead likeminded countries in establishing and supporting alternatives that are safer and technologically more advanced. I hope this bill will push the Administration to lead in this space."Leadership and competitiveness in emerging technologies will determine the political, economic, and military strength of countries in the 21st century. Currently, the People's Republic of China (PRC) is using every tool in its arsenal to dominate key technologies such as 5G, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, semiconductors, and more from heavily subsidizing Chinese companies to investing extensively in research and development, to leveraging international standard-setting bodies, and accessing technologies through illicit means.The U.S. cannot counter this on its own. To help America compete, the Democracy Technology Partnership Act would establish an interagency office at the U.S. Department of State to spearhead a new partnership among the world's tech-leading democracies. This partnership would help guide critical emerging technologies to advance democratic values instead of those from authoritarian regimes like China.Specifically, the new office would be responsible for:Creating a technology-based partnership of democratic countries to develop harmonized technology governance regimes and to fill gaps in specific technologies;Identifying existing or new multilateral mechanisms to advance the objectives of the Technology Partnership;Coordinating with democratic partners on shared technology strategies; andDeveloping strategies to provide alternatives to countries at risk of acquiring technologies from authoritarian regimes.In addition, the Democracy Technology Partnership Act creates a $5 billion International Technology Partnership Fund to support joint research projects between government research agencies, universities, technology companies and other businesses from partner countries, as well as to make technology investments in third-country markets. The legislation also creates a Public-Private Board, called the International Technology Partnership Advisory Board, made up of individuals with demonstrated expertise in emerging technologies and international trade.Bennet has supported policies that invest in America's competitiveness and combat challenges posed by the Chinese Communist Party's growing influence. In January 2020, Bennet introduced the Utilizing Strategic Allied (USA) Telecommunications Act to encourage and support U.S. innovation in the race for 5G, providing over $1 billion to invest in alternatives to Chinese equipment providers Huawei and ZTE.Load-Date: March 8, 2021End of Document

FCC Acting Chairwoman Rosenworcel Issues Remarks at CSISTargeted News ServiceMarch 20, 2021 Saturday 9:00 AM  ESTCopyright 2021 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2223 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Federal Communications Commission issued the following remarks on March 18, 2021, by Acting Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel at the Center for Strategic and International Studies:* * *Thank you to the Center for Strategic and International Studies for convening this discussion and inviting me to participate. Thank you also for your working group's new report on 5G security. It's full of keen analysis and smart recommendations--and I'm not just saying that because it echoes a lot of our work at the Federal Communications Commission. It's also treat to be here with Congresswoman Matsui--especially in a setting where I'm not being cross-examined by the Energy and Commerce Committee. She is a true thought leader on Capitol Hill, especially when it comes to spectrum policy.This is actually my second time speaking to CSIS. You hosted me back in early 2019. I opened those remarks by noting how timely it was to be holding a discussion about the security of our communications networks. Just days earlier, the Department of Justice had charged a Chinese equipment manufacturer and its Chief Financial Officer with attempting to steal trade secrets. Back then the presence of network equipment from untrusted Chinese vendors was viewed as one of the greatest cybersecurity challenges facing the country.Then my predecessor at the FCC spoke to CSIS in early 2021. That took place two weeks after news broke about the SolarWinds breach, which allowed hackers to penetrate the Pentagon, nuclear labs, the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security, and other offices that used the company's network-monitoring software. It has been described as the biggest and most sophisticated hack the world has ever seen.Now I find myself speaking to CSIS again, on the heels of yet another major cybersecurity story. Last week, Microsoft revealed that security for its Exchange software had been breached, leaving hundreds of banks, healthcare, and government servers vulnerable to hackers.So it's safe to say, we've reached a point where we are never that far removed from a new development to remind us that, when it comes to cybersecurity, the threats are real, the stakes are high, and our defenses may be insufficient. In other words, we live in an age where talk of cybersecurity and how to improve it is always a timely discussion.What strikes me is that each of these events unfolded like a scene from a scary movie: we frantically barricaded the doors, only to discover that the threat had been hiding inside the whole time. For years while we sought to protect ourselves from external threats, untrusted equipment and services had been sitting undisturbed in our nation's commercial networks.Now let me pause here and make something of a confession. I'm that person that talks back at the television screen. I'm sure I'm not the only one. Some people jump, some people close their eyes--I've got ideas about what ill-fated characters could be doing to better their fate, and an unabashed proclivity toward sharing them.So today I'm not going to hold that tendency back. I'm going to share three lessons we've all learned from these movies that should apply equally to our nation's cybersecurity. Of course, I want to start by recognizing that the cybersecurity challenge is about to get even more challenging with the advent of 5G.That's because our 5G future is about connecting everything. It is about moving to a new networked world that will open up possibilities for communications that we cannot even fully imagine today. By exponentially increasing the connections between people and things around us, this technology could become an input in everything we do--improving agriculture, education, healthcare, energy, transportation, and more. The data we derive from all these connections is powerful--it will inform machine learning, artificial intelligence, and the next generation of innovation across the economy.But building this future right means building security in front from the start. That's because this new endless connectivity also means new vulnerabilities. With so much on the line, it's urgent that trustworthy companies build the next-generation networks that will soon touch so much of our lives. And it's critical that we take a multifaceted and strategic approach to protecting our networks from all threats.So let's get started.Lesson One: Never Split Up.It's a terrible idea for horror movies and it's a terrible idea for cybersecurity too. There is no task at the FCC--or in any part of the federal government--that is more important than keeping the American people safe. But history demonstrates that no single entity can meet this challenge alone. That is why in my first meeting as Acting Chairwoman I committed to working with our federal partners and the private sector to increase the security and resiliency of our nation's communications networks. I also made clear my belief that working with like-minded countries and multilateral institutions and building on shared frameworks like the Prague Principles can multiply our strength across the globe.This is more than just rhetoric. In my first few weeks as Acting Chairwoman I made it a priority to reach out to my peers in other parts of the federal government to help coordinate and advance our shared interest in network security. Those efforts included speaking with present leadership at the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and the Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technology in the new Administration.And while we make it a priority to coordinate externally--whether with other countries or other agencies--we need to do the same internally. So I have updated the way that the FCC reviews matters related to national security, which right now are siloed within the agency's various bureaus and offices. If we are going to keep pace with the growing threats to our communications, we need a dedicated interagency and cross-bureau team of experts advancing a comprehensive approach to securing our nation's communications.This team is already hard at work. That includes auditing and updating the FCC's capabilities on national security issues, exploring opportunities to collaborate with other federal agencies--like the National Science Foundation and the Department of Defense--on new 5G testbeds, rechartering and rejuvenating the FCC's Communications Security, Reliability, and Interoperability Council for our 5G future, and addressing evolving national security risks in this agency's past grants of Section 214 applications. We expect to have more to announce on each of these fronts soon.So that's lesson one. Let's keep going.Lesson Two: Don't Answer the Door.Or to put it somewhat differently, don't let the threat inside your home.When it comes to a 5G security strategy, the government's approach to date has focused on slowing down untrusted vendors. We know there are risks that come with using this equipment and those vulnerabilities could provide foreign interests with access to our networks, jeopardizing the security of communications in the United States. So we've rolled out policies aimed at slowing down the adoption of Huawei and ZTE equipment globally, targeting these companies' practices that allow them to move quickly, and leveling the international playing field.At the FCC we restricted the use of this equipment by carriers through changes to our universal service fund. Thanks to the Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Act, we are putting the finishing touches on a system to replace insecure equipment from Chinese companies like Huawei and ZTE, to the extent that it is present in our domestic networks today. Congress has appropriated $1.9 billion for the FCC to do this work. And in February, at my first meeting as Acting Chairwoman, the Commission launched a proceeding to get that money out the door and get going on this important work.We're broadening our focus from equipment to services too. We previously denied an application from China Mobile USA to enter our markets and put four other similarly situated companies on notice they could share a similar fate. Yesterday we instituted proceedings to revoke the domestic authority and international authorizations of three of those companies: China Unicom Americas, Pacific Networks, and ComNet.Finally, we're increasing transparency and information sharing around these issues, too. The Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Act requires that the Commission publish and maintain a list of communications equipment and services that pose an unacceptable risk to national security or the security and safety of U.S. persons. Just last week, our Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau released its list of unsafe vendors, which includes Huawei, ZTE and three other Chinese companies identified by Congress. As we continue to update and maintain this list, it will provide meaningful guidance that will ensure that as next-generation networks are built across the country, they do not repeat the mistakes of the past.Collectively, I believe these actions will help make our communications future more secure. If we do these things right, we have an opportunity to serve as a model for the rest of the world on how to remove insecure equipment and services from communications networks. We have the funding, the congressional mandate, the ears of policymakers, and the eyes of the world. So let's make the most of this moment.And that brings us the end.Lesson Three: Have a Back-Up Plan.It's just common sense.Now I said earlier that the FCC's focus to date has been on slowing down untrusted vendors. But I believe there is another strategy that we should be pursuing at the same time. While we continue to take action to slow down untrusted vendors, we also must take action to speed up American innovation.So to get that effort started, yesterday the agency launched the first-ever inquiry into open radio access networks--or open RAN.This is important because we have only four major vendors for RAN equipment to choose from, none of which hails from the United States. Plus, the vendors that have grown fastest in recent years are from China, in part because the Chinese government deploys powerful industrial policies to make their equipment cheaper to deploy than the alternatives. We know based on a comprehensive record developed by various national security agencies around the world that there are serious risks that come with having this equipment in our networks.On top of that, the RAN is the most restrictive and most expensive part of the network, in part because all of its major components have to come from the same vendor. There is no way to mix and match.So here's the thinking behind open RAN. If we can unlock the RAN and diversify the equipment in this part of our networks, we may be able to increase security, reduce our exposure to any single foreign vendor, lower costs, and push the equipment market to where the United States is uniquely skilled--in software.That sounds promising. And as a result of our action yesterday, we will have the first comprehensive record on the public interest benefits of new interoperability in the RAN. We will have the first assessment of the state of this technology, how our rules may be adjusted to foster its growth, and how our coordination with other federal actors--from the National Science Foundation to the Department of Defense--may stimulate its development in the marketplace.At the same time, we do not shy away from the hard questions. We ask about challenges associated with systems integration and management. We consider reliability and quality of service. We ask whether new openness also could introduce new vulnerabilities to the network. These questions are important to understand whether open RAN will deliver on its national security promise.Of course, our network equipment is only as good as the spectrum it runs on. So we are not slowing down there either. Yesterday the FCC took decisive action to pivot to mid-band for 5G. We did that by adopting rules and auction procedures that will make 100 megahertz of prime mid-band spectrum in the 3.45-3.55 GHz band available for 5G this year. And we are tying this new spectrum to the most aggressive build-out obligations of any spectrum auctioned for 5G to date.This decision offers tremendous opportunity because during the past few years the United States was slow, relative to other countries, to recognize the importance of mid-band spectrum for 5G. This meant we were late to bring these airwaves to market. So mid-band spectrum has been the critical component that is missing, and our action here helps fix that.This is all progress we can be proud of. No talking back to the screen required. But we need to continue to talk about network security and the roll-out of 5G service at home and abroad. The opportunities for innovation are extraordinary. But the vulnerabilities this connectivity brings deserves attention--and I'm glad that CSIS is here to provide a forum for discussion. Because it's important for the United States to get this right. In fact, it is essential for our 5G leadership in a post-pandemic world.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7427245 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: March 20, 2021End of Document

China and India, to the shovels at the borderCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 7, 2021 SundayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 823 wordsBodyThe two most populous countries in the world are, moreover, two great rising powers with a rapid pace of growth: China and India, where 2.5 billion souls live, this is almost 40% of the world's population. Both nations have on their very wide border an area that has not yet been well defined, nor satisfactorily delimited: that of the Himalayan region.We are talking about 3,440 kilometers in which there is an atmosphere of tension between the military personnel of both nations that constantly patrol the conflict zone, thus starring in a rosary of violent incidents.Thanks to a bilateral agreement reached in 2020, military patrols in both countries are not equipped with firearms, but equipped with sticks and canes, as well as stones. The agreement referred to suggests that the incidents are not necessarily serious.Therefore, beatings and hand-to-hand combat between the two sides rarely result in fatalities, which, however, has just happened, for the first time since 1975. In the Indian state of Sikkim, in the disputed Tibet region.For the parties, it was only a "minor confrontation", which was resolved, as with most of them, by the local military commanders themselves, which for this purpose has already defined, with some degree of precision and good detail, careful protocols of operation.To further complicate operational difficulties, this long border has some parts that are located about 5,000 meters high. They are almost inaccessible, then, without special means and equipment.In particular, the so-called "Siliguri corridor", which communicates india's heart with its seven northern states, is of particular concern.THE LAST BATTLEThe last significant military confrontation in that conflicted region occurred in 1962, when the Chinese army directed a defeat, quickly and utterly unappealable, to India's military forces. Which would predictably happen again if, suddenly, a new violent episode burst. This is despite India having the tactical, at least theoretical advantage, of having a much higher territory than the one below, it seems to form part of China instead.In the midst of a harsh winter, which this year has been really fierce in that area, unfortunately tensions between the two countries have recently returned to growth.India is, moreover, preventing the marketing of hundreds of Chinese cyber products, including the popular application called: Tik-Tok, arguing that they are a threat to India's security and territorial integrity. Because the Chinese government, through its active state technology companies, would sucptitiously obtain reserved information, not counting - of course - on the knowledge, or authorization, of the country that is thus effectively spied on. What should always be taken into account, in all latitudes certainly. Between us, too.Both sides are actively building and modernizing their respective physical infrastructures, in order to try to improve or thus profile their sovereignty claims.The accumulation of decades of constant mistrust and suspicion has maintained - it is clear - tensions that could suddenly erupt border incidents of some magnitude between the two nations.Xi Jinping's government is - moreover - particularly jealous when it comes to dealing with territorial conflicts.THE PAKISTAN FACTORTo further complicate the difficult bilateral relationship, China has recently greatly strengthened its ties with Pakistan, a tough rival of India, supporting its claims in theKashmir region. The current relationship between China and Pakistan can therefore be described as a strategic alliance.  China has also greatly improved Pakistan's physical infrastructure and extended increasingly visible military support.  It is time, we believe, to consider adopting a package of confidence-building measures, in order to try to relax the relationship between China and India, which has become too harsh. For this there are already specific bilateral institutional mechanisms, which could certainly be better used. In this, the role of the United Nations (and in particular that of its Security Council) can also be very important.In a few more years India will not only be the most populous democracy in the world, but also the largest Muslim-majority democracy on the planet, thus defining a complex and distinct identity, which cannot fail to be taken into account in the concert of nations.  China and India are somehow partners and rivals today. India today has support on the international stage of the United States and Japan. China, on the other hand, with the backing of Russia, Thailand and Nepal.For the latter - and because of the presence in both nations of governments that can be described as heavy-handed - conflicts between China and India often take on a larger dimension than, perhaps, corresponds to the conflict or differing specificly, in itself. Which is quite a disturbing reality, which cannot fail to be highlighted and taken into account.Load-Date: February 8, 2021End of Document

California WeChat Users Sue Tencent Over Fear of Chinese CensorsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 11, 2021 MondayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 435 wordsBody(Bloomberg) -- A group of California WeChat users sued Tencent Holdings Ltd., the Chinese owner of the messaging and payment app, for allegedly violating their right to privacy by surveilling and censoring their communications.Citizen Power Initiatives for China, a group promoting transition to Democracy in China, and six anonymous WeChat users said comments made using WeChat that can be perceived as critical of the Chinese government have led to the users’ accounts being frozen, causing them to be cut of from friends and relatives in China as well as their business clients in the U.S.“All this chills constitutionally protected speech,” according to the complaint filed Friday in California state court in San Jose. “Indeed, many WeChat users have told CPIFC that they feel real fear that the Party-state or its agents will retaliate against them or their family, and that, as a result, they self-censor, despite the fact that they live in California.”WeChat is the most used social media app among Chinese-speaking people in part because China blocks other apps, such as Facebook and Twitter. It’s also essential for Chinese-speaking people in California who need it to communicate with friends and relatives in China as well as to do business within the Chinese-speaking community, according to the complaint.One of the anonymous California plaintiffs, a practitioner of traditional Chinese massage, allegedly had his WeChat account frozen for 42 days after he made a comment about the coronavirus pandemic last year, according to the complaint. As a result, he wasn’t able to communicate with his clients and lost about $500 a day, according to the complaint.“The experience left him a changed man,” CPIFC said. “He now feels a deep sense of fear when using WeChat, aware that one stray comment might result in a repeat of the foregoing events.”The Trump administration last year unsuccessfully sought to remove WeChat from mobile app stores in the U.S. and impose other restrictions that another U.S. users’ group said amounted to an outright ban. According to the administration, Tencent is intertwined with the Chinese Communist Party, which can use the app to collect users’ data and spy on them.The California WeChat users want to pursue their claims as a class action and seek a court order to allow them to use the app without politically motivated censorship and surveillance.Representatives of Tencent couldn’t be immediately reached for comment on the lawsuit.The case is Citizen Power Initiatives for China v. Tencent America LLC, 21CV375169, California Superior Court, County of Santa Clara.Load-Date: January 12, 2021End of Document

The Nasdaq Composite (-2.7%), which has greater exposure to these names, dropped 2.7%. The Russell 2000 declined 1.1%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.4%.Long-term interest rates moved higher partly due to lingering growth optimism and pestering inflation concerns. The 10-yr yield rose six basis points to 1.47%, although it settled below its intraday high of 1.50% and well below last week's high of 1.61%. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 0.14%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.2% to 90.96.Growth optimism was linked to new expectations from the Biden administration to have vaccines available for every adult by the end of May, versus prior guidance of July. Inflation concerns stemmed from the February ISM Non-Manufacturing Index showing the Prices Index rise to 71.8% from 64.2% in January.As it pertained to equities, the higher rates worked against the growth stocks within the S&P 500 information technology (-2.5%), consumer discretionary (-2.4%), and communication services (-1.6%) sectors. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fell 3.1%, the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF (MGK 199.71, -5.32, -2.6%) fell 2.6%, and the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK 125.11, -8.40, -6.3%) fell 6.3%.On the flip side, the gains in the cyclical energy (+1.4%), financials (+0.8%), and industrials (+0.1%) sectors were symptomatic of a rotational interest as investors sought areas with direct exposure to the economy. Financial stocks additionally benefited from the curve-steepening activity in the Treasury market; energy stocks followed oil prices ($61.31, +1.52, +2.5%) higher.Lyft (LYFT 61.76, +4.70, +8.2%) contributed to the so-called reopening thesis after raising its Q1 adjusted EBITDA loss expectation to $135 million from $145-150 million and observing that average daily ride-shares were up 4% m/m in February despite severe weather. LYFT shares rose 8%.A separate note on inflation, the Fed's Beige Book for economic activity in February highlighted that "several districts reported anticipating modest price increases over the next several months." Chicago Fed President Evans (FOMC voter) said he doesn't see inflation as a risk at this point. These observations might have tempered any inflation angst.For what it's worth, the S&P 500 closed just above its 50-day moving average (3818) despite a weak finish.Reviewing Wednesday's economic data:The ISM Non-Manufacturing Index fell to 55.3% in February (Briefing.com consensus 58.6%) from 58.7% in January. The dividing line between expansion and contraction is 50.0%. The February reading marks the ninth straight month of growth for the services sector, but it is the slowest pace since May 2020.The key takeaway from the report for a market focusing increased attention on inflation trends, as economic activity picks up, is the upward move in the Prices Index to 71.8% from 64.2% in January. This elevated reading follows on the heels of Monday's ISM Manufacturing Index, which showed the Prices Index at its highest level (86.0%) since May 2008.The ADP Employment Change report estimated 117,000 jobs were added to private-sector payrolls in February (Briefing.com consensus +180,000) following an upwardly revised 195,000 increase (from 174,000) in January.The IHS Markit Services PMI for February was revised higher to 59.8 from 58.3 in the preliminary reading.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index increased 0.5% following a 11.4% drop in the prior week.Looking ahead, investors will receive the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report, the revised Q4 readings for Productivity and Unit Labor Costs, and Factory Orders for January on Thursday.Russell 2000 +11.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +2.2% YTDS&P 500 +1.7% YTDNasdaq Composite +0.9% YTD16:23SHO Sunstone Hotel announces retirement of COO Marc Hoffman (12.60 +0.10)Sunstone Hotel Investors today announced the retirement of Marc Hoffman, EVP & COO.

Treasuries started the day with losses across the curve, continuing their retreat through the first couple hours of action. The early selling took place after an upbeat overnight session and it was paced by the 10-yr note and the 30-yr bond. The opening downdraft lifted the 30-yr yield above its high from Friday, but that's where the selling abated. The 30-yr bond bounced off its low, pressuring its yield below its opening level while shorter tenors underperformed, holding the bulk of their losses into the close. The intraday strength in longer tenors was owed to a growing sense that Fed Chairman Powell will hint at another operation twist when he speaks at tomorrow's virtual Wall Street Journal jobs summit. This policy tool, which would involve selling shorter-term debt and buying longer term notes and bonds with the proceeds, was last utilized in 2012. The U.S. Dollar Index backed off its intraday high in the afternoon, but still climbed 0.2% to 90.93. Yield Check: 2-yr: +2 bps to 0.14% 3-yr: +5 bps to 0.29% 5-yr: +5 bps to 0.73% 10-yr: +6 bps to 1.47% 30-yr: +4 bps to 2.25%News: The Fed's Beige Book for February noted that economic activity in most districts expanded at a modest pace during the first six weeks of 2021. Leisure and hospitality remained weak while manufacturing activity improved. Commercial real estate worsened while home prices continued climbing in most districts. Employment levels rose at a slow pace while demand for labor varied significantly by industry. Input costs rose with steel and lumber prices leading the way. Chicago Fed President (FOMC voter) Evans said he does not see a need to respond to the recent rise in yields, but he acknowledged that the average maturity of bond purchases could be extended. Bloomberg reported that former President Trump is considering another run in 2024 with a different candidate for VP. Expectations are mounting for the People's Bank of China to lower the reserve requirement ratio for some banks later this month. Australia's Treasurer acknowledged that massive stimulus measures around the world are creating risks to financial stability. The French Banking Federation is reportedly lobbying for a law to move euro clearinghouses from the City of London. Bundesbank President Weidmann said that extended lockdowns in Q2 would delay the region's recovery and that Germany's domestic economy is strong enough to withstand the weak phase.

Today's Data: The ISM Non-Manufacturing Index fell to 55.3% in February (Briefing.com consensus 58.6%) from 58.7% in January. The dividing line between expansion and contraction is 50.0%. The February reading marks the ninth straight month of growth for the services sector, but it is the slowest pace since May 2020. The key takeaway from the report for a market focusing increased attention on inflation trends, as economic activity picks up, is the upward move in the Prices Index to 71.8% from 64.2% in January. This elevated reading follows on the heels of Monday's ISM Manufacturing Index, which showed the Prices Index at its highest level (86.0%) since May 2008.

Last quarter, Ciena reported results at 7am ET, so it's likely that's when the company will report this quarter.The CapitalIQ consensus for non-GAAP EPS is $0.45 and for revenue it's $750.2 mln (Dec 10 guidance: $735-765 mln, which was below consensus at the time). Of note, Ciena typically guides for revenue for the next quarter on the call. In terms of performance relative to consensus, CIEN has reported an EPS miss in two of the past five quarters, including a $0.03 miss in Q4 (Oct). That followed two huge beats of $0.24 each in the prior two quarters. As such, Ciena has been pretty hit-or-miss lately. Ciena consistently reports revenue upside although the upside is usually pretty modest and that was the case again in Q4. Of note, CIEN has guided revenue below consensus in each of the past four quarters, so be careful on the call tomorrow morning. So why have the results/guidance been so weak?While the pandemic and working from home have increased demand for bandwidth as network traffic grows, Ciena has not been a primary beneficiary. Specifically, service providers generally are risk adverse for any sort of new business (new networks, new architectures). Instead, they are running their current networks "hotter." Also, these customers are more focused on access points as opposed to the metro and the core, which is understandable but that hurts Ciena. Ciena's current view is that the pandemic will hurt orders in the first half of FY21, but then Ciena's pipeline of new activity will kick in the second half of the fiscal year. Ciena is confident about this because secular demand for things like 5G needs this network infrastructure to be successful. In sum, investors are right to be cautious heading into this Q1 report and guidance. Ciena's business is normally fiscally second half loaded, but it's going to be a more extreme hockey stick this year. As such, expect rocky results in Q1 and Q2. We think investors will be focusing on whether Ciena maintains its excitement about orders improving in 2HFY21. But if the can gets kicked down the road into FY22, investors will not be happy.

Revenue is expected to grow 33% yr/yr to $222 mln. Okta tends to guides for EPS and revs for the net quarter. Okta has surely benefited from the shift to remote working/learning as thousands of companies have had to adapt quickly, allowing employees to easily connect and collaborate with colleagues. Additionally, as web and app traffic surged, companies have needed to modernize and strengthen their security and identity posture. In terms of Okta's customer base, the vast majority of sales is generated from large enterprise customers. Based on earnings reports from others, enterprise spending has held up pretty well. It's the small business (SMB) segment that has been weaker but Okta has only limited exposure to SMB side. In terms of what to expect, Okta has been very consistent relative to consensus estimates, having reported EPS upside each quarter since making its IPO debut in April 2017. Bottom line, while we're not in the earnings prediction business, it would be a nice milestone for Okta if it could report another profitable quarter. Since going public, Okta had reported losses each quarter but has reported profits in each of the past two quarters. Investors may be having some doubts about the quarter as the stock is sharply lower today and has been trending lower since mid-February. High multiple tech stocks in general have been weak, but the trading action may signal some concern about tonight's earnings or guidance.

The S&P 500 (-0.3%) and Nasdaq Composite (-1.3%) are on the losing end of the trade, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.3%) and Russell 2000 (+0.3%) are on the winning side.From a sector perspective, the information technology sector (-1.4%) is the most influential laggard with a 1.4% decline amid a rise in long-term interest rates. The cyclical energy (+3.1%), financials (+2.1%), and industrials (+1.0%) sectors have provided some offsetting support with strong gains amid some curve-steepening activity and higher oil prices ($61.72, +1.97, +3.3%).The 10-yr yield is up six basis points to 1.48%, while the 2-yr yield is up two basis points to 0.15%. Rates are up because of lingering growth expectations and inflation angst.Growth optimism has keyed off expectations from the White House to have vaccines available for every adult by the end of May, versus prior guidance of July. The inflation angst has been exacerbated by the Price Index within the February ISM Services PMI rising to 71.8% from 64.2% in January. The headline Non-Manufacturing Index fell to 55.3% in February (Briefing.com consensus 58.6%) from 58.7% in January.In other words, unlike last week when the market was pinned down by rising rates, the market this time around is appreciating the good side of the rate narrative. This has been showcased by the strength in cyclical stocks, but it's hard to gain ground when the heavily-weighted growth stocks are hurting from rotational and valuation-oriented pressures.The iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD 147.31, +1.01, +0.7%) is up 0.7%, versus a 1.6% decline in the iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF (IWF 238.61, -3.75, -1.6%)Shares of Lyft (LYFT 62.47, +5.36, +9.4%), meanwhile, are up 9% after the company raised its Q1 adjusted EBITDA loss expectation to $135 million from $145-150 million and observed that average daily ride-shares were up 4% m/m in February despite severe weather.Reviewing today's economic data:The ISM Non-Manufacturing Index fell to 55.3% in February (Briefing.com consensus 58.6%) from 58.7% in January. The dividing line between expansion and contraction is 50.0%. The February reading marks the ninth straight month of growth for the services sector, but it is the slowest pace since May 2020.The key takeaway from the report for a market focusing increased attention on inflation trends, as economic activity picks up, is the upward move in the Prices Index to 71.8% from 64.2% in January. This elevated reading follows on the heels of Monday's ISM Manufacturing Index, which showed the Prices Index at its highest level (86.0%) since May 2008.The ADP Employment Change report estimated 117,000 jobs were added to private-sector payrolls in February (Briefing.com consensus +180,000) following an upwardly revised 195,000 increase (from 174,000) in January.The IHS Markit Services PMI for February was revised higher to 59.8 from 58.3 in the preliminary reading.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index increased 0.5% following a 11.4% drop in the prior week.12:54SUMRX Earnings Out This Afternoon/Tomorrow MorningThis Afternoon: AEO DSGX MRVL OKTA RRGB SNOW SQM SPLK TCOM VRM YEXTTomorrow Morning: AZUL BZUN BJ BURL CNQ CRAI CIEN GCP GMS JW.A KR MEI MIK PRPL SDGR FOUR TTC12:45SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Asensus Surgical (TRXC) gains on additional FDA clearance for Senhance Surgical Ssystem -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersVRTV (42.1 +67.06%): Reported Q4 results. Net sales decreased 10.5% yr/yr to $1.6 bln; adj. EBITDA increased +30.7% yr/yr to $61.7 mln while diluted EPS rose yr/yr to $1.90 from $0.21. Co's 2020 Restructuring Plan remains on schedule and on target. Co expects FY21 revs to be relatively flat yr/yr, with revs expected to be unfavorably impacted by COVID-19 during the first half of the year across all segments, with the exception of Packaging, and with a broader economic rebound expected in the second half of the year. Approved a $50 mln stock repurchase program. At two-year highs. TRXC (4.98 +27.04%): Received additional FDA clearance for the Senhance Surgical System, allowing for indication expansion in general surgery in the US; the system, said co, can now be used in many high-value, complex reconstructive surgeries, such as those used to treat obesity and reflux. OCGN (11.99 +24.88%): Co's COVID-19 vaccine co-development partner, Bharat Biotech, announced results from the first interim analysis (based on 43 cases) of its Phase 3 study of COVAXIN, reporting that COVAXIN demonstrated a vaccine efficacy of 81%.

MILE (12.66 -11.81%): Pulls back to its lowest levels since December on higher than average volume; the stock has now moved lower by approx. 37% through the last two weeks after reaching record highs in mid-February.12:34SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (255) outpacing new lows (7) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: AA, ABCB, AERI, AIN, ALGT, ALLY, AMBA, AMCX, AOS, ARCB, ARCC, ARD, ARMK, ATKR, AVNT, AX, AXP, BCEI, BECN, BG, BHC, BJRI, BKU, BLMN, BOKF, BRC, BRK.B, BRKL, BUSE, BWA, BXS, BY, BYD, C, CADE, CAKE, CAR, CASH, CBRL, CBZ, CDEV, CENX, CFB, CFFN, CGBD, CHDN, CIR, CIT, CLBK, CLMT, CLR, CMC, CMCSA, CNDT, CNOB, CNTY, CNX, COF, COOP, CPA, CPE, CR, CTB, CVX, CZR, DAKT, DAN, DCP, DELL, DFIN, DISCA, DRI, DRNA, DVN, DX, EB, EBSB, EFSC, EGBN, ETN, EVR, FANG, FBNC, FBP, FCF, FDUS, FIBK, FIVE, FIX, FLOW, FMBI, FOE, FRBK, FTAI, FULT, FUN, FWRD, GBCI, GCO, GDEN, GE, GEF, GHL, GIII, GNK, GPC, GPRE, GRPN, GS, GT, GVA, GWB, HCKT, HEES, HESM, HFC, HFWA, HMST, HOMB, HONE, HOPE, HPE, HTGC, HTH, HTLF, HWC, IBCP, IBOC, IGT, IHRT, IMAX, IMKTA, INMD, IPG, ISBC, ITRI, JCI, JEF, JLL, JPM, JYNT, KFRC, KRNY, KTB, LBAI, LEA, LEVI, LKFN, LKQ, LPLA, LSTR, LTRPA, LVS, LXFR, LYB, LYFT, LYV, MATW, MCY, MDP, MGTA, MHK, MIK, MMYT, MNRO, MO, MOD, MPC, MPLX, MS, MSGN, MTDR, MTZ, MX, NBHC, NDLS, NEWT, NFG, NR, NTB, NXST, OCFC, ODFL, OMC, OMP, ORCL, PAG, PARR, PEB, PFLT, PH, PLAY, PPBI, PQG, PRIM, PTGX, PXD, QEP, REVG, RGP, RILY, RL, RMNI, RRGB, RRR, RS, SAIA, SANM, SASR, SBCF, SBH, SBSI, SCHW, SEM, SFBS, SFNC, SIG, SLCA, SM, SNA, SRI, SSP, ST, SYF, SYY, TBBK, TBK, THC, TOWN, TPX, TRIP, UAA, UBSI, ULTA, UMBF, UMH, UNM, URBN, UVSP, VIAC, VLY, VOYA, VRA, WBS, WES, WMB, WOR, WOW, WRK, WSBC, WTFC, WW, WYNN, XEC, XPERStocks that traded to 52 week lows: ATNX, EPZM, ICPT, KPTI, LLNW, STRA, VYGRThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: ABTX, ACBI, AMAL, AVD, BANF, BBSI, BMTC, BVH, BWB, BXG, CAC, CHCO, CSTR, CTBI, EQBK, FCNCA, FMNB, GABC, GFN, HTBI, IPAR, MEC, MOFG, MSBI, MTRN, NNI, NPO, OBNK, OSBC, OXM, PFBC, PGC, PLUS, QCRH, RM, SLCT, SMBK, SONA, SRCE, STXB, SXI, TCBK, THFF, TMP, UFI, UHAL, ULH, VEC, VRTS, VRTV, WHF, WTBAETFs that traded to 52 week highs: BJK, IAI, XLF12:03NS NuStar Energy announces a plan to develop incremental pipeline capacity that will allow for the delivery of approximately 6,000 barrels per day of additional refined products, including gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, into the Albuquerque, NM region (19.49 +0.42)Project to increase flow of refined fuels into region while increasing pipeline efficiency and environmental performance.NuStar will upgrade pump stations on a pipeline system it jointly owns with Phillips 66 Partners (PSXP) that transports refined products from Amarillo, Texas to Albuquerque.

As part of the accelerated transformation program, the Company is also removing thousands of under-performing labels, brands and products across the core destination categories which account for the majority of its assortment.11:18NTP Nam Tai Property confirms court ruling; intends to exercise its right to appeal the decision (11.20 +1.73)On March 3, 2021, the Court handed down a judgment holding that the private placement previously announced by the Company on October 5, 2020 was void and should be set aside, and that the Company shall convene a special meeting of shareholders regarding the election of directors as soon as possible.

The 10-yr note yield is up six basis points to 1.48%, riding there on steady selling interest that began overnight and continued past the open for the stock market.That move has generated some reflexive trading action in the stock market, which has featured the underperformance of growth stocks and the outperformance of reopening plays. The resulting connection is that the broader market is mixed.Within the S&P 500, the biggest losers are the utilities (-1.6%), health care (-1.1%), and information technology (-0.9%) sectors, the latter of which is having the most impact given that it is the most heavily-weighted sector in the S&P 500. Conversely, strength in the energy (+1.7%), financial (+1.7%), and industrials (+0.6%) sectors is helping to offset some of those losses.The Nasdaq Composite (-0.8%), weighed down by weakness in many of its largest components, is trailing behind.The S&P 500 (-0.2%) for its part remains confined in the 3800-3900 band where it has traded largely since the beginning of February. At 3861, it is in the upper portion of that trading band.The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.3%; the Russell 2000 is up 0.1%; and the CBOE Volatility Index is up 5.7% to 25.48.10:57SUMRX Economic SummaryEconomic Data Summary:Weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index 0.5%; Prior -11.4% February ADP Employment Change 117K (Briefing.com consensus 180K); Prior revised to 195K from 174KGoods-producing: -14,000Service-providing: 131,000Small businesses: 32,000Medium businesses: 57,000Large businesses: 28,000February IHS Markit Services PMI - Final 59.8; Prior 58.3 February ISM Non-Manufacturing Index 55.3% (Briefing.com consensus 58.6%); Prior 58.7%The key takeaway from the report for a market focusing increased attention on inflation trends, as economic activity picks up, is the upward move in the Prices Index to 71.8% from 64.2% in January.

C3.ai (AI 98.50, -22.55, -18.6%), a smaller growth stock, dropped 19% after earnings.Target (TGT 173.49, -12.60, -6.8%) had similar price action to Zoom, with shares giving up an early 4% gain and closing lower by 7% despite reporting strong quarterly results.Other headwinds for the market included technical resistance at the 3900 level for the S&P 500, media reports continuing to highlight emerging coronavirus variants, and their potential resistance to vaccines, and China's top banking regulator warning about elevated valuations of global equity markets.The Covid-variant reports might have overshadowed news that businesses in Texas will open at 100% capacity and that indoor dining in Chicago will expand to 50% capacity from 40%. Regrading valuations, Fed Governor Brainard (FOMC voter) acknowledged that are some signs of stretched asset valuations, but she didn't think they are broad-based.Ms. Brainard added that last week's slide in Treasuries caught her eye and that conditions for tapering bond purchases will not be met for "some time."

Anti-bitcoin: China advances eYuan tests, a cryptocurrency to increase control over citizensCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 18, 2021 ThursdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 539 wordsBodyThe main objective of the creator of bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, was to create an anonymous currency, without anyone controlling or supervising operations, to support a libertarian view of the economy. Using similar mechanisms, the Chinese government is preparing the opposite: the 'eYuan', a cryptocurrency controlled by the Central Bank that allows the country's authorities to know all the transactions of all its citizens, minute by minute. And their trials are already advancing in several cities.In the areas where testing is taking place, local governments have distributed millions of digital yuan among their citizens, in New Year's gifts or in lotteries, according to the Financial Times. In order to access this money, a digital wallet must be downloaded, which is in constant connection with the country's authorities. Every operation carried out by citizens will be recorded. A 'Big Brother' looking inside the purse of everyone in the country. According to the Government, it will be to avoid cases of "corruption, laundering or financing of terrorism". For a state so obsessed with control over its citizens, any new way to monitor everything all its inhabitants do is welcome.Beijing's goal is that these tests will improve the functioning of the system and correct any weaknesses or failures to launch it widely for the 2022 Winter Olympics in the Chinese capital. An event in which they will be able to present their advances to the world public and, if successful, offer their technology as a basis to the rest of the world.The idea would be for this 'cryptoyuan' to end up definitively replacing all payment mechanisms. No cash, no checks, no cards: mobile payments, by reading QR codes or fast transfers, would become managed and controlled by the state. And it would not be necessary to have phones permanently connected: it would be possible to make 'offline' transactions that were then added to the central register, when one of the participants had a connection.This revolution would pose an existential threat to payment providers, especially the large duopoly that dominates the Chinese market, WeChat and Alipay. A public service that replaces its functions and must be accepted by all retailers and users would make its applications redundant. Why move eYuanes from the Government app to the Alipay app, if both offer the same thing? Why mess with two different and separate services when everyone uses the same state app?Up to 60 central banks would be working on a version of their ownNot only that, but the fact that the central bank controls the money of all citizens will also be a paradigm shift in traditional banking. Although the eYuan can be deposited into bank accounts for use, the fact that it can remain in the app's state account will mean that banks will have to look for new ways to attract citizens' deposits, or rely even more on the central bank's liquidity.According to data from the Bank for International Payments, up to 60 central banks would be working on a version of their currencies in digital format. Cambodia, a neighboring former communist dictatorship in China, has already put its own into operation by the end of 2020.commentsforum0WhatsApp  FacebookTwitter  Linkedin       Load-Date: February 19, 2021End of Document

I'm Dagen McDowell from Maria Bartiromo. It's Friday January 8th, your top stories at 6:00 a.m. Eastern.Back on Twitter. President Trump comes back from his Twitter time out, posting a video message one day after the riots on Capitol Hill. He condemned Wednesday's violence, while promising a peaceful transition of power to a new administration on January 20th. This as, more of his cabinet members walk out, leave with less than two weeks to go in the administration.We're talking about this all morning long. We hear from Florida Congressman Michael Waltz, former Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman, and Ohio Congressman Brad Wenstrup.Meantime, it is Jobs Friday. The December jobs report out at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time. Here's what Futures are doing ahead of that report. You can see gains across the board. This follows another record setting day on Wall Street. All three major market gauges finishing at all-time highs.Investor putting hopes on stimulus and a new Blue Senate, again more spending lifting stocks. See how the markets performed yesterday, at 2.5 percent gain on the NASDAQ.Helping California, Governor Gavin Newsom proposing an additional stimulus check for his state residents, the impact on a state already facing a budget shortfall.And Kimye crumbles. We break down the potential billion dollar divorce of Kanye West and Kim Kardashian West.And oh, what a night, David Hasselhoff is ready to part ways with his Knight Rider friend KITT, that's, K.I.T.T.And maybe a special delivery to you, "The morning Buzz" is ahead. "Mornings with Maria" live right now.European markets are mixed at the moment, a slight loss in England, but gains in France and Germany. And Asia overnight, markets moving mostly to the plus side, the only loser there the Shanghai Composite. The South Korea, Hong Kong and the Nikkei in Japan all gaining.Some of the top stories we're following this morning. President Trump speaking out against the violence on Capitol Hill in his return to Twitter. Cheryl Casone has more. Cheryl?CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: That's right, Dagen. Good morning to you. President Trump releasing his strongest condemnation yet of the chaos on Capitol Hill and says there will be a peaceful transition of power to a new administration on January 20th.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Like all Americans, I am outraged by the violence, lawlessness and mayhem. The demonstrators who infiltrated the Capitol have defiled the seat of American democracy. To those who engage in the acts of violence and destruction, you do not represent our country. And to those who broke the law, you will pay. My focus now turns to ensuring a smooth, orderly and seamless transition of power. This moment calls for healing and reconciliation.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: The video message was tweeted out last night, shortly after his 12 hour banned from Twitter was lifted. Many social media companies have already barred the president from their platforms. Facebook says that ban is indefinite for both Facebook and Instagram.Meanwhile, President-elect Joe Biden calling those who stormed the Capitol two days ago, domestic terrorists, saying that the riot was "One of the darkest days in our nation." He laid the blame on President Trump for inciting the violence and said he would make - passing a law to combat domestic terrorism a priority.Well, a Capitol Police officer has died after reportedly being hit in the head with a fire extinguisher Wednesday during that attack. Officer Brian Sicknick collapsed after returning to his office. He died at the hospital last night.This, as Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund announced his resignation amid criticism of the department's response to the riots. He will step down January 16th.Well, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos becomes the second Trump cabinet member to resign over the Capitol Hill riots. She follows Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao who also resigned. This comes amid a push led by Democratic leaders to persuade Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment and remove President Trump from office.And, finally, more than 4,000 deaths from COVID reported yesterday, the deadliest day since the start of the pandemic in March of last year. This brings the total to more than 353,000 deaths in the United States.There is a bright spot, though. Pfizer and BioNTech scientists say their vaccine appears to be working against key mutation and the more contagious U.K. variant of COVID. And as for the Moderna vaccine, CEO Stephane Bancel says the vaccine is likely to offer protection from the virus for up to a couple of years, Dagen.Ending it with a little bit of good news on what's been a very dark week. Back to you.MCDOWELL: Thank you so much, Cheryl Casone, we'll see you at the bottom of the hour.Markets pointing to gains ahead of the opening bell at 9:30 a.m. Eastern time. We've got that jobs report that comes out an hour before the opening bell. Investors keeping an eye as a big technology stocks continue to lead the way. The December jobs report, again, out in about two and a half hours. Economists are expecting that just 71,000 jobs were added last month with the unemployment rate ticking up to 6.8 percent.Joining me now is Potomac Wealth Advisors President and Founder Mark Avallone, and joining the conversation all morning long, Wall Street Journal Assistant Editorial Page Editor James Freeman; and the King's College in Manhattan, Professor of Business and Economics, Fox News Contributor, Brian Brenberg. I'm really excited for you, gentlemen to be here all morning.And I said that to one of our producers before the show, because I value the way that you think and the way that you express yourself, so nice to see Brian and James Freeman. Mark in your outlook, you say business efficiency will rise post pandemic, what does that mean for jobs, and the way that you're betting on companies here?MARK AVALLONE, POTOMAC WEALTH ADVISORS PRESIDENT AND FOUNDER: Well, a lot of the focus on stocks rising is the Federal Reserve and easy money and trillions on the sideline, and that's true.But if we look beyond that, and we look at the way corporations are structured now, we have low energy costs, low interest rates, the low unemployment creates low wage pressure. The increased use of technology is also making businesses more efficient. And it makes less pressure for wages, because the technology is replacing people.So on the one hand, all of these phenomenons are good for companies, good for corporate earnings, earnings drive stock prices. The unfortunate part is the lack of labor demand lowers the demand for wages. And the last four years we saw wages finally rise to about 3 percent annually. Don't expect that to happen. So it's not going to be a good environment for workers.When you add on to that the impacts of globalism, the return of globalism from the Biden administration, we're going to see lower cost jobs again move overseas, and it will impact the labor market. So that could be the downside to what's actually helping some corporate profits now.MCDOWELL: James Freeman?JAMES FREEMAN, WALL STREET JOURNAL, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR: Oh, thanks. Mark, I think a lot of people have been wondering this week why stocks keep rising, even as we see these disturbing events in Washington, even during the protests that ended up over running the Capitol, but markets were up for the day. What's going on here?AVALLONE: Well, there's always a disconnect between what's happening in the political arena and Wall Street. The market is driven by the prospects for future earnings, low interest rates, outlooks on inflation, and factors like that. It's not who's in the White House. It's only when there would be an extreme policy shift or a dramatic change.Now, we saw some favorable response in the last administration to the tax cut, because it was a monumental tax bill. We'll see what the Biden administration rolls out. Right now there's optimism, because what's coming - what's going to come out of Washington is spending, a huge stimulus bill. Money drives prices.So that's where the top line disconnect of, "Oh, there's chaos in Washington." Yes, perhaps for a few days. But what's really coming out of Washington is candy for the stock market and that's what's driving stock prices higher.MCDOWELL: Brian Brenberg, answer - yes, answer James's question, Brian, because I'm getting that from even family members.BRIAN BRENBERG, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes.MCDOWELL: Just want to know what what's going on? Part of what I see - well, one, markets don't really know what the bigger picture agenda will be from the Biden administration. It could be negative for stocks, negative for corporate earnings if you raise taxes on corporations, as Biden has promised to 28 percent. We'll see how that plays out.But, also, I saw a system - the riots were horrible, just horrific. But you saw a system - our democratic system still functioning. You saw Mike Pence stand up there and abide by his constitutional duty and not follow the orders of President Trump. So at the end of it all, the system is still in place, and it works.BRENBERG: Yes, I think there's some kind of confidence around the transition happening and getting through that Dagen, I agree with you. But I also think markets are just really short term right now. I just think they're very focused on a big stimulus coming in, and they're really focused on the Fed basically saying, we're going to print money indefinitely.And so, investors look at those two things, and they say, "oh, money sloshing around. This is going to be great, a lot of juice for the economy." But they're not thinking about the regulatory picture. They're not thinking about the kind of burden that places on businesses. I get worried about that as somebody looking at labor markets, looking at hiring, but investors just seek cash right now and that's what they're putting their money into.MCDOWELL: James, did I interrupt you? Were you going to follow up?FREEMAN: Oh, thanks. Well, I was just going to follow up, I guess for Mark on Brian's point here. Should we take away that investors think that massive government spending is the long-term way to grow the economy? Or are they just thinking 2021 is going to be a big year given all the money in the system?AVALLONE: Well, Brian mentioned the word short term thinking right now. And short term thinking is carrying the day. And when Dagen asked about the disconnect on Main Street from Wall Street, look, Main Street got crushed by the government shutdowns. You couldn't go to a florist, but you could get your flowers at a Target or grocery store.The big chains won out, the tech companies won out, the work-from-home using new infrastructure and ordering computers, and increasing Apple sales, that's what won out, that's the disconnect. Main Street, where people live, work is feeling the brunt of this.In terms of the investing, that's where the dollars are flowing. So on the one hand, it's short term thinking tons of money from the Fed. But underlying all this are fundamental shifts in the economy, so I don't want to be too cynical.We started out talking about how businesses are adapting, being more efficient, they're going to find ways that the new administration may raise corporate taxes, they may not go back up to where they were pre-Trump administration, but they're going to go back up.But American corporations are resilient, and I do think there's a legitimate reason for some of the push up in stock prices. Maybe it's a little exuberant now. We might see a little volatility. But let's not think this is a 2000 style bubble, because I don't believe it is.MCDOWELL: Mark Avallone, good to see you. Thank you so much for being here.We're just getting started this morning. Coming up, that Kim-Kanye fallout, we're looking at who gets what in the potential billion dollar divorce.Next hour we preview the December jobs report and Bitcoin big bounce and the word on Wall Street. Then Florida Congressman Michael Waltz talks the changing balance of power in Washington. Former Connecticut Senator and Vice Presidential Candidate Joe Lieberman discusses Joe Biden's cabinet picks, his outlook on the incoming administration.In the 8:00 o'clock hour Ohio Congressman Brad Wenstrup talks the legislative agenda as Democrats get ready to take control. Don't miss a moment of it.You're watching "Mornings with Maria" live on Fox Business.MCDOWELL: Your "Morning Mover". Tesla, shares on the rise again this morning, up almost 4 percent. The gains helping Elon Musk surpass Jeff Bezos as the world's richest person. Musk now has a personal net worth of around $195 billion, up by 30 billion in just a year. Matt (ph) our station manager is shaking his head, as we all are.Now to the balance of power in Congress as lawmakers get ready for a Blue House, a Blue Senate and a Blue White House. Progressives could have more sway in the halls of Congress. "Squad" members Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib have already have been reappointed to the House Oversight and Reform Committee, as Bernie Sanders is poised to Chair the Senate Budget Committee.This, as the incoming Biden administration aims to increase taxes and spending, introduce, reintroduce regulations galore. Joining me now Commentary Writer at "The Washington Examiner" Tiana Lowe. Do we have again much reregulation and much spending is in store Tiana?TIANA LOWE, THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER COMMENTARY WRITER: Good morning Dagen. Yes. I mean, in some way this is the worst case scenario for Republicans or even anyone two inches to the right of Kyrsten Sinema. But it's also the best worst case scenario.You have Kamala as a swing vote, so you know you're not going to get any of the nonsense Hyde Amendment revocation, because you have still sort of conservative Democrats like Joe Manchin who will block it. But, yes, it does mean that a literal socialist will be in charge of the Budget Committee in the form of Bernie Sanders.MCDOWELL: James Freeman to you on this. Again, it comes down to what can the Senate do with just a simple majority. In "The Wall Street Journal" editorial page, who you write for, has talked about this at length about you can raise taxes, and you can easily reintroduce regulations.And I'll just point to Ron Wyden, who could be running the Finance Committee, he wants to tax gains and capital assets every year as if they're not sold. That's a wealth confiscation.FREEMAN: Yes. And so Tiana mentioned a literal socialist in charge of the Budget Committee, it makes me wonder. I guess, I don't know, Tiana, if you have a sense of how big are we talking in terms of the spending? The Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, they're speaking as if the nation is in a deep crisis, and a big federal response is necessary.We're going to find out today with the jobs report, what the progress is, obviously, a big rebound since the spring. As they kind of set the table for what they hope is a massive spending bill in Washington, do you have any sense of how big we're talking about?LOWE: So I don't know the scope James. But what I do know is that sources I'm talking to on the Hill, including incoming House members on the Right, they do feel a public pressure to include more spending in terms of what's permissible, frankly, because of what happened yesterday - the tragedy.But also because, Trump was the one who's advocating for the $2,000 sort of half means tested checks. So they do have a sense that they will have to comply with some of the spending measures. It can't be anything under the guise of the Green New Deal.But anything for "stimulus," when really a lot of these representatives know the real stimulus will be unlocking the economy all of Florida, which has the - what 25th highest death rate of coronavirus versus California. which currently has ICUs overridden with coronavirus.MCDOWELL: Well, James, before we go, we're going to see bailouts clearly of these Blue states. They've been pushing for this. They were suffering budget problems. We're going to talk about it in the next block with you and Brian.But, Nancy Pelosi, Don't forget, she tried to lift the state and local tax to - get rid of the cap on state and local tax deductions in a rescue bill that the Democrats passed in the House last May. So, again, you're going to see money going from Red states to bailout Blue states, and that's really clear, don't you think?FREEMAN: Yes. And I think this is really a moment where people who don't want this sort of stimulus year of 2020 to become a permanent part of our government until there's some sort of financial reckoning to say, the economy has actually bounced back quite a bit. If you reopen that's a great stimulus and we have vaccine. So we don't we don't need a Manhattan Project, I would say, but that's the way Joe Biden is talking.MCDOWELL: I shake my head. We'll see how big it is. I do know that there's going to be a giant infrastructure bill, something that President Obama talked about in literally every economic speech that he gave, so lots of potholes to fill, I suppose. Tiana Lowe great to see. Thank you so much.LOWE: Thank you Dagen.MCDOWELL: Coming up, more stimulus with no money. California Governor Gavin Newsom's new plan that has some wondering how he's going to pay for it.Plus, a $1 billion at stake, we'll take you inside the financial Fallout, as Kim Kardashian and Kanye West had for divorce.MCDOWELL: The Golden State seeking stimulus, Governor Gavin Newsom wants to give out more COVID relief proposing a $600 state stimulus for residents with incomes of less than $30,000. This includes money for undocumented households. Brian, what do you think?BRENBERG: It's the old formula. "Hey, you can't work. We're not going to let you work, but here have $600. I hope that helps you." I mean, that that's like the strategy going out in California right now. They don't even have the money to spend on this $600.And the state's got no long term strategy for its economy. I mean, I saw a poll just recently one in four Californians considering leaving the state because they just can't hack it. The cost of living is too high, the opportunities aren't there. I mean, California has got a problem. And they're trying to solve it with this lamebrain $600 stimulus. When is this going to end? When are going to get back to actually creating economies that work instead of just handing out cash?MCDOWELL: Well, and James, this goes to what you were talking about, let people work. Let bit restaurants operate outdoors in Los Angeles County and vaccinate people and these governments are failing at this.FREEMAN: Yes, and I understand there's a school of thought that $2,000 checks won the Georgia Senate races, and the $600 in California, maybe related to our earlier discussion, Gavin Newsom is going to be asking Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer for that money. But it does - Brian pointed out, it sort of raises the question as well.600 why not 6,000? Why not 60,000? Why not 600,000? Obviously, this is not the source of wealth. We need people working and serving and making things and marketing things and distributing things, and that's the real economy we need to get back to.The failures of states to get the vaccines into arms is our biggest problem right now, I would say. And so I would hope that's where the governor's focus is.MCDOWELL: James, do you think, though, that - because it looks like that there is this rolling boulder that is we're heading very quickly toward a socialist state where more and more Americans are dependent on the government. The government plays a greater role in all of our lives, or maybe not, because - and I'm divided.Because if you look at how local politicians and state politicians like here in New York, de Blasio and Cuomo, you would never trust a politician or government to ensure your safety and make good decisions about your life and your money. And so I don't know if people driven, because certainly we saw what happened in Georgia, but ultimately, our people driven away from the idea of big government rather than driven toward it. What do you think, James?FREEMAN: Well, I do think that at some point there is a financial reckoning. I think we were talking earlier about how markets are looking at all this money in the economy and all this stimulus and thinking the 2021 has to be a good year.But we are also have been seeing signals in terms of recent months, a weakening dollar, and then lately arising yield on the 10 year bond. I think there is a limit. Then we've been very fortunate people have a lot of faith in the U.S. dollar, faith in our economy and in our system.But I think there may be a message from the markets if the legislators in DC and in places like California continue to sort of test how much we can borrow and spend to pay people not to work, it's not a obviously a long term strategy. And I think a lot of people thought it would be very temporary last year.And if the consensus is in Washington that, well, let's have another year like that when in terms of massive government intervention, and slowing the reopening of schools and so forth, I think that could spark of market reaction.MCDOWELL: In New York, potentially, people high earners could be handing over at - with a top marginal tax rate, broadly speaking, they could be handing over $0.70 on every $1 to the government for the privilege of being chased down the street by a man with a club who is arrested and then put back on the street.That's the reality of living in New York, of dodging human excrement in the street and leading a life unless you're riding around a limousine that is not safe. I mean, it's really appalling.Coming up, social media versus the commander-in-chief, the long term consequences of big tech censoring President Trump, well, and censoring you, after the chaos on Capitol Hill.Plus tone-deaf cash-in, fans are livid. Kylie Jenner's newest pandemic product -- it's making a buzz this morning.MCDOWELL: Welcome back, I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo, it's Friday, January 8th, a look at markets at the bottom of the hour. It is jobs Friday. The December jobs report out at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time, here is what futures are doing ahead of that report. We do have gains across the board. This follows another record-setting day on Wall Street, all three major market gauges finish at all-time highs. Investors putting hopes on stimulus bets, how much money a new blue Senate and a blue house and a blue White House might spend? European markets are trading to the plus side, now, the FTSE 100 back in the green as well. England, France and Germany showing gains. In Asia overnight, it was a similar story, the only loser there, the Shanghai Composite down less than two-tenths of 1 percent.The Justice Department charging Boeing with criminal conspiracy after it lied about this 737 Max jets. Cheryl Casone has the details. Cheryl?CASONE: That is right, Dagen, and Boeing has agreed to pay $2.5 billion to settle criminals charges over the 737 Max. Boeing admitting employees deceived the FAA, leaving pilots in the dark about a key safety system that ultimately failed resulting in two crashes that killed 346 people. And the jet returned to the U.S. skies last week after being grounded for more than 20 months. Let's take a look at this Dow component in the pre-market right now. Stock to watch today. It is down currently more than a quarter percent, even though futures are higher right now. Another company we're following, American Express reportedly under investigation for its business card sales practices. The "Wall Street Journal" is reporting the Inspector General Offices of the Treasury, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve are investigating if Amex used aggressive and misleading sales tactics to sell business cards to business owners, and whether those customers were actually harmed.Well, the three-recent dealers, Chinese telecom companies are feeling the burn this morning. Shares of China Mobile, China Telecom, China Unicom all dropping in Hong Kong after news of the U.S. ban would cover publicly- traded -- these publicly-traded units. These companies, of course, were part of President Trump's November executive order which banned Americans from investing in companies with ties to the Chinese government. Finally this, it is the end of an era. Tonight marks the final episode of "Jeopardy" airing with Alex Trebek as the host, it was the last one recorded before Trebek died two months ago from pancreatic cancer. It will include a special message from him. Trebek hosted the quiz show for 37 seasons, Dagen. Back to you.MCDOWELL: I would use an expletive, but, boy, I hate cancer. I know you do, too.CASONE: Oh, yes, got you.MCDOWELL: Thank you, Cheryl. Big tech battle. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announcing that President Trump has been banned indefinitely from both Facebook and Instagram. Zuckerberg says the risk of him using the platforms are too great. The ban will last at least 2 weeks until a peaceful transition of power is complete. Twitter meantime unlocking the president's account after a 12-hour ban, following the riot on Capitol Hill. Joining me now is Disruptive Tech Research founder and chief analyst, Lou Basenese. Lou, well, social -- I have a lot to say about this, but I'm just going to ask you what social media --LOU BASENESE, FOUNDER & CHIEF ANALYST, DISRUPTIVE TECH RESEARCH: We talked about it before, Dagen --MCDOWELL: Well, social media companies come under more pressure to control what is posted on their platforms, and this is not just about President Trump, this is about censoring thought that people who run these -- billionaire oligarchs who run these giant tech companies, they and their employees don't agree with a lot of conservative thought. So, is it about censorship? And what is the fallout for the companies and the stocks even?BASENESE: Yes, I know, I mean, there's a lot to unpack there. I think, look, what we're learning that you can put a president in time-out like a toddler and change behavior, and I think that needs to be done to some extent on these social media platforms. Dagen, you and I have talked about this before. There's reprehensible content like murders that get shown over this periodically, and Zuckerberg tries to shun any responsibility, the same thing with Jack Dorsey at Twitter. So, I think they need to do something. Self-regulation is not working, they're not monitoring it. The other side of that coin though is obviously the fear of censorships. So, there has got to be some middle ground. I think the key would be an act similar to (INAUDIBLE) for social media where you put these executives criminally responsible -- you know, personally responsible, threatening them with being in orange jump suit and watch how fast that they can moderate and clean up the content.In terms of the stocks -- in terms of the stocks, like investors have shown really, they don't care. It's all about the networks and the ads and the size of the network. They really -- traditionally, I mean, look at Facebook, I mean, how many times have they gotten in trouble and their stock has just marched higher?MCDOWELL: James Freeman, though, cleaning up the content, I -- when I hear people say that, I hear censorship. And I saw what Twitter did to the "New York Post", one of the largest newspapers --FREEMAN: Yes --MCDOWELL: In the country. And that moment when you could not share, it's not just that they shut down the "New York Post", Twitter account for I think 10 days or longer. It was the fact that nobody was allowed to share a story that was reported about Hunter Biden because it was a political bomb for the -- figurative bomb for the Biden campaign. And so these companies, they have so much power and they control so much of what we do and say, and they in a split second will shut somebody down and shut down a national newspaper. And so I see -- like, where does it go from here because they have -- I mean, they're so big, you can't control them unless you break them up.FREEMAN: Well, just to emphasize your point. The "New York Post" reporting was true.MCDOWELL: Right.FREEMAN: It wasn't just that they were -- that the social media companies were suppressing reporting or opinions they didn't like. It was -- it was literally suppressing what is looking back. You know, one of the biggest political news stories, maybe the biggest political news story of last year that was blocked by Twitter, by others. So, it -- I think a lot of Americans obviously don't want the social media companies deciding what we're allowed to see and what views are allowed to be shown to us. And also what news, what legitimate, factual news is permitted to make its way to us. So I guess I'd ask, Lou, you know, is there -- is there any emerging market competition here? People have talked about the parlor, some people are trying that as the alternative to Twitter. There have been other efforts to kind of create a free-speech platforms. Any of these create a market problem for big tech as opposed --BASENESE: Yes, I think it's --FREEMAN: To political problem?BASENESE: Yes, James, I think it's a great question. I mean, you're reading my mind here. I was going to say like this opens -- moderation, the risk of it is censoring truth, right? But it opens a window of opportunity for another network, another platform to come in that's not going to have these impacts, that's not going to have this tremendous oversight and control over content. To date, I haven't seen anything. I mean, you know, it's one of those things though that a competitor can come on the scene in social media, we've seen it before. I mean, look at Snap, they got, went from zero to 300 million users in record time. So, it's about someone innovating. And the -- you know, the name of my firm is Disruptive Tech Research, like, I truly believe in innovation and ingenuity.So, there's an opportunity here. Someone has got -- you know, whoever is listening out in Silicon Valley or these other hotbeds of innovation throughout the country, you know, there's a great opportunity here. We know the model works. You just got to make it better. I don't think we can count on the Twitters and Facebooks of the world and SnapChat to do it right. They just haven't. They've had plenty of opportunities and they're just not doing it --MCDOWELL: I look at -- I look at Google and Google owns YouTube and the censorship there. And Google is so big, almost impossible to challenge it in terms of how it serves ads to websites. Because if Google -- and we've seen it with "The Federalist". If Google decides that it doesn't like what you're publishing, they will de-platform you and shut you down and put you out of business. Now, "The Federalist" is, of course, in business, but we saw what happened in the last year with that. But you know, this is where the free market has in some ways failed because these companies like Facebook were allowed to gobble up company after company after company, and it was allowed to happen, and now they're so big, we can't -- we have no control over who they censor and how much. So, Lou, thank you for being here. I've talked a lot.BASENESE: Yes, no problem.MCDOWELL: More time for you next time. Lou Basenese. Coming up, Kim-Ye crumbles. We take you inside the financial fallout from the potential billion-dollar divorce of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West. Plus, knight rider fans rejoice, David Hasselhoff is ready to part ways with his friend Kitt. It's making a buzz this morning. Don't forget to tune in, Wednesday, January 13th for the Fox Business "FUTURE OF CAPITALISM VIRTUAL TOWN HALL". Charles Payne, he will answer any question. You can send your questions in to investedinyou@foxbusiness.com You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.MCDOWELL: One of Hollywood's most famous, richest couples heading toward a split. Kim Kardashian and Kanye West reportedly divorcing after six years of marriage, with a combined net worth of more than $2 billion. What is at stake? Joining me now, trial attorney Jonna Spilbor. Jonna, first, take a look at the companies -- the company. The couples, they are like -- you know, they are a --JONNA SPILBOR, TRIAL ATTORNEY: Yes --MCDOWELL: Brand or a giant corporation if you will, the couple's real estate which includes a California mansion, a Miami condo and two ranches in Wyoming. What happens in this divorce, you think?SPILBOR: Yes, so, OK, we know, generally speaking, divorce is the process of putting a marriage out of business, and this marriage produced some big business. On paper, Dagen, these two are pretty equally valued, but what the court or the law is going to do is basically put a value on everything they acquired over the course of their 6 or 7-year marriage, and then split it down the middle because this is California and California is a community property state which means what's yours is mine and what's mine is yours when two people are married.Yes, and a case like this, where they have money and business and stuff, the court could simply take their personal property, and say, all right, you have $300,000 in livestock, you get a cow and you get a cow, which is likely not going to happen or they can simply put a price tag on all of their personal property and their real estate. And their real estate is around 88 million and divide it up, either somebody buys the other person out or they can force the sale of their real estate, the court can and then they would split the proceeds, that way. Or more likely than not, they would come to an agreement as to who is getting the Florida condo, who is getting the L.A. house, who is getting the cows in Montana or wherever they are, that's likely what's going to happen, assuming that they don't have a prenup and they probably do.MCDOWELL: And Jonna, the one story I was reading is that in the Calabasas, California, the L.A. house, if you will, which is north of the city, that Kim Kardashian --SPILBOR: Yes --MCDOWELL: Owns the actual land, but apparently, Kanye owns the dwelling, the house that was -- I think that they tore it down and rebuilt it or added on to it. But it's a show place --SPILBOR: Correct --MCDOWELL: And that makes it that much more complicated to split up those assets. But like you said, so what are the other joint assets that you were talking about?SPILBOR: Right, so they have a lot of real estate. They have several different properties, they have personal belongings, your jewelry, your cars, your art work, your furnishings, those are all things that get in the mix when somebody is getting a divorce. Now, you can't take an axe to an arm or -- right? So, what the court will do is figure out what the value is, usually experts come in to figure that out, and you either will agree on a dollar amount that's going to get exchanged. In other words, Kim Kardashian may have to buy some of her furniture, his share, Kanye's share for the furniture or they can agree who is going to get the bedroom set, the dining room set, et cetera. If not, a court will come in and all of their belongings will be up for sale and can go to the highest bidder, and they'll split the proceeds.I really doubt it would come to that. Their biggest assets right now, Dagen, are themselves. Like their businesses --MCDOWELL: You're right --SPILBOR: Are why they are worth $2 billion.MCDOWELL: Right, and that ring, if you're married, you get to keep it. The wife gets to keep it.SPILBOR: That's right --MCDOWELL: It is contingent --SPILBOR: That's right --MCDOWELL: On the contract of marriage. If you don't -- if you don't ever get married, you've got to give the engagement ring back. But you get to --SPILBOR: You know it --MCDOWELL: Keep it. Yes, because I went through that --SPILBOR: Yes --MCDOWELL: And had to sell my engagement ring on eBay --SPILBOR: OK --MCDOWELL: That's a true story.SPILBOR: Oh, no --MCDOWELL: Yes, I sold my ring on eBay --SPILBOR: We'll talk about that sometime --MCDOWELL: Some little old lady in -- like in Wisconsin, God bless her. By the way, I loved --(CROSSTALK)The $300,000 in livestock which is used as a tax break. I don't think it's because they love animals --SPILBOR: Right --MCDOWELL: Jonna Spilbor, great to see you.SPILBOR: Same here.MCDOWELL: Coming up, "Knight Rider" fans rejoice. David Hasselhoff ready to part ways with his friend Kitt, it's making a buzz this morning.MCDOWELL: It's time for the Morning Buzz, we just talked about Kim. Now, let's move on to Kylie Jenner. Her fans are accusing her of profiting off the pandemic after her skincare brand announced a $7 hand sanitizer. Some pointed out her donations to frontline workers in hospitals, but many didn't see the point of a maybe billionaire making hand sanitizer, James. Is this a no-go for Kylie or just seizing an opportunity?FREEMAN: Well, I mean, I don't know why you'd accuse someone of creating a useful product that people want and need. I don't think she should apologize for anything. I guess I'm just hoping and I should never question the marketing savvy of the Kardashians. They obviously know a lot more about this than I do. But I'm just hoping that her timing is off, that she's coming late to the market, and that, that curve with the vaccines is going to flatten again very soon, and we're going to be out of this. But maybe she's on the right track as they often are with their business ventures.MCDOWELL: There are so much free hand --FREEMAN: Unfortunately --MCDOWELL: Sanitizers available though. Like anywhere you go, there's a hand sanitizer dispenser shoot. If you're single and ready to mingle, some way you can meet the ladies and the fellows at the grocery store like asking for hand -- oh, you have any hand sanitizer? Let me have a little bit. You know, just an idea. Next, riding --FREEMAN: OK --MCDOWELL: In Hasselhoff style. Actor David Hasselhoff is auctioning off his iconic car, Kitt, from the show "Knight Rider" for $300,000. Three hundred thousand -- if you're a super fan and want to meet the actor, he will personally drive the car to you for an extra 25 percent above the asking price. Brian, are you a fan of the show? You're too young to be a fan of the show.BRENBERG: No, look, Dagen, there are a few things in life where you know you give your right arm to have it. For me, Kitt would be one of those things. That was my dream car when I was a kid. When I was in college, I had the Knight Rider theme song playing in the background of my voice message greeting in my dorm room, which was awesome for me until an employer called, and after they reached, I don't think they were impressed by it. But I loved Kitt. If I had a million bucks lying around, I would want this car in a heartbeat.(LAUGHTER)MCDOWELL: You make -- you make James laugh. You know, I like you even more -- I already love Brian, but I like him even more knowing that.FREEMAN: Yes, that was strong. And I like you to direct that question to me and I would have made fun of people like --(LAUGHTER)MCDOWELL: More right after this.Load-Date: January 8, 2021End of Document

Telecom Operations Management Market - Growth, Trends, COVID-19 Impact, and Forecasts (2021 - 2026); The Telecom Operations Management Market is expected to register a CAGR of 8. 57% over the forecast period from 2021 to 2026. Rapid advancements of various technologies impacted the telecom industry, whether it's the rise in the adoption of 5G and network-centric business models or new connected devices and applications has opened up significant opportunities for business transformation, and the companies in the market are collaborating with leading telecoms, partners, and customers to provide efficient operation management solutions.GlobeNewswireMarch 29, 2021 Monday 2:00 AM PTCopyright 2021 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: MARKET RESEARCH REPORTSLength: 1928 wordsBodyNew York, March  29, 2021  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Reportlinker.com announces the release of the report "Telecom Operations Management Market - Growth, Trends, COVID-19 Impact, and Forecasts (2021 - 2026)" - https://www.reportlinker.com/p06039535/?utm_source=GNW  Amid intense competition, commoditization, and unprecedented demand, successful telecom companies need to focus on operation and technology simplification, while seeking insight from their systems to keep subscribers intact and find new ways to grow.- Over the past few years, significant changes in the telecommunication landscape have resulted in a sharpened focus on the area of business metrics. For gaining better operational efficiency and customer satisfaction, it is beneficial to translate organization-level metrics to lower-level internal metrics in a structured methodology. It is essential that the internal parameters can be measured accurately and efficiently such that the systems and tools should support it for effective operation. In June 2020, ETI Software Solutions announced a strategic deal with Microsoft to help telecom service providers improve subscriber experience, reduce inefficiencies and cost, and offer next-gen services more reliably and affordably. Through this deal, service providers could utilize the comprehensive yet modular, integrated solution that empowers companies to address subscriber-facing issues to operate more efficiently proactively.- Individual telecommunications operators had experienced a high level of operational failures in the data center and network equipment resulting in poor service to customers. The operators identified poor operation management as a significant source of these issues. The telecom operation management can tackle the problem by offering solutions for telecom network inventory and planning, billing, customer relations management (CRM), monitoring of network performance, support of the processes of network configuration, rollout, and service assurance. The solutions are generally supported by a modern workflow engine that automates and optimizes business processes related to telecommunication network management, service monetization, and customer management.- In June 2020, ServiceNow launched Telecommunications Service Management and Telecommunications Network Performance Management products that will enable service providers to deliver better experiences to customers, contact center agents, and network operations teams to maximize their network technology investments helping to reduce costs. Built on the Now Platform, the products will extend the company's capabilities in customer service and network operations with the latest telecommunications-specific apps for Proactive Customer Care and Automated Service Assurance. The products will enable service providers to better manage customer requests and quickly identify network issues for faster resolution.- With the outbreak of COVID-19, telecom companies should be well equipped to handle the operations for meeting the 30% to 40% increase in bandwidth demand on their networks as millions of employees and students became homebound. According to FieceTelecom, the coronavirus pandemic has pushed companies of all sizes to accelerate their digital transformation plans. The companies that had already engaged in the adoption of digital transformation and cloud strategies were better able to sustain in the first few weeks of the pandemic. Verizon Business' survey results echoed some of the points, including 43% of the respondents now planning to expand their businesses through digital and related technologies. Also, 30% have already added new methods for delivering their products and services digitally.Key Market TrendsCloud is Expected to Witness Significant Growth- Telecom companies worldwide are embarking on transformation journeys centered on the cloud to drive new services, revenue opportunities, and experiences. By combining their cloud-native, open and modular solutions with the fully managed, high performing Cloud platform, the telecom operators can accelerate the journey. Cloud providers are focusing on some strategic regions to support telecommunications companies. These include helping telecommunications companies monetize 5G as a business services platform, empowering them to engage their customers through data-driven experiences better, and assisting them in improving operational efficiencies across core telecom systems.- In March 2020, Google Cloud announced a comprehensive new strategy to help telecommunications companies digitally transform. Google Cloud's approach focuses on key business outcomes for telecommunications companies, including improving operational efficiency across telecom core systems. Google Cloud is helping telecommunications providers in the transformation of their core IT systems and networks. As a part of this transformation, various applications, such as Operations Support Systems (OSS), Business Support Systems (BSS), and network functions that, once present in telecom environments, will shift to Google Cloud. This will provide customers with various benefits, including reducing costs and improving IT efficiencies and using Google Cloud to virtualize network functions for their core communications networks.- Google also announced a partnership with Amdocs to enable communications service providers to run Amdocs' market-leading portfolio on Google Cloud and to deliver new data analytics, site reliability engineering, and 5G edge solutions to enterprise customers. Amdocs announced that Altice USA had gone live with Amdocs data and intelligence systems on the Google Cloud as part of the Amdocs and Google Cloud joint go-to-market initiative. Also, a new partnership with Netcracker to deploy its entire Digital BSS/OSS and Orchestration stack on Google Cloud. Service providers can now scale and purchase their mission-critical IT applications on-demand, access unlimited Google Cloud resources, reduce the total cost of ownership, and accelerate the availability of new services.- In May 2020, ZTE Corporation collaborated with the Guangdong branch of China Mobile has completed the large-scale deployment of ZTE's intelligent cloud-based 5G transport management and control system ZENIC ONE (UME) in Guangdong province of China, to achieve the unified management of 150,000 PTN network elements. Besides, the ZENIC ONE (UME) system integrates Artificial Intelligence and Big Data for the first time to add management and control with tools and applications. Therefore, the system can collect the information related to the operation reported by the device in real-time, and combine AI intelligent big data analysis to monitor the network operation status, promptly pinpoint problems and recover services, thus significantly improving the O&M efficiency.North America is Expected to Hold Significant Share- North America is anticipated to occupy a significant share in the telecom operations management market studied, owing to the high expenditure on business operation solutions in the region. Besides, the telecommunications in the region is highly developed with intense competition among the communication providers, which is expected further to boost the market for telecom analytics in the region. The continuous advancements in IT infrastructure and technology used for customer support, a significant number of market vendors, and the accessibility of proficient technical expertise about managing the daily operations and helpdesk software contribute toward the telecom operations management market growth region.- In July 2019, IBM and AT&T announced a multi-year strategic alliance. Under the coalition, AT&T Communications will utilize IBM's expertise to transform AT&T Business Solutions' internal software applications, enabling migrations to the IBM Cloud. Besides, IBM will provide infrastructure to support AT&T Business applications. AT&T Business will utilize Red Hat's open-source platform for the management of workloads and applications. The improvements will allow AT&T Business to serve enterprise customers better. IBM will be the major cloud provider and developer for AT&T Business's operational applications and will engage in managing the company's IT infrastructure, on and off-premises, and across multiple clouds, including private and public.- Furthermore, the shift in consumer behavior, along with rising mobile internet adoption and, smartphone, improved affordability, and the increasing availability of locally relevant content have led to a boom in mobile services across areas such as e-commerce, and financial services, video, and social media. As a result, the demand for telecom operations management has been witnessing an upward trend in North America. In April 2020, the United States Department of Justice, combined with other federal agencies, called on the FCC to revoke China Telecom Americas Corporation's authorization for providing international telecommunications services across the United States.- In May 2019, the FCC together voted to deny China Mobile Ltd, a Chinese telecommunications company, the rights for providing services in the United States, citing risks that the Chinese government could result in using the approval to conduct espionage against the United States government. Such allegations in the region may decrease the ability of international telecommunication providers in the region to adopt operation management solutions. Furthermore, this would also encourage local telecoms to take better operation management solutions to gain a competitive edge over international players, thereby augmenting the growth of the market.Competitive LandscapeThe Telecom Operations Management Market is quite competitive and moderately fragmented. This is due to the presence of significant players such as IBM Corporation, Oracle Corporation, Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Development LP, Nokia Corporation, etc. The prominent companies are entering into collaborations and are launching innovative solutions, to increase their market share.- March 2020 - Omantel has announced a partnership with Ericsson to manage its multi-access mobile networks. The deal, says the telecommunications company, in which the Omani government has majority ownership, will allow Omantel to take advantage of a range of network functions virtualization (NFV) functionalities. The partnership also covers fully managed end-to-end operations services, which includes nationwide network operations and field maintenance and support for Omantel's fixed-line access, 2G, 3G, 4G, and future 5G access.- March 2020 - Nokia launched a complete AI as a service offering called Nokia AVA 5G Cognitive Operations. The framework and its AI-based solutions enable Communication Service Providers (CSPs) to transform their network, service, and business operations through AI, cloud scalability, and automation. The solution will provide CSPs with solutions to assist with slice creation and assurance to meet committed SLAs.Reasons to Purchase this report:- The market estimate (ME) sheet in Excel format- 3 months of analyst supportRead the full report: https://www.reportlinker.com/p06039535/?utm_source=GNWAbout ReportlinkerReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution.

Report: High-Tech Heist: Government IT Vendors And The Threat To U.S. Banks; Report cites SolarWinds attack, recommends strategies for financial organizations to mitigate vulnerabilitiesPR NewswireMarch 3, 2021 Wednesday 10:00 AM ESTCopyright 2021 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 388 wordsDateline: WASHINGTON, March 3, 2021 BodyPR NewswireDr. Roslyn Layton,China Tech Threat Co-Founder, today released a newreport showing that cyber attacks on banks are increasing in frequency, severity, and sophistication despite banks' investment in cybersecurity and significant federal policy efforts intended to mitigate them."A cyber attack on a bank can devastate its customers and systems, and a cyber attack on the U.S. Treasury—which SolarWinds came dangerously close to achieving—could bring down the country. The possibility of a similar attack represents an existential threat to the financial industry," said Dr. Layton. "The stark reality is that cyber attacks are growing faster and larger than government or banks can address them."The People's Republic of China (PRC), the leading threat actor against the U.S., increasingly supplies the IT products and services of U.S. financial organizations. This presents risks of backdoors, data exfiltration and unethical product development. The U.S. cyber policy approach, which restricts some PRC-owned IT firms but not others, is needlessly complex and invites exploitation. The report recommends a strategy for U.S. financial organizations to reduce operational and reputational risks:  1) Don't wait for policymakers to fix the problem2) Conduct cyber resilience audits3) Remove elements with cyber vulnerabilities4) Adopt a secure cyber sourcing strategy"China is the only national adversary providing technology to U.S. financial institutions, banks and credit unions so they must guard against relying on products and services from suppliers controlled by the PRC. As cyber threats continue to evolve and grow, so too must companies' cyber defenses. There is no silver bullet, but proactive strategies, like continuous audits of systems and equipment can help financial institutions stay ahead of these threats," said Layton.  About China Tech Threat: We bring attention to the threats, dangers and vulnerabilities posed of information technology from entities owned and affiliated with the Chinese government. We conduct research and collect on materials from other experts to better understand these complex issues and improve policy. View original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/report-high-tech-heist-government-it-vendors-and-the-threat-to-us-banks-301239161.htmlSOURCE China Tech ThreatCONTACT: Jamie@ChinaTechThreat.com Load-Date: March 3, 2021End of Document

Now fashion is: virtual influencersCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 22, 2021 MondayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 705 wordsBody They come from video games and anime and others are created for this specific purpose. They are characters who are entering the mainstream of being influencers and, as in recent years in technological advances, China is where they start strong. As fictional as these digital avatars are, they have real jobs and are becoming more interactive and human-like, thanks to improvements in technologies such as artificial intelligence, motion capture and virtual reality (VR). Recent advances in augmented reality (AR) have allowed virtual avatars to leave social media and make live appearances alongside flesh-and-blood celebrities.Recently, commercial interest in virtual influencers has increased, which can be explained by the industry's new willingness to experiment with creating digital brand experiences, in order to reach the consumer through innovative ways, especially in the current context of the pandemic.An example of this is virtual pop idol Luo Tianyi. In recent years, he has performed with human artists for the Annual Spring Festival Gala of the Chinese state television network, the most-watched media event in that nation. Many saw this presentation as the government's implied support for mixed reality (XR). Indeed, in its last five-year plan, published earlier this month, the Chinese government named the XR one of the country's seven central digital industries.China has dominated for years, in terms of investment, augmented reality and virtual reality. Just to give an example, IDC notes that China accounted for 54.7% of commercial and consumer spending on AR and VR worldwide by 2020. IDC projections for this year raise the investment to 56% this year.Since the end of last year, we saw an increase in brands eager to connect with young consumers in China and now the virtual characters are added with sponsorships. For example, virtual influencer Noonoouri works in conjunction with Chinese actor Li Xian on a campaign for luxury brand Ermenegildo Zegna, and Luo Tianyi has backed some brands such as Gillette, KFC, Pizza Hut, Tide, the Vitasoy beverage brand and local cosmetics company Pechoin.Last April, Luo co-founded a live broadcast with influencer Li Jiaqi, who is considered one of the two main influencers (known locally as key opinion leaders) in China.According to a study presented in September 2020 by the GlobalWebIndex, 66% of viewers of live broadcasts in China, age 16 and older, said they were likely to buy products recommended by virtual influencers who follow.As the adoption of e-commerce skyrocketed over the issue of covid-19 lockdown, social platforms like TikTok doubled as purchases and sales capabilities expanded.The list of conventional virtual influencers is growing. Tencent hired the character from the game Xing Tong for brand agreements and in January 2021 McDonald's introduced her own virtual idol, Happy Sister, as the brand's ambassador to China. The group's most realistic is Ling, who mingled with human celebrities on the February cover of Vogue Me China.Working with virtual influencers has advantages over their human counterparts. Brands can have full control of the creative process and virtual influencer schedule, for example, and location and language barriers are never a problem.Brands must activate the right voice to reach the right consumer and make sure they have a well-balanced combination of voices. It is essential to remember thatthey are choosing an influencer because it generates a lot of enthusiasm, but because it brings authenticity and authority to their brand.The role of virtual influencers is likely to continue to expand as the purchasing power of generation Z and the demand for more interactive entertainment experiences grow. However, many technological hurdle remains to be overcome. Viewing a virtual character in a physical environment still requires mediation of some kind of screen.For brands, it's not too early to think about how to address this emerging trend. In the coming years, as virtual avatars make their way into more aspects of everyday life in China, and beyond, there are likely to be ethical issues that marketers and governments will have to address, as happened with Amazon Alexa and other voice assistants. Load-Date: March 23, 2021End of Document

Biden candidate for CIA chief underscores China threatCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 25, 2021 ThursdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 341 wordsBodyChina is the biggest threat to the UnitedStates, President Joe Biden's candidate to lead the CIA on Wednesday, William Burns, who promised to ensure the spy agency's independence from the political world.In an "increasingly complex and competitive" international scenario, the Chinese government's "predatory" attitude represents "our greatest geopolitical challenge," the former professor declared during his hearing before the Senate intelligence committee, which must approve his appointment."Overcoming China will be key to our security in the coming decades," he said. "That will require a long-term, lucid, bipartisan strategy, underpinned by a domestic renewal and strong intelligence,"he said.Although Washington can cooperate with Beijing on key issues such as climate change or the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, the state department's number two (2011-2014) warned that theChinese regime "methodically strengthens its intellectual property theft capabilities, suppresses its people, harasses its neighbors, extends its power in the world, and builds its influence within American society."The CIA has in recent years been targeted by Chinese intelligence operations,which recruited several U.S. agents and diplomats.A decade ago, Beijing managed to dismantle a network of us agency informants in China.Burns stated that the battle for technological superiority in intelligence, including the use of artificial intelligence, will be a key element of his mission. He also advocated recruiting Mandarin-speaking agents.In addition to China, Russia, which he called "aggressive" and Iran, which he called "hostile," are the other major threats to his country,according to Burns.Recalling his years as U.S. ambassador to Moscow, between 2005 and 2008, the former artist said he had learned "that it is always a mistake to underestimate Vladimir Putin's Russia.""While, in many respects, Russia is a declining power, it can be as disruptive" as emerging powers as China, he considered.US: G20 must help poor countries buy vaccines       Load-Date: February 26, 2021End of Document

Pinduoduo under fire as China turns on its tech titansCNN WireJanuary 13, 2021 Wednesday 1:55 PM GMTCopyright 2021 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1071 wordsDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  One of China's most prominent e-commerce companies is facing intense public backlash over allegations that it overworks its employees. It's a sign that scrutiny of the country's tech champions is broadening, and could become even more intense.Pinduoduo --- the country's third largest e-commerce firm after Alibaba and JD.com --- became a target of public outrage after two of its employees unexpectedly died during the holiday season.First, a worker in her twenties collapsed in Urumqi, the capital city of the Xinjiang region, while walking home with colleagues during the early hours of Dec. 29. The company confirmed her death, but did not disclose the cause.Then, another worker died late last week after jumping from his 27-floor apartment in Changsha, a city in the southern Hunan province. Pinduoduo said the man had earlier asked for time off, without giving a reason, according to a company statement."We feel profound sadness that we lost one of our employees to suicide," the company said in the statement. "We are doing everything we can to support his family and loved ones during this difficult time." Chinese social media users had already started calling out the deaths as emblematic of a troublesome work culture at Pinduoduo when a former software engineer at the company catapulted awareness of the problem to new highs.In a 15-minute video published Sunday on Weibo that garnered millions of likes and thousands of comments, the user Wang Taixu claimed that Pinduoduo fired him after he posted a photo he said showed an ambulance taking away another company employee. (Wang is his surname, and he goes by the nickname "Taixu" on Weibo and used that name during his time at Pinduoduo.)In additional posts on Weibo and other Chinese social media platforms, Wang accused the company of forcing workers at its Shanghai headquarters to work in excess of 300 hours per month, and not providing enough toilets for its employees."I don't think the world should work this way," Wang said in the video. He described Pinduoduo as a company that "forces the smartest people in the country to work" long hours, and expressed his disappointment that the stock has been trading at record levels on Wall Street despite the recent controversies.Pinduoduo denied that Wang was fired because of the photo he posted, telling CNN Business that his termination was due to "extreme comments" he made on social media with "notable ill intentions," in violation of the company's rules.The company didn't respond to questions about the allegations made against its work culture. It did say, however, that it has set up a team to provide psychological counseling following the suicide of its worker last week.Tech work culture under fire The firestorm surrounding Pinduoduo has reignited a long-running debate in China about the tech industry's controversial "996" work culture --- a term referring to the practice of working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week that is said to be common among the country's big technology companies and startups.Public backlash against the practice isn't new. Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma, for example, was heavily criticized in China two years ago after he called 996 culture a "huge blessing." But this latest fallout comes at a precarious time for China's tech titans, which are facing intense regulatory scrutiny, including accusations that some of them are putting profits above their customers and crowding out competition. Ma himself hasn't been seen in public for months as Alibaba faces an antitrust investigation and its financial affiliate, Ant Group, has been ordered to overhaul its operations."The sad death of employees at Pinduoduo provides Beijing with timely and very visceral publicity which it can leverage to further its policy objectives," said Alex Capri, a research fellow at Hinrich Foundation and a visiting senior fellow at National University of Singapore. "The message: the Pinduoduo tragedy is another lesson about what happens when private companies put their own business priorities ahead of the [ruling Chinese Communist Party]."Chinese state media has picked up on the recent controversies, further suggesting that the government is willing to stoke criticism of these tech companies. (Such outlets are a powerful tool in the country's propaganda machine, and they are often looked upon as barometers of sentiment among senior officials.)"People are concerned about the matter [the sudden death of the Pinduoduo employee] because they feel the pain of abnormal overtime work culture," read an unbylined commentary piece published on Weibo last week by the state-owned Xinhua News Agency. The article added that workers' rights and interests must be strengthened. Xinhua interviewed Wang, the former Pinduoduo worker, on Tuesday. He told the publication that while his remarks were drastic, he did not regret publishing his photo."It is the Chinese government which allowed Wang Taixu's video to be so widely circulated and generate such heated discussions," said Jack Qiu Linchuan, professor of communications at the National University of Singapore and an expert on Chinese labor issues. "One of the fundamental reasons for the huge public backlash is that the government did not censor it, despite having the full ability to do so."Brock Silvers, chief investment officer for Kaiyuan Capital who is based in Hong Kong, also said the recent backlash against the 996 culture appeared to carry "political overtones.""Beijing is busily trying to assert new levels of control upon tech giants and their massively wealthy leaders. Recent worker tragedies at Pinduoduo have provided those authorities with another potential arrow in their quiver," Silvers said.He added, though, that the environment for workers might not change much, even after the tech sector "regains a regulator equilibrium.""Ambitious workers looking for better lives will likely still be toiling under the influence of 996," Silvers said.To get help, call the US National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255. For crisis support in Spanish, call 1-888-628-9454.

Biden Warns China Is Set To "Eat Our Lunch."The FrontrunnerFebruary 12, 2021 FridayCopyright 2021 Bulletin News Network, Inc.Section: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 473 wordsBodyReuters (2/11, Brunnstrom, Alper, Tian) reports President Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping "held their first phone call as leaders and appeared at odds on most issues, even as Xi warned that confrontation would be a 'disaster' for both nations." Biden told a bipartisan group of senators Thursday that US must steps up its game in the face of Chinese competition. Biden, who "said he spoke to Xi for two hours," Warned the senators, "If we don't get moving, they are going to eat our lunch." On its website, CNBC (2/11, Macias, 7.34M) says Biden "warned lawmakers...that China is aggressively outpacing the United States on infrastructure." Biden said, "They're investing a lot of money, they're investing billions of dollars and dealing with a whole range of issues that relate to transportation, the environment and a whole range of other things."Axios (2/11, Lawler, 1.26M) reports Biden "said Thursday that it was a 'good conversation' between two leaders who know each other well based on their interactions while Biden was vice president." The Washington Post (2/11, Shih, 10.52M) says that after Biden and Xi spoke, "the U.S. and Chinese governments released accounts that diverged sharply in tone and focus. But both sides signaled they would not yield on the thorny issues of Taiwan, Hong Kong and Xinjiang, foreshadowing the areas that could generate protracted tensions in the post-Trump era."Biden Urged To Provide Incentives For Domestic Semiconductor Manufacturing.Reuters (2/11, Nellis) reports that on Thursday, US microchip companies sent a letter to President Biden "urging him to provide 'substantial funding for incentives for semiconductor manufacturing' as part of his economic recovery and infrastructure plans." According to Reuters, signatories include the CEOs of Intel, Qualcomm, Micron Technology and Advanced Micro Devices. Reuters says the letter "comes as a global chip shortage has idled factory lines at Ford Motor Co and General Motors Co, with executives at the automakers predicting billions in lost profit. Tight chip supplies have even made it hard for consumers to buy popular gaming consoles such as Microsoft Corp's Xbox and Sony Corp's Playstation." The letter reads: "This is largely because the governments of our global competitors offer significant incentives and subsidies to attract new semiconductor manufacturing facilities, while the U.S. does not."China Bans Broadcast Of BBC World News.Reuters (2/11) reports that BBC World News "has been barred from airing in China, the National Radio and Television Administration said on Friday." In a statement, NRTA "said an investigation found BBC World News' China-related reports had 'seriously violated' regulations, including that news should be 'truthful and fair,' had harmed China's national interests and undermined national unity."Load-Date: February 12, 2021End of Document

A year after his death, thousands of Chinese remembered the doctor who alerted about the coronavirusCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 6, 2021 SaturdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 367 wordsBodyThousands of social media users in China today honored Li Wenliang, the first doctor to warn about the coronavirus, on the anniversary of his death.Li was part of wuhan's group of doctors who warned that a SARS-like virus was spreading in this city in central China in December 2019 and was reprimanded by police for spreading "rumors."His death at the age of 34 in February 2020, after being infected with Covid-19 by a patient, generated a wave of laments at the national level and numerous criticisms against the Government for its uns transparent way of dealing with the health crisis.Since then, the Chinese government has focused its message on highlighting the effectiveness with which it managed to curb the spread of coronavirus in the country, while critical comments are quickly erased by Internet censors.But Li's personal page on Weibo - equivalent to Twitter in China - remains a space where users can commemorate the trauma of the start of the pandemic, when the authorities imposed strict confinement on the city of Wuhan and hubei province to which it belongs.Thousands of messages of homage were sent on the occasion of the first anniversary of the doctor's death."I thought everyone would forget it, after a year. But I was wrong, you will live forever in the hearts of the Chinese," you can read in one of the comments, which was reproduced by the AFP news agency.China managed to control the pandemic better than many countries; since May they do not register dead and most new cases are imported or small pockets are recorded that are quickly controlled.In total, 89,619 people were coronavirused in the Asian country of nearly 1.4 billion inhabitants, of whom 4,636 died.NEWSLETTER 9AM From Monday to Friday, the selection of our editors of the most relevant information for each day.

China defends use of Twitter, Facebook in virus campaignAssociated Press Financial WireFebruary 18, 2021 Thursday 11:30 AM GMTCopyright 2021 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; INTERNATIONAL NEWS; POLITICAL NEWSLength: 397 wordsDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) — The Chinese government defended its use of Twitter and Facebook on Thursday, following a report that it had used its growing social media presence to spread disinformation about the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.When asked about the report, the Foreign Ministry’s top spokesperson, Hua Chunying, didn't directly address the allegations about China's role in spreading virus disinformation. However, she called the report hype and said China should have the right to use social media too.An Associated Press investigation, conducted in collaboration with the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab, found that powerful political figures and allied media in China as well as the U.S., Russia and Iran flooded the globe with disinformation about the virus.The report, published earlier this week, said that Chinese officials went on the offensive in reaction to a narrative — nursed by former U.S. President Donald Trump among others — that the virus had been manufactured by China. Experts have largely ruled out that possibility.Hua, asked about the AP report at a daily Foreign Ministry briefing, said that some people in Western countries, such as the U.S, don't want to hear China's objective and true voice."They are afraid that more people will learn the truth, so that they can no longer spread false information unscrupulously and do whatever they want to mislead and monopolize international public opinion," she said.China's response, though, was to start spreading rumors that the virus had been created by a U.S. military lab and released during an international competition for military athletes in Wuhan, the Chinese city where the new coronavirus was first detected in late 2019.The search for the origins of the virus has become highly politicized. Trump sought to pin the blame on China, in part to deflect criticism of his administration's response to the pandemic in the United States.China, in turn, has played up reports that the virus was circulating outside of the country before the outbreak in Wuhan, suggesting it may have been brought in from elsewhere.Determining where the virus started is likely to take years of research and may never be known. Most scientists say the most likely scenario is it was first carried by bats in southwest China or neighboring Southeast Asia, and then spread to another animal before infecting humans.Load-Date: February 18, 2021End of Document

Democrats gaining a seat in the Senate as Fox News calls one of the two Senate runoff races there. Raphael Warnock defeating incumbent Senator Kelly Loeffler in flipping one of the state's two GOP Senate seats.And the second race is still too close to call. Democrat Jon Ossoff maintains a narrow lead over Republican incumbent David Perdue. If Ossoff wins, Democrats will have a majority in the Senate, if you include the tie- breaking vote of senator -- Vice President-Elect Kamala Harris.Fox News voter analysis shows that 60 percent of voters said that the balance of power in the Senate was the single most important factor in their vote.Joining me now, former White House deputy press secretary, Trump campaign national press secretary, Hogan Gidley. And also here with me all morning long: Nancy Tengler and Steve Forbes.Hogan, good to see you this morning. I just want to quickly point out that if the margin is half of 1 percent or less, so 0.5 percentage points -- that's the recount threshold in Georgia. So depending on how the Ossoff- Perdue race is called, there will certainly -- almost certainly be a recount there. But what do you make of what happened in Georgia?HOGAN GIDLEY, FORMER DEPUTY WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Well, look, I think the future of this country is clearly at stake here. This is something that the president went down and discussed with the people of Georgia on multiple occasions. It's something that Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue ran on.You know, again, we have a situation in which the media largely ignored so many of the scandals surrounding Raphael Warnock. They didn't really talk about, you know, that race at all and all the issues he faced, being accused by his ex-wife of abuse and other things.The comments he made about the military in Georgia, saying you can't serve the military and serve God. Georgia's a large military state.So you saw, again, as kind of a rigging of the election like they did to Donald Trump and what they decided to cover, what they decided not to cover -- big tech, big companies doing their best to kind of censor the things that the voters couldn't see.But the fact is, we pressed so hard to make sure that the Senate was kept in Republican hands, not just for the balance of power, but for the protection of this country.And when you look at the radical left agenda of Raphael Warnock and of the radical left as well, you have to have serious pause and serious concerns. It's not just higher taxes and regulation that are going to cripple businesses and cripple American workers.It's the decision to open our of borders to people who have no right whatsoever to be here and flood the market with cheap labor. That's going to be a problem. The green new deal that would make us energy dependent for the first time since Donald Trump took office and made us independent. That's a national security issue.So there are all types of issues this country is going to face if in fact Democrats will control the Senate and have Kamala Harris as Vice President.MCDOWELL: Kelly Loeffler did her level best to label Raphael Warnock that very thing. In the one debate that they had, she said over and over again, it was at least more than a dozen times, radical liberal. I think that was -- those were the two words that she chose and those very issues.And I said on the -- I've said on the air that Raphael Warnock in his past has said things that in recent history would have been disqualifying. But those issues were run in ads aimed on TV, aimed at Georgia voters. So Georgia voters were certainly -- many of them aware of Raphael Warnock's history. And he still won.GIDLEY: Yes but you talked about it. Kelly Loeffler talked about it.(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: No but the Georgia voters watched -- if you watched TV you saw some of these ads in Georgia.GIDLEY: Yes, you saw the ads. But let's be clear about what happened here. We just came off of a contentious presidential election in the state of Georgia and then inundated with all those Senate ads in the primary, inundated with those Senate ads in the general and then in a runoff as well. Don't pretend as though people didn't turn that off.What they didn't turn off were their local newscasts. What they didn't turn off were the national newscasts. And if the mainstream media refused to cover these issues, it's not just about what they cover, it's about what they don't cover. And it's about how they cover it.And so when those issues don't come to the fore and the people don't get a chance to see exactly what Raphael Warnock is all about, exactly what Jon Ossoff is all about, no wonder this type of thing culminates in a potential victory for both of those two men.MCDOWELL: Did President Trump's behavior leading up to these runoff elections hurt the turnout and hurt the enthusiasm? Again, the -- I'm asking this as a serious question -- sowing doubt about the results from November. But then also doing a giant cannon ball into the issue of the stimulus package -- the aid package that was negotiated by his own Treasury Secretary but instead of $600 checks he does a giant cannon ball in the middle of it and says $2,000 checks.Certainly puts the Republicans on edge and whether they have to get on- board with those checks or not. Mitch McConnell did not move ahead with voting on the $2,000 checks.But then also the call -- I mean, going after the governor and then the secretary of state and then that phone call which was leaked -- but didn't that hurt?GIDLEY: Look, you can't ascribe the issues of a local state Senate race to the president solely. I mean the fact is --(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: I didn't say solely. I didn't say solely.GIDLEY: I know that. I know, but I did. I'm saying the president of the United States went down there and gave a massive boost to Kelly Loeffler, a massive boost to David Perdue. Otherwise they wouldn't have asked him to come down. They wanted him there.And he'd been there multiple times because they wanted to capture the magic and the strength and the love of the Donald Trump voter onto their side. I don't know how much of that they got. I'm sure once we see the breakdown of the votes afterwards we'll know more.But the president did a really good job differentiating between the fraud, the abuse, the illegalities, the anomalies of his election versus the importance of the upcoming Senate elections. Because if the Senate goes to Democrats, they're going to completely erode all of the successes and record-setting time that this president was able to accomplish on behalf of all Americans and implement this socialist utopia agenda that is going to absolutely destroy this country and erode faith in our future.Not to mention the fact, people out there are smart enough to understand that what they saw in November was an absolute scam. They know this thing was rigged from the outset. They know how the media covered it and didn't cover it leading up to it, how big tech censored certain stories and didn't censor others. They know that occurred. But they also understood the importance of making sure that the Senate remained in Republican hands.Let's be honest here, owning the libs doesn't mean giving two Senate seats to Democrats. I think the voters understood that. And I think the president of the United States did an outstanding job reminding voters exactly what was at stake up to and including at the event he did on election eve, Monday night in Dalton, Georgia.MCDOWELL: Yes, I just raised the issue of to what extent did President Trump by fomenting distrust, rightfully or wrongly, into the voting system. Did he discourage --(CROSSTALK)GIDLEY: Yes, but he didn't foment it, Dagen. He didn't foment. These people saw it with their own eyes. They saw the videos. They experienced it. There's a reason the Pennsylvania legislature is asking for more time because they live and die on their constituents. The constituents are coming to these folks at the state House level --MCDOWELL: My question is did that hurt --GIDLEY: -- and the Senate level saying this is a serious problem. This isn't the president of the United States. This is the American people experiencing this fraud, these illegalities and this abuse and telling people they want faith in their election system and after what we saw in November, they don't have it.MCDOWELL: Ok. Hogan, good to see you. I didn't even get --GIDLEY: Thanks so much.MCDOWELL: -- to ask you about the Electoral College certification. But come back. Good to see you. Hogan Gidley.GIDLEY: Will do. Thanks.MCDOWELL: We'll be right back with "The Word on Wall Street". Stay with usMCDOWELL: Time for "The Word on Wall Street", top investors watching your money this week.Joining me now is Mayflower Advisors managing partner Larry Glazer and principal of the Fitz-Gerald Group Keith Fitz-Gerald. Also Laffer/Tengler Investments' chief investment officer, Nancy Tengler.Nancy let's start with you and the markets this morning. Investors of course, watching Georgia, the Senate runoff races.Fox News has projected that Democrat Raphael Warnock has defeated incumbent Kelly Loeffler. The race between Senator David Perdue and Jon Ossoff still too close to call. What would the impact of a Democrat-controlled Senate and a Democrat-controlled Congress and White House be on the markets? It just seems like investors have not completely factored in what the world might look like.NANCY TENGLER, CIO, LAFFER/TENGLER INVESTMENTS: I think you're right, Dagen. But markets rarely rational in the short term. A lot of the volatility is driven by the algorithms. So one of my primary investment tenets is don't invest your politics. That said, I think you have to be very savvy in how you navigate this. We had been expecting a correction in the first quarter. You usually get one when there's a change in party in the White House.But more importantly I think what investors have to consider is will rippleistics (ph) -- Sam Stovall calls it -- will it in fact result in higher taxes in the midst of COVID and the recession?I think the bigger risk is regulations and again, one of the things that puzzles me is President-Elect Biden said his day one, top five regulatory desire and he has the executive power to do that. Four of those included oil, or against the oil industry. Yet we've seen massive rally in oil stocks.So I think investors need to be looking to the long term. We're long consumer discretionary stocks and those that sort of overlap with the digitization that we think will continue and will benefit a number of technology stocks, despite today's selloff in the Nasdaq.So stay away from FANG but focus on Cloud, artificial intelligence and any company that is benefiting from digitization, particularly in consumer discretionary.MCDOWELL: Larry, let's keep talking about potentially increased regulation on big tech. What could happen to these companies if Democrats potentially control all levels of power in Washington? Has Nancy raised this issue. What say you, Larry?LARRY GLAZER, MANAGING PARTNER, MAYFLOWER ADVISORS: Look Dagen, things are about to get real interesting in Silicon Valley today as people are rolling out of bed and seeing the election results. And at the end of the day, a Democratic-controlled Washington is bad news for big technology companies. For a couple reasons. One is Bernie and other influential Democrats don't think these companies pay enough in taxes. They think they wield too much power.It also means we're going to have higher interest rates, what we saw this morning and overnight. Higher interest rates are bad for high multiple stocks.But it's not bad news for everyone, it's not bad news for little tech. It's not bad news for EV companies. There's plenty of opportunity.Print technology companies are going to be really nervous. And they have a reason to be because they have a bull's-eye on their back. and they're the ones that are going to wind up paying for all those stimulus checks and the $29 trillion debt that we're all going to face as a result of what's happened over the last couple of years.So I think there's opportunities. Wall Street has been asleep at the switch. You need to change your portfolio in 2021. The last couple of years it meant more big tech meant out performance. Now it mean less big tech, more of everything else. And that's how you're going to make money in 2021. Tech is ok, growth is ok, big tech maybe not so much.MCDOWELL: Yes, I love how the Amazon JP Morgan, Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway partnership just went poof. We're going to reimagine the healthcare industry. It's all going to fall on the little guys and the entrepreneurs.I heard that from the founder of WOOP, the fitness tracking band.Keith, let's turn to you. The Trump administration banning transactions with eight Chinese connected apps. One of those apps, AliPay is owned by Jack Ma's Ant Group, another owned by Chinese tech giant TenCent. Keith, what impact does this move have as investors look toward China?How do investors read this? because again, this is something that a Biden administration could undo.KEITH FITZ-GERALD, PRINCIPAL, FITZ-GERALD GROUP: Well, I think you're absolutely correct, Dagen. I think the Biden administration is going to undo it. The cat is out of the bag or however that expression goes on this.I think the ban is absolutely correct. I think there's no question China uses that information against people, not necessarily Americans but just as a matter of surveillance. They're ok with that over there. We're not ok with that over here.From an investment standpoint with all the cross currents, not a big deal. The decision investors have to make right now is that the dragon is coming to dinner on Tuesday. You have to decide whether you want to be at the table of or on the menu.Ultimately there's an investment opportunity but we've got to let things settle first.MCDOWELL: Great to see you, Keith. Keith Fitz-Gerald and Larry Glazer. Larry always brings the energy too even at 7:20 in the morning. Nancy Tengler, you stay right here. you're with us all morning long.TENGLER: Nice seeing you, Dagen.MCDOWELL: Larry, Keith -- great to see you both.Coming up, Apple bonuses go progressive. The new executive rewards based on environmental values.Plus, Kim-Ye headed for Splitsville. The breakup making a buzz this morning.MCDOWELL: Going progressive, Apple will modify cash bonuses for executives by up to 10 percent based on their performance toward the company's social and environmental goals. No word on how they plan on evaluating that.Apple said earlier this year that it -- or last year, rather -- that it plans to remove of carbon emissions from all of the businesses by 2030. CEO Tim Cook's compensation for last year also rose to nearly $15 million.Steve, I was joking earlier but what are they going to do? Go in the parking lot to see what kind of car people are driving?STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA: They have to really spell out what these things actually mean. There are a lot of words right now, like environment, diversity and the like. I'm sure those are the things that like diversity have already been dealt with.One of the interesting things they list is education. I'm hoping that education will now include school choice so that young people at an early age get the education they need so they can have a better life instead of being crushed by the unions more interested in their power rather than educating kids. I hope that's part of their education responsibility program.MCDOWELL: Apple has a diversity problem in the makeup of its workforce, like all technology companies. It's better -- the breakdown is better for Apple than at companies like Facebook but Nancy if you look at U.S. race and ethnicity, this is U.S. employees overall, 9 percent of the workforce is made up of black individuals, 6 percent for technology jobs and leadership, it's just 3 percent of black Americans making up leadership roles. It's worse at Facebook.So, again, this is a look in the mirror scenario for executives at Apple.TENGLER: Yes, I know, Dagen. Let me just say, I'm long Apple -- I've loved the company on so many levels. But I don't really think that a 10 percent adjustment in the bonus is going to make the changes that the company seeks.It has to be -- first of all, it has to be based on merit and then they have to change the way they recruit. And you know, I loved when we were seeing all the stories about prisoners being taught coding and then coming out of prison and being given jobs in Silicon Valley.That kind of grass roots activity makes a difference but setting arbitrary standards and putting in place these amorphous -- and Steve's right, what do they mean. Definitions, is a little bit -- it feels a little bit like pandering to me.MCDOWELL: Yes. Are they going to -- would they go through my garbage can to see if I'm recycling rigorously.(CROSSTALK)TENGLER: It's fine to put it in the recycle bin.MCDOWELL: Oh, my God, there's one can of Red Bull in your garbage, and not your recycling bin. We're going to dock your pay. I jest. But how do you quantify this is the question.Thank you both.TENGLER: Exactly.MCDOWELL: Coming up, the Senate's new balance of power. North Dakota Senator Kevin Kramer is here to discuss.Plus the latest on the battle for a free and fair election.And flag on the play, Buffalo Bills fans ready to sideline Governor Andrew Cuomo from attending this weekend's playoff game. It's making a buzz this morning.CASONE: Welcome back. I am Cheryl Casone. Some headlines, we are watching for you this morning, President Trump issuing a new executive order against Chinese companies. This order bans transactions with eight Chinese connected apps including Alipay, which is owned by Jack Ma's Ant Group, and apps owned by Tencent Holdings. These apps can reportedly access private information from users, which is then turned over to the Chinese government. The order will take effect in 45 days.Well, more than 50 pro-democracy figures were arrested overnight in Hong Kong on suspicion of violating the city's sweeping national security law, its biggest crackdown yet since the law was passed by Beijing just six months ago. Those arrested include pro-democracy politicians who organized and planned the city's aborted legislative council elections last summer, as well as other high profile activists. An American lawyer was also taken away by police.Well UnitedHealth Group has agreed to buy Change Healthcare for just under $8 billion. This is an effort to beef up its Health Care Technology Services business. The health insurer is going to pay $25.75 per share in cash, is still expected to close in the second half of the year and it's going to combine Change Healthcare with UnitedHealth's OptumInsight unit stock. As you can see, UnitedHealth Group's stock is down a little more than 1 percent right now.Well, auction drilling leases are going to take place this morning for the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. This after a federal judge ruled in favor of the Trump administration's plan. Environmental groups had filed several lawsuits to block it, the ruling seen as a win for President Trump and his promise to deliver on his energy dominance agenda.And the Boston Red Sox making history in the offseason, the team announced the hiring of Bianca Smith as a minor league coach, making her the first black woman to coach professional baseball. Smith previously worked as the assistant and hitting coach at Carroll University and will work with position players at the team's facility in Fort Myers, Florida. Dagen, and those are some of your headlines, back over to you.MCDOWELL: It's pretty cool. Thank you, Cheryl. Georgia on the nation's mind, Democrats gaining a seat in the Senate, as Fox News calls one of the two Senate runoff races.Raphael Warnock defeating incumbent Senator Kelly Loeffler, flipping one of the state's two GOP Senate seats. The second race still too close to call, with Democrat Jon Ossoff maintaining a narrow lead over Republican incumbent David Perdue. If Ossoff wins, Democrats will have a majority in the Senate, if you include the tie-breaking vote of Kamala Harris.Joining me now, North Dakota Senator, Senate Armed Services and Budget Committee member, Kevin Cramer. Senator, a pleasure to see you this morning and a Happy New Year. What do you make of what we know so far coming out of Georgia?SEN. KEVIN CRAMER (R-ND): Well, obviously, why not? I mean, why not come down to the last minute of a runoff and see who's going to control the Senate in a year like we've had. That said, I'm still hopeful, I'm holding out for those - particularly those military ballots that haven't been opened and counted yet.If David Perdue has a shot before the end of this day, I think that's where his best opportunity lies. Now, all of that said, what's at stake, and I know you guys know this better than anybody, and what's at stake is, for one thing, real big things like elimination of the filibuster packing the courts, adding a couple of Senators by making the District of Columbia a state, those are huge ramifications should they even get 50 Senators and Kamala Harris spends a couple of weeks in the Capitol.But even at the moment, when you just look at how elections are handled and realizing that Nancy Pelosi's dream and she has been quite open about it is to nationalize elections, and allow vote - universal vote by mail everywhere, not just allow it, require it, require registration, require voting, prohibit states from putting restrictions on voter identification, allowing - not just allowing, but requiring ballot harvesting in every state.So this is a frightening potential outcome. If even one Democrat, if we end up 50/50 and even one Democrat or even 51/49, and one Democrat decides to do something, it's just a very frightening, frankly, situation.MCDOWELL: Well, there's my - I want to ask you about Senator Joe Manchin, because there's been so much talk about he - he has, how will he vote? Would he vote? Would he vote along with his party? Or would he be a more reasonable, middle of the road member of the Senate, despite being a Democrat? But that's a lot or even turning to Senator Sinema from Arizona. But that's a lot to count on, is it?CRAMER: Well, it is a lot to count on. And I love both Joe and Kyrsten, I know them well, and Joe is a lot like North Dakotan. You know, West Virginians are a lot like North Dakotans. The problem with Senator Manchin in my, you know, observations of him is, he's a pretty good moderate vote unless, you know, Chuck Schumer needs them.And if the vote makes a difference, which is the only time it really matters, he hasn't been that reliable. So you can't rely on that. Kyrsten is a bit even more rebellious than Joe is in her conference as she was in the House when I served with her there. But those are not the things you can count on.Remember, there's a lot, the majority has a lot to give a Senator. They have a lot that they can entice them with like Chairmanships and other things. So I'd rather not test that, Dagen, I'd rather make sure that David Perdue becomes a - comes back for - after reelection and we keep our majority.Senator, Steve Forbes is here. I know, he has something he wants to ask you. Well, many thanks, Steve.STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA: Thank you, Dagen. And Senator, in terms of regulation, what do you see coming against the two parts of your state, energy and agriculture? Regardless of how the Senate race in Georgia goes, the remaining one looks like they're going to go to war against agricultural, environmental regulations, energy pipelines and the like, what do you see on the horizon? Is there anything that can be done to stop that freight train that's going to damage your state?CRAMER: So great point, Steve, and this is one of the - probably the greatest concerns about losing the majority in the Senate. Because remember, Democrats voted unanimously against many of Donald Trump's nominees, for example, at places like EPA, and other agencies.If we lose the majority, we lose that leverage over the administration. So when it comes to, you know, confirming that the advice and consent rule, which is very important in the Senate and unique to the Senate, if we lose that leverage, those things could even be worse. See, there's no question their goals are very clear, and that is to do exactly the things you're doing.I mean, everything from private property rights, to how water is is managed, and land. And then of course, you know, as you said, the energy industry pipelines, the citing the pipelines, I mean that's bad enough as it is with all the consent decrees and the liberal courts. But the one bright spot, Steve, is that for four years, Donald Trump working with Mitch McConnell and Republicans in the Senate has at least nominated and confirmed several very good conservative judges and justices up and down this court system, and that will be the backstop. I just hate to litigate everything.MCDOWELL: Yes, I actually have, you know - because I'm such a nerd, Senator, I have the number of judges written down on a folder that I carry around with me. It's three Supreme Court justices, 54 Appeals Court judges, and 174 Lower Court judges. That's what the Trump administration was able to do.I want to move on to what happens on Capitol Hill today as the Electoral College certifies its votes during a joint session of Congress. A growing number of Republican lawmakers in the House and particularly the Senate are set to challenge the certification, and President Trump is pressuring Vice President Mike Pence, who will oversee the certification.The President went as far as tweeting this. If Vice President Mike Pence comes through for us, we will win the presidency. Many states want to decertify the mistake they made in certifying incorrect and even fraudulent numbers in a process not approved by their state legislatures, which it must be. Mike can send it back.This coming as Trump supporters are set to march on Washington today. President Trump is expected to speak. Senator, you will not be objecting to the certification. Tell me why?CRAMER: Well, for me, Dagen, it's just a matter of conscience and my oath to the Constitution; my conscience captive to God and my oath to the Constitution. The Constitution in my mind is quite clear that Congress has a role to count previously certified by the states where they're supposed to be certified ballots that are provided sealed to the President of the Senate.I don't see an option to that. I do think, however, that the cases that you're talking about in these - some of these swing states, where the legislature didn't authorize the changes that were made, unfortunately in a couple of cases, the courts have determined that the legislature authorized the bureaucrat who did change those laws. And so, that's a challenge, it's going to take longer to litigate than what we have between now and this afternoon.I see nowhere, either in law or statute or the Vice President, as the President of the Senate, has the authority to send them back. I mean, that'd be great if that was true, but I just don't see that he has that authority.MCDOWELL: Right. The Constitution I think only empowers the vice president to open the Electoral College certificates, not even count them. That's not even speaking to the issue of rejecting them.Senator Kevin Cramer, always a pleasure, sir. If I can ever take a road trip, I've got to get to your - got to get to North Dakota.CRAMER: Please do, I'd be happy to host you.MCDOWELL: One of the few states I've never driven through, so I'm on my way eventually.CRAMER: All right.MCDOWELL: Senator, be well. Thank you so much. Coming up, what you need to know about more - the more contagious COVID-19 variant and how to protect children from the spread, we discuss. Plus, Kimye heading for Splitsville, the breakup making a buzz this morning. You're watching Mornings with Maria live on Fox Business.MCDOWELL: Coronavirus crisis, Georgia health officials confirming the first case of the highly contagious COVID variant in a healthy teenager. The CDC reporting at least seven states have the new strain including Colorado, California, Florida and New York. Joining me now is pediatric infectious disease expert Boston Children's Hospital Director of Precision Vaccine Program, Dr. Ofer Levy.Ofer, excuse me, Dr. Levy, a new study - Levy, sorry. I'll get it right eventually and my apologies this morning. A new study suggests that under - that those under the age of 20 are most at risk of contracting this variant. What are your concerns?DR. OFER LEVY, DIRECTOR OF THE PRECISION VACCINES PROGRAM, BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL: Thank you for that, Dagen. This virus is spreading throughout the world and continues to evolve over time; its genetic material is changing as it's spreading. And in the United Kingdom, they've done an excellent job at surveillance, keeping an eye on the genetic sequence of the virus, right taking samples from individuals who are infected and sequencing, doing the genetic sequencing to monitor what the strains are that are moving through the United Kingdom.And the recent study you will allude to indicates that there's a variant that has emerged in the United Kingdom that appears to spread easier between individuals, and to cause a somewhat more frequent disease in those who are under 20 years of age.MCDOWELL: In terms of - so more - the spread, but it doesn't have the health consequences for those who do contract this new variant, is it - is it the same?DR. LEVY: Correct, Dagen. Yes, no. Yes, right. Right. No, thank you for that. Right. To clarify, it does not appear that the - that this variant causes more severe disease. What it does appear to be is that it spreads easier between individuals. And it appears to now have begun spreading more frequently to those younger than 20 years of age.MCDOWELL: Looking at say, what is going on in Los Angeles, in Los Angeles County, I have family who live there, and they're terrified in the way that I certainly felt deep fear coming to work every day, like coming into the building every day and traveling around New York City in the spring. I just want to ask you why it - like that city is virtually locked down. But why is there such a dramatic spread in a place like that? I'm sure you've looked at that.DR. LEVY: Right. So look, California started off pretty well, as you recall early on, California have distinguished itself by having relatively low spread of the virus. But, the ability and the conformity with the measures that are still critical, wearing masks, socially distancing, hand hygiene, just the basics, I think being diligent with that over time is tough. Let's label it.You're doing it one day, one week; that's one thing. Asking people to do that for months and months is very tough. I'm not just an infectious disease specialist. I'm a husband, I'm a father of three kids. I have two teenagers in the house, soon three teenagers. I know how hard it is to be diligent with these things. But it's critical that we all continue to be diligent even as the vaccines come out.We hope in the coming months things look better. We believe that the vaccines will be effective against this UK variant, but we're going to have to continue to have very close surveillance, keeping an eye on what strains are circulating, keeping an eye on whether the vaccine is protecting against the circulating strains. We believe it will, but we need to keep an eye on that.And what's unfolding now in Los Angeles is a tragedy. It appears that the hospital capacity is being outstripped.MCDOWELL: Right. I want to move on to the issue with the vaccines, the latest numbers from the CDC, these are the big numbers - show that out of more than 17 million vaccination doses that have been distributed, only 4.8 million shots have been administered so far. So, over 70 percent of the vaccines are still sitting in freezers waiting to be given out. Where is the delay, because this did fall on the state and local governments to come up with a plan? And certainly, Florida seems to have a better plan than say, New York, which again has been, in my opinion, a disaster.DR. LEVY: Yes, well, I will - I will tell you that overall, as a country, they're like - countries are like human beings. It's no different. We have strengths and weaknesses and tendencies, right? No country is perfect because no human being is perfect. We score, in my opinion, in my opinion, high marks for innovation. Look at what Moderna did; they came out of nowhere, and they're contributing one of the vaccines that's key for us in fighting this pandemic.So, we get an A plus in my book for innovation. I think our Food and Drug Administration process, which I was proud to be a part of, was really an excellent process. But in terms of implementation and public health, we're still working out the kinks, as Dr. Fauci said, and I saw headlines of elderly people in Florida waiting hours online to get a vaccine. That didn't sound like a good system to me.My parents are in Israel; they got the vaccine very rapidly and easily. They're soon going to have 25 percent of their population inoculated (ph).MCDOWELL: I know people, elderly people in Florida who have been vaccinated, but the issue with the lines for elderly people, that was based on what Governor DeSantis was saying yesterday, that was an allocation given to the hospital and it was a hot - an issue with the hospital and the way that the hospital handled it.Doctor, let me get this straight, Ofer Levy.DR. LEVY: Levy.MCDOWELL: I got it right. It's important.DR. LEVY: Thank you for that, Dagen.MCDOWELL: It's important, Dr. Levy, and I wanted to get it right. Thank you so much for being here, very much.DR. LEVY: Thank you, Dagen. A pleasure to be on your show.MCDOWELL: Kim and Kanye calling it quits. New reports that the couple are headed for divorce, Buzz next.MCDOWELL: It's time for the Morning Buzz. Hollywood royalty, no more. The New York Post reporting; it's on the front page today that Kanye and Kim Kardashian West are calling it quits after six years of marriage and four children together. Sources revealing that the couple has been living apart for some time now, and that Kim is "done."The couple's combined worth more than $2.2 billion. Steve, you know what Kim Kardashian wants to do? Pass the bar and continue to work on criminal justice reform. That's kind of awesome.FORBES: It is awesome. We interviewed her - I interviewed her once at a women's conference we had; she impressed that audience. She's not to be underestimated. Even though the marriage with the West we might say is going south, she's a force to be reckoned with, and she already got - helped pass that justice reform bill for President Trump. So, I expect more from her in the future, positive stuff.MCDOWELL: Yes, absolutely. And I was fascinated in terms of Nancy, the finances of it. They have this house in - I think it's in Calabasas, California, that Kanye they made - I think they essentially ripped it down and rebuilt it. But she owns the property. He owns the actual dwelling. Now, they've got to figure out how to split it up.NANCY TENGLER, LAFFER TENGLER INVESTMENTS CIO: Yes, after a $40 million remodel, right, rebuild. Yes, I agree with Steve though. I think the fascinating part is Kim's future career plans. But, there's a lot in this story to chew on, the hologram that he gave - Kanye gave of her father, a very interesting presentation (ph).MCDOWELL: Right.

RENEWABLE ENERGY: Solar companies respond to reports of forced labor in ChinaGreenwireFebruary 4, 2021 ThursdayCopyright 2021 Environment and Energy Publishing, LLCSection: Top Stories; Vol. 10; No. 9Length: 520 wordsBodySolar energy companies have pledged opposition to forced labor and agreed to develop traceable supply chains, after multiple reports linking the industry to forced labor factories in the Xinjiang, China, region. Led by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), 175 companies signed a pledge, including some of the top solar manufacturers in the world such as JinkoSolar Inc. and SunPower Corp. "Forced labor will not be tolerated in our industry," John Smirnow, vice president of market strategy for SEIA, said in a statement. "Given reports of labor abuses in Xinjiang and the inability to conduct independent audits there, solar companies should immediately move their supply chains out of the region." An estimated 50% of the global supply of polysilicon, a key component in solar modules, is produced in the Xinjiang region. Reports have tied many solar companies to forced labor operations in the Xinjiang region, which is infamous for the Chinese government's human rights abuses against Uighurs, a largely Muslim minority group in the region. In October, former President Trump's Deputy National Security Adviser Matt Pottinger said in a speech that Uighur Muslims in China were living in "concentration camps" (Energywire, Oct. 26, 2020). In recent years, Uighurs have been detained by the Chinese government and coerced to work in factories that supply a broad range of goods to Western companies, according to a United Nations report. The situation is complicated by the industry's inability to conduct independent audits on labor in the region. "Progress cannot come at the expense of global human rights," said Zaid Ashai, CEO of pledge signatory Nexamp, in a statement. "We are fully committed to doing everything we can to identify and evaluate the origins of the materials we use, with particular attention to avoiding materials that can be tied to the Xinjiang region of China, where issues of forced labor have been identified." Despite its growing popularity, some top solar companies, like Canadian Solar Inc., First Solar Inc. and GCL-Poly Energy Holdings Ltd. have not yet signed the pledge. SEIA said it is keeping the pledge open for signatures in hopes to expand its coalition. In addition to the pledge, SEIA is crafting a Solar Supply Chain Traceability Protocol that includes a series of steps to responsibly trace solar supply sources. In upcoming months, Smirnow of SEIA said they will work with lawmakers, customs officials and the Biden administration to ensure solar power is free of forced labor. Currently, the United States is blocking some imports and identified some categories of goods that might be made with forced labor in China, but they did not include solar panels or components. "Solar has the potential for enormous positive impact on the world, but that mission is void if products are made on the back of unethical labor practices," Suzanne Leta, head of policy and strategy at SunPower, said in a statement. "Signing the Forced Labor Prevention Pledge was a meaningful first step; now we must be vigilant about continuing to lead our industry to do the right thing."Load-Date: March 4, 2021End of Document

CSIS: 'Future of Competition - U.S. Adversaries & Growth of Irregular Warfare'Targeted News ServiceFebruary 6, 2021 Saturday 12:17 PM  ESTCopyright 2021 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2738 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Center for Strategic and International Studies issued the following commentary entitled "The Future of Competition: U.S. Adversaries and the Growth of Irregular Warfare":The commentary was written by Seth G. Jones, a senior vice president, holds the Harold Brown Chair and is director of the International Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C., and is the author of the forthcoming Three Dangerous Men: Russia, Iran, China and the Rise of Irregular Warfare (W.W. Norton).This commentary is part of CSIS's Global Forecast 2021 essay series.* * *While conventional warfare--set-piece battles between large military forces--largely defined twentieth-century conflict between major powers, irregular warfare will likely define international politics over the next year and beyond. Countries like China, Russia, and Iran compete with the United States using irregular methods because conventional and nuclear warfare are far too costly. The tools of irregular warfare are not strategic bombers, main battle tanks, or infantry soldiers, but hackers, intelligence operatives, special operations forces, and private military companies that often operate in the shadows.Unfortunately, the United States is woefully unprepared for this type of competition--both at home and abroad. U.S. government agencies and departments have erroneously focused too much on planning for conventional and nuclear war, including scenarios like nuclear exchanges and conventional wars in the Baltic states, Taiwan Strait, and South China Sea. Yet China, Russia, and Iran are daily--even hourly--targeting the United States at home and abroad using irregular means. One of the most recent examples was the massive cyberattack against as many as 250 U.S. government agencies and companies by the SVR, Russia's foreign intelligence service.The United States does not need to choose between conventional, nuclear, or irregular competition. All are important. Russia and China are developing conventional and nuclear military capabilities that pose a threat to the United States and its partners. But the challenge for the Biden administration will be to find an equilibrium between preparing for--and deterring--conventional, nuclear, and irregular warfare.From Clausewitz to Sun TzuIrregular warfare refers to activities short of conventional and nuclear warfare that are designed to expand a country's influence and legitimacy as well as weaken its adversaries. As a 2020 Department of Defense publication explained, irregular warfare "favors indirect and asymmetric approaches" by countries "in order to erode an adversary's power, influence, and will." It includes numerous tools of statecraft that governments can use to shift the balance of power in their favor: information operations (including psychological operations and propaganda), cyber operations, support to state and nonstate partners, covert action, espionage, and economic coercion.Many of these tools, such as information and cyber operations, can be used for irregular and conventional campaigns. They are simply a means. In irregular warfare, however, a country designs and uses these tools to undermine its adversaries as part of balance-of-power competition without engaging in set-piece battles. Other government officials and scholars have used different terms--such as political warfare, hybrid warfare, gray zone activity, asymmetric conflict, and the indirect approach--to capture some or all of these activities.In particular, irregular warfare is distinct from conventional warfare, which has sometimes been referred to as "traditional" or "regular" warfare. Conventional warfare involves the use of direct land, naval, air, and other military capabilities to defeat an adversary's armed forces on a battlefield; control territory, populations, and forces; or annihilate an enemy's war-making capacity. Irregular warfare is also different from nuclear warfare, which involves the use--or threat--of nuclear weapons against adversaries. Finally, irregular warfare is distinct from routine foreign policy, which can include diplomatic, humanitarian, intelligence, and other activities that have little or nothing to do with competition against adversaries.Some might object to using the term "warfare" to describe non-violent actions like economic coercion and information operations, but that is not how U.S. rivals see it. They apply a broad view of warfare as "a struggle between competing entities." China has used terms like san zhong zhanfa (three warfares), which includes media, psychological, and legal warfare. None of these aspects involve the direct use of violence. Iran has utilized terms such as jang-e narm (soft war), which includes activities like propaganda and disinformation to influence others. Russia has used aktivnyye meropriyatiya (active measures) for decades as a tool of warfare against the United States and its partners. "The important point," writes U.S. military historian Charles Bartles, "is that while the West considers these non-military measures as ways of avoiding war, Russia considers these measures as war."In short, the future concept of warfare faced by the Biden administration is much closer to the Chinese general and military strategist Sun Tzu than it is to the Prussian military theorist Carl von Clausewitz, who narrowly defined war as an "act of violence intended to compel our opponent to fulfill our will."Active Measures and Three WarfaresIrregular warfare is not new. During the Cold War, Russian services like the KGB waged aggressive irregular campaigns against the United States around the globe. Oleg Kalugin, the former head of foreign counterintelligence for the KGB, described aktivnyye meropriyatiya and similar operations as the "heart and soul of Soviet intelligence" that were used to "weaken the United States" and to "drive wedges in the Western community alliance of all sorts."1As the Biden administration takes office, U.S. adversaries are utilizing irregular strategies and tactics. Perhaps the quintessential example is Russia. Under President Vladimir Putin, Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov, and other officials, Russia employs a mix of offensive cyber operations, espionage, covert action, and information and disinformation campaigns to weaken the United States and expand Moscow's influence. Russia has meddled in U.S. elections and waged a disinformation campaign inside the United States, attempting to inflame social, racial, and political tensions through such issues as Black Lives Matter, Covid-19, the Me Too movement, gun control, white supremacy, abortion, and immigration. Russia has placed malware, such as Triton and BlackEnergy, in U.S. critical infrastructure--threatening power plants, electricity grids, communications networks, and financial systems in the U.S. homeland. Russian agencies have also leveraged shadowy organizations to help conduct information operations and cyberattacks, including the Internet Research Agency (IRA); Kaspersky Lab; networks and online personas with creative names like "Cozy Bear," "Fancy Bear," and "Guccifer 2.0"; and private military companies like the Wagner Group.Overseas, Moscow has attempted to weaken the United States and undermine U.S. relations with its allies. Russian intelligence agencies have conducted disinformation campaigns, falsely charging the United States with supporting the Islamic State and other terrorist organizations in countries like Syria and Afghanistan. Moscow has worked with terrorist groups like Lebanese Hezbollah and nonstate groups in Ukraine, Syria, Libya, and Afghanistan, including the Taliban. The Russian military intelligence agency GRU and the SVR have also provided assistance to political leaders in Europe--including far-right organizations like Italy's Lega Party and Austria's Freedom Party--and created divisions between the United States and its European allies.Iran has also embraced irregular warfare. Tehran possesses formidable irregular capabilities led by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force. The Biden administration's most significant challenge with Iran will not likely be renegotiating a nuclear deal, but rather undermining Iran's irregular warfare campaign across the region and aid to nonstate partners like Lebanese Hezbollah. The Quds Force provides aid nonstate partner forces in Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Lebanon, Afghanistan, and other countries. In addition, Iran maintains the largest ballistic and cruise missile force in the Middle East, courtesy of Russian, Chinese, and North Korean support. Iran has also improved its offensive cyber capabilities and targeted U.S. casinos, dams, the power grid, and financial institutions like Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and the New York Stock Exchange.Finally, China has engaged in irregular activities to achieve its objectives of expanding influence, particularly in Asia; increasing its economic power with a mercantilist view of the world; and surpassing the United States as the dominant global technological, military, and economic power. Beijing has developed one of the most sophisticated cyber capabilities of any of the United States' adversaries through such organizations as Unit 61398 of the People's Liberation Army. China's leaders are attempting to extend the country's global economic, political, military, and technological reach using China's global development strategies like the Belt and Road Initiative. The Chinese government has leveraged the telecom giant Huawei and other technology firms to expand 5G, the fifth-generation technology for cellular networks, and intelligence collection across the globe. Beijing also uses fleets of fishing vessels and has created artificial islands by dumping millions of tons of sand and concrete onto reefs to assert its territorial and resource claims in the Pacific.Chinese influence even extends into the United States. Chinese political and intelligence agencies have conducted operations on U.S. university campuses, including stealing sensitive technologies, collecting information, monitoring Chinese students, and pressuring publishers and researchers not to print negative portrayals of China. Beijing's influence has reached into Hollywood, where approval by the Communist Party impacts whether a major film can be distributed in China, and pressured U.S. studios to alter their content. There are sparingly few Chinese villains in Hollywood movies, a far cry from the Cold War, when movies like The Hunt for Red October pitted the United States against the Soviet Union. As one study concluded, there is an epidemic of "self-censorship" in Hollywood to ensure access to the Chinese market.There is still time for the United States to change course. But the United States needs to significantly alter how it thinks about--and engages in--competition.Irregular CompetitionIrregular warfare today is merely the newest variant of an age-old struggle between competitors. Doing it well will require better understanding the nature of competition today and implementing a strategy and policies aligned with U.S. values. Competition, of course, is not necessarily bad. Competition is at the heart of athletics, academics, and business. Nor does competition prohibit cooperation. Even during the height of the Cold War, the United States and Soviet Union found ways to cooperate in areas like arms control when and where they shared common interests. China will remain an important trading partner in the future and a critical market for U.S. companies. China's economy is growing, its manufacturing sector is the largest in the world by a wide margin, its population of 1.4 billion is an attractive market for U.S. companies, and it boasts 400 million millennials--five times the number as the United States.In international politics, competition today is to a great extent a struggle between rival political, economic, and military systems--between authoritarian, state-controlled systems and democratic ones. Perhaps the single most important step for the Biden administration will be to refashion U.S. foreign policy on the country's core principles, ones that have been in place since the United States' founding. China, Russia, and Iran are all undemocratic and eschew free markets and a free press. They have violently cracked down on democratic movements, developed a state-run economic system, and tried to suppress information by creating a "Great Firewall," Russian "Runet," and Persian "halal net." Even recently, Russia has cracked down on pro-democracy protesters in support of the jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny.The next step is to better understand how China, Russia, and Iran view competition with the United States. Unfortunately, the United States has not learned from its own past. Beijing, for example, invests substantial resources in translating and exploring the contours of U.S. culture and politics. Unlike during the Cold War, the U.S. government and private sector have failed to invest in the language skills and expertise to effectively compete with the Chinese Communist Party. U.S. national security documents argue that the United States and China are engaged in a long-term strategic competition. But you would not know it looking at the U.S. media and the general lack of federal funding for Chinese language programs--a role that was filled by Beijing's Confucius Institutes at U.S. college campuses.One option is to build a twenty-first century open-source information service with congressional support. The United States should start by translating materials from its main competitors--like China, Russia, and Iran--and making them publicly available. Every Xi Jinping speech, for example, should be available in English within a day or two. Machine learning and translation technology from programs like Google Translate have been helpful stopgaps. But they cannot replace translation by humans with a nuanced understanding of local culture, politics, and history. In addition, the U.S. government needs to increase the resources devoted to educating its diplomats, soldiers, and spies in Chinese, Russian, and Persian language, history, politics, and culture. In the "Long Telegram," State Department diplomat and Cold War expert George Kennan urged Americans to study the Soviet Union and truly understand "the nature of the movement with which we are dealing."Finally, the Biden administration needs to conduct offensive--not just defensive--operations, including in the information arena. China, Russia, and Iran are vulnerable--much like the Soviet Union was vulnerable during the Cold War. Their authoritarian political systems and attempt to control access to information--including through state-run media--make them susceptible to a U.S. and Western information campaign. The United States and its partners in Europe, Asia, and other regions should relentlessly expose China, Russia, and Iran's human rights abuses, oppression, and corruption. These adversaries have been involved in the arrest, torture, and assassination of defectors, political opponents, and individuals investigating or prosecuting bribery and fraud. China, for one, already has its hands full, from protesters in Hong Kong and Taiwan to Uyghurs in the Xinjiang autonomous region of China.But there are limits to what the United States can and should do overseas, particularly with military force. The goal of U.S. foreign policy should not be what some have called "liberal hegemony": to spread liberal democracy by toppling regimes and attempting to force liberal values on foreign populations through military intervention. The United States has a responsibility to encourage free trade, democracy, human rights, and other core values--but generally not by military force. The Cold War ended not because NATO countries invaded Poland, East Germany, and other Warsaw Pact countries, but because their populations rose up against tyranny.The U.S. principles of democracy, freedom of religion, and free markets were essential in establishing the United States as a country. They were also critical in winning the Cold War against the Soviet Union. And they are just as critical in outperforming the United States' authoritarian adversaries today and tomorrow.[Category: Political][Category: ThinkTank1]Copyright Targeted News Servicesnull-7377692 T40-MgEditorLoad-Date: February 6, 2021End of Document

After avoiding obstacles, part of a WHO team arrived in China to investigate the origin of the coronavirusCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 14, 2021 ThursdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 646 wordsBodyAn international team of experts arrived in the Chinese city where coronavirus was first detected for politically sensitive research on its origins, amid doubts about Beijing's leeway.The mission of specialists sent to Wuhan by the World Health Organization (WHO) was approved by The Government of President Xi Jinping after months of diplomatic shootings that included an unusual complaint from the DIRECTOR of WHO.After 8 months, China confirms new coronavirus deathScientists suspect that the virus that has already killed more than 1.9 million people since late 2019 was transmitted to humans from bats or another animal, something that probably occurred in southeastern China.The ruling Communist Party, accused of having allowed the spread of the disease that would later become pandemic, claims that the virus came from abroad, possibly in frozen shellfish, but international scientists reject it.Fifteen team members planned to arrive in China, but two tested positive for coronavirus antibodies before leaving Singapore and stayed there again for another test, said WHO, the UN health agency, on Twitter.The rest of the mission arrived at Wuhan Airport and was greeted by air station personnel dressed in special protective suits, including masks - which experts also wore - and anti-pars.The team will have to do two weeks of quarantine, a swab and antibody test for Covid-19, reported CGTN, the English-language TV channel of the Chinese public network CCTV.Specialists will immediately begin working with Chinese experts via videoconference.The team includes experts from the United States, Australia, Germany, Japan, United Kingdom, Russia, Netherlands, Qatar and Vietnam.A spokesman for the Chinese government said this week that they will "exchange views" with Chinese scientists but did not clarify whether they will be able to collect evidence.China had been able to eradicate the pandemic since last spring, thanks to strong movement control measures, widespread use of masks, and mobile phone confinements and tracking apps.But in recent days, several outbreaks have re-emerged in the country, although it is still a long way from cases in other parts of the world.Today, China announced the first coronavirus death in eight months and the highest number of contagions since March.Most new cases occur in Hebei, the vast province surrounding the capital, Beijing, with 81 cases.According to the health authorities, the deceased person was precisely in this province. Arrival by the WHO team. (AP)The last death in China by Covid-19, before this Thursday, dated from last May.According to the official balance sheet, 4,635 people have been killed in the country by Covid-19.This new death in China comes after the emergence of several outbreaks that have led the authorities to act forcefully.Heilongjiang, Russia's neighbouring province, declared the "state of emergency" yesterday. Its 37.5 million inhabitants cannot leave the province except in cases of urgency and the planned congregations were annulled.One of the cities of the province, Suihua, where more than 5 million inhabitants live, was quarantined last Monday.Who's mission initially planned to arrive in China last week, but the visit was cancelled at the last minute because all necessary authorizations were lacking.

WHO asks China for "more data" on initial COVID-19 casesCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 13, 2021 SaturdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 852 wordsBodyExperts from the World Health Organization (WHO) have requested more data from China on the initial cases of COVID-19, the head of the recent research mission that travelled to Wuhan City reported on Saturday. "We want more data. We asked for more data," said Peter Ben Embarek, who led that mission to the city where the new coronavirus officially emerged, to the AFP agency. "There is a mixture of frustration but also a mixture of realistic expectations, in terms of what can be done in the face of time requirements," said the expert, who expects that raw data to be delivered later. The team had requested raw data from the 174 COVID-19 cases that China had identified from the initial phase of the outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019, as well as other cases, but were only provided with a summary, Dominic Dwyer, an Australian infectious disease expert who is a member of the team, told Reuters agency. Primary data of this type are known as "line lists," he said, and would normally be anonymous, but they contain details such as what questions were asked to patients, their answers, and how their answers were analyzed. "It's standard practice in investigating an outbreak," he told Reuters Saturday through a video call from Sydney, where he is currently quarantined. Dwyer said that gaining access to raw data was especially important, as only half of the 174 cases had exposure to the Huanan market, Wuhan's now closed wholesale seafood center and where the virus was initially detected. The four-week mission in Wuhan concluded its work last Monday, with no clear conclusions. Officially the pandemic, which has killed about 2.4 million people worldwide, emerged among bats, which were able to pass it on to humans through another mammal. Authorities reported that the virus was detected in Wuhan in December 2019, but there are doubts as to whether it was not already circulating previously. The team of experts determined that there were no major COVID-19 bulbs in Wuhan or anywhere else before December 2019, but did not bray that perhaps there were isolated cases. Ben Embarek said the team would have wanted access to raw data on diseases such as pneumonia, flu and fever in the city that might shed more light on the onset of the pandemic. Prior to the mission, Chinese scientists had identified 72,000 such cases between October and December. But after deep screening of the cases, they concluded that only 92 patients were able to show symptoms of COVID-19. Of those 92, 67 were able to pass serological tests. They all tested negative for the coronavirus. Ben Embarek explained to the AFP agency that the team could not however have access to the specific criteria that were used. "We're trying to figure out how it goes down from 72,000 to 92," he said. Another team expert, British epidemiologist John Watson, said there was a "frank and comprehensive discussion" about access to all of that raw data, but he said excessive focus on that could be unfair. America, with "deep concerns" The United States has "deep concerns" about China's response to the COVID-19 crisis and wants Beijing to "make its data available from the early days of the outbreak," said U.S. Homeland Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. This statement comes days after a World Health Organization (WHO) research team returned from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the pandemic, without a clear finding on the origin of the virus. Members had to walk the diplomatic tightrope during their stay, with StatesUnited States insisting that a "solid" investigation be conducted while China called for the matter not to be politicized. "We have deep concerns about how the first findings of the COVID-19 investigation were communicated and questions about the process used to reach them," Sullivan said. "It is imperative that this report be independent, with expert conclusions free from intervention or alteration by the Chinese government," he continued. The official called on China to "make its data available from the first days of the outbreak." Despite not having found the origin of the virus a year after the onset of the pandemic, the team of foreign experts agreed that it probably jumped from bats to an unknown animal species before being transmitted to humans. The theory that the virus spread from a lab experiment that went wrong - a theory used by former U.S. President Donald Trump and his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo - seems "extremely unlikely," the team said, while introduced new avenues of investigation. Beijing has repeatedly raised the theory that the virus arrived in China through packaging some products such as frozen shellfish, a theory that the WHO team did not brazen. Sullivan expressed his "deep respect" for WHO, to which the United States rejoins after Trump abandoned it to protest what he saw as Beijing's ineffective response to the virus. But the U.S. official said that "recommiting to WHO also means demanding the highest standards. And at this critical moment, protecting WHO's credibility is an absolute priority."

The scrutiny of Chinese and US authorities, with which Amazon and Alibaba will charge this yearCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 25, 2021 MondayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 624 wordsBodyThe power of great technology is in the eyes of the authorities. Last year in the United States federal and state agencies filed five separate antitrust lawsuits against Alphabet and Facebook, impetus that in this financial year could reach the sovereign e-commerce in the West, Amazon.By coincidence or not, his eastern competence, Alibaba, also faces a challenging year in the context of his relations with the bosses of his native China, who in the last days of 2020 announced the start of an investigation against him.ClaimsOn the U.S. side, the alarm went on with a congressional report, alleging that "Amazon expanded its market power by avoiding taxes, obtaining state subsidies, and engaging in anti-competitive behavior." Thus, on the Chinese side, the State Administration for Market Regulation detailed that it would investigate "alleged monopoly practices" on Alibaba's part.It is thus clear, for Dan Ives, Wedbush's technology expert, to see parallels between the respective confrontations of these companies with their governments. "Amazon and Alibaba, both in different ways, are victims of their own success on the regulatory front," the expert argues, in light of the rise in their shares of 76.3% in 2020 and 1.27% so far in 2021 for Amazon, and 13.2% and 10.9%, respectively, when it comes to Alibaba.Jack Ma reappears after two months and Alibaba's actions soarGreen agenda, more technological regulation and more taxes mark Biden's business policyFacebook and Google will face new antitrust lawsuits in the U.S.From his point of view, "the dominance of companies has further highlighted the dynamics of 'David versus Goliath', which occurs with small businesses that close every day in this Covid environment, while Amazon and Alibaba mint billions."Pablo Foncillas, an academic at IESE Business School, is also not surprised by the fact that governments have set their eyes on Jeff Bezos' $192.2 billion empires and Jack Ma's $53.7 billion. "Today, six e-commerce players account for 60% of world trade. One of them is Amazon, four of these are Chinese, two of whom belong to Alibaba," he says.The alternativesIn this context, he believes that over the course of the coming months we could have news regarding these gigantic internet marketplaces. "Rumor has it that Alibaba can be somehow divided by the Chinese government (...). Amazon is likely that they themselves will decide to self-split, separating Amazon Web Services. It could be in the next 12 and 18 months and but at the same time," Foncillas predicts.While the possibility of a division is precisely what generates the most noise around the prospects of companies, the truth is that outside of the judicial confrontation that could result in that, it is the regulation that has the ability to move more decisively in the coming months, with Beijing determined to order the matter and Washington dyed of a Democrat blue who wants to address the big tech.In this context, one of the complaints that has been repeated is that the companies in question simultaneously serve as key market operators, being able to establish terms, policies and tariffs, while using the accumulated data to launch and sell competitive products."I have doubts that, ultimately, there will be a ban on operating a platform and competing inher, but there might be some rules around the matter," says Jennifer Rie, a lawyer and antitrust analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, who anticipates the direction of regulation that could fall to Amazon and who will surely be following with attention in China.In that context, Ives says that "regulation will be a problem for Amazon, Alibaba and other technology stalwart in the future, as forts become stronger in this coronavirus environment."Load-Date: January 26, 2021End of Document

HONG KONG BN(O) VISA: UK GOVERNMENT TO HONOUR HISTORIC COMMITMENTStates News ServiceJanuary 28, 2021 ThursdayCopyright 2021 States News ServiceLength: 607 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: LONDON BodyThe following information was released by the UK Government:The UK government will deliver on its commitment to open a new visa for Hong Kong BN(O) status holders on Sunday.Published 29 January 2021From:Home Office and Foreign, Commonwealth and Development OfficeThe commitment was made following the Chinese government's imposition of the National Security Law in Hong Kong last year, in breach of its commitments under international law.The visa reflects the UK's historic and moral commitment to the people of Hong Kong who have had their rights and freedoms restricted.Those with BN(O) status and their eligible family members will be able to come to the UK to live, study and work. As with other visas, after five years in the UK, they will be able to apply for settlement, followed by British citizenship after a further 12 months.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said:I am immensely proud that we have brought in this new route for Hong Kong BN(O)s to live, work and make their home in our country.In doing so we have honoured our profound ties of history and friendship with the people of Hong Kong, and we have stood up for freedom and autonomy values both the UK and Hong Kong hold dear.Home Secretary Priti Patel said:Global Britain will always stand up for what is right and uphold our commitments. This new visa delivers on our promise to the people of Hong Kong, honouring our strong historic relationship and upholding their freedoms.I look forward to welcoming people wanting to put down roots and build a new life with their family in the UK.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said:We have been clear we won't look the other way when it comes to Hong Kong. We will live up to our historic responsibility to its people.China's imposition of the National Security Law in Hong Kong constitutes a clear and serious breach of the Sino-British Joint Declaration contrary to international law.With the launch of this new visa route, BN(O) citizens will now have a choice to come and live, work and study in the UK.Applicants for the visa with certain biometric passports will also be able to apply from home using a smartphone app to scan their passport rather than having to visit a visa application centre.From 23 February, BN(O) status holders and their eligible family members who hold a biometric BN(O), Hong Kong Special Administrative Region or European Economic Area (EEA) passport can scan their passport on the app and complete their application from home. They will be the first non-EEA citizens to be able to do so.The UK committed to this visa following the imposition of the National Security Law imposed by the Chinese government in June 2020, in a clear breach of the Sino-British Joint Declaration. The 1984 declaration is a legally binding treaty which commits to ensure the rights and freedoms of the people of Hong Kong and maintain Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy.From 15 July 2020 to 13 January 2021, approximately 7,000 BN(O) status holders and their dependants have been granted Leave Outside the Rules at the border. BN(O) status holders will not need to apply for the new route straight away. We have made the decision to extend the Leave Outside the Rules at the border scheme until after the route becomes fully digital.In addition to the Immigration Health Surcharge, the visa fee payable to stay for five years will be 250 per person or applicants will also be able to apply to stay for 30 months which will cost 180 per person. This is lower than many other visas.The UK government is working with civil society groups and others to welcome BN(O) status holders to all parts of the UK and help them integrate.Load-Date: January 29, 2021End of Document

Alibaba sales surge, even as crackdown in China intensifiesCNN WireFebruary 2, 2021 Tuesday 1:54 PM GMTCopyright 2021 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 903 wordsByline: By Laura He, CNN BusinessDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  Alibaba reported a big quarter for its e-commerce business. But China's most famous tech firm faced nervous investors on Tuesday as a regulatory crackdown by Beijing and co-founder Jack Ma's fall from grace cast a shadow over its future.The company reported a 37% jump in revenue for the quarter ended December compared to a year earlier. That was better than what analysts were expecting, according to forecasts from Refinitiv.Alibaba's core e-commerce operations have benefited during the coronavirus pandemic as people turned to online shopping to buy things without leaving their homes. And the most recent quarter included the company's big Singles Day sales blitz, which brought in tens of billions of dollars last year."Thanks to the rapid recovery of China's economy, Alibaba had another very healthy quarter," said Daniel Zhang, chairman and CEO of Alibaba, in a press release.But strong revenue might not be enough to soothe concerns from investors, who have been rattled by worries over how hard Chinese authorities might come down on Ma's tech empire. Ma, who co-founded Alibaba more than two decades ago, has watched his businesses draw the ire of Beijing in recent months. He's also been snubbed by state-run media: On Tuesday, the Shanghai Securities Journal praised prominent Chinese business leaders in an article about "entrepreneurial spirit." While tech entrepreneurs such as Tencent's Pony Ma and Huawei's Ren Zhengfei were mentioned, Ma was not."Alibaba's earnings can't help but be overshadowed by the recent reappearance of their leader Jack Ma," said Andy Halliwell, senior director of retail at digital consultancy Publicis Sapient, in an email. "If the Chinese government is looking to crack down on outspoken entrepreneurs and take a more conservative line with their larger tech businesses, then this will dent investors' confidence in the brand," Halliwell added.Ma built Alibaba into one of China's most powerful tech titans. It generated nearly $80 billion in revenue for the fiscal year that ended last March, and it has a market capitalization of more than $700 billion, making it one of the world's most valuable tech companies.But Beijing has become increasingly concerned about the clout that big, private tech firms have over the financial industry and other sensitive areas, and how entrenched they have become to everyday life in China through digital payments apps and other services.Last November, shares in Alibaba slid even though the company's earnings topped estimates, as it reported results just after regulators shelved a highly anticipated IPO from its financial affiliate, Ant Group. Since then, the landscape has worsened for Alibaba and other Chinese tech firms. President Xi Jinping in December called efforts to strengthen anti-monopoly rules against online platforms one of the most important goals for 2021, according to state news agency Xinhua. And regulators announced an antitrust investigation into Alibaba on Christmas Eve. Ant Group, meanwhile, has been told to overhaul its online financial business after authorities criticized it for edging out rivals from the market place, harming consumer rights and taking advantage of regulatory loopholes for its own profit.Yi Gang, the governor of the People's Bank of China, said last week at a virtual Davos forum that regulator involvement in that company is ongoing. Ma --- who has retired from the company but still remains a figurehead --- has largely remained out of sight through all of this. He vanished from public view for months before briefly emerging in a video in January to speak to teachers at a philanthropic event.The issues facing Alibaba and Ant have dented the former's share price. Alibaba's New York-listed shares are down about 17% since a peak in late October, a plunge that has wiped off more than $140 billion from its market capitalization. Alibaba shares were up in early trading Tuesday following the earnings release, however.Some analysts suspect Alibaba may survive regulatory scrutiny from China relatively intact. Martin Chorzempa, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said Chinese authorities likely want to be careful "not to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs," after all.But experts warn that the days of unchecked growth are probably over. "It is clear that [Beijing] is going to narrow the scope of managerial independence through regulation and informal 'guidance' to the [Alibaba] conglomerate," said Doug Fuller, an associate professor at the City University of Hong Kong who studies technological development in Asia.As for Ant Group, the company will likely still be allowed to go ahead with an IPO once regulators are finished grilling the company over anti-monopoly concerns and consumer privacy issues, according to Kevin Kwek, managing director and senior analyst at Alliance Bernstein.But if it is forced to make any drastic changes, that could hurt Ant's valuation when it eventually is able to list. Before the IPO was pulled, Ant was expected to become the largest initial public offering ever with a $34 billion share sale. "You can bet the best minds of Ant [are] working on the challenges as we speak," Kwek said. "The question is how much they end up 'giving up' and what that could mean for valuations."TM & © 2021 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Monday, February 1. Your top stories right now 6 AM on the east coast. Markets looking to kick off a new month in the green. Check out futures pointing to a rally at the start of trading this morning.The Dow futures up 159. The NASDAQ up 124 and the S&P 500 higher by 29. All three major indices looking to bounce back from last week's decline. It was in fact the worst week for stocks in three months when the Dow industrials capped it off on Friday with that 620 point decline.The volatility of course driven by GameStop, that is shifting this morning. Online traders now zeroing in on silver. Take a look at the price up better than 10 percent, right now on silver. Well, the deal that never was. Chevron and Exxon reportedly held talks about a merger at the start of the pandemic which could be one of the largest deals ever.The implications of the policies from the Biden administration and weakening demand coming up this morning with this potential mega merger. Seeking a compromise on stimulus. President Biden set to meet with a group of Republicans today who are proposing a pared down coronavirus release bill. We'll get into it with Tennessee Senator Marsha Blackburn this morning.Plus this. Free speech under attack again. Parler CEO John Matze is joining me this morning with an update on tax return. We'll talk with him at 7:30. Then we're watching the Chinese threat as always. You heard it here first. The very latest on the risks American biotech companies take on when doing business with Beijing. What it means for you?And then this, Martha Stewart and Snoop Dogg team up in a new way. The big game they'll be hosting this weekend and it's making a buzz this morning. Mornings with Maria is live right now.A snowy day in New York and Chicago. That's for sure but in Europe we've got gains across the board in stocks. Take a look at European indices this morning. FT100 up about 50. That's three-quarters of a percent. The CAC 40 up 53 and the Dax index in Germany higher by 154.In Asia overnight, stocks were higher across the board. Take a look. Best performer overnight in Asia was in Hong Kong and in Korea, KOSPI and Hang Send up better than 2 percent. Now some of the top stories that we are watching this morning. Merger talks in big energy.According to the Wall Street Journal, the CEOs of Exxon and Chevron discussed a deal last year at the beginning of the pandemic. The preliminary talks reportedly began following the beginning of the pandemic and the expectations that demand was about to decrease for oil and gas.If these two were to combine, the company's market value would top $350 billion. We're watching oil this morning and of course the stocks involved Exxon and Chevron up this morning about one and two-thirds percent and 2 percent apiece. Robinhood cutting down, it the restricted stocks now. The company is narrowing the number of companies from 50 to 8 which includes GameStop, AMC and Blackberry.GameStop continues to have the strictest limitations with traders only allowed to buy 1 stock and 5 auctions. GameStop shares are up this morning ahead of the open by another 4.5 percent. Reddit investors meanwhile have a new target and that is silver, the precious metal hitting its highest level since 2013.The spike in silver comes as the hash tag 'silver squeeze' is trending on Twitter. Silver prices this morning up 10.5 percent and then this President Joe Biden is expected to meet with 10 GOP senators today on their counter proposal to his $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill.The Republicans' $600 billion plan calls for $160 billion for vaccines and testing and expanded unemployment benefits but would reduce direct payment checks from $1400 to $1000. Well, the U.S. is calling on the military in Myanmar to release its pro-democracy leader and other officials detained in overnight raids. This take over reportedly over the military's claims of voter fraud in last November's election.Secretary of State Antony Blinken tweeted in part, "The United States stands with the people of Burma in their aspirations for democracy, freedom, peace and development. The military must reverse these actions immediately."Markets this morning are higher. Take a look at futures indicating a gain of 158 points on the Dow industrials. The NASDAQ is up 116 and the S&P higher by 28. This with silver prices surging this morning as Reddit users target the precious metal. The hash tag 'silver squeeze' trending on Twitter as Reddit's Wall Street bets forum discussed executing a similar move that pushed GameStop shares higher last week.Joining me right now is Lane Generational Founder, Managing Partner and former vice chairman of Raymond James, Fred Lane. Also joining the conversation this morning all morning is Fox business' Dagen McDowell and the King's college in Manhattan, Professor of Business and Economics and Fox business contributor Brian Brenberg. Great to see everybody this morning. Thanks so much for being here. Fred, let me kick it off with you.Your thoughts this morning on what we saw in terms of the squeezes. Now you've got silver being the target.FRED LANE, FOUNDER & MD, LANE GENERATIONAL: Well, you know I've used this term before which is this is the everything bubble and this is speculative excess at its best. We looked at GameStop actually when the stock was in single digits and concluded, you know interesting trade but we don't really trade so we're not going to hold it.So here it is you know at 300 plus so it's been a pretty amazing, it's amazing what's going on in the market, it reminds me a little bit of the internet bubble in the sense that there were a number of companies that had no revenues and would be valued based upon you know any kind of metrics that could have value per employee.Biotech craze have the value per PhD and I think when we look at what's going on with GameStop, it's just a classic speculative frenzy going on here that the move to silver is interesting. If you look at the value of all silver ever mined, it's about $1.5 trillion so the silver market's rather small and so to focus on these companies is - it's a little strange because quite honestly silver is an industrial commodity.It could in fact be playing - the investors could be playing the commodity cycle and the prospect of inflation but I think it's something a little different which is just basically playing against the shorts and trying to create a short squeeze.BARTIROMO: Yes you're - I agree. I mean Robinhood is continuing to limit some trading today on short squeeze names. The stock trading app restricting eight stocks, coming down from as many as 50 on Friday but those names today are GameStop, AMC, Blackberry, Koss, Express, Nokia, Genius Brands International and Naked Brand Group.Fred, as a as an investor, what do you make of this, that there are these trading restrictions on certain names?LANE: Well, I don't - I don't like it quite honestly. I think it's - I think what they are doing is they're trying to control the shorting activity but you know the Reddit users and this group of Robinhood investors who I find to be - I mean I find it immensely amusing, having been on the market for 44 years.BARTIROMO: Yes.LANE: And I find it and looks, there are people who are going to make money on this and they're going to be people who aren't going to make money in this you know. This is - some of these stocks, it almost reminds me of the tulip craze of 600 years ago.I mean it really is kind of crazy, these companies fundamentally don't have underlying values that are anything approaching the values that are being attributed to them but you know, this is - this is how speculative markets work and I think for market - for the brokerages to try to control the short, it just means they're going to move to different short position.BARTIROMO: Whoa, what about is it speculation - is it speculation in the oil market this morning Fred? What do you make of this story, it was in Bloomberg and the Journal that the CEOs of Chevron and Exxon discussed the possibility of merging. They would - they saw the demand situation weakening at the beginning of COVID-19, that would be negatively impacting oil prices.Now these reports say that the talks are not ongoing. They're described as preliminary according to the Journal but this would be a huge deal $350 billion market value and of course we know that - you know changing the fundamentals in terms of the oil markets. What's your take? Do you think a deal would happen or what - how do you look at something like this?LANE: It wasn't so long ago that Exxon was the most highly valued company in the United States by market cap.BARTIROMO: That's right.LANE: And now we're talking about a gigantic merger between two of the highest quality oil companies with a combined market cap perhaps $350 billion to $400 billion which is a fraction of some of the largest individual companies in the S&P.I think what's happened is that fossil fuels have gone - are really - they're under attack and they're under attack globally by central governments and by legislators. The subsidies for alternative fuels are going to drive people to other approaches for energy. If we want truly clean energy, in my opinion we need nuclear, put that aside but if you look at Exxon and you look at Chevron, they both face long term existential risks with respect to their business.They have to take that free cash flow and redeploy it into other areas, maybe it will be renewables, may be it will be nuclear, maybe hydrogen but in order to save themselves in my opinion long term and I'm talking about a 20-year perspective, a 30-year perspective, they need to look at strategic alternatives.So I think the combination of these two power houses makes a lot of sense but executing a strategy of redeployment of assets is going to be a complicated one. It's going to take a lot of time and a lot of patience.BARTIROMO: Yes and then we would probably see synergies and more job cuts there as well on an industry that is already seeing a significant number of job cuts because of policy. Fred, real quick, how are you allocating capital right here, knowing that we are looking at slowly but surely an improving economy.I don't know if you agree with that actually.LANE: No, I do agree with that and I think that there are - I would say there are three areas that we're focusing on. You know we try to avoid being market timers because market timing is not the issue, it's time in the market that's the issue. You really have to be invested and I think I've lived through a lot of cycles and been rather casual about taking money off the table because I think the long term growth outlook has been always very positive.And I think - I think it remains so today. The consumer is strong so what we're doing is we're basically continue to focus heavy allocation to technology and then we also are looking at - we also are looking very, very strongly at consumer related companies that are going to accelerate growth coming out of the pandemic.I might add that healthcare falls into that category of consumer because a lot of health care procedures have been deferred and then the last area that we're really focusing on are areas that are going to be favored by inflation and by frankly the movement to other forms of energy.So we're looking at lithium, we've been in silver and we've been in gold for a while so I'm chuckling about the movements in silver because we consider these to be anchors of value not necessarily big growth areas.BARTIROMO: Yep Fred, it's great talk with you this morning. Thanks so much.LANE: Thank you Maria.BARTIROMO: All right, have a great Monday. Fred Lane joining us. Your Morning Mover this morning is bitcoin. Elon Musk giving the cryptocurrency another boost after declaring he is a supporter. In a new interview, the CEO of Tesla saying that bitcoin is "on the verge of getting broad acceptance by conventional finance people."As you can see it is down from earlier highs this morning but is now at 34,090. We're just getting started this morning. A lot coming up. Stay with us. Stimulus is in focus this morning. Florida Congressman Michael Waltz is here to discuss where the negotiations stand and then next hour GameStop, Robinhood, silver and more. We're breaking down all the top market moving stories on Wall Street in the Word on Wall Street.Plus the CEO of Parler's here. John Matze giving us an update on getting that app back online. In the 8:00 AM hour former New York Stock Exchange CEO, Dick Grasso will join us giving up his outlook on GameStop and what it means for markets this morning. Plus Tennessee Senator Marsha Blackburn will join us to break down where the Senate stands on stimulus and former Customs and Border Protection Acting Commissioner Mark Morgan laid out the week's planned executive orders.They will likely focus on immigration. The concerns they raise for border security. Don't miss a moment of it. You're watching Mornings with Maria live on Fox Business. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Stimulus showdown continues. President Joe Biden is set to meet with a group of 10 Senate Republicans early this week in an effort to reach an agreement on the next round of coronavirus relief. The Biden administration so far put forth a $1.9 trillion package while Republicans are pushing for a $600 billion package.Joining me right now is Florida congressman, House Armed Services Committee member and former Green Beret himself, Michael Waltz. Congressman, it's great to see you this morning. Thanks very much for being here. Where do we stand by stimulus?Do you expect something to pass?REP. MICHAEL WALTZ (R-FL): I think something will pass eventually. I'm encouraged to see one thing and that is the Biden administration looking to do two things with the stimulus checks. One is lower the threshold so that those who most need them, that's the income threshold. In previous rounds it was people under 75,000 received these check.I understand there are talks under way to lower that threshold and then secondly to make it more targeted. You know, I don't know that employees of companies like Netflix or Amazon or others who have been booming in the last year need the stimulus checks. They need to be targeted to people who need them the most and then my concern still remains that we don't need taxpayers in Florida bailing out the lockdown policies of Cuomo in New York or Newsom in California or Illinois.These lockdown policies have devastated businesses, devastated individual income and therefore it devastated their state tax budgets and now they want to have a federal tax dollars go to bail those out, whereas states like Florida and Texas have been able to manage their state budgets because the best way to stimulate the economy is to keep it open safely.BARTIROMO: Yes in fact Senator Schumer has already put forth a formal push to get the salt deduction back in in New York to pretty much bail them out because of the high taxes in New York.WALTZ: Yes, yes Maria, it's worth noting that Florida and New York by example have roughly the same population yet New York state's budget is double, double, at $180 billion versus Florida's $90 billion state budget.Yet there are thousands of people moving into Florida per day and we managed to serve our constituents well so that's exactly what it is. It's a bailout and all it is, is shell gaming people and many of these people have escaped those high tax states. Now they're going to see their federal tax dollars going right back in and then one other thing Maria.This issue of schools and opening the schools. You know Democrats need to stand up to the teachers unions. There's no reason these schools can't be opened and in the last stimulus package just in December, just a month ago, we passed monies for school but now we're seeing Bernie Sanders and others say that if Republicans are serious about opening schools, they'll pass another round of monies in this next stimulus package.We have had kids in school since last August. They're - they're doing fine. We give families the choice of doing virtual or in-person. We need to open the schools, we need to open them now.BARTIROMO: Well, you and the leadership in Florida Governor DeSantis have done an excellent job and the numbers you know bear that out. Look at how many people are moving to Florida. Look at the growth numbers in terms of the economy we're seeing in Florida and the mortality rates are actually better in Florida than in New York even though your economy there in Florida is wide open.You can't say it anything negative about you know much because of the censorship that we're seeing by big tech. Yesterday on Sunday Morning Futures, I spoke with California Congressman Devin Nunes on this effort within the government and social media platforms to silent conservative voices and what it means for the country. Listen to what Congressman Nunes said. I want to get your take on this as well Sir. Watch.WALTZ: OK.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA): You have political parties that decide that they want to go out and hire a bunch of people, develop a narrative that you go out and get reporters to go report on and then the FBI takes it and picks it up and then uses it in the FISA court to actually make whatever the news narrative you want real. They turn the entire apparatus of the intelligence agencies on Americans that they don't like, Americans who may be voted for Trump, Americans to use Parler, who think that Twitter and Facebook and Google and Apple are monopolies and antitrust and they should be broken apart.There's 75 million Americans who don't like those companies who don't want to use those companies but have to. Now what you're going to see is the FBI to the military is all going to be politicized because supposedly, if you didn't vote the way the left and the socialist Democrat party wanted, you're now a domestic terrorist.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: This is - this is the new watchword from your colleagues on the left Congressman. It's domestic terrorism and it's basically encapsulating a lot of people who didn't do anything wrong.WALTZ: Well, that's absolutely right. They're expanding - they're expanding the use of that term and we are seeing - we are seeing elements of law enforcement and elements of the intelligence community reacting to news reports and those news reports are being driven. We saw famously with Schiff down and his selectively leaking items literally as people were - were testifying which then drives media reporting. Big tech picks it up.BARTIROMO: Congressman.WALTZ: And they take it. I've introduced legislation--BARTIROMO: And the cycle goes on and the cycle goes on. Congressman, we're going to continue spotlighting this issue. We recognize how important it is. Thank you so much Michael Waltz. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The China threat, you heard it here first and we continue reporting. Now new concerns over China stealing your DNA. A former top U.S. counterintelligence official telling 60 minutes last night that China's BGI group, the world's largest biotech firm is trying to grab your genetic material. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Bill Evanina suspects these lab offers are modern day Trojan horses. BGI comes to the U.S. bearing gifts but harboring other motives. It's unclear whether BGI or any COVID tester would get DN. from nasal swabs he says but the labs are a way to establish a foothold to bring their equipment here, start mining your data and set up shop in your neighborhood.Chinese companies like BGI are obligated to share data with the Chinese regime.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Chinese government, whether it's biotech or - they can say hey, we want your information, please provide it.BILL EVANINA, FMR NATIONAL COUNTERINTELLIGENCE SECURITY CTR DIR: Absolutely. You must provide any all data that's asked for by the Communist Party in China which the scary part is sometimes, it's not all their data. If you are in a joint partnership, a joint venture, their data is now susceptible to go to the Chinese Communist Party.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Yes, Evanina also notes that BGI already has partnerships with U.S. hospitals, biotech companies giving BGI and by extension the Chinese government access to our DNA, a topic we covered closely on this program. Dagen McDowell, we started investigating the Chinese Communist Party because of the theft of intellectual property and what we learned in terms of this overall approach in theft.Stealing intellectual property, stealing DNA was just incredible and we continue learning new things about the CCP and their motives.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: You have talked about this Maria longer than anybody that China wants to be the world's number one super power and will achieve that at by any means necessary and that includes - I mean that one - there's one statistic from this report that current - their current estimates say that 80 percent of American adults have had all their personally identifiable personal information stolen by China and by the Communist Party.It is just again, I thought this myself when I've gone to get COVID test over and over again, who is securing this most personal information about me. To add to this in the Wall Street Journal today, they have a story about, it was printed yesterday or published yesterday about a government SWAT team, it's about two dozen people working with and the committee on foreign investment in the U.S. that is built out a new enforcement arm to go back and look out - look at old investment deals that involves sensitive technologies that could pose a threat to national security.They're looking for any infiltration by Chinese investors and by extension the Communist Party into even the smallest deals here in the U.S. and I think it goes to the point we really don't know how much China has infiltrated the U.S. economy and how much information they have on us.BARTIROMO: And they've been able to get inside of our institutions and target influencers within the U.S. economy. That's why the concern about Hunter Biden was so important that we brought forth because they were able to get to him and pay him money. They were able to get to professors at MIT at Harvard and pay them money to send the data back. Brian, in my view the whole world should be worried about this because you don't want - you don't want a communist country Brian to be running the world where they're surveilling their people and tracking everything.MCDOWELL: Yes, I don't think that - I think Brian's shots a little funky this morning. Blame the - blame the weather.BARTIROMO: But Dagen, you know what I mean right, I mean, having a communist country be the dominant country in the world should worry the entire free world.MCDOWELL: And that's what's so perplexing about the -- how aggressive American companies are at getting into China, doing business in China because it comes at a cost. And to what extent are you --BARTIROMO: Right --MCDOWELL: Putting yourself, your customers and your shareholders at risk because you are in bed with the Chinese Communist Party. And their goal is to dominate that business --BARTIROMO: Yes --MCDOWELL: Those customers and the world.BARTIROMO: Well, I'm glad you brought up the corporate sector, Dagen, because this fight will be played in corporate America. This cold war will play out in corporate America as we see some of our most important financial institutions just getting licenses to operate on the --MCDOWELL: Right --BARTIROMO: Ground. JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs -- look, if you need any, you know, example of who is in charge, just look at Alibaba, just look at the Ant Group, Jack Ma; founder of those companies made the mistake of criticizing the CCP and the regulatory backdrop. What happened? The Ant Group IPO, $30-plus billion was pulled and he wasn't seen for two months. I mean, literally, they disappear people. They disappear Jack Ma for two months, we don't know what happened within that two months.MCDOWELL: Right --BARTIROMO: Whether he had to go to some re-education camp or what. It's very disturbing.MCDOWELL: Exactly.BARTIROMO: Yes, we'll take a break, we're going to continue spot-lighting this, that's for sure. Stay with us, we've got a market underway that is trading higher, up about 250 points on the Dow Industrials, we had a big pick-up in the last 20 minutes. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, good Monday morning everybody, thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday, February 1st, let's take a look at markets where a rip run rally is underway, Dow Industrials at the high of the morning right now. We are kicking off a new month in the green with the Dow right now up 255 points, that is almost 1 percent, the Nasdaq up 148 points, better than 1 percent, and the S&P higher by 40 points, all three major indices looking to bounce back from last week's decline. In fact, last week, it was the worst week for stocks in three months, Dow Industrials were down 620 points on Friday as you can see there, the volatility driven by GameStop, that this morning, though, is shifting, online traders are now zeroing in on silver.Take a look at the price of silver this morning, up better than 10 percent, just under $30 on silver. Meanwhile, it is snowing out. A nor'easter is slamming the East Coast, Cheryl Casone with all the details there. Cheryl, good morning to you.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS HOST: Oh, good morning Maria, yes, here we go, more than 80 million people are under extreme storm watches this morning. State of emergencies have been declared including in New York and New Jersey. New York City can see up to 20 inches of snow. And Virginia's slippery roads causing this fire truck to roll over, four firefighters escape without injuries. The storm moving into the northeast this morning from the Midwest where some Chicago neighborhoods saw nearly 13 inches of snow. Well, some encouraging news in the fight against the coronavirus. For the first time in nearly two months, the number of Americans hospitalized with COVID has dropped below 100,000.The number of cases dropping about 17 percent last week with hospitalizations dropping 10 percent. Despite fewer cases, you know, at the end of the month, January remains the deadliest month to date with more than 95,000 deaths. More than 440,000 people have died since the beginning of this pandemic. Well, Facebook's war with Apple could be headed to a courtroom. Facebook is reportedly preparing an anti-trust lawsuit against Apple, accusing it of forcing developers to follow app store rules that its own apps don't have to follow. At the center of the feud, Apple's new app tracking transparency feature which requires people to often to apps collecting their data. Facebook calls the move an attack on personalized advertising.Toys "R" Us has closed the only two stores they have left in the U.S. just a year after a highly anticipated re-launch of the historic brand, physical stores particularly in the malls have been hurt by weak customer traffic amid the pandemic. The Toys "R" Us website remains operational and its 700 stores outside the United States still remain open. And finally this, the pandemic won't put a pause on showering your sweetie with love according to the National Retail Federation, more than half of Americans will spend in total about 2.8 billion on Valentine's Day. Many couples though planning for a nice night in instead of dinner out on the town. But spending still is going to be down from last year, consumers will dish out about $164 each, that's down, though, Maria, $32 on average per person. And those are some of your headlines from the newsroom, back to you.BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl, thank you so much. We are looking at the new vaccines coming on the market, Johnson & Johnson announced its single dose vaccine provides strong protection against COVID-19. This vaccine's efficacy rate dropped to 57 percent, though, down from 72 percent after concerns that it would provide protection from the new strains of the virus in the United States. Joining me right now is the founder and CEO of Celularity, Dr. Robert Hariri. Dr. Hariri, great to see you again, thanks very much for being here. Do you think that the vaccines will give the protection needed against the virus and these new strains? Tell us the actions you're giving, telling patients and how to bolster their immune system these days.ROBERT HARIRI, FOUNDER & CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, CELULARITY: Well, great to see you again, Maria, and thank you. It's important that we manage expectations around the new vaccines that have been developed for COVID-19 in record time. The data that's being quoted and the clinical experience thus far is based on relatively small studies and small numbers of patients. And the studies based on different designs and so on show very promising results. Most importantly that they're protecting patients from moderate to severe disease. But they don't necessarily block disease in everyone. So I think we have to take a lot of this with a grain of salt and monitor the effects over time.BARTIROMO: Yes, how do you assess where we are right now Dr. Hariri? I mean, there are so many concerns that, you know, the vaccines are coming on the market, but so are the new strains coming into the -- you know, into the popular -- Stephen Lynch, Congressman Lynch recently tested positive for COVID, he received the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine. So he got the entire vaccine -- supposed to be 95 percent efficacy and he got the virus anyway.HARIRI: Remember, a vaccine is only as good as the immune system is being injected into. We already know the vast majority of people who get infected have either mild or generally no real illness, but it's the elderly and people with other -- what we call co-morbid conditions, bad health that are at most at risk. The common denominator here is the underlying immune system with the congressman, you know, clearly, he had enough exposure to the vaccine to begin to mount a response, but underlying his own immune capabilities, he may not have been able to mount a more durable response to protect him. And by the way, the fact that he tested positive doesn't necessarily mean he wasn't provided protection. You know, testing positive doesn't necessarily mean you're ill.BARTIROMO: Yes. Dr. Hariri, what's most important in terms of strengthening our immune systems? I mean, do you -- do you believe, do you also advocate things like, you know, taking Zinc regularly, Vitamin D3 -- I feel like I've been taking zinc and Elderberry since last March. I don't know if it's --HARIRI: Right --BARTIROMO: Doing anything, but you know, I've certainly been on that, and I'm following the hype. Am I right?HARIRI: So Elderberry and Zinc and Vitamin D3 have all generated some really interesting evidence that they can protect you and stimulate your immune system to function at a higher -- at a higher tempo. Look, under normal conditions, 10 percent of average people fail to develop immunity after conventional vaccines. What we really need to be thinking about, though, is look, vaccination gives your immune system a preview of their pathogen. And you have to develop your own response to that in order to have protection against disease. What we need to recognize is that just like the nutrients you're talking about, there are other approaches which can augment immune function.Remember, in cancer, we recognize that not everybody responds to chemotherapy. You need to have a high functioning, high performance immune system to get the best results. Immunotherapy --BARTIROMO: Yes --HARIRI: Is for viral infections, I think we'll be a very important next wave. And as you already know, Regeneron, Sorrento, other companies are developing immune therapies for COVID-19. And I think that's where a lot of promise exist perhaps above and beyond even vaccines.BARTIROMO: And Dr. Hariri, let me turn to business because you've seen a tremendous amount of growth in your own business. You're taking Celularity public with this merger with GX. Tell me about it and why this is -- is this a spark? Walk us through the growth story for Celularity.HARIRI: So, Maria, as you know, Celularity was a spinoff from Celgene Corporation, we were the one and only spinoff company dedicated to the platform of technology we invented around using cells and other biologic materials from the postpartum placenta. The platform is very rich. We had access to cells that are -- that are stem cells as well as immune cells, and we were looking towards moving towards the capital markets in order to take advantage of the funding necessary to fuel very active and aggressive clinical programs. So, GXGX, the special purpose acquisition corporation that we partnered with was ideally situated and suited for our purposes. Number one, they provided us great certainty upon our process to go public.They provided speed that, obviously, is essential in a fast-moving technology sector. And they provided great value. We were able to rise -- to raise our pipe around, our private investment in a public enterprise to our existing strategic investors --BARTIROMO: Yes --HARIRI: And we were able to move very quickly and efficiently towards being public. So we're very excited. Celularity has a potential to be a leader in cellular therapy, not just in cancer, but in degenerative diseases, and clearly even in treating viral diseases. So the GXGX stock was an ideal partner for us.BARTIROMO: That is just terrific. Dr. Hariri, we'll be watching the growth story as you take to the capital markets, congrats to you. It obviously gives the company that much more scale which we will cover. Dr. Robert Hariri, come back soon. Thanks very much.HARIRI: Thank you very much, Maria.BARTIROMO: All right, we'll see you soon. Coming up, the CEO of Parler John Matze is here with an update on getting Parler back online. It's next hour, you're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Cold ones for the community. New Jersey Craft Beer company ship Bottom Brewery creating special brews with proceeds going straight to healthcare workers, giving back even in today's tough business climate. Joining me right now is Ship Bottom Brewing President Robert Zarko. Robert, thanks very much for being here. What a very great gesture. Tell us more about what you're doing.ROBERT ZARKO, PRESIDENT, SHIP BOTTOM BREWING: Thank you, Maria, I really appreciate it, good morning. So in the beginning of the pandemic, we decided to actually brew a cold brew coffee, and I came out and donate that to the healthcare workers in southern New Jersey and around the Philadelphia area. It was really successful, we wanted to help out the people on the frontlines, and that really helped them.BARTIROMO: That is --ZARKO: And we love doing it.BARTIROMO: Well, it's wonderful to do, we all are so grateful for the healthcare workers, being on the frontlines of this nightmare. How has your business been impacted? Tell me about the COVID impact and the lockdown impact on business.ZARKO: Well, when it first happened we never expected that. So it was a real challenge. We didn't know what to do, we were scared. We didn't know whether we should shut down or produce. We had our initial meeting within the staff to talk about how we would do this. How we would protect ourselves, how we would protect our customers. At first, our business wasn't open at all for customers. So, from March until mid-June, we had to do business just by packaging.No one was ordering draft beer, we had to basically go into our cases and package in 16 ounce cans, and decided to move forward. So, most important thing was to keep our staffing customers protected, and then, you know, watch market trends, see what was going on. We are able to do different things by doing home delivery, curbside pickups, and then you know, we saw real surge in the market where people were buying more and more of our beers, our hard ciders and our hard seltzers, so we --BARTIROMO: Terrific --ZARKO: Started attacking the market and go into new areas.BARTIROMO: Wow, you know, you had to completely change the way you do business right? That was incredible. How can viewers get some of the beer, where do they get it then in terms of wanting to support your company?ZARKO: Right now, we're available in New Jersey and southeastern Pennsylvania. We're also doing shipping with UPS as a partner. So, they're going out to multiple --BARTIROMO: OK --ZARKO: States, and then we're looking at, you know, shipper, which is shipping our hard ciders.BARTIROMO: Terrific. Robert, we will be there, we will be watching the developments, thanks very much for all that you're doing. Robert Zarko joining us there. Stay with us, we'll be right back. We got the morning buzz on the other side of this. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, it is time for the Morning Buzz. First up, the 17th Annual Puppy Bowl, I look forward to this every year. Martha Stewart and Snoop Dogg are set to co-host this year's Puppy Bowl. The duo will comment on Sunday's canine competition in efforts to bring awareness to animal shelters. Dagen, how can you not love this? What do you think of the host for the Puppy Bowl?MCDOWELL: Apparently, they will have their own dogs on the program as well. Martha Stewart, I know that historically, she's owned Chow Chows, I'm anxious to see Snoop's dogs as well. I mean, you just want to take those puppies and just rub them in your face and smell them, and that puppy --BARTIROMO: Yes --MCDOWELL: Smell.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: You're right. Like I like to see Charlie and Gail and Dusty at that Puppy Bowl one of these days. I'd like to see some more and more teases too.MCDOWELL: Exactly.BARTIROMO: All right, next up, there's my Dusty. Wall Street that's going to the Box Office. MGM Studios gaining rights to a book proposal about the Wall Street's best Reddit forum that shook up the stock market the last week. Brian, what Hollywood stars, I mean, fit this part?(LAUGHTER)BRIAN BRENBERG, PROFESSOR OF BUSINESS, KING'S COLLEGE: Maria, I'm embarrassed to say I had to do a Google search for Hollywood stars to try and figure out, and not get a big problem here. I don't know, Chris Pratt kind of came to mind, maybe a James Franco or something in that category guy who kind of play that role of a -- you can imagine sitting at home kind of shaking up the world from their -- from their desk. But it's kind of crazy that we're talking about a movie being made about a story that we're right in the middle of. I mean, how do we know this is a good movie yet? We're still right in the middle of it, we don't know how it ends. So it seems a little premature to me --BARTIROMO: Yes, that's true, what do you think, Dagen?MCDOWELL: Timothy Shalloway would probably star in it -- it has to be like young people who I probably wouldn't even recognize. But how -- we already had the big short which I thought was kind of a terrible movie.(LAUGHTER)I mean, it's hard to make a film about people sitting in front of a computer, right? That's --BARTIROMO: Yes --MCDOWELL: That's essence of it.BARTIROMO: Yes, it takes a lot of explanations too --MCDOWELL: Yes.BARTIROMO: All right, we'll take a break, when we come back, we are once again looking at GameStop, Robinhood, Silver, a lot more. We are breaking down what is going to be a very strong rally this morning with the word on Wall Street. It all starts in the next hour. MORNINGS WITH MARIA continues live on Fox Business.

International Federation of Journalists: China - Ex-Journalist Sentenced to JailTargeted News ServiceJanuary 13, 2021 Wednesday 8:20 AM  ESTCopyright 2021 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 359 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: BRUSSELS, Belgium BodyThe International Federation of Journalists issued the following news release:Former Chinese journalist and renowned critic of internet censorship Zhang Jialong was sentenced to 18 months in prison on January 8 for his remarks on social media that were allegedly aimed at "spreading false information and provoking trouble". The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) condemns the assault on freedom of speech and calls on Chinese authorities to overturn the verdict and release Zhang immediately.The 32-year-old former journalist with Caijing, a Beijing-based magazine, and Tencent was found guilty of "picking quarrels and provoking trouble," a broadly defined charge often levelled by the authorities against those who are critical of the Chinese government.Zhang was jailed for 18 months, his wife Shao Yuan said after being notified by Zhang's lawyer on January 8.Zhang was arrested at his residence in Guiyang, Guizho Province on August 12, 2019 and has been held in police custody ever since. The authorities later accused him of spreading false information defaming the Chinese Communist Party on Twitter.His Twitter posts related to human rights issues and internet freedoms in China.Zhang has been detained since August and is therefore expected to be released on February 12. Nevertheless, Zhang reportedly vowed to appeal against the ruling.Zhang has been targeted by the Chinese authorities for several years. In February 2014, hemade headlines after asking the then-U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry to help "tear down this great firewall that blocks the Internet" during their meeting in Beijing.He later published an op-ed in the global magazine Foreign Policy, calling on the U.S. government to deny visas to those involved in building and maintaining the Chinese great firewall of censorship. He was subsequently fired from Tencent.IFJ General Secretary Anthony Bellanger said: "We call on Chinese authorities to stop this smear campaign against Zhang Jialong immediately, overturn a verdict based on unwarranted charges and release him immediately."[Category: Media]Copyright Targeted News ServicesC20-RajeshS-7350210 C20-RajeshSLoad-Date: January 13, 2021End of Document

The company coming in at $30.16 billion, but his comments again are crossing the tape.They're keeping their reserves a little bit higher, which I think is part of the story here. They're saying they're going to keep reserves over $30 billion. Remember that we started to see the banks do that in 2020 because of the pandemic and the uncertainty.He says, look, we're just not - we're not quite ready as of now to really draw down those reserves. (inaudible) looking for the companies to start to do that. They do say that there is significant near-term economic uncertainty, and this is, again, a headline coming from Jamie Dimon. He also says we're setting about $1.4 trillion of cash and marketable securities. That's over $450 billion of what they're actually required by the Fed, but basically they're saying that they need to be kind of cautious.Real quick, I do want to let you know investment revenue - investment banking revenue was up 37 percent, so markets moving higher helped the bank. Also they're going to initiate stock buybacks in the first quarter of 2021.There was some - there was some thought they might start to do that in the fourth quarter because they could at the very end of the month, but they did not do that. So again, it's more of the comments coming, Maria, from Jamie Dimon at this point, and again it's they're kind of keeping that reserve in hand just in case, and I think that's kind of the story right now. Back to you.BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, look. You had a very strong capital markets business. Investment banking was one of the real strong spots here, so when you look at it, the actual categories of business, look at the deposits. Money continuing to move into the deposit base at JPM. The numbers look strong, but of course Jamie Dimon is giving some cautious commentary, which I guess had the stock down. It has reversed course and is now up a fraction, about a third of a percent.Now some of the top stories that we are watching this morning. Joe Biden yesterday unveiled his COVID relief plan. It was $1.9 trillion proposal and includes more stimulus money for Americans and a nationwide vaccination effort. Biden says he wants to increase weekly unemployment benefits by $400 a week and give Americans $1,400 in stimulus. He is also planning to raise the minimum wage to $15.Meanwhile a left-wing activist who claimed he travelled to Washington to document the siege on Capitol Hill is now facing charges for his involvement. This after new video shows John Sullivan encouraging people to storm the Capitol.(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)JOHN SULLIVAN: We got to burn this (inaudible). We got to get this (inaudible) burned. Oh my God. We did this (inaudible). We took this (inaudbile). It's our house, (inaudible).(END VIDEOCLIP)BARTIROMO: Oh God, several videos were posted by Sullivan of the riots on YouTube. They were posted on YouTube under a different name. He has been arrested. Twitter CEO, Jack Dorsey, meanwhile admitted on camera that more censorship is coming on the platform.In a video leaked by Project Veritas, Jack Dorsey is heard and seen telling the company's 5,400 employees that the recent ban on President Trump is, quote, "bigger than just one account and that they must think about how the long-term dynamics play out overtime." A Twitter spokesperson said that the leaked comments are nearly the same as Dorsey shared in recent tweets. He says there is more to come on tape.Time for the Word on Wall Street. Top investors watching your money this week. Joining me right now is SlateStone Wealth Chief Market Strategist, Kenny Polcari; Stifel Chief Economist, Lindsey Piegza; and Rosecliff Capital CEO and Managing Partner, Mike Murphy. Great to see everybody this morning. Happy Friday. Thanks for being here. Mike, kicking it off with you.We are watching the banks this morning. JPMorgan just reported a better- than-expected quarter. Very strong numbers here with $30.16 billion in revenue. We're going to hear from Citigroup and Wells Fargo later today. What's your reaction as we watch bank stocks traded lower this morning?MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL CEO AND MANAGING PARTNER: Good morning, Maria. Nice to see you. Yes. JPMorgan put up a very strong 1quarter, but I think you have to step back and look at the stock's performance over the last three months. It's up almost 40 percent in that time period, so the stock had a big run into this quarter. I think the Street was expecting this strong quarter from JPMorgan.There's nothing here that makes me want - we own the stock. There's nothing here that makes me want to sell it. There's nothing here that makes me want to run out and buy it either. I think Jamie Dimon is kind of talking down the quarter a little bit, but really what I wanted to see was release of reserves. You know, they reserved a lot of money last year. I wanted to see more of that money.They released some. I wanted to see more of that coming out because I think the big story, Maria, when you talk whether JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup, any of these large banks I want to see innovation. I want to see growth. You know, my money was in JPMorgan last year, and for the year it returned roughly 2 percent before the dividend. So I need more growth an innovation from the big banks, and the way they're going to get there is through acquisitions.There's a lot of private startup businesses that are disrupting these big banks and they're going to continue to acquire these companies. So right now I'd say hold onto JPMorgan or - and that goes for all of the banks, but look at the investment banking revenue for this quarter. A lot of SPAC business, a lot of private company IPO business. That's going to help them going forward, but they need more innovation and growth.BARTIROMO: Yes, that's a great point. So a couple of months ago I know Jamie Dimon was basically saying, look, whatever exchange-traded fund or asset management company that wants to sell itself, I'm all ears. He wanted - he was very vocally saying I want to acquire asset managers. Is that where you're expecting acquisitions or would you expect acquisitions on fintech to create more innovation?MURPHY: You hit the nail on the head. I think what Jamie Dimon was saying about asset managers, it isn't enough. I think you need fintech. You need innovation. Whether that's in the form of -(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: OK.MURPHY: -- payments, whether it's in the form of straight technology, he needs to get some tech in his -(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Exactly.MURPHY: -- business that's going to make people want to own it.BARTIROMO: OK. Kenny, I want to turn to mortgage lending because the financials are the spotlight today for sure, but the Trump administration is leaving without restructuring the taxpayers' stake in the mortgage giants, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. I know a lot of shareholders are upset. They wanted to get paid. It's now up to the Biden administration to return those companies to private ownership after being placed in government control following the 2008 financial crisis. What's your take on Fannie and Freddie right here?KENNY POLCARI, SLATESTONE WEATH CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST: So listen, I understand that they want, you know - the privators (ph) want the money back but I also understand that the Biden administration is not going to run right out and try to disrupt the housing market and potentially disrupt the mortgage market especially during this time of crisis, so I think it's going to be slow.I think the owners have to continue to be patient as they have been, but one way or the other I think this was also expected, and while it's newsworthy I don't think it's going to change market psyche at all, but I think - I think Joe's - I think the Biden administration is going to have to go very slowly especially as we weave our way through the crisis.BARTIROMO: All right. Kenny, what do you think about the banks here? You saw the numbers. JPMorgan looked better than expected, but as Mike said Jamie Dimon sort of talking down the quarter or so. Stock is lower fractionally.POLCARI: Listen. Listen, I think JPMorgan's a foundational stock in any portfolio. I love the name Jamie Dimon. Never disappoint. I'm not necessarily surprised to see what the stock is doing post earnings announcement. They blew the number out of the water like BlackRock did yesterday, and look what they did. Mike had it right. They've taken the stock up almost -(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Yes.POLCARI: -- 45 or 50 percent. And so, therefore, a little bit off the table as people, you know, take some profits and reallocate. It's certainly healthy. So I'm looking for a pullback, but by no means would I be a seller of JPMorgan at all. And I think Mike's right when you talk about growth.BARTIROMO: Yes, that -(CROSSTALK)POLCARI: Fintech I think is the place where he's going to find the biggest bang for his buck.BARTIROMO: That makes a lot of sense, Kenny. All right, Lindsey, let's talk about the broader economy. President - we are expecting a reaction to this $1.9 trillion stimulus package from Joe Biden, including $1,400 direct payments, $400 weekly unemployment aid, $20 billion in national vaccination program, increasing the federal minimum wage to $15. What's your reaction to Biden's $1.9 trillion proposal, Lindsey, and its impact?LINDSEY PIEGZA, STIEFEL CHIEF ECONOMIST: I think most agree that federal assistance has been vital to support millions of workers and businesses that were hard hit during the pandemic, but at this point, 10 months in and $4 trillion already spent, we arguably need a more narrow approach.So rather than, for example, direct checks sent out to every qualifying individual regardless of their financial or employment situation more targeted unemployment assistance, but at this point with debt-to-GDP pushing up to 100 percent we may be creating an insurmountable barrier to growth in the longer run as the economy does struggle to return to a more organic path of growth.BARTIROMO: All right, Lindsey. It's great to see you and, Mike and Kenny, great to talk with you all this morning. Thanks very much. Great Word on Wall Street. Have a good weekend, guys. We'll see you soon. Much more ahead this morning.Coming up the attack on free speech. Jack Dorsey caught on camera suggesting his recent ban. The president - will go well beyond the president and last well beyond one day. Then later this hour New York Congresswoman, Nicole Malliotakis is here talking about the newly-released $2 trillion COVID release plan and why progressives are already slamming it.We'll also get her take on the exodus out of New York. In the 8 a.m. hour, former New York Yankees star and businessman, Alex Rodriguez, is here to talk about his entrepreneurial moves and when, well, he and JLo will officially tie the knot. Don't miss a moment of it. You're watching Mornings with Maria live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Declassifying documents, a Senate source telling Fox News that hundreds of pages of documents, including depositions, transcripts, and interviews related to the Russia probe are set to release - be released as early as today. John Durham has served as Special Counsel since October to investigate the origins of Russiagate, focusing on the conduct of the FBI agents during Crossfire Hurricane.Joining me right now is the Chief Political Correspondent for the Washington Examiner and Fox News Contributor, Byron York. Byron, it's good to have you. Thanks very much for being here. Finally we are getting to see some of these declassified documents. What are you expecting?BYRON YORK, WASHINGTON EXAMINER, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well we don't really know what they are. We're told they're transcripts of interviews and depositions, and we do know because the former Attorney General, William Barr, told us that Durham has been focusing pretty closely on the actions of the FBI.People wondered in the past whether he was looking at the CIA, what he was looking at. Now it appears to be he's looking mostly at the FBI. So I would guess they're interviews coming from the early period of the Crossfire Hurricane investigation in late 2016, early 2017.BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, there is some speculation that John Durham is still going to come up with indictments for certain members of these intelligence agencies for coming up with this story or Hillary Clinton coming up with this story to tie Trump to Russia and then moving on it, but we haven't heard from John Durham in a long time, so we'll see.I want to ask you about President Trump and this split on removing the president. According to a new NBC News poll 50 percent of voters support removing the president from office. 48 percent are opposed. Byron, what do you think this says about the public sentiment around the idea of impeaching a president after he's left office?YORK: Yes, you have to remember the key fact here is the Senate will not begin the trial of President Trump until President Trump is former President Trump. It won't happen until after the president leaves office, and it's my guess that when the public fully appreciates that then that support for impeachment will go down. The primary reason for impeachment - look at article 2 of the Constitution - is to remove a president from office.And if that's not possible, if he's already gone, then there's - they'll be doing it only for the secondary purpose of disqualifying him from any future office. So you're going to be faced apparently with a weird spectacle of a new president in office while the Senate holds a trial to remove the former president from office who's already gone.BARTIROMO: Brian Berenberg, jump in.BRIAN BERENBERG, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR, PROFESSOR OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS, THE KING'S COLLEGE: Yes, Byron. Can you talk a little bit about how long the Senate trial might go on? I don't think anybody's really contemplating just how big of a deal this could be.The president has a right to make a defense. You know, he can bring whatever evidence he wants to bear in that. So this - it seems to me the trial can go on for a very long time, not just, you know, eating up a couple of days but weeks potentially the beginning of the Biden administration. What are your thoughts on that?YORK: Well it could. I mean, it's only one article, the incitement to insurrection article, but yes. The president does have a chance to make his defense, and by the way, I mean, I personally think that the president should go to court against the Senate here to settle this question of whether a president can be impeached after he leaves office.The proponents will tell you there's a precedent in the past from a judge who was going to be impeached and tried to avoid it by resigning at the last minute and they went ahead and impeached him, but there's really not a precedent that applies to this situation, and I think it would be a good idea for the country to have that question settled.And if the Senate wins, if the president loses and they go ahead and have a trial, you're absolutely right. It could take awhile, and it seems to me the person who is not really happy about this happening is Joe Biden who would prefer to take office as a new president to enact his agenda as much as he can get through Congress and instead the Senate is going to be bogged down in a trial of the former president.BARTIROMO: What do you think is the most important item on Joe Biden's agenda, Byron? Do - what do you think he really is most looking forward to execute?YORK: Well I think it's what he says it is right now. I think it is passing this enormous coronavirus relief bill and also giving the public the impression that he, the president, is in charge of the coronavirus effort around the country when under President Trump is has been basically the work of the states.And the latest in that is that so many of the states have really messed up the vaccine distribution effort. So I do think that's the big agenda item with a President Biden. Now all of the progressive dreams of packing the Supreme Court, of making Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C. a state, all of that kind of really wild stuff would depend on the Senate first eliminating the filibuster, which I think is going to be impossible with a 50-50 Senate and a Democratic vice president.BARTIROMO: All right, Byron. Great to talk with you. Thanks so much. Byron York joining us. We'll take a break.YORK: Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: When we come back an admission caught on tape by Jack Dorsey. The Twitter CEO was talking about President Trump's ban, and he says that the censorship will go way beyond just the president. We're going to bring you those comments. Then listen to your pup. A new technology can translate your dog's barks. It's making a buzz this morning. Back in a moment.Welcome back. The attack on free speech. In a leaked recording Twitter CEO, Jack Dorsey, was caught on camera admitting that the ban on President Trump is only the beginning.(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)JACK DORSEY, TWITTER CEO: We are focused on one account right now, but this is going to be much bigger than just one account. And it's going to go on for much longer than just this day and this week and the next few weeks. It's going to go on beyond the inauguration.(END VIDEOCLIP)BARTIROMO: Dagen McDowell, what do you think about this? I mean, we are looking at this company believing they are the arbiter of truth.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: They're working at the direction two of the very Democrats and left-wing politicians who have - who have been - whose campaigns have been funded by these large Silicon Valley companies.We know - he's saying the obvious. He's stating the obvious. It's never been about President Trump. It's about censoring any voice that doesn't fall in line with the left-wing group think that is the cornerstone of Silicon Valley and the people who work at these companies. So these large tech companies have stepped up and they're silencing anybody that their employees don't agree with.Where does it end because I say that they're - the power that these big tech companies have now is so incredibly dangerous that they can not only silence individual voices but they can shut down entire businesses. And when the likes of Angela Merkel will - may step up and say are troubled by just President Trump's accounts being shut down, I think that speaks volumes about history, the fact that people in this country have forgotten it because eventually like all these censors, they come for you even if they might agree with you. Everyone gets shut down.BARTIROMO: That's right.MCDOWELL: I don't know - I don't know where we go from here because, again, the big tech companies and the left-wing politicians, the Democrats are moving in lock step with one another.BARTIROMO: They are moving in lock step and this is what happens in Communist China. I keep saying China won because it's true and because you are looking at the kind of moves that happen when you have state-run media. In China you can search for information on Tiananmen Square and you won't get it. You will never get it about what happened in Tiananmen Square if you're searching on a search engine to find that information. That's what happened here when people wanted information on Hunter Biden and they couldn't get it. This is a very dangerous situation, indeed.Quick break, and then we are focused on stimulus. New York Congresswoman Nicole Malliotakis is here. She'll talk about the newly-released $1.9 trillion relief plan, why progressives are slamming it saying it's not enough. And then what a card the rare Mickey Mantle baseball card come in with a huge price tag. Wait till you hear this right after the break.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Friday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. Happy Friday. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Friday, January 15th. A look at markets this half an hour.We are looking at some red across the screen. Dow Industrials down 134 points; the NASDAQ down 9 and three quarters; and the S&P 500 weaker by 13. Investors are waiting on more bank earnings this morning. Plus, we will get readings on retail sales and the producer price index, another look at inflation.JPMorgan reported earnings better than expected, but the stock is flat. And of course, this on top of losses yesterday on Wall Street, check the markets yesterday at 4:00 on Wall Street.The Dow Jones Industrial average was lower at the close by 68; NASDAQ was down 16; and the S&P 500 lower by 14 and a third.European markets this morning are also trading down ahead of the European Central Bank meeting which happens next week. The FTSE 100 down 60; the CAC quarante down 60; and the DAX Index down 139.In Asia overnight, mixed performances there. Take a look. Really fractional moves pretty much across the board with the exception of Korea, the KOSPI Index was down better than 2 percent.Well, more indictments over China and MIT professor charged with lying about his ties to China. Cheryl Casone with the details there. Cheryl.CASONE: We were talking about China, Maria. Good morning again.Federal prosecutors say that Dr. Gang Chen, an expert in nanotechnology, failed to disclose extensive ties to the Chinese government in grant applications to the Department of Energy. His accusations include attempting to recruit academics from China, goes far back as 2012. This is just one of about a dozen similar criminal cases.Well, major U.S. airlines are taking precautions ahead of next week's inauguration. Delta, United, Alaska, American and Southwest, all banning guns inside checked luggage for anyone flying to the D.C. area. Law enforcement officials are exempt from the ban. Airlines will start enforcing the policy this weekend.Ready for take off! Jeff Bezos' private space company, Blue Origin has aimed to take humans to space in just a few months. Blue Origin yesterday completed the 14th test flight of its New Shepard rocket booster and capsule. But for those that are looking to climb aboard, it's going to cost you. Space tourists are going to have to shell out $200,000 per seat.Finally, this. Mickey Mantle is back in the record books. A mint condition 1952 Mantle card just sold for $5.2 million, setting a record for the highest selling sports card of all time. It was purchased by actor and entrepreneur Rob Gough, who called it the "Mona Lisa of sports cards".In 1952, a pack of Topps baseball cards, Maria, would have cost you $0.05. Those are your headlines.BARTIROMO: Wow! That's funny. All right, thanks very much, Cheryl.Brian Brenberg, you're a huge Mickey Mantle, fan, right? Are you a collector?BRENBERG: I am, yes. I actually tweeted yesterday a picture of my very modest collection which doesn't include the rookie card.But what's interesting is in 1952, Topps made that Mickey Mantle rookie card. They had hundreds of cases of baseball cards leftover that year, including all sorts of Mickey Mantle's. They dumped them in the Hudson River because they couldn't get rid of them. Now that card is selling for 5 million bucks.Love to get my hands on one, Maria. I think that one's always going to elude my collection though.BARTIROMO: That is awesome. All right.Meanwhile, we are talking this morning about a nearly $2 trillion pandemic relief plan from Joe Biden. The proposal includes $1,400 checks, increasing weekly unemployment benefits, raising the minimum federal wage to $15 an hour, and a nationwide vaccination effort.However, New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has already commented about it. And she says, it's not enough. She wants more.Joining me right now is New York Congresswoman, Nicole Malliotakis. Congresswoman, it's great to see you this morning. Thank you so much for joining us.So let's talk about this plan first. Do you think this has any shot of getting passed?REP. NICOLE MALLIOTAKIS (R-NY): Well, now that the Democrats control all levels of government, I'm sure it does have a chance of getting passed. And of course, people like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez won't be satisfied. They won't be satisfied until we have complete socialism, which means government control over our lives and a guaranteed minimum income to pay for that.We have to make sure that any relief package going forward is tailored. The best relief package, quite frankly, is reopening our economy. I could tell you that as someone here in New York seeing so many livelihoods destroyed by arbitrary mandates from our mayor and our governor.Of course, I'm concerned about the rise in first time unemployment claims that have come out since the New Year. But we also need to be mindful of the debt that we're racking up as a nation.So any relief package needs to be extremely tailored to help those who are currently unemployed or whose businesses are struggling as a result of mandates. But I think the best thing the government can do is get out of the way and allow these businesses to reopen and get our economy back on track.BARTIROMO: Yes. But Congresswoman, we know that New York has been on lockdown. And last week, Governor Cuomo changed his tune. What do you make of what he said last week when he said, "Look, we can't stay closed. It's going to be too expensive and we're not going to have any industry left". I'll tell you, he sounded an awfully lot like President Trump last week when he did that flip-flop on the closing of New York.MALLIOTAKIS: Well, it's interesting now that President Trump is leaving and a new administration is coming in how the governor is all about reopening this economy and getting people back to work. This is something that I've been saying for a long time and I wish he had listened to me early on when I said that there is a balanced approach to reopening our economy.Of course, public health is paramount. We can reopen those safely. And particularly now, I've been pushing for an acceleration of vaccine distribution to those who want it. I see that changes are being made both at the local and the state level, which I'm happy about. And we need to make sure that we reopen this economy. And even though he's saying that, I still see that the restaurants in New York City are shut down despite the fact that the science shows that they are not a contributing factor to the rise in positive cases.BARTIROMO: Yes. So many people lost their jobs as a result of that. As a result of that, the people working in restaurants, they don't know what to do. And then there's the security issue. There is this war on police that continues.Congresswoman, New York Attorney General Letitia James is now suing the NYPD, Mayor Bill de Blasio, and two of the city's top cops, over their handling of protesters of last year's protests following the murder of George Floyd.This James suit alleges that the department used illegal and harmful tactics in their handling of the protesters and have for years. She is calling for a federal monitor of the department. Your reaction?MALLIOTAKIS: It's completely outrageous. Look, New York Democrats have put our NYPD under attack for years. First, we see the mayor tying their hands, not allowing them to prosecute or arrest individuals for certain crimes. Then we see the New York City Council defunding a billion dollars. They ended the plainclothes unit. We saw a spike in crime as a result of that in a radical bail reform that took place at the state level.We even saw New York Democrat elected officials raise money to bail out rioters and looters, and they would be back on the street before a police officer's shift would end. Now the attorney general is suing the NYPD, including its Chief Monahan, who was actually assaulted during one of the protests. These protests left hundreds of NYPD officers injured, many went to the hospital.And on top of it, they destroyed businesses. So she should be investigating those individuals that caused this type of damage, not only to our police officers, but to mom-and-pop shops in our local economy. I think it's very misguided and I think that we need to show more respect and love and appreciation for our men and women in blue.BARTIROMO: Yes. I agree with that sentiment, that's for sure. Look, it's not just the blow-off and the treatment, the lack of support for the cops. That's just one reason that people are leaving New York and going to places like Florida.I have so many friends that I know who of live in New York who have left and now they live in Florida, or they're spending much of their time there. What does that do in your view to the budget?Talk to us about when this is going to come back to haunt New York, even Staten Island, in terms of what happens when you've got the decline in revenue from all of these people leaving and taking their tax dollars with them?MALLIOTAKIS: Well, Mayor de Blasio gave his fiscal forecast for the upcoming year, he is saying they're going to eliminate thousands of jobs at the city level, but also that they expect the $2.5 billion decrease in property tax receipts. And this is something that's very troubling and I have warned for years that the mayor's increase in spending was very inappropriate and this is a mayor who came in and after that just increased spending about 30 percent. Now he is forced to reduce it, but it's too late.He never saved money. He never saved money for a rainy day, and certainly this is the rainiest of days and now we're in a jam. And on top of it, it's not just the spending, it's the increase in taxes that have really been driving people out and the crime. People feel they're not getting the bang for their buck living in New York City. They don't feel safe. They've seen crime soar. Quality of life has deteriorated.Remember, this is a mayor who decided to tie the hands of police when it comes to graffiti in public urination and all this is probably a life crimes. And so, his handling of homelessness has been a disaster, despite record spending.So all of this is now crashing down (inaudible) we got a right to shift quickly the new mayor next year that is going to take this stuff seriously.BARTIROMO: All right. Congresswoman, we'll be watching all of this. Thanks very much, Nicole Malliotakis, for joining us this morning.MALLIOTAKIS: Thank you.BARTIROMO: We will see you soon.Coming up, the attack on free speech. My next guest says Amazon's shutdown of Parler is a threat to all small business. We'll get into it.And then big banks in focus, JPMorgan reporting better-than-expected earnings last hour. Expenses are up as well. We're waiting on Wells Fargo and Citigroup. The stocks right now are up about a quarter to two-thirds of 1 percent.You're watching "Mornings with Maria" live on Fox Business.Next week on "Mornings with Maria". Monday with Biden hours away from taking office. Karl Rove lays out how far left he will go.Tuesday, Henry Kissinger raising alarm over a return to the Iran nuclear deal. General Jack Keane tells us why.Wednesday, it is inauguration day in our nation's capitol. Joe Lieberman on Joe Biden's first 100 days.Thursday, we give you the big league insight on how to allocate your capital with the word on Wall Street.And on Friday, the largest group of Republican women in history taking office. Beth Van Duyne is one of them. She will join us live.It's all right here on "Mornings with Maria"BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Big Tech censorship spurring fear among small business owners. Parler began as a Nevada-based startup, employing fewer than 50 people. My next guest says they are definitely not alone as small business owners feel the wrath of Big Tech censorship.Joining me right now is The Marks Group President and small business columnist for "The Hill", Gene Marks. Gene, it's great to have you this morning and it's a really important angle that we're talking about.You lay out several examples of other small businesses who have run afoul of Big Tech rules only to find themselves struggling to hold onto their business. Tell us about it.GENE MARKS, PRESIDENT, THE MARKS GROUP: Sure. So Maria, the whole controversy about Parler and Amazon is actually a pretty simple issue. Amazon Web Services really did nothing wrong. You might have the opinion that they're limiting free speech. And I know John Matze who is the CEO of Parler also feels the same way, but right now while Big Tech controls what they control, that's Amazon, that's Google, that's Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter, they can write the rules. They're not regulated right now.So the fact of the matter is that Parler violated the terms and conditions of Amazon Web Services and they got thrown off the platform. And I think that's a big warning to small businesses, because there are many small businesses out there that do run afoul of some of those terms and conditions. Not only just on Amazon, but Facebook and they're risking their businesses.BARTIROMO: How did they violate any practices when in fact there was hate speech all over social media? I mean, Twitter is like the sewer of hate speech. You go on Twitter, it's all hate and getting attacked by people who don't agree with you.MARKS: But that's the issue, Maria. I can't really argue or defend how some of these companies are implementing their terms and conditions. But the bottom line is, when it comes to free speech, they're the ones that can determine that. And the reason why is because it's their servers, it's their technology, it's their hardware, it's their software.So if you want to play on their platforms, you've got to abide by the rules, however inconsistently that they're administered. And frankly, John at Parler, honestly, I think he did a great service to a lot of small business owners because he taught a lot of us what not to do.He was warned repeatedly that there were issues with his platform. His whole livelihood, his whole business was based on Amazon Web Services and what happened? Amazon threw him off. The guy is like out of business right now. So if you're a small business owner, you have got to have a viable plan B.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: So what do you do? You don't rely just on one cloud company?MARKS: Correct. Yes, you really can't. You have to realize that if you're going to be facing those kinds of limitations and restrictions, either you behave, you adjust your behavior, or you've got to make sure that you've got a good plan B. And unfortunately, Parler did not have a backup plan.BARTIROMO: But Gene, you keep saying - Gene, you keep saying this behavior. What behavior? What did they do that was so bad? You're talking about a platform where people were exchanging opinions.The issue here, in my view, for the social media company, is that they say that they are the bulletin board, that everybody can have their own opinion and throw it up on the bulletin board. But in fact, they're not. And that's why they got Section 230 in the Telecom Act of 1996, and that's why they have this liability protection that they can't get sued and yet it's not true.They're not a bulletin board. They've made a choice to take a side, and they have made a choice to think that they're the arbiter of truth, to edit out people and posts that they don't like.MARKS: I get it. But here's the thing, these platforms are not regulated. Look at yourself, for example, there are certain things that you cannot say on your network. There are certain behaviors that you can't have on your network because you're regulated by the FCC.BARTIROMO: Like what? Like what, Gene?MARKS: Well, you can't use profanity on your network, can you? Can you do that? Can you say sexually explicit things? Can you view - display pornography, for example?BARTIROMO: No, but you can on Twitter and it's no problem. No, but you can on Twitter and it's no problem.(CROSSTALK)MARKS: But Twitter is not regulated.BARTIROMO: That's what I'm saying. They got that liability - but that's what I'm saying. They got that liability protection because they said that they were bulletin boards that they weren't taking a side but they have taken a side. They're not bulletin boards. They are publishers and content creators.MARKS: The problem is, though, is that because they're not regulated, they set what their terms and conditions are. In the instance of Parler, they were warned many, many times by Amazon that they were going to get thrown off for violating their terms and conditions.And by the way, I am not going to defend how these terms and conditions were implemented.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Why isn't Twitter warned? How come Twitter isn't being warned?MARKS: Because Twitter, again, it's a private company. I'll give you an example. If you are selling certain types of natural health products, if you are involved in, say, you are related to the pornography business, for example, you do get warned and thrown off of Twitter, because that's a violation of their terms and conditions.Again, if you're a small business, Maria, you've got to play by the rules if you're going to be on these platforms until these platforms are regulated.BARTIROMO: OK.MARKS: And once they're regulated like you are, then there will be more fair play.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Gene Marks. We've got Wells Fargo to talk about. Company is reporting earnings. We're going to get back to that when we come right back.Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.The bank earnings keep on flowing. Wells Fargo quarterly earnings have hit the tape. The stock is down 2 and two-thirds percent.Cheryl Casone with the numbers right now. Cheryl.CASONE: Yes. Here's what's going on with this one, Maria, the stock down more than two-and-a-half percent. The earnings per share, they actually beat by $0.04. The estimate was $0.60, they came in at $0.64, but this was a miss on the revenue estimate. The estimate was $18.13 billion, they came in at $17.93 billion.A couple of things here. They did announce a stock buyback. They're going to initiate 500 million shares. They did get a 6.4 percent return on equity. But they're still talking a little bit about potential credit losses moving forward. They have got a credit loss provision. They actually pulled out $823 million of that. They talked about restructuring, they also sold off their student loan portfolio as well.But again, the buyback is part of it. But the provision for credit loss is $179 million there. So they're still being cautious like we heard from JPMorgan. The reserves is the story to watch with all of these banks.Again, Maria, as we talked about with JPMorgan Chase, we're now waiting on Citigroup. But that's kind of the highlights there of Wells Fargo. Biggest mortgage lender in the country, so obviously this is going to be a big one to watch as well.Back to you.BARTIROMO: All right.Stock down about 3 percent right now. Cheryl, thanks very much.Time for the morning buzz. Barking translation. You can now find out your dog's emotions with a new smart collar. Using AI, voice recognition technology, the collar can identify happiness, sadness, anxiety, relaxation or anger, all from one bark.Dagen?DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: Dale has a lot more going on.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: I feel like I understand when Dusty is thinking and I don't even have this collar.MCDOWELL: Exactly. We've got to go to break now.BARTIROMO: She was happy on that day with her shave.MCDOWELL: I love her.Load-Date: January 15, 2021End of Document

Rep. Murphy Reintroduces Legislation Cracking Down on Foreign Espionage in Colleges and UniversitiesTargeted News ServiceFebruary 19, 2021 Friday 7:50 AM  ESTCopyright 2021 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 602 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyRep. Gregory Murphy, R-North Carolina, issued the following news release on Feb. 18, 2021:On Thursday, February 18, 2021, Higher Education and Workforce Investment Subcommittee Ranking Member Congressman Greg Murphy, M.D. (NC-03) reintroduced the Intelligence on Nefarious Foreign Leaders Using Education Networks for Corrupt Enrichment (INFLUENCE) Act. The legislation aims to limit intellectual property theft by foreign nationals at colleges and universities.The Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property estimates foreign actors steal $300 billion in American intellectual property annually. The Intellectual Property Commission estimates China is responsible for 70 percent of that theft - or $210 billion annually.The Center for Strategic and International Studies compiled a list of 152 publicly reported cases of Chinese espionage seeking to acquire information from military, government, civilian and academic institutions. Some examples of these instance are listed below:* In November 2020, a professor of internal medicine at Ohio State University and Penn State University pled guilty to neglecting to disclose his ties to a Chinese university when securing grants. Investigators believed this was an effort to share federally funded research with China.* In August 2020, a Texas A&M professor was charged with wire fraud, making false statements and conspiracy while secretly working with the Chinese government while conducting research for NASA.* In May 2020, an engineering professor from the University of Arkansas was arrested for wire fraud as a result of his failure to disclose ties to Chinese institutions.* In January 2020, the Chairman of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Harvard University was charged with making false statements about his ties to the Chinese government.Existing law requires any gift or contract from a foreign source given to institutions of higher learning valued at $250,000 or more to be reported to the Department of Education. If passed, the INFLUENCE Act would lower that threshold to $50,000. The bill would also require schools to report to the Department of Education on the nature of any contracts with foreign nationals on sensitive projects.In addition, the measure would establish interagency coordination on the enforcement of any violations exposing U.S. national security projects, and the Secretary of Education would report on best practices moving forward regarding these types of breaches and how best to protect sensitive information. Enforcement mechanisms of the bill include civil action, revoking Title IV funding, and fines.Murphy released the following statement:"China is an American adversary - they are not simply 'competitors' as President Joe Biden recently stated," said Murphy. "We have evidence the Chinese government will stop at nothing to steal American secrets and intellectual property. To stop this, we need to take a closer look at foreign involvement on colleges and universities, which is where a large portion of American research takes place."Although we have caught many Chinese spies in the act of espionage, who knows how often this practice goes undetected? By lowering the gift and contract threshold to $50,000, we can cast a larger net and catch more foreign operatives in the act of stealing. It is my hope this bill can become law so we can crack down on China's malicious theft of our secrets and intellectual property."The text of the bill can be found here: https://gregmurphy.house.gov/sites/gregmurphy.house.gov/files/MURPNC_005_xml.pdfCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7389134 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: February 19, 2021End of Document

China, the end of extreme poverty and the promotion of entrepreneurshipCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 17, 2021 SundayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 803 wordsBodyDespite the economic crisis brought by the pandemic to the world, China announced last year the end of extreme poverty, meeting the target set by 2020. The fight against poverty has been a priority for the Chinese government since the start of reform and openness in 1978, and the economic growth achieved since that time has allowed more than 700 million people to get out of poverty.Although China is already the second or first world economy, depending on how it is consumed, it is a country with great inequality and according to indicators, by the end of 2015 there were still 55.75 million Chinese living below the poverty line, which in absolute terms is much, but in relative terms it was close to 5%. It is important to address the developments in poverty reduction that in 1990 was close to 60% of the population and by the age of ten had already halved. China is at a stage that we can call it fine-tuning in the fight against poverty through targeted and differentiated measures for every poor sector of society, thus making it more resource efficient and avoiding unnecessary diversions, getting funds to those who really need it.These targeted measures are about incentiving so that poor areas can develop competitive industries related especially to agriculture, tourism and e-commerce through joint work between the state, businesses, universities and families seeking to improve their living conditions.Since achieving these goals it took a large investment and this can be seen in the budget for the fight against poverty, which in recent years was close to $10 billion per year.As Nestor Restivo said in this newspaper a few months ago, education alongside planning and economic growth is the basis of China's poverty eradication program.A few years ago I was able to visit the city of Handan to observe the results of public policies aimed at reducing poverty in the area. In this place we were able to see various ventures linked to the production of high quality organic food to supply the nearby cities that are consuming healthier products, the resulting in work and opportunities to improve the quality of life for the people of Handan. The population of that city participated in the venture not only as an employee but also as minority shareholders of the business. At the same time they received the advice of the experts of the University of Handan who provided their knowledge so that the production meets the required standards. The government, on the other hand, was responsible for improving infrastructure conditions such as connectivity between this city with China's major cities through improved routes and the railway network; while making strong investments linked to renewable energy generation, allowing the population to access energy resources in a sustainable way.We were also able to learn about other ventures linked to the tourism sector, and in all of us we emphasize that the virtuous circle of articulation between the government, the private sector, the local university, is always repeated to make entrepreneurship successful and generate opportunities for the local population to improve their quality of life.During a political exchange in 2015 we held a meeting with the Vice President of China at the time, who expressed that one of the problems in China; based on the increase in the number of universities and increased access to university across the country; was the difficulty of thenew college graduates to access the world of work. In this sense, the country was strongly promoting entrepreneurship, so that young graduates who could not enter the labour market may have other development opportunities.For this purpose, measures were taken ranging from tax incentives to the provision of financing and subsidies by the government for entrepreneurship; It was promoted in some cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hangzhou, the development of startup ecosystems where entrepreneurs have universities for training and training, incubators that help the idea project can be realized and accelerators that seek to boost or enhance ventures. Beijing and Shanghai are today among the top 10 startup ecosystems in the world. There are currently more than 3000 incubators and 400 accelerators in China, and many more are expected to emerge. In addition, the most promising ventures are chosen by large Chinese companies such as Tencent (creator of Wechat), Alibaba, JD, Lenovo, Fosun, Baidu, Xiaomi, etc. for their accompaniment and above all to give them financial support, infrastructure and business vision.Diego Mazzoccone is Executive Director of the Latin American Center for Political and Economic Studies of China (CLEPEC).

The Chinese millionaire appeared as if nothing in a videoCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 21, 2021 ThursdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 886 wordsBodyVictor EscribanoSome said he was in custody; others, who simply kept quiet. Either way, Alibaba's founding billionaire, Jack Ma, was "missing" 88 days until yesterday, fueling speculation about his whereabouts behind his frictions with the Chinese government.The entrepreneur recorded a speech, published by the local press, in which he greets a hundred rural teachers from the Asian country selected for an award given by his foundation, to which he assures that "when the epidemic is over, we will meet again".In the video, posted on the portal of a newspaper in his native province, Zhejiang (east), Ma makes no mention of his situation, although he does claim that in "the last six months" - a period that includes the nearly three months he has been away from the spotlight - he has remained "active", participating in the process of selecting teachers for the award.Ma had measured during the last two decades under Beijing, which favored the development of the digital economy and allowed the sector to grow without too many regulations.He managed to become The Richest Man in China and elevated his conglomerate - focused mainly on e-commerce - to the category of giant, with a valuation of about $700 billion.In recent months, however, his apparent status as untouchable appears to have faded, not only given as the great visible face of private sector development in the Asian giant but also as a member of the Communist Party ( PCCh).ROCES WITH BEIJINGThe reason for the end of his good tune with Beijing seems to have a name: Ant Group, Alibaba's 'fintech', in which Ma holds no executive position but of which he is the top shareholder.The company, operator of Alipay, China's most widely used electronic payments platform, was to star in the largest IBRO in history in November 2020, but 36 hours before its stock market debut Chinese regulators forced it to suspend it after publishing the draft of much more restrictive regulations for the sector.Days earlier, Ma had given a controversial speech in which he was highly critical of Beijing's strategy of minimizing risks in the financial system and with traditional banks, which he said continue to be managed as "pawnshops."That was the last time, to this day, that the billionaire appeared publicly.Since then, despite Ma and Ant's apparent attempts to calm the waters, regulators and the official press have repeatedly criticized the way the sector operates, ensuring that it tricks young people into over-indebtedness or shielding behind the concepts of innovation and technology to enter the banking business without subjecting the regulations they are to comply with.Some experts speculated on the possibility that Ma already knew the content of this new regulation and that he was trying to force a renegotiation of terms through public criticism, something not overly common in such a high-profile figure in China.The entrepreneur was not only known for his corporate activity or for his multiple lectures but for his predilection for cameras, having recorded his own kung fu movie or appeared on a stage disguised as Michael Jackson during a company event.ALIBABA SHOOTS IN BAGIn these three months, international press and social media have speculated that Ma was in detention, that the authorities had banned him from leaving the country, and even that Beijing was planning to nationalize Alibaba, which he opened an antitrust investigation into.RumorsAbout Ma's whereabouts grew in November after he did not participate as a jury on the television show 'The Heroes of Business in Africa', founded by himself and in which he was replaced by another executive of the firm.In recent years, some of China's best-known figures have "disappeared" after committing crimes or having disputes with the authorities and then reappearing months later, such as the popular actress Fan Bingbing, of which nothing was known for several months in 2018 following a tax evasion case.However, last week, sources aware of the situation had explained that Ma was trying to keep a "low profile" and that he was "fine," while calling the aforementioned rumours "unfounded."Meanwhile, the official media has remained silent while other reports pointed to Beijing's alleged orders not to give further media coverage to the skies against Alibaba.On Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter, Jack Ma's reappearance was not now among the 50 most debated topics, indicating that either netizens have not given importance to the news or that, as has happened on other issues in the past, it is a deliberate action on the heavily censored social network.However, when searching for "Ma Yun" - the entrepreneur's Chinese name - there are messages and news about his return to the public arena.To whom the news has been well seated is Alibaba's investors - Ma left his presidency in 2019, twenty years after founding it - whose shares lost 18% of their value since the last time he was seen and which today, after the reappearance, more than 8.5% were revalued.However, according to Bloomberg's list of billionaires, Ma is no longer China's richest man: his fortune would have been reduced by about $10 billion to $52.9 billion, now ranked fourth behind the heads of the drinking company Nongfu Spring and the tech companies Tencent and Pinduoduo, rivals of Alibaba.

Lay Zhang, Wang Yibo and Jackson add to Xinjiang cotton boycottCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 25, 2021 ThursdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 529 wordsBodyAs of Thursday, March 25, nearly 30 Chinese singers and actors have cut ties with clothing brands such as H&M, Adidas, Converse and Nike. Some of them are LAy Zhang of EXO, Jackson Wang of GOT7 and actors Wang Yibo and Dilraba. This responds to boycott measures to foreign companies that refused to use cotton from the Xinjiang region.What about cotton and H&M in China?At least 20% of the world's cotton production is obtained from Xinjiang; however, treatment of its workers has been called into question since 2020. A BBC complaint reported the alleged use of Uighur forced labour in the fields of this region.For its part, the Chinese government rejects the accusations and through its official means indicate that these are manufactured rumors. "Workers from all ethnic groups voluntarily choose their jobs in Xinjiang," was their response in the same report from the British portal.Some brands such as H&M had spoken out their "concern about allegations of working conditions" and that they did not use material from Xinjiang. Although his position dates back to last year, a screening of the communiqué resurfaced in network over recent political sanctions on the subject. The original version has been removed from the H&M Group page.On March 25, a youth association invoked in Weibo to boycott companies that "spread rumors about Xinjiang cotton and want to make money in China." Since then, H&M has been removed from all local e-commerce portals.Other brands involved in having similar pronouncements over the past two years were Nike, Adidas, Philip-Van Heusen (Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein) and Converse.Which Chinese artists finished their contracts?The internet user campaign in Weibo under the slogan "We support Xinjiang cotton" also required public figures to terminate their image contracts with the aforementioned multinationals.Yuehua confirmed that actor Wang Yibo, famous for his role in The Untamed, ceases his collaboration with Nike. In addition to its official pronouncement where the agency points to its rejection of "rhetoric that defies its country", Yibo removed all brand-related photographs in its official Weibo.Zhang Yixing, a Chinese member of EXO, also announced the end of his contract with Calvin Klein and Converse. Lay Studio's statement notes that they contacted CK asking for their position on the PVH corporation's statements but did not receive a clear response.On the other hand, GOT7's Jackson Wang reported that he will no longer work with Adidas. "The country comes first, Team Wang and Jackson strongly oppose any act of defamation towards China."This is the partial relationship of Chinese personalities and the brands with which they have cut ties.• H&M: Huan Xuan.

The ten convicted activists reportedly received sentences ranging from seven months to three years in prison.Two other members of the group who were minors were returned to Hong Kong after their arrest in August, NYT reported. (RELATED: REPORT: China Uses Private Companies To Process Stolen Data) Lawyers Lu Siwei and Ren Quanniu, who have been helping the case of the 12 Hong Kong Youths, have both received notices of proposed revocation of their lawyer licenses on 4 January 2021 and 31 December 2020 respectively. Full version: https://t.co/IYEUoQb9MU #save12hkyouths pic.twitter.com/5AnYKg1Yvw - save12hkyouths (@save12hkyouths) January 4, 2021Family members of the activists hired the two attorneys, but the lawyers weren't allowed to represent their clients, according to NYT. The defendants were instead made to use government-appointed defense attorneys.Lu had been previously reprimanded for taking the case of another lawyer in 2019 who had criticized Chinese Communist Party leadership, NYT reported. Ren represented Chinese citizen journalist Zhang Zhan, who was recently sentenced to prison for reporting about the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan. Ren was reportedly told by the Department of Justice in Henan Province he could be disbarred over a 2018 case in which he represented a member of the banned spiritual group Falun Gong, but he said that reasoning is just a cover for a political attack against him. “The direct reason is definitely related to the Hong Kongers' case and Shanghai Zhang Zhan case,” he told NYT. Lu recently received a letter from the Department of Justice in Sichuan Province accusing him of “repeatedly publishing unsuitable language online,” according to NYT. He reportedly called the case “inexplicable suppression and persecution.”Lu and Ren were each given three days to prepare for hearings to defend their licenses, but have little hope for success against the Chinese government, which frequently uses annual licensing requirements to intimidate lawyers, according to NYT. (RELATED: Japan's Prime Minister Insists Summer Olympics Will Still Happen Amid Rise In COVID-19 Cases)Many of the activists involved in the recent case were reportedly connected to pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong in 2019. They faced a variety of charges including rioting, arson, assaulting police, and weapons possession, NYT reported.One member of the group, Andy Li, was suspected of violating a security law implemented by the CCP in Hong Kong last year, according to NYT. The protesters were reportedly captured by the Chinese Coast Guard as they fled to Taiwan via speedboat.Graphic Chinese President Xi Jinping speaks during a ceremony marking the 70th anniversary of China's entry into the Korean War.

China announced new measures to combat "unjustified" lawsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 9, 2021 SaturdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 355 wordsBodyChina published this Saturday, January 9, a set of new rules that will seek to counter the "unjustified" laws and restrictions imposed by foreign countries on Chinese businesses and citizens.The Asian giant's Ministry of Commerce disseminated the new Chinese Executive regulations on the department's website and established a "working mechanism" to assess the legal implications of such restrictions as economic relations between Beijing and Washington deteriorate.This seeks "measures to safeguard national interests, prevent or mitigate adverse effects on enterprises and maintain the normal international economic order".The notice states that if a person or organization is restricted by foreign law to "participate in economic, commercial and third-party or citizen-related activities", it may report it to the Department of Commerce within 30 days.It will then assess a case for its possible violation of international law, the impact on China's sovereignty and national security, and Chinese citizens.When a citizen or other organization "suffers significant losses" from non-compliance with foreign law, "relevant government departments can provide the necessary support," the communiqué ends.The Chinese government could also enact "necessary countermeasures" in response.While the brief is not addressed to a particular country, it is known that the tensions of the China-U.S. trade war have reached some companies.An example of this was introduced in 2020, when Washington imposed restrictions on Huawei citing national security concerns. Social media like TikTok was also caught up in these fewies when president Trump gave President Trump a deadline to sell the famous network to a U.S. company in August last year.2021 could be no exception, as this week the New York Stock Exchange announced the retirement of three Chinese telecommunications companies as close to the Chinese army. Outgoing Donald Trump's administration already considers blacklisting tech giants Alibaba and Tencent. Finally, it went on to say that transactions with Asian applications were prohibited.With information from Reuters and Expansion.Load-Date: January 10, 2021End of Document

Tesla is the top-selling EV maker in China. But China-based rivals are narrowing the gap. Nio said it delivered 7,225 vehicles in January, more than four times the number for January 2020. Xpeng notched a sixfold increase with 6,015 deliveries. And Li Auto delivered 5,379 vehicles, an increase of 356% year-over-year.Tesla is likely to see competition grow in China from U.S. carmakers, too. Last month, Ford said it would build its Mustang Mach-E in China for the first time to appeal to Chinese customers.Retail sales of all passenger cars in China rose 26% to 2.16 million vehicles last month, the strongest growth since September 2016. Covid-19 shutdowns last year hit the auto market hard. Sales sank 20% in January 2020 and ended December 7% below the year-ago period.The CPCA sees car sales growing 7% in 2021, but cautioned the second half of the year could see pressure due to chip shortages affecting the whole industry.Meanwhile, Chinese authorities told Tesla on Monday it had to beef up quality and safety measures. Tesla, which has expanded rapidly in China thanks in large part to Chinese government subsidies, has been dogged by consumer complaints.Officials met with Tesla to discuss reports about battery fires, unexpected acceleration and failures in over-the-air software updates, according to Reuters. The officials urged Tesla to operate according to China's laws and protect customer rights.Tesla last week recalled more than 36,000 Model S and Model X vehicles imported from the U.S. due to touch-screen problems. That recall follows another one in October that affected more than 48,000 imported cars of the same models in China because of faulty suspension systems.IBD Live: A New Tool For Daily Stock Market AnalysisTesla StockShares rose 1.3% to 863.42 on the stock market today. Tesla stock got a boost Monday when the company announced it is buy $1.5 billion in Bitcoin and will accept the cryptocurrency as a form of payment.A breakout attempt over a high, tight flag pattern on Jan. 25 with an entry at 884.59 didn't get very far, according to MarketSmith chart analysis. Tesla stock, which is on the IBD Leaderboard, fell and triggered the 7%-8% sell rule.Tesla stock also recently met one key rule of a climax run: a 25% to 50% gain within three weeks after a long run-up from prior breakouts, which could signal that a stock is reaching its top and is due for a pullback.Among other EV makers, Nio stock rose 4.2%, Xpeng was up 1.45% and Li Auto slipped 0.1%.Follow Adelia Cellini Linecker on Twitter @IBD_Adelia.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Is Nio Stock A Buy Right Now?Is Tesla Stock A Buy Right Now?Why This IBD Tool Simplifies The Search For Top StocksWant To Get Quick Profits And Avoid Big Losses?

CHINA PUSHES BACK AGAINST 'FALSE ACCUSATIONS' IN PHILIPPINES ABOUT COAST GUARD LAWStates News ServiceFebruary 1, 2021 MondayCopyright 2021 States News ServiceLength: 919 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Beijing's embassy here hit out Monday at some forces in the Philippines that were spreading false information, it said, about a new law allowing the Chinese coast guard to use force in South China Sea waters claimed by the Asian superpower as part of its territory.The Philippines last week had filed a diplomatic protest against China, with Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. calling the law a verbal threat of war to any country that defies it.In a statement posted on Facebook, the embassy said it had noticed with regret many false accusations against China on the newly passed China Coast Guard Law.The law, which the National People's Congress approved on Jan. 22, took effect on Monday. It places the China Coast Guard (CCG) under military command, gives the security agency more leeway in asserting Beijing's claims in the contested South China Sea, and authorizes its ships to use force against foreign vessels.China's Coast Guard Law is a normal domestic legislative activity, the embassy said.Enacting such a coast guard law is not unique to China, but a sovereign right to all. Many countries have enacted similar legislation, the statement added. [N]one of these laws have been seen as a threat of war.China claims nearly the entire South China Sea, including waters within the exclusive economic zones of Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Taiwan. While Indonesia does not regard itself as party to the South China Sea dispute, Beijing claims historic rights to parts of that sea overlapping Indonesia's exclusive economic zone as well.Everyone is entitled [to] freedom of speech. However, malicious hype-up and irresponsible and baseless accusations that run counter to common sense, are not acceptable and should not be appeased in a society that believes in [the] rule of law and international norms as well as mutual respect, the embassy said.The Chinese coast guard, nevertheless, has a reputation for confronting and sometimes clashing with fishing boats and other vessels of neighboring countries in the waterway. Coastal nations fish the South China Sea intensively and explore for oil and gas in its waters.An investigation in 2020 by Radio Free Asia (RFA), a sister entity of BenarNews, found that CCG vessels work with China's maritime militia to maintain an ongoing presence in disputed areas of the sea.Manila's foreign secretary said last week that enacting a law was usually a sovereign prerogative.But this one given the area involved or for that matter the open South China Sea is a verbal threat of war to any country that defies the law; which, if unchallenged, is submission to it, Locsin said.The embassy, however, denied that the law was targeting any one country.The law's passage doesn't indicate any change of China's maritime policy, the diplomatic mission said. China has always been committed to managing differences with countries including the Philippines through dialogue and consultations and upholding peace and stability in the South China Sea.Still, the law has raised concerns in the international community. A day after its passage, the U.S. Navy announced that the Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Strike Group had entered the South China Sea to conduct routine operations including maritime strike exercises and coordinated tactical training between surface and air units.Relentlessly fake news'Last week, Filipino fisherman Larry Hugo accused the CCG of driving fishermen away while they were fishing near the Philippine-occupied Pag-asa Island, which is also called Thitu.The Chinese Embassy in Manila denied this accusation.Some forces in the Philippines, either for their own political interests or out of prejudice toward China, have not only misinterpreted China's normal legislation, but also fabricated and spread relentlessly fake news such as China Coast Guard harassing Filipino fishermen,' despite repeated denial[s] from authorities concerned including the Philippine armed forces of such an improbable case, the embassy said.On Sunday, Filipino news website Inquirer.net said that Chinese research vessel Jia Geng had been anchored off the coast of Bato, in eastern Catanduanes province, since Jan 28 without clearance from the Philippines government.The Chinese embassy said the ship's presence was being sensationalized as an intrusion.The fact is that the Chinese scientific survey ship is seeking humanitarian shelter in Philippine waters due to unfavorable weather and sea conditions in the Pacific where they are scheduled to conduct research mission, the embassy said. The ship has sought clearance and humanitarian assistance from the Philippine government and maintained communication with its relevant authorities all the time, the embassy statement said.A Filipino government source, however, told the Inquirer that the vessel had sought clearance from the Philippine government on Jan. 30 to drop anchor from Jan. 29 to Feb. 2 due to weather and sea conditions, but the application remained pending as of Sunday.In 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague struck down China's expansive claims in the South China Sea after the Philippines sought international intervention because Beijing had effectively seized control of the Scarborough Shoal in 2012.Beijing has never recognized the ruling, or the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), on which the tribunal based its ruling.Reported by BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service.Load-Date: February 2, 2021End of Document

It didn’t mention China by name or the group’s alleged links to the government in Beijing. The statement posted also on the agency's Twitter site in English.Finland’s National Bureau of Investigation, NBI, said late December that it had started an investigation into suspected gross hacking and espionage attacks on the information systems of Eduskunta, the Finnish legislature. Among other things, some lawmakers' email accounts were compromised.Parliament has since upgraded the systems' security features.NBI’s Tero Muurman, who is in charge of the investigation, said Thursday his agency was probing further Supo’s allegation of APT31\u2032s involvement. He said the breach likely aimed to “acquire information for the benefit of a foreign nation or to harm Finland.”FireEye, one of the world’s major cybersecurity firms, and other data security firms have linked APT31 to the Chinese government or operations conducted on its orders.APT is an abbreviation for “advanced persistent threat,” a general term to describe an attack in which an intruder — or intruders — establishes an illicit and usually long-term presence on a network to acquire highly sensitive data.Earlier this month, Supo said that the intelligence services of foreign powers have expanded their cyber espionage operations in Finland during the COVID-19 pandemic through either directly targeting Finnish organizations or using Finnish infrastructure.The agency has earlier named China and Russia as being the most active countries spying on Finland.Arctic issues is an area of particular interest to China in the Nordic countries.The Finnish public broadcaster YLE reported earlier March that the state-funded Polar Research Institute of China attempted in 2018 to buy or lease an airport near the small northern town of Kemijarvi in the Lapland area, Finland’s Arctic region, for research flights over the North Pole and other Arctic regions. The Finnish military, however, blocked the deal on security concerns. as the airport is close to a military area.The parliament of Norway, Finland’s Nordic neighbor, was hit by a cyberattack last year that the country’s domestic security agency said was probably done by the hacking group APT28, which has been linked to Russia’s GRU military intelligence agency.Load-Date: March 18, 2021End of Document

Li, who was part of the group of doctors in Wuhan who warned that a SARS-like virus was spreading in this city in central China in December 2019, was reprimanded by police for spreading "rumors." Li's death in February 2020, after being infected with the virus by a patient, generated a wave of national mourning and numerous criticisms of the government for its uns transparent way of dealing with the health crisis. Since then, the Chinese government has focused its message on highlighting the effectiveness with which the spread of coronavirus has slowed in the country, while critical comments are quickly erased by internet censors. But Li's personal page on Weibo -- equivalent to Twitter in China -- remains a space where users can commemorate the trauma of the start of the pandemic, when the government imposed strict confinement on the city of Wuhan and Hubei Province to which it belongs.Thousands of messages of homage were sent on the occasion of the first anniversary of the doctor's death."

Homeland Security Department Issues Report Entitled 'Risks & Considerations for Businesses Using Data Services & Equipment From Firms Linked to People's Republic of China'Targeted News ServiceFebruary 19, 2021 Friday 3:10 AM  ESTCopyright 2021 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 523 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON, Feb. 19 -- The Department of Homeland Security issued the following 15-page report entitled "Data Security Business Advisory: Risks and Considerations for Businesses Using Data Services and Equipment from Firms Linked to the People's Republic of China".* * *SummaryThis Advisory describes the data-related risks American businesses face as a result of the actions of the People's Republic of China (PRC) and outlines steps that businesses can take to mitigate these risks. Businesses expose themselves and their customers to heightened risk when they share sensitive data with firms located in the PRC, or use equipment and software developed by firms with an ownership nexus in the PRC, as well as with firms that have PRC citizens in key leadership and security-focused roles (together, "PRC firms"). Due to PRC legal regimes and known PRC data collection practices, this is particularly true for data service providers and data infrastructure.The PRC's data collection actions result in numerous risks to U.S. businesses and customers, including: the theft of trade secrets, of intellectual property, and of other confidential business information; violations of U.S. export control laws; violations of U.S. privacy laws; breaches of contractual provisions and terms of service; security and privacy risks to customers and employees; risk of PRC surveillance and tracking of regime critics; and reputational harm to U.S. businesses.These risks result from direct actions of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and from PRC laws that coerce PRC firms into providing data and relevant information to the Chinese government. This Advisory provides an overview of PRC laws and initiatives that compel PRC firms and entities to secretly cooperate with PRC security and intelligence services. These laws may be used to compel PRC firms to illicitly provide the PRC government with data, logical access, encryption keys, and other vital technical information, as well as to install "backdoors" or "bugdoors" in equipment which create security flaws easily exploitable by PRC entities./1This Advisory concludes with recommended actions U.S. businesses can take to address these risks. Businesses that share data with PRC firms or use equipment developed, maintained, or operated by PRC firms should apply due diligence policies and procedures, including consideration of alternative data service providers and equipment. By following these recommendations, businesses can mitigate the data-related risks posed by the PRC and improve the privacy and security of their customers.The full report can be viewed at https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/20_1222_data-security-business-advisory.pdfTARGETED NEWS SERVICE (founded 2004) features non-partisan 'edited journalism' news briefs and information for news organizations, public policy groups and individuals; as well as 'gathered' public policy information, including news releases, reports, speeches.

Xiaomi will invest 10 billion in the production of electric carsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 30, 2021 TuesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 375 wordsBody       After smartphones, electric cars. Chinese giant Xiaomi announced on Tuesday that it will invest in the production of electric vehicles, in which it plans to invest about US$10 billion (8.5 billion euros) over the next decade. It joins competitors Apple and Huawei, who will also be developing their own vehicles.The company will create a new division, to which it will allocate an initial investment equivalent to 1.3 billion euros, which will be led by the company's co-founder, Lei Jun. "We have a deep pocket for this project," said the multimillionaire, quoted by Bloomberg, at the project presentation event, which took place in Beijing. "I am fully aware of the risks inherent in the automotive industry. I am also aware that this project will take between three and five years at least and that it will require tens of millions in investment," he said.According to Bloomberg, Xiaomi intends to launch itself into the electric vehicle business alone, without the participation of outside investors. Last week, Reuters advanced that the company will work in partnership with Chinese manufacturer Great Wall Motors. Without going into details, Lel Jun just assured that this will be "the last startup" of his career.In a statement, Xiaomi said it "hopes to offer quality intelligent electric vehicles that allow all people in the world to enjoy intelligent life anytime, anywhere."            Read Also Lexus wants to make small revolution to enter the race for electric vehicles                 Xiaomi is the third largest smartphone manufacturer in the world and in the last quarter of last year was the brand whose sales grew the most in China, ahead of Huawei. The entry into the electric car business comes at a time when the appetite for these vehicles increases in China, with incentives hitchhiking. By 2021, 1.9 million electric cars are expected to be sold in the country, representing an annual increase of 51%, according to forecasts by Canalys. The Chinese government wants one-fifth of the cars sold in the country to be electric by 2025.            Read Also The electric bikes that will heat up the market in 2021 Tesla exceeds 600 supercharger stations in Europe.

Huawei posts record profit in 2020 even if its turnover stagnatesCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 31, 2021 WednesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 365 wordsBodyChinese telecom giant Huawei on Wednesday announced a record net profit in 2020, but a turnover stagnated by the coronavirus pandemic and U.S. sanctions.In 2020, Huawei made a rising net profit of 3.2% per year at 64.6 billion yuan (8.39 billion euros, $9.84 billion).Turnover advanced by 3.8%, up from 19.1% recorded a year earlier, and stood at 891.4 billion yuan (115.9 billion euros, 134 billion dollars)."Last year we remained strong in the face of adversity," company president Ken Hu said in a statement.The future of Huawei, the world's first provider of telecommunications network equipment and first smartphone brand, has been in question since Donald Trump's previous US administration launched a campaign against the company in 2018 that has been diminishing its results.Bloomberg News reported that Huawei's revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020 was cut for the first time in its history. Huawei representatives did not confirm this immediately.Before U.S. pressure began, revenue growth typically hovered around 30% or more, although it slowed to around 19% in 2019.At a briefing at Huawei headquarters in Shenzhen, South, Hu blamed the pandemic and america's "unfair" measures of lower growth in 2020.Smartphone sales have stagnated after Washington cut Huawei's access to key components and prohibited it from using Google's Android operating system on their phones.Huawei said its consumer products division -- which manufactures smartphones and other devices and accounts for more than 50% of total revenue -- recorded sales growth of 3.3% in 2020.But that figure hides the impact of U.S. sanctions. Data from independent analysts showed that phone sales, both at home and abroad, plummeted by more than 40% in the fourth quarter of 2020.In addition, several U.S. allies responded to Washington's warnings about the threat to the safety of Huawei equipment by prohibiting the use of its network equipment in national telecommunications systems.The United States, mired in growing rivalry with China, fears that the Communist Party government may use Huawei's worldwide systems for espionage.

Cvirus.- Brazil's Supreme authorizes investigation against Pazuello for its management in the Amazon crisisCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 26, 2021 TuesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 513 wordsBodyBolsonaro announces agreement with China for the arrival of inputs with which to develop the COVID-19 vaccine   MADRID, 26 (EUROPA PRESS)   Brazil's Supreme Court Judge Ricardo Lewandowski gave the green light on Monday to the opening of the investigation proposed by the Prosecutor's Office against the Minister of Health, Eduardo Pazuello, for his management of the health crisis in the state of Amazonas, with a collapsed health system and an unmet oxygen demand that has crowded cemeteries and crematoriums.   Pazuello, Brazil's third minister of health since the pandemic's origin, will be formally investigated for a possible crime of omission in his duties, after the Prosecutor's Office has filed a letter stating that, despite being aware of the situation, he acted late to remedy it.   Pending the deadlines for the process to be set definitively, the Supreme has advanced that the first authority to give a statement should be the Federal Police and subsequently Pazuello, not five days after his first subpoena, after Lewandowski initially gave 60 days to the Prosecutor's Office to collect and present all his investigations.   According to the report presented last Saturday to the Supreme, the Ministry of Health was negligent in not acting on time even knowing of the health collapse faced by Manaus, the capital of Amazonas, as well as the delay in the arrival of oxygen and the need to move many patients to other regions and states in order to alleviate the saturation suffered by hospitals.   For his part, the president of the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies, Rodrigo Maia, has joined the criticisms against Minister Pazuello, of which he "has no doubt" of his responsibility in the current situation suffered by cities such as Manaus, reports the Brazilian press.   "I have no doubt that he committed a crime, that he was irresponsible," said Maia, who criticizes Pazuello for not recommending "early treatment" or not "allied with the Butantan Institute," regarding the development that the Sao Paulo lab is making of the Chinese vaccine.CHINA SENDS INPUTS TO DEVELOP VACCINE IN BRAZIL   Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has used his social media on Monday to announce an agreement with the Chinese authorities that has made "5,400 litres of inputs" needed to develop the vaccine reach the country in the coming days.   "The Chinese embassy informed us that the export of the 5,400 liters of inputs for the Coronavac vaccine was approved and they are already in airport area for rapid shipment to Brazil, arriving in the coming days," he said on his Facebook account.   "I appreciate the sensitivity of the Chinese government," said Bolsonaro, who for months has spared no spare in his attacks and criticism of Beijing and his vaccine, of which he said a few days ago it was "like throwing a coin in the air."   Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health confirmed on Monday 26,816 new positives and 627 deaths. In total, there are more than 8.87 million people who have contracted the disease in the country, of whom 7.7 million have recovered and 217,664 have died.Load-Date: January 27, 2021End of Document

Chinese TV features blackface performers in New Year's galaAssociated Press InternationalFebruary 12, 2021 Friday 2:12 PM GMTCopyright 2021 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: LIFESTYLE; INTERNATIONAL NEWS; ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLength: 528 wordsByline: JOE McDONALD, Associated PressDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) — Chinese state TV included dancers in blackface portraying Africans in a holiday gala for the second time in three years, prompting criticism online, as Asia welcomed the Year of the Ox with muted festivities amid travel curbs to contain renewed coronavirus outbreaks.The “African Song and Dance” performance Thursday came at start of the Spring Festival Gala, one of the world’s most-watched TV programs. It included Chinese dancers in African-style costumes and dark face makeup beating drums.The five-hour annual program, which state TV has said in the past is seen by as many as 800 million viewers, also included tributes to nurses, doctors and others who fought the coronavirus pandemic that began in central China in late 2019.Festivities for the holiday, normally East Asia's busiest tourism season, are muted after China, Vietnam, Taiwan and other governments tightened travel curbs and urged the public to avoid big gatherings following renewed virus outbreaks.China's ruling Communist Party tries to promote an image of unity with African nations as fellow developing economies. But China Central Television has faced criticism over using blackface to depict African people in past New Year broadcasts.On Twitter, Black Livity China, a group for people of African descent who work in or with China, called the broadcast “extremely disappointing.” It noted CCTV’s 2018 Spring Festival Gala featured performers in blackface with a monkey.“We cannot stress enough the impact scenes such as these have on African and Afro-diasporic communities living in China,” the group said.Elsewhere in China, Buddhist and Daoist temples that usually are packed with holiday worshippers were closed. Streets in major cities were largely empty.Visitors gathered outside the locked gates of the Tibetan-style Lama Temple on Beijing’s north side to burn incense and pray.Ji Jianping, who wore a jacket and face mask in red, the traditional color of good fortune, said she and her family skipped visiting their hometown in the northern province of Shanxi due to the pandemic.“I wish for safety and health, as well as happiness for my family,” said Ji, 62.The government’s appeal to China's public to avoid travel is denting spending on tourism and gifts. But economists say the overall impact might be limited if factories, shops and factories keep operating instead of taking their usual two-week break.The Commerce Ministry said it found 48 million more people in Chinese cities planned to celebrate where they live instead of traveling. Departures from Beijing’s two major airports were down 75% from last year on Wednesday, the Chinese capital’s government reported.In Taiwan, merchants said this year's sales are up 10%-20% because Taiwanese celebrated at home with family dinners instead of traveling abroad.“Business this year is good. We have even more people,” said a sausage vendor in the capital, Taipei, who would give only his surname, Tsai. “People stay home and prepare food for year-end dinner to share with friends and family.”___AP video journalist Caroline Chen in Beijing and journalist Taijing Wu in Taipei, Taiwan, contributed to this report.Load-Date: February 12, 2021End of Document

Alibaba Group To Shutter China's Xiami Music ServiceBillboardJanuary 6, 2021 WednesdayCopyright 2021 Prometheus Global Media, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; TAGLength: 515 wordsByline: Alexei BarrionuevoHighlight: Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group will shutter music streaming platform Xiami Music in February amid scrutiny of Alibaba and its founder, Jack Ma.BodyChinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group will shut down its music streaming platform Xiami Music in February, in a step back from its ambitious plans to enter China’s entertainment industry.According to an official notice on social media on Tuesday, Xiami said it would shut down the service on Feb. 5 "due to business development adjustments." Artist albums will no longer be sold on the site after Jan. 5, the notice says.Founded in 2008, Xiami Music was once a strong taste-making platform in China but fell off in popularity after being acquired by Alibaba Group in 2013. Alibaba, founded by e-commerce billionaire Jack Ma, has recently come under regulatory scrutiny in China for its alleged monopolistic practices.Xiami is one of the smaller digital music services in China. While user numbers are not publicly available, Xiami's music penetration was less than 2% in 2019, with about five million Monthly Active Users in mainland China, according to local Chinese reports.The country's biggest streaming platforms are QQ Music, Kugou Music, Kuwo Music and WeSing, all owned by tech giant Tencent Music Entertainment Group. Collectively those four services have more than 800 million users, says Tencent.Tencent's biggest competitor is NetEase Cloud Music, operated by Chinese internet company NetEase, which claims to have more than 600 million registered users.Xiami and NetEase Cloud Music cut a deal in 2018 for the streaming services to share libraries and grow their respective repertoires - a move seen as a way to strengthen both platforms against Tencent Music. Alibaba acquired a  in NetEase Cloud Music in 2019, investing about $700 million in conjunction with Yunfeng Financial Group.China was the fourth-biggest market for streaming revenues in 2019, according to the IFPI’s Global Music Report, generating $590.9 million in total revenue. Streaming made up more than 90% of recorded music revenues in China, which had the second-highest number of subscription-service users behind the U.S. in 2019.Xiami has focused on discovery and sharing, and on providing  of music files. But despite millions of dollars of investment by Alibaba, Xiami struggled soon after the acquisition. It lagged its rivals in adhering to orders from the Chinese government, beginning in 2015, to respect copyrights and stop unauthorized distribution of music. More recently, Xiami came under scrutiny from users for stymying creativity by implementing features like a fast-audition function, which uses big data algorithms to select the 30-second "essence" of a song.Ma, one of China's most visible Internet pioneers, put himself in the crosshairs of Chinese authorities after he criticized regulators for not being innovative enough in an Oct. 24 speech. Following the speech, regulators scuttled the stock-market debut of Alibaba affiliate Ant Group, which owns China's largest digital payment platform, Alipay, which has one billion users and some 80 million merchants. Ant Group was set to raise $34.5 billion in the world's largest IPO, which valued the company at $313 billion.Link to ImageLoad-Date: January 7, 2021End of Document

British Foreign Office: Hong Kong BN(O) Visa - U.K. Government to Honour Historic CommitmentTargeted News ServiceJanuary 29, 2021 Friday 8:20 AM  ESTCopyright 2021 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 595 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: LONDON, England BodyThe British Foreign and Commonwealth Office issued the following news release:The commitment was made following the Chinese government's imposition of the National Security Law in Hong Kong last year, in breach of its commitments under international law.The visa reflects the UK's historic and moral commitment to the people of Hong Kong who have had their rights and freedoms restricted.Those with British National (Overseas) (BN(O)) status and their eligible family members will be able to come to the UK to live, study and work. As with other visas, after 5 years in the UK, they will be able to apply for settlement, followed by British citizenship after a further 12 months.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said:I am immensely proud that we have brought in this new route for Hong Kong BN(O)s to live, work and make their home in our country.In doing so we have honoured our profound ties of history and friendship with the people of Hong Kong, and we have stood up for freedom and autonomy - values both the UK and Hong Kong hold dear.Home Secretary Priti Patel said:Global Britain will always stand up for what is right and uphold our commitments. This new visa delivers on our promise to the people of Hong Kong, honouring our strong historic relationship and upholding their freedoms.I look forward to welcoming people wanting to put down roots and build a new life with their family in the UK.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said:We have been clear we won't look the other way when it comes to Hong Kong. We will live up to our historic responsibility to its people.China's imposition of the National Security Law in Hong Kong constitutes a clear and serious breach of the Sino-British Joint Declaration contrary to international law.With the launch of this new visa route, BN(O) citizens will now have a choice to come and live, work and study in the UK.Applicants for the visa with certain biometric passports will also be able to apply from home using a smartphone app to scan their passport rather than having to visit a visa application centre.From 23 February, BN(O) status holders and their eligible family members who hold a biometric BN(O), Hong Kong Special Administrative Region or European Economic Area (EEA) passport can scan their passport on the app and complete their application from home. They will be the first non-EEA citizens to be able to do so.The UK committed to this visa following the imposition of the National Security Law imposed by the Chinese government in June 2020, in a clear breach of the Sino-British Joint Declaration. The 1984 declaration is a legally binding treaty which commits to ensure the rights and freedoms of the people of Hong Kong and maintain Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy.From 15 July 2020 to 13 January 2021, approximately 7,000 BN(O) status holders and their dependants have been granted Leave Outside the Rules at the border. BN(O) status holders will not need to apply for the new route straight away. We have made the decision to extend the Leave Outside the Rules at the border scheme until after the route becomes fully digital.In addition to the Immigration Health Surcharge, the visa fee payable to stay for 5 years will be pound sterling250 per person or applicants will also be able to apply to stay for 30 months which will cost pound sterling180 per person. This is lower than many other visas.The UK government is working with civil society groups and others to welcome BN(O) status holders to all parts of the UK and help them integrate.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7367552 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: January 29, 2021End of Document

International AntiCounterfeiting Coalition Issues Public Comment on U.S. Trade Representative NoticeTargeted News ServiceFebruary 2, 2021 Tuesday 1:39 AM  ESTCopyright 2021 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 3305 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON, Feb. 2 -- International AntiCounterfeiting Coalition Inc. has issued a public comment on the U.S. Trade Representative notice entitled "Hearing: 2021 Special 301 Review". The comment was written on Jan. 28, 2021, and posted on Jan. 29, 2021:* * *INTRODUCTIONThe International AntiCounterfeiting Coalition, Inc. ("IACC"), is pleased to submit these recommendations to the Office of the United States Trade Representative ("USTR"), pursuant to the request published in the Federal Register on December 15, 2020, seeking written comments from the public concerning the acts, policies, and practices of foreign countries relevant to the determination by the USTR, in cooperation with its interagency partners in the Special 301 review ("Special 301"), under Section 182 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, 19 USC Sec. 2242, of countries that deny adequate and effective protection of intellectual property rights ("IPR") or deny fair and equitable market access to U.S. persons who rely on intellectual property protection.The IACC is the world's oldest and largest organization dedicated exclusively to combating trademark counterfeiting and copyright piracy. Founded in 1979, and based in Washington, D.C., the IACC represents more than 200 corporations, trade associations, and professional firms, spanning a broad cross-section of industries. IACC members include many of the world's best-known brands in the apparel, automotive, electronics, entertainment, luxury goods, pharmaceutical, software, and other consumer product sectors.Central to the IACC's mission is the education of both the general public and policy makers regarding the severity and scope of the harms caused by intellectual property crimes - not only to legitimate manufacturers and retailers, but also to consumers and governments worldwide. The IACC seeks to address these threats by promoting the adoption of legislative and regulatory regimes to effectively protect intellectual property rights, and to encourage the application of resources sufficient to implement and enforce those regimes.To that end, the IACC worked with both foreign government officials and the private sector throughout the past year to identify, and to seek remedies to, legislative deficiencies and practical impediments to IP enforcement. The IACC has also led the development of voluntary collaborative programs on a global scale to address key priorities in the online space, including its RogueBlock and IACC MarketSafe programs. The role of governments in encouraging these types of collaborative approaches remains vital. Further, rights-holders continue to face concerns that require direct intervention by governments at home and abroad. These challenges continue to evolve, and we welcome the assistance of the U.S. government in resolving both the new concerns highlighted in this year's comments, and those which have been reported in past years' submissions.Whether measured in terms of lost sales to legitimate manufacturers, tax revenues and duties that go unpaid to governments, decreased employment, or diminished investment in capital improvements and research and development; counterfeiting is a significant drain on the U.S. and global economy. Further, the production and distribution of goods manufactured in an entirely unregulated supply chain, where the makers have every incentive to cut corners by using cheap, substandard components, and no incentive to abide by accepted standards of consumer health and safety, presents a clear threat to the health and well-being of consumers, and to the integrity of our national security infrastructure./1We look forward to working with you to ensure the safety of consumers and the vitality of legitimate manufacturers and retailers impacted by the global trade in counterfeit and pirated goods.As in past years, the comments submitted by the IACC are drawn from a variety of sources including surveys of member companies, interviews with local experts in the identified countries of concern, research of publicly-available sources, and data generated by the IACC through its own programs and direct engagement with foreign governments. It should be noted, however, that the countries and issues discussed herein are not an exhaustive list of rights-holders' concerns, but merely a snapshot of current and ongoing issues faced by rights-holders around the world, to which the IACC wishes to draw special attention. It is expected that the majority of the countries and issues raised in this filing will come as no surprise to USTR and the interagency team, as many of those highlighted by IACC members are long-standing concerns that have been raised in previous years' filings.Our comments this year cover 35 countries and span five continents, underscoring the truly global scope of the problems faced by rights-holders. Twelve countries are recommended for inclusion at the Priority Watch List level, and an additional fifteen for the Watch List. While we make no formal recommendation for the placement of the remaining eight countries, it is hoped that those comments will serve to inform the interagency team's determinations when considered within the broader context of comments provided by other relevant parties.At the outset, we also wish to acknowledge the impact that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had on rights-holders' enforcement efforts, as well as those undertaken by government agencies, regulatory bodies, and judiciary operations around the world. Broadly speaking, most of the rights-holders providing input for the comments contained herein noted significant decreases in the trafficking of counterfeits via brick-and-mortar outlets, and concurrent increases in online sales, as consumers avoided traditional retail outlets (whether voluntarily, or due to restrictions on operations imposed by governments). In addition, rights-holders widely acknowledged the difficulties faced by their counterparts in law enforcement and customs agencies, and have taken into account those challenges in making their assessments of the present situation in each jurisdiction.We thank you for the opportunity to share our experiences.CHINAThe People's Republic of China has, for many years, been the top priority for rights-holders small and large, across all product sectors. That continued to be the case during this year's consultations. China remains the single largest source for the production of counterfeit goods sold in the U.S. market and throughout the world. In its most recently published IPR seizure statistics, U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported that China (mainland and Hong Kong) accounts for 83% of its total seizures - more than 23,000 shipments - at U.S. ports./2In terms of value, those counterfeit shipments approached 92% of total seizures - over $1.4 billion in Fiscal Year 2019./3While those figures themselves are disconcerting, perhaps more so is the fact that those seizures represent only a fraction of the Chinese-manufactured counterfeits that reach U.S. consumers each year.Many of the issues raised herein are well-known to USTR; rights-holders' perennial concerns about China's perceived over-reliance on administrative remedies, thresholds for criminal investigation and prosecution, policies related to product valuation, and continuing concerns related to bad faith trademark registrations have been discussed in numerous past submissions. Similarly, issues pertaining to online trafficking have been well-documented over the years, and remain a priority for brands across every product sector. The IP landscape in China remains extremely challenging even for well-resourced multi-nationals, and even more so for small- and medium-sized brands. Given the severity and scope of the challenges that rights-holders continue to face in the country, we strongly support China's retention on the Priority Watch List in 2021.Relevant LegislationChina's statutory framework was described by respondents in generally positive terms - "fairly robust," "workable," "generally in-line with global norms." Nearly every brand that provided feedback though highlighted areas in which improvements or additional clarity were desirable, or noted that the legal regime remains a "work in progress." To its credit, China has continued to review, refine, and modernize its IP laws.In December of last year, China's Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC) passed a new amendment to the Criminal Law Amendment (XI) that is expected to take effect on March 1, 2021. The new law focuses on six areas that have been among the Chinese government's top priorities, by both adding new crimes and raising penalties for existing ones. Rights-holders were pleased to see that IP crime was one of the enumerated priorities; the new law contains two positive changes that have been sought for years: an expansion of the definition of criminal counterfeiting to include counterfeit services, and an increase in the maximum prison term for criminal counterfeiting from 7 to 10 years.Respondents also expressed support for provisions of the Anti-Unfair Competition Law passed in recent years, which broadened the definition of unfair competition based on misuse of famous trademarks and established statutory damages of up to RMB250,000 where revenues are undetermined. It is hoped that this will aid authorities in assessing tougher penalties for such violations. Others however have identified challenges in their attempts to avail themselves of the AUCL's provisions, tied to some courts' narrow reading of the law. Additional guidance would be helpful to ensure proper application of the AUCL.Brands in the pharmaceutical sector wish to draw attention to Article 121 of the New Drugs Administration Law of China, which requires a quality test report issued by the Institute for Drug Control to support the imposition of penalties related to offenses involving counterfeit or substandard drugs. This requirement makes taking action against counterfeit drugs more difficult, due to practical constraints on obtaining such a report. Respondents cite limited access to qualified labs, the length of time necessary to obtain such testing and analysis, and the unavailability of (or lack of ready accessibility to) necessary reference samples as obstacles to compliance. The end result is that law enforcement agencies may be discouraged from pursuing those charges.EnforcementThe enforcement of IP rights remains challenging, even for the most well-resourced of the IACC's members, and that fact was borne out in the comments received during this year's consultations. As in past years, administrative enforcement is the default approach under the Chinese system, and brands have long taken issue with the high thresholds that must be overcome to allow for the involvement of criminal authorities. As documented in countless past submissions, counterfeiters have grown incredibly sophisticated in the management of their operations to evade the threat of criminal prosecution. Unfortunately, the fines imposed through the administrative enforcement process are generally seen as insufficient to create any true deterrence.Despite rights-holders' frustrations with the administrative enforcement regime; respondent brands generally expressed satisfaction with their counterparts in the AICs, Market Supervision Bureaus, and other relevant administrative bodies, noting their engagement and cooperation while also highlighting their successful handling of many cases brought to their attention. Rights-holders have, however, reported significant obstacles to these enforcement efforts. By way of example, some administrative authorities have been reluctant to pursue action against offenders who produced evidence (e.g., an invoice) that they'd obtained the relevant goods from a "legitimate source." Forged documents of this kind have been seen frequently during brands' investigations, but authorities are often inclined to accept them at face value, and simply direct the brand to pursue action against the purported supplier of the goods. Where the documents are valid, the supplier is often located across jurisdictional bounds, necessitating the IP owner's starting the enforcement process over from scratch with a new agency, and unnecessarily increasing costs to the rights-holder.Rights-holders have also noted officials' tendency to strictly apply China's sub-class trademark system in a manner that effectively limits the scope of enforcement. For example, administrative authorities may refuse to seize products bearing identical trademarks that are outside of specific classes or sub-classes of a brand's Chinese trademark registrations. This has been a source of great aggravation where an individual has used marks identical to a trademark registered for a particular class of goods, in connection with names and signage for the sale of unrelated or unauthorized goods in that same class.IACC members tended to speak highly of China's criminal enforcement bodies, with some singling out the Public Security Bureaus for their consistent support in raiding factories and large-scale distributors. Respondents also expressed their appreciation for criminal authorities' apparent growing appetite to collaborate on cross-border and multi-jurisdictional investigations. Others reported continuing cooperation in pursuing "online-to-offline" investigations in collaboration with major e-commerce platforms and criminal authorities, as was previously highlighted in last year's submission.Rights-holders comments in connection with civil enforcement this year were largely unchanged from those heard in the recent past. A priority concern in this context is the need to strengthen provisions governing the preservation of defendants' assets to ensure the viability of judgments obtained in the courts. Historically, IP owners have reported little, and often only begrudging, cooperation from Chinese financial institutions in this regard.Bad Faith TrademarksNotwithstanding recent amendments to China's Trademark Law, IACC members continue to report an unacceptably high number of bad faith trademark registrations in China. The filing of bad faith applications appears to have become a full-time job for some, as rights-holders have reported numerous encounters with individuals who have registered or have pending applications for hundreds of trademarks identical to those belonging to legitimate brands. Others, meanwhile, appear to take a more targeted approach, filing smaller numbers of applications in China, while simultaneously filing applications in other jurisdictions. Proving bad faith under China's system remains extremely challenging; and whether the applicants' ultimate objective is to "ransom" the mark or to hijack the goodwill of well-known brands, the cost to legitimate manufacturers is immense, and growing.Online ConcernsAs noted in last year's submission, the past decade has seen a dramatic shift in the counterfeit distribution chain, with direct-to-consumer and fulfillment distribution models driven by the explosion in e-commerce displacing traditional brick-and-mortar distribution. Despite these changes, China's status as the primary source for counterfeit goods globally has been a constant, and intellectual property owners have taken considerable interest in the development of China's IP regime in the online context.A primary focus of that interest has been China's implementation of the E-commerce Law. One concern that appeared consistently in the feedback received from rights-holders during this year's consultations involved the need for clear and detailed guidance on the proper scope, interpretation, and practical application of that law (including its interplay with other relevant Chinese law). As stated by one respondent, "Criminal counterfeiters will exploit any gaps or gray areas they can find ... Creating legal certainty is vital to protecting the interests of rights-holders, consumers, and legitimate e-commerce businesses." In September of last year, the PRC government issued two documents relevant to rights-holders' concerns: Guiding Opinions of the Supreme People's Court on Deciding Intellectual Property Right Disputes that Involve ECommerce Platforms ("Guiding Opinions"); and Official Reply of the Supreme People's Court on Several Questions of the Application of Law on Disputes over Network Infringements on Intellectual Property Rights ("Official Reply"), offering additional guidance concerning the application and interpretation of the law. Additional questions remain unanswered, however.Regarding the issue of contributory liability, one respondent noted that the E-commerce Law indicates that an intermediary "e-commerce platform operator" is liable for online infringing activity when it knew or should have known of infringing activity and failed to take appropriate action; this standard is repeated in the judicial guidance documents. The standard for making that determination remains unclear, however; rights-holders would encourage the provision of a clear standard that incentivizes platforms to take both proactive and reactive steps to combat infringement on their platforms.Concerning the treatment of repeat offenders, judicial guidance appears to indicate that platforms may only terminate a merchant's account following multiple, intentional infringements./4That guidance would appear, unnecessarily, to require platforms to engage in extensive reviews of relevant facts before arriving at a subjective determination regarding the violator's state of mind or the willfulness of each violation. A "bright line" standard would be preferred.Others have pointed to concerns about the rapid evolution of e-commerce (and counterfeiters') business models, and the potential for the law's strict definitions to become quickly outdated. As noted in last year's submissions, IP owners are already reporting that counterfeiters are migrating their operations away from traditional e-commerce platforms to social media and commerce outlets that may not fall squarely within the four corners of the law.IACC members have likewise encouraged the consideration of more comprehensive "know your customer" requirements as a means to facilitating enforcement and preventing known bad actors from restarting or migrating their operations following disciplinary action (whether imposed by an e-commerce platform, or the government).View full comment at: https://www.regulations.gov/contentStreamer?documentId=USTR-2020-0041-0044&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=pdf* * *Footnotes:1/ It is worth noting that seizures of counterfeit goods deemed to pose a heightened risk to consumers' health and safety now account for greater than 20% of U.S. Customs and Border Protection's total IPR-related seizures by volume, and greater than 11% by value.

Government agrees with Chinese company to manufacture electric cars in the countryCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 5, 2021 FridayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 523 wordsBody             By Andrew Lerner       The automotive sector is key to defining industrial policy. Because of the sources of work it generates, for the capital it mobilizes and for the impact it can have on the trade balance. In the Government they have been closely following the green agenda and are betting on sustainable mobility in the future. In this line, Minister Matías Kulfas and former special representative for the Promotion of Trade and Investment in China (now a designated ambassador), Sabino Vaca Narvaja, signed an agreement this week for Jiangsu Jiankang Automobile to manufacture electric cars and lithium-powered batteries in the country.According to official sources, "the company undertook to make the necessary investments for the construction of a new battery production plant for sustainable mobility." In turn, it will also "advance in a complete chassis plant of urban passenger buses, units approximately 12 meters long, in Argentine territory".The Government seeks to generate exports in addition to supplying the domestic market. In this regard, the agreement of the parties given through a memorandum details: "The factory must have economic scale capacities that are feasible to reasonably supply Argentine and foreign markets, in particular neighbouring markets in Latin America".Add to the sector's historic discussion in the country about the level of integration of the vehicles that are produced is now added to the question of where the sector will converge. The answer seems concrete: during 2020 in Europe the sale of electric cars doubled and in Argentina more than 53.9% grew despite the crisis.As Scope advanced, the Ministryof Productive Development works on a plan to boost the sector. "We believe there are conditions for Argentina to assume a leadership role in electromobility, with a robust legal framework that we are designing," President Alberto Fernández confirmed last week at the Davos forum.As this medium found out, the Government plans to create a twenty-year regime with staggered benefits for manufacturers and users. From the Ministry of Productive Development they detailed that it will be a broad-spectrum regime. In this regard, they explained that it will include terminals, autopartists, auxiliary equipment manufacturers, sustainable fuel, software and hardware, among others.The official project also includes the creation of the Sustainable Mobility Trust Fund to provide funding and funding to the Program. The National Institute of Sustainable Mobility in charge of research, development and innovation will also have a preponderance. In turn, this medium was able to find out that some of the items will be included in the automotive bill to be discussed in the extraordinary sessions of Congress and other chapters will be defined over the course of the year.Vaca Narvaja argued that "this is a strategic project given the high added value of transforming lithium into batteries and the development of the electric vehicle industry for the country." Argentina currently has one-seventh of the world's Lithium reserves and is the world's third largest producer of lithium.Load-Date: February 6, 2021End of Document

How could China control the pandemic?CE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 27, 2021 WednesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 663 wordsBodyBut the increase in its GDP in the last quarter of 2020 was 6.5%, so it matched the values it had before the pandemic by giving a signal to the world that it is the first country to return to normal.The contagions reported by China since the start of the pandemic have not yet reached 100,000 in total, when in the US the average daily number of contagions is close to 200,000. This month, China reported the first covid-19 death since May, on the other hand the US has more than 3,200 daily dead on average in the past week. But how did China achieve these results?From the outing point, the decisions of the Asian giant's government were immediate and forceful. The isolation was strict and effective, the city of Wuhan was closed, and then continued with fifteen other cities, reaching almost half of the population throughout the country who had to stay at home for almost two months. In addition, the Chinese government demonstrated a great capacity for mass testing, reaching its record in October last year when 10 million people were tested in Qingdao City in just 5 days.Unlike other countries, china's political system has the advantage of making decisions that involve concentrating efforts for emergencies like this, which allowed them to use resources across the country to support Wuhan and cities with contagions. It was surprising, for example, the rapid construction of a network of 30 temporary hospitals with thousands of beds each and the conversion of stadiums into isolation centers, where all patients with covid-19 were admitted so that they would not have to isolate themselves in their homes with the possibility that they would infect their relatives. Moreover, for China, as the world's leading manufacturer of health equipment and equipment, it was easy to stock up on everything needed to combat covid-19.One of the most innovative measures was the implementation of "Health QR Code". This tool uses Big Data technology developed by Alibaba and Tencent to prevent and control covid-19. The massivity of its use was immediate as these companies added this QR Code to the two most used applications in China, which are Alipay – which is used to make payments online- and WeChat – similar to WhatsApp. This QR code works using three colors as a traffic light.The green code allows you to circulate freely. The yellow code requires the person to stay at home for 7 days, and the code red for 14 days. Those with these two colors must report their situation permanently and receive surprise visits at their homes. After that period, the yellow and red codes turn green.Color is defined based on places so each person was present, information that is obtained from telecommunications companies in China. If a person is in an area with a covid19 outbreak or if they were with someone who has yellow or red code, that person will become that color as well. Also all citizens have to update the QR code daily entering the body temperature.The use of barbijo was never in discussion, it was mandatory from the first contagions, this has made a difference with the rest of the countries. Much helped the existence of a greater awareness and custom of the use of it, both by thepollution that some Chinese cities have as for the memories of the first SARS epidemic in 2002.Another highlight is that China has been strict in receiving people from abroad by requiring a 14-day quarantine at a government-designated hotel (the cost of it is borne by each person).Since all these measures are difficult to implement in other countries because of the great social, political and economic differences, but they serve to have as a reference and understand how they did it. And finally, we cannot ignore the importance of the common good in China as a value over individualism, which facilitated the commitment and responsibility of the population in the fight against covid-19.The entrance How could China control the pandemic? was first published in Diario La República.Load-Date: January 28, 2021End of Document

Sens. Lankford, Kaine Defend Open Internet in Hong KongTargeted News ServiceMarch 19, 2021 Friday 7:41 AM  ESTCopyright 2021 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 467 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodySen. James Lankford, R-Oklahoma, issued the following news release on March 18, 2021:Senators James Lankford (R-OK) and Tim Kaine (D-VA) today introduced the Safeguarding Internet Freedom in Hong Kong Act. Since July 2020, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has implemented a "national security law" that violates the basic freedoms of Hong Kongers including the freedom to peacefully assemble and the right to freely access and share information online. The bill supports firewall circumvention infrastructure in Hong Kong to strengthen the ability of the people to share information online."China has continuously shown they have no regard for the autonomy of Hong Kong or the basic rights of its people," said Lankford. "Based on Beijing's track record, I am concerned that the internet suppression the CCP uses in mainland China will soon become a reality in Hong Kong if the United States does not act. Pro-democracy advocates speaking out against Beijing's oppression should not be censored or limited in their ability to openly communicate on the internet. Investing in firewall circumvention technology protects and safeguards the basic freedoms Hongkongers have long been guaranteed while affirming the US' commitment to proudly stand with the people of Hong Kong.""Since we first introduced this bill in July 2020, China's oppression of Hong Kong has only gotten worse. Chinese telecom service providers have blocked a pro-democracy website. Chinese authorities are arresting civil society activists and taking steps to ban anti-Beijing candidates from running for office. Those developments make opposing censorship and supporting civil society in Hong Kong through this bill and other legislation more urgent than ever," said Kaine.The bill establishes an interagency working group of officials from the Department of State, the Open Technology Fund, and the US Agency for International Development to coordinate US efforts to develop and deploy firewall circumvention technology to Hong Kong. The federal government already invests in internet freedom programs in mainland China and other areas around the world with high degrees of online censorship, but ongoing events make clear that a new program is needed to address what is happening in Hong Kong.As a commissioner on the Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC), Lankford has worked to protect the rights of Hongkongers and hold the Chinese government accountable for its human rights abuses. Lankford supported the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which was signed into law by President Trump in 2019, and the Hong Kong Autonomy Act, which became law in 2020. Last month, Lankford joined a bipartisan group of senators to introduce the Hong Kong Safe Harbor Act.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7425547 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: March 19, 2021End of Document

Those under the DACA program would be on the shortest path to citizenship. The overhaul would still need to clear congress. Meanwhile, the Biden administration is rejecting President Trump's ban to lift bans on travel into the United States from Europe, the U.K. and Brazil. These restrictions were put in place last spring to stop the spread of the coronavirus. President Trump's order lifts that ban on January 26th the same day all travelers must present a negative test or proof of recovery from COVID-19 to actually enter the United States.Parler taking the first steps to come back, the social media platform teaming with one a Russia owned technology company in order to make its website reachable again, while the social media platform is still unavailable, visitors to the website can now see a message from the CEO, John Matze saying that he expects service to be restored soon.

Joining me right now is Capital Wealth Planning, Market Strategist Jeff Saut.Also joining the conversation all morning long is Fox Business is Dagen McDowell and Matson Money President and CEO Mark Matson. Great to see everybody this morning, thank so much for being here. And let me kick it off with markets this morning and Jeff, your reaction to what we're seeing. Pretty good rally underway. What's behind it and is it sustainable?JEFF SAUT, CAPITAL WEALTH PLANNING, MARKET STRATEGIST: I think it is sustainable, Maria. Our work actually suggests we should get a pause last week and this week but so far that hasn't - I guess last week was kind of a pause. But I mean, it's like the perfect scenario. You've got good earnings, you've got low interest rates, you've got - looks to me like the virus is going to be in the rear view me mirror in the not too distant future which means people will be going to movies and restaurants and that will give the economy a lift.So it's like a prefect scenarios and the fact of the matter is when you scratch most individual investors, they're bearish which is why $5 trillion sits on the sidelines. And eventually I think that money finds its way into stocks. So I think to be secular bull markets last 15 to 20 years. So we ought to have another four to eight years in this thing and nobody believes it.BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean look, we've got rates at record low levels. But we're going to hear from Janet Yellen today, all eyes on Capitol Hill the Treasury Secretary Nominee Former Federal Reserve Chairman knows a thing or two about rock bottom interest rates, Jeff. She's expected to urge congress to pass more aid in order to avoid a longer recession. What are your expectations of what we hear out of Janet Yellen and will that further this rally, I think.SAUT: I think she's going to be selling the Biden stimulus package. I think she's going to be speaking to all the points on the Biden stimulus package, and you know it pass or failure, she does a very good job of doing that. So I would expect the markets to be friendly to what Janet Yellen has to say at 10:00 a.m. this morning.BARTIROMO: The major indices seeing prices surge in 2020 during the coronavirus pandemic, Jeff. What's your take in terms of this vaccine getting widely distributed? Do you think that will represent the kind of stimulus that Nancy Lazar at Cornerstone Macro is talking about? She's got a report out, it's the vaccine, not massive stimulus that matters and that's what's going to bring GDP up. She's got - she's going to be coming in the program, she says she's got room to go all the way up to 7 percent potentially in 2021 for the GDP.SAUT: I think that's a bit optimistic. But I think GDP could come in somewhere between 5 percent and 6 percent and I think she's right on the vaccine. I think it's all about the vaccine. I think the more you can roll out the vaccine, I think the better it is for the economy. And I think the markets are sensing that and I think that's why they're going higher here.BARTIROMO: Mark Mattson, jump in here.MARK MATSON, MATSON MONEY PRESIDENT AND CEO: Well, I think it's important for investors not to be so myopically looking at the U.S. market. We had it in since 1995 to 2000 when large stocks, S&P stocks and tech stocks had an amazing run which they have here recently followed by a disastrous crash. And I think investors have to be prepared for that. Many people don't know they can lose 50 percent of their stocks overnight. 75 percent in tech stocks for the NASDAQ, so not only investing in the U.S., but they've got to be invested in emerging markets, they have to be globally diversified, Europe and Asia.And then furthermore, they need to really do a stress test on their portfolio and see what kind of volatility is actually crept into it and then hedge it with short-term, high quality, fixed income and if they don't do that they could - problem with predicting the future is no one can do it. So they have to be prepared to build a portfolio that doesn't have a guess for the future.BARTIROMO: Well, it's a good point. And Jeff what do you think about that? There's so many issues where international markets. You've got the issues around China, you've got a weak recovery in Europe, we're going to hear from the European Central Bank this week. How much of one's money do you believe should be placed internationally, Jeff?SAUT: I think you should have some positions in international markets. I tend to use mutual funds to do that. I don't buy the individual stocks. As far as a crash is concerned, it's typically one crash to a generation and we've seen ours. Could we get a pullback? Yes. But I doubt seriously you're going to get a crash in this equity market with all - equity market with all the money that's sitting on the sidelines and people wanting to get in.BARTIROMO: All right, Jeff, it's great to see you this morning. Thanks very much. We'll check back soon, in a week that is jam packed with earnings certainly will direct and set the tone for markets, Jeff, it's good to see you this morning. Have a good day, Jeff Saut joining us there. We are just getting started this morning. Coming up, retired Four Star General Jack Keane is here, talking about security surrounding the inauguration, China's latest sanctions on the U.S. over Taiwan, we're going to get into it.And in the next hour, New York Congressman Tom Reed will be here talking about bipartisanship, bridging the congressional divide and then the Surgeon General, Dr. Jerome Adams, joins us with an exclusive report on community health and economic prosperity. The very latest on the vaccine rollout coming up.In the 8:00 a.m. hour, Former Georgia Congressman Doug Collins will be here discussing the big tech censorship and criminal justice reformed. Plus, Trump 2020 campaign Senior Adviser Mercedes Schlapp, will join us to discuss President Trump's legacy. What policies Joe Biden could potentially reverse. Don't miss a moment of it. We've got a big show this morning. You're watching "Mornings with Maria" live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The first hearings for President-Elect Joe Biden's cabinet nominations are set to begin later this morning, just one day before his inauguration. The hearing kick off with the Finance Committee, Treasury Secretary Nominee Janet Yellen the Intelligence Committee will hold a hearing for the Director of National Intelligence pick, Avril Haines, and Homeland Security Nominee Alejandro Mayorkas, appearing before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, later this after Secret Secretary of State Nominee Anthony Blinken will sit before the Foreign Relations Committee and the Arm Services Committee, holding a hearing for Defense Secretary Nominee, Lloyd J. Austin, all that happening today as and this week.Joining me right now is USA Today Washington Bureau Chief, Susan Page. Susan it's great to see you this morning. Welcome, what do you think about the nominees, who will have an easier path and who will have a tougher path getting past the senate?SUSAN PAGE, USA TODAY WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF: I think Janet Yellen will have the smoothest path of these five maybe the entire cabinet. She is a very familiar figure on Capitol Hill and in the world of finance. It's possible she'll get confirmed tomorrow, on the day of Joe Biden's inauguration. But this is unusual. No cabinet official do we think will be confirmed before the inauguration.In the past, for President Trump, two of his nominees - cabinet nominees were confirmed by that point, for Barack Obama it was six. So things are getting off to a somewhat slower start than it's been customary in recent times.BARTIROMO: I don't know about slower than the Trump administration, everybody was acting secretary for years.PAGE: He had some problems with confirmations and keeping people but at this point, at his inauguration, he had two of his cabinet appointments confirmed. There's been a modern tradition of trying to get National Security Officials in particular confirmed and ready to go because of the need to take over that hasn't happen this time.Although we think General Austin will get confirmed. We don't anticipate a big problem there, once he gets a waiver, for having been served in the military in the past several seven years that's been our requirement in a waiver if he been in the military in the period of time. All these nominees we think are likely to be confirmed. It's just going to take a little bit of time.BARTIROMO: Susan, we're just getting news of Bank of America and its earnings are authorizing a huge buyback plan, three and a quarter billion dollar stock purchases from Bank of America as the company reports its earnings. This speaks directly to the economy after that huge spending package that Joe Biden announced last week, $1.9 trillion. Do you have an expectation that this moves the needle in terms of economic growth, as so many small businesses face shutdowns?PAGE: Maria, I should leave the economic analysis to you. You know more about it than I do. But I do know that the Biden folks and Democrats in congress thing this big spending package that the Biden administration is proposing will do a lot to help small businesses, to help individuals, to help schools reopen. And to help with distribution of the vaccine and I know I heard earlier on your show how important distribution of the vaccine is for the economy of the nation.BARTIROMO: Absolutely. And all of the stimulus coming into the market has certainly been a positive for the stock market. We'll see when markets start focusing on debt. Let me ask you about President Trump expected to issue as many as 100 pardons and commutations on the final full day in office, today, potential parlors including the President's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, for White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon, Rapper Lil Wayne. Who are you expecting to be pardon Susan?PAGE: You know, I think we will discover in four years, it's dangerous to predict what President Trump is going to do. It's probably better waiting to see. Certainly, a lot of the speculation has been around whether he'll pardon himself and White House officials are now telling reporters that doesn't seem to be likely you to happen.You know for one thing it might be seen as an acknowledgement of guilt. President Trump has said he hasn't done anything wrong. It would also take away his Fifth Amendment Protection against incriminating himself as he said got a pardon back it would be a complication for us. So we're watching for will he pardon himself, will he pardon his kids, will he pardon Rudy Giuliani. He's got just over 24 hours left to do that.BARTIROMO: What I'm wondering is if he's going to pardon Julian Assange. There was a lot of conversation about whether or not Julian Assange would get a pardon and there are people who were appealing to the President in that regard. Susan, there's a new USA Today poll out as you know showing most Americans are braced for violence at tomorrow's inauguration. Look at all this National Guards troops. A majority more than 65 percent feel the country is headed down the wrong track, Susan. What's the reaction to the poll that you've taken there at USA today?PAGE: It's so different from the tone that we usually have from Americans at the point of an inauguration. Usually this is a celebratory time where people who - the folks who won are really encouraged, the folks who lost the election are giving them offense, their moment in the sun. That's not what we're finding this week.The wounds and divisions from the election are still pretty raw and that attack on the Capitol January 6th, have left scars on Americans. They are now as you say - seven out of ten, braced for violence at the inauguration. We still hope that doesn't happen tomorrow.BARTIROMO: Absolutely. Susan, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks very much. We'll be watching of course and bringing our viewers the story.PAGE: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Susan Page, coming up, immigration, mixed signals. Joe Biden promising 11 million people a path had to citizenship while telling a new migrant caravan that now they will not be accepted just yet. We discuss that coming up. Then a sleuth for the truth, the subtle ways you can pinpoint a liar, it's making a buzz this morning. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Well, thousands of Honduran migrants are headed towards the United States border. But Joe Biden is now telling them not yet, because they will not immediately get into the country. This as the Biden administration is planning to unveil an immigration bill after taking oath tomorrow, the bill providing an eight year path to citizenship for an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants. Dagen McDowell, good morning to you, your reaction?DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NEWS CORRESPONDENT: This is what happened when you pander to the left and that's what Joe Biden did on the campaign trail, even promising federal healthcare for illegal immigrants. Come on in was the message. And this is one crisis that's already in the making, before Joe Biden is even inaugurated.I just want to point out, he's promise, he's kind of walked back the talk that he was going to reverse the stay in Mexico program of the Trump administration, he was going to rescind that day one. He's walked that back. Maybe because he knows that it works, keeping people in Mexico as they are claiming asylum, rather than allowing them into the United States and potentially releasing them into the population.But what about our pandemic, the roughly 18.5 million people here who are collecting unemployment benefits, untold many more who are unemployed what about our hospital system, our healthcare system, which is at a breaking point? What about this being a super spreader event, this caravan? Are you going to COVID test them when they get to the border? Are you going to quarantine them? I think this is something that they are incapable of dealing with, the incoming Biden administration.BARTIROMO: Dagen, talk about the impact, though. When you've got all of these people coming in illegally, eventually those people are going to look for jobs. They're going to look for government services. It takes away from American citizens. That's why there is such outrage about it, partly. And then there's the security issue. We don't know what happens when you've got illegal's coming in, in terms of security.MCDOWELL: Right, just think bouts any border - about any border communities, if people end up coming across the border and residing in the United States illegally. Again, the strain that this country is under because we're trying to battle COVID and come back from it and you're going to add to that, you're going to add to the misery of people who can't find work? Again, leisure and hospitality is one of the most hard-hit areas. I just think that this is unthinkable, what we're witnessing. But this is what President Joe Biden promised people.BARTIROMO: Yes. We've got breaking news this morning, markets, Bank of America announcing plans for a share buyback, I mentioned it earlier in the show, $2.9 billion in buyback in the first quarter, it is also declaring a dividend, 18 cents a share. It comes ahead of the company's earnings they are delayed just hour. The stock right now is trading up about 1 percent. Mark, what do you make of Bank of America and the banks? Would be buying these stocks?MATSON: Well, I think everybody should have some financial stocks in their portfolio, speaks to diversification. But I want investors to really take a deep drive a dive and start to research the history and the violations that some of these companies have had. Bank of America happens to be one of them. They have a very long sheet of violations that they've had, with the SEC, with FINRA and banking regulations and wherever you put your money, you should be verifying if the people actually have high morals, high standards, and are ethical. And if not, then you shouldn't put your money with them.BARTIROMO: Yes, I guess really the question I'm asking is we've got low interest rates but they've been creeping up. That's a positive for margins for the banks. Many people say that the banks are going to have a much better year in 2021 than they saw in 2020 for a number of reasons, interest rates at rock bottom levels were obliviously hurting their bottom line and also the economy, the economy seems to be recovering at this point, Nancy Lazar looking for 7 percent GDP. So going into 2021, do you want to own banks rather than where you were in 2020, where the stocks were under pressure.MATSON: I think investors have to look at this as a k-shaped recovery. A lot of people have made a lot of money and real estate has gone up. Look there's 10 million people still out of work. Eventually the rent comes due, eventually the mortgage comes due. No one really knows the long-term effects and no one know what Biden is going to do with a potential lockdown.So I think people would do well to stop - to diversify more broadly, not to sector pick or gamble on which sectors they're going to be leaning towards and keep the portfolio more balanced. There's just too much risk right now.BARTIROMO: That makes sense. Coming up, Washington, D.C. is on lockdown this morning. Retired Four Star General Jack Keane is here to discuss the ramped up security ahead of tomorrow inauguration of Joe Biden. You won't believe what one Democratic Congressman is saying about National Guard troops who are not Biden supporters we'll bring it to you when we come back.MARIA BARTIROMO, ANCHOR, MORNINGS WITH MARIA: Welcome back, good Tuesday morning everybody, thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, January 19th. A look at markets this half an hour, we've got a rally underway this morning, this Tuesday morning shows the Dow Industrials up about 200 points, check it out, two-thirds of 1 percent, the Nasdaq is up 127, about 1 percent, and the S&P 500 higher by three-quarters of a percent, 28 points higher. Global markets are also higher, of course, this is after the day off yesterday, markets were closed, Martin Luther King Jr. Day yesterday. Investors are watching a whole slew of earnings this week, this morning we got Bank of America and Goldman Sachs.Later on in the day, we get Netflix after the close, later. You see the companies reporting in there, stocks are up this morning. Bank of America just announced a few minutes ago a major buy-back ahead of its own earnings report. Check European markets this morning, also trading mostly higher, although it is fractional moves pretty much across the board in Europe this morning. FTSE 100 is up 20, the CAC Quarante is up 5 and the Dax Index in Germany higher by 57. In Asia overnight, stocks finished mostly higher. Best performer was Hong Kong, Hang Seng index higher by almost 3 percent overnight. Meanwhile, this, California breaks yet another COVID-19 record. Cheryl Casone with the details there. Cheryl? These are not good records.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS: And that is -- yes, exactly, Maria, and good morning to you. The state now, the first in the country to top 3 million confirmed cases. That number has tripled in just two months. Los Angeles County has over a million cases right now, this despite it being one of the areas still on lockdown. Meanwhile, hospitals in California, they're overwhelmed. Patients are now being set up in field hospitals around Los Angeles County area. Well, President Trump is expected to issue as many as 100 pardons and commutations in his final day in office. Rapper Lil Wayne and New York Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver are said to be on this list. The president is not expected to pardon himself or issue preemptive pardons to his family.Allies have also warned him not to pardon supporters who took part in the Capitol Hill riots. Tesla has begun delivery of its China-made Model Y. The milestone coming after the company broke ground on its Shanghai factory just two years ago. And now has the capacity to build half a million cars per year at this facility. Building the vehicles locally in China allows Tesla to avoid shipping costs and import duties. Chinese government has set the ambitious goal of having electric vehicles, that account over 20 percent of all auto sales there. By 2025, Tesla in the pre-market up 1.75 of a percent, Maria. Finally, this, you may not want to miss out on your chance to become a multi-millionaire. The $850 million mega millions jackpot up for grabs in tonight's drawing. This is the second largest grand prize in the game's history. Meanwhile, the big prize in tomorrow's Powerball drawing, it is now standing at $730 million. So, the combined jackpot hitting a whopping $1.6 billion. Maria. You can't win if you don't play, Maria.BARTIROMO: Yes, that's right. What is it saying, you've got to be in it to win it. Cheryl, there you go. All right.(LAUGHTER)Thank you, Cheryl. Well, security in the nation's Capitol is at an unprecedented level this morning ahead of the inauguration tomorrow. A new report says that some far-right protesters have discussed posing as members of the National Guard to infiltrate the inauguration, the way Democrats infiltrated two weeks ago and put on MAGA clothing. Acting Secretary of Defense Chris Miller says that there is no intelligence about a potential insider threat to the inauguration.This as Democrat Tennessee Congressman Steve Cohen is suggesting that National Guards men who support President Trump should be vetted as possible security threats. Joining me right now is Fox News senior strategic analyst General Jack Keane. General, it's great to see you this morning, thanks very much for being here. Have we -- have we actually gotten to this point where we are questioning our National Guard? Did you hear what Steve Cohen said about the National Guard troops, General?JACK KEANE, FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST: Yes, I mean, Congressman Cohen's statement, I mean, it's not only outrageous, Maria. I mean, this is a -- this is a statement that's significantly irresponsible and is completely baseless. What this man is saying --BARTIROMO: Yes --KEANE: Is that because National Guard soldiers -- some National Guard -- we don't have any idea how many or what, and neither does he, because they may have voted against the incoming Biden administration and because they're white, that these soldiers, as soldiers, would take up arms against an incoming administration. That is what this man is saying. That -- I have -- I've been around national security for 50 years. I have never, ever heard a politician in the United States of America or a leader of any conscript say something like that. It is totally outrageous and baseless, as I said. And he should apologize --BARTIROMO: Yes --KEANE: For a statement like that.BARTIROMO: Yes, it's absolutely disgusting. Our National Guard are working so hard and they're patriots to this country, and to question their loyalty to America is disgusting. I agree with you. Let me ask you about China, this is obviously the biggest threat to America right now, General. The Foreign Ministry announcing that it will sanction U.S. officials over, quote, "nasty behavior", in regards to Taiwan. So China is pushing back aggressively against America. The move follows the U.S. removing several self-imposed restrictions against Taiwan. We spoke about this. This was a move to try to strengthen ties between the United States and Taiwan. China doesn't like it and they're obviously going to be pushing back and doing what they can to stop the United States from getting involved in this relationship between Taiwan and China. Your reaction, General?KEANE: Well, I think Taiwan is going to be a major issue that the Biden administration is going to have to face. I think President Xi, he's at his most aggressive and most ambitious in the seven years he's been in power now. And I think he looks at the United States and the incoming administration that they're going to have some understandable distractions. One is COVID-19 and what it's doing inside the United States. Two is recovering our economy, and I also believe he thinks that the Biden administration will be involved in climate change and he'll probably be wanting to work with him on that. But he's going to press hard on Taiwan. And I think it's going to be a contested issue, and we're going to find out pretty quick, I believe as a result of Xi's actions, stepping up military intimidation which he has done rather significantly this last year, how the Biden administration is going to react to that.Will they have the same strong view that the Trump administration has, that Taiwan is an ally of ours, that we should continue to provide defense capability to them so they can shore up their own defenses. And are we going to be able -- will we respond with our allies to China's provocation? This is going to be on the table, Maria, and we're going to see how this administration reacts to it.BARTIROMO: Well, this is a really important issue and we are going to be following it because the Trump administration was probably the toughest against China than we've seen in our 40-year engagement. Would you say that that's a true statement? And where do you believe the incoming Biden administration will be poised to try to work with China and where will it be poised to try to hold the line and ensure that they require that they put consequences in place for theft of intellectual property for human rights abuses and all of these broken promises?KEANE: You know, well, I think there will be more conciliatory in tone and they'll look for cooperation and collaboration with China, certainly on the pandemic itself. I don't believe they'll have the hard line that President Trump had in terms of holding China accountable --BARTIROMO: Oh, my God --KEANE: For deception and for spreading it, and also they'll look for cooperation on climate change. The issue is really going to come down to, will they take a strong stand that the Trump administration has done against Huawei and the 5G networks spreading around the world. And if China gets the majority of those networks, they're going to own personal data, they're going to own the telecommunication systems in those countries, we know that for a fact. Will they stand up and stop China from running the table on that, and will they confront --BARTIROMO: Right --KEANE: China over Taiwan? These are the two I think major issues we're going to see very early on if the Biden administration is not only going to cooperate with China, but are they willing to confront China with our of allies? When they talk to our allies in the region, Maria, they're going to find out that our allies were rattled a little bit as a result of the November 3rd election when President Trump --BARTIROMO: Yes --KEANE: Lost because he has shored up our allies against the Chinese Communist Party, and they have concerns whether the Biden administration will have the same backing to our allies in the region that the Trump administration had. That issue is the undercurrent going on right now.BARTIROMO: Yes, that's a really important point that you make, General. Right now, 30 countries have already banned Huawei because of the back doors and the data going back to the CCP. We'll see. We'll see, you know, that's on the United States' lead, right? So the U.S. is in the lead and others follow and work with us on that. General, we'll keep following it and we'll keep talking with you about it for sure. General Jack Keane, thank you sir, we will see you soon.KEANE: Yes, great talking to you, Maria --BARTIROMO: Quick break and then we've got the word on Wall Street -- you too, Jack, thank you. Coming up, we've got the word on Wall Street coming up. Top investors looking ahead to Janet Yellen's Capitol Hill testimony, and then we're talking bitcoin. Where does it go this year after a massive rally last year? Then we are watching earnings all morning long, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs coming out this morning. We will bring you those numbers, the stocks are up going into the quarterly report. You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Big bank earnings this week, Bank of America hitting the tape just in a couple of moments or so along with Goldman Sachs later this morning, and Morgan Stanley later on in the week. This will give us a really good window into what went on in the quarter, Bank of America looking like it is a miss on revenue. Let's break it all down with CFRA Director of Equity Research Ken Leon. And Ken, the numbers are just coming out, it looks like the earnings are a beat but the revenue is a miss. One of the issues here are margins because of the rock-bottom interest rates that we've seen throughout 2020. Let's get the actual numbers, Ken, and then I want to get your reaction. We know that it's a miss on revenue. Cheryl Casone with the specifics. Go ahead, Cheryl.CASONE: It is, yes. And to your point, Maria, these numbers are just crossing. On the revenue side, the estimate was 20.68 billion for revenue, they came in at 20.1 billion, so that's a slight miss there. As far as the earnings per share, that was a beat, they came in at 59 cents, the estimate was for 55 cents. Also as far as that stock repurchase, that buy-back that you talked about 30 minutes ago, we're finding out that's $2.9 billion, and then there's an additional $300 million on top of that. Remember, the Fed back in December, Maria, said that the banks -- that they deem them healthy enough during the coronavirus pandemic to start the buy-backs. Also, they're talking about provisions for credit losses, that's coming in $53 million, again, that is to protect themselves against credit losses.But that is a decrease from the last time that they reported that number. Also, we're looking for any provisions when it comes to equities and obviously fixed income trading. I don't have those numbers yet. But again, that is a -- again, it's a beat on EPS, but it's a slight miss on revenue, and they've got a reserve release. I'm sending it back to you, Maria, the reserve release right here, $828 million, that's a reserve release. And we've seen nearly the banks do this, Maria, where now that they're feeling more comfortable in this economic environment, they're starting to draw back down on those reserves that they of course had bulked up in 2020 during the pandemic. Stock is up 1.5 percent. Back to you.BARTIROMO: All right, thanks so much, Cheryl. And yet -- on that reserve release, they had gotten the go-ahead from the Federal Reserve. Ken Leon is the director of Equity Research at CFRA. Ken, good to see you this morning, I want to get your take on the earnings period overall. But first, your reaction to the B of A numbers this morning, and what that tells us about where we are in terms of the banking sector.KEN LEON, DIRECTOR, OF EQUITY RESEARCH, CFRA: Oh, it's great to be here, Maria. And it tells us that the dark side of 2020 is behind us, the reserve loan release means that they over-reserved for calamities of write-offs for especially the consumer. We'll still see in distress industries. So, the focus is really on 2021, outlook for recovery. And the revenue miss is probably coming from the consumer where we saw not only lower loan activity, but also loan balances including cards, credit cards. What that means is the velocity from the consumer, which is so important for Bank of America, still has room to grow on the upside or rebound.Capital markets probably is going to be just like the other three banks last week, very strong, firing on all cylinders, and Cheryl's comment about return of capital, the Fed still needs to release Bank of America and others from still a moderately restricted period, so they can raise the dividend and aggressively buy back shares. Bank stocks have done well. The context for investors, they're up over 50 percent since September. The December 18th Fed move was positive. When we look ahead to this year, is, will this U.S. economy recover at a pace that the consumer plays in? And I think a narrative that might change, Maria, is that the consumer might be saving more. We're seeing that in Fed data, staying in their homes, maybe improving them. But you know, credit card activity is driven by business and leisure, travel and restaurants. Maybe that's the narrative for the second half of this year.BARTIROMO: And what about the broader economy, Ken? What have you gotten in terms of your expectations on the fourth quarter earnings elsewhere? I mean, it just started with the banks, I know that. But your expectations for the year in terms of earnings growth, Ken?LEON: You know, it's going to be positive, maybe 4 percent or 5 percent in the first quarter. We're seeing that the cyclical sectors like industrials and materials and even energy are beginning to turn around. Energy and real estate probably second or third quarter. But financials are playing right into that cyclical play which is why we favor them right now versus growth sectors such as technology.BARTIROMO: All right, Ken, we'll leave it there. Great to see you this morning, thanks so much.LEON: Take care.BARTIROMO: Ken Leon joining us there on earnings. We'll be right back, stay with us. We've got a market up almost 200 points right here, we'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. It is time for the Morning Buzz. Garth Brooks sings about friends in low places, but he has some in very high places too. The country music superstar performing at Joe Biden's inauguration Wednesday, joking he'll be the only Republican there, noting his presence there is about bringing people together, not politics. He joins an all-star lineup which includes Lady Gaga and fan of our show, Jennifer Lopez. Dagen, it looks like the celebrities are coming out for tomorrow's big event. I have to say, I really like the idea that they released a playlist of the songs. I thought that was a great idea actually.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS: Yes, I love Garth --BARTIROMO: Anybody who loves music --MCDOWELL: Yes, I love Garth Brooks -- that he might be the only Republican at the inauguration, I just hope -- equally talented, Trisha Yearwood is there. So, fingers crossed on that. Maybe not, but a girl can dream.BARTIROMO: Yes, well, hopefully. Next up, if somebody's acting a lot like you, they could be lying. A new study reveals that people who are not telling the truth become copycats. The findings published in the "Royal Society's Open Science Journal" finds that people who aren't being truthful tend to mimic the body language of the person that they're talking to and that they're lying to. Mark, this is an interesting tell.MARK MATSON, PRESIDENT & CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, MATSON MONEY: Well, it's important for investors to understand because some estimates show that up to one in 20 people are actually sociopaths, and Maria, it might be more than that on Wall Street. So I would -- you know, Reagan said trust then verify. I think it should be the other way around, verify then trust. And when you verify, you want audited financial statements from -- returns would stand for global investment protective performance standards. And then -- that a manager can't manipulate like Madoff did. Look, investors, there are con people out there, con men, con women, and when someone shows you who they really are, you've got to believe them because your own American dream could be at risk.BARTIROMO: Hey, that was Maya Angelou's famous quotes, one of my favs. All right, look, this is way too much work, I just want truth and honesty, gosh. Still ahead, the word on Wall Street, top investors discussing Janet Yellen's plan to avoid recession. She's going to testify this morning, we're going to preview it. And then we're looking at bitcoin, where does it go this year after a swashbuckling move last year. It all starts next hour, MORNINGS WITH MARIA is live on Fox Business.Load-Date: January 19, 2021End of Document

Xiaomi Sues The Us Government For Including It On A BlacklistStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeFebruary 2, 2021 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2021 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: HI TECH; Pg. 1Length: 375 wordsByline: Sandy MccarthyBodyIn a report, Xiaomi claimed that a substantial number of its shareholders are U.S citizens and that if the restriction stayed in place, it would only cause further harm to the company and its stock prices and stop Mi from expanding to its full potential.Xiaomi was added to the list of companies with ties to China's military in January."Moreover, the public association ofXiaomi with the Chinese military will significantly impair the company's standing with business partners and consumers, causing reputational harms that can not be readily quantified or easily repaired".This is different from putting into Entity List, which would ban the companies from using United States proprietary technology.

Congressional Research Service Report: 'Huawei & U.S. Law' (Part 2 of 2)Targeted News ServiceFebruary 25, 2021 Thursday 3:47 PM  ESTCopyright 2021 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2977 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Congressional Research Service issued the following report (No. R46693) on Feb. 23, 2021, entitled "Huawei and U.S. Law":Secure Networks ActOverviewWith the Secure Networks Act (Pub. L. No. 116-124), signed into law in March 2020, Congress acted to provide additional statutory grounds and direction for the FCC's current efforts to limit Huawei's presence in the U.S. communications network./227Much like the 2019 Order, the Secure Networks Act prohibits companies from using FCC administered subsidies to obtain or maintain communications equipment or services that pose national security risks to U.S. communications networks./228The Act directs the FCC to publish a list of the equipment and services subject to this limitation (the Covered List)./229Equipment or services must meet two conditions for it to be added to the Covered List. First, either (1) certain agencies have made a "specific determination" that the particular equipment or services are a national security risk/230 or (2) the equipment or services are covered by section 889(f)(3) of the 2019 NDAA (i.e., be equipment or services provided by Huawei and ZTE)./231Second, the equipment or services must be "capable of" (1) "routing or redirecting user data traffic or permitting visibility into any user data or packets that such equipment or service transmits or otherwise handles," (2) "causing the network of a provider of advanced communications service to be disrupted remotely," or (3) "otherwise posing an unacceptable risk to the national security of the United States or the security and safety of United States persons." /232Furthermore, similar to the 2019 FNPRM, the law directs the FCC to implement a so-called "rip-and-replace" reimbursement program./233Under this program, small/234 communications providers would be reimbursed for the cost of removing and replacing equipment on the Covered List./235To participate in the program, applicants would have to provide an "initial reimbursement cost estimate" and supporting materials./236While participation in the program is voluntary, providers who chose to participate in the program must complete the "permanent removal, replacement, and disposal" of covered equipment or services within one year of receiving the funds, unless the FCC grants an extension./237While the law does not expressly appropriate any funds for the program, it appears to assume an initial reimbursement budget of $1 billion, as it directs the FCC to notify Congress if it determines during implementation of the reimbursement program that $1 billion "will not be sufficient to fully fund all approved applications for reimbursements" under the program./238The law requires the FCC to begin rulemaking within 90 days after its enactment to implement the reimbursement program./239Lastly, the Act includes a reporting requirement, directing "each provider of an advanced communications service" to submit an annual report to the Commission detailing whether they have "purchased, rented, leased or otherwise obtained any covered communications equipment."/240Providers must further include a "detailed justification" for their use of the equipment and state whether they have removed or replaced the equipment or plan to do so./241FCC Implementation and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021The FCC has taken several steps to integrate the Secure Networks Act into its ongoing actions.On July 17, 2020, the FCC released a declaratory ruling finding that, by adopting the 2019 USF Order, it had already "substantially implemented" the Secure Networks Act's subsidy limitations./242Furthermore, on December 11, 2020, the FCC issued a final order (2020 Order) implementing the Act's remaining provisions./243Namely, the 2020 Order implements the Secure Networks Act by (1) establishing the reimbursement program to subsidize small communications providers that rip-and-replace equipment on the Covered List; (2) establishing procedures and criteria for creating and maintaining the Covered List; and (3) adopting reporting requirements for carriers to inform the FCC about the ongoing presence of equipment on the Covered List in communications networks./244The 2020 Order also goes beyond the Secure Networks Act by requiring any ETCs receiving USF funds, as well as participants in the reimbursement program, to rip-and-replace covered equipment from their networks./245While the 2020 Order made ETC's rip-and-replace obligation contingent on a "Congressional appropriation to fund the Reimbursement Program,"/246 the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, appropriates $1.9 billion to "carry out" the Secure Networks Act, with $1.895 billion of that amount going towards the reimbursement program./247The Appropriations Act also includes several amendments to the Secure Networks Act's provisions on the reimbursement program. For instance, it broadens the entities eligible for funding, allows reimbursement for the removal of equipment covered by the 2019 Order and Designation Orders (which cover any Huawei and ZTE equipment, rather than simply Huawei and ZTE equipment on the Covered List), and establishes a prioritization paradigm that favors small providers and non-commercial educational institutions in the allocation of reimbursement funds./248On February 17, 2021, the Commission adopted a notice of proposed rulemaking that seeks comment on proposals to implement these changes./249United States' Criminal ProsecutionsThe United States has brought several criminal charges involving Huawei./250In the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, a grand jury indicted two Huawei affiliates/251 on charges arising from the alleged theft of trade secrets from T-Mobile USA (TMobile) and obstruction of justice when T-Mobile threatened to file a lawsuit./252In the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, the United States is pursuing a criminal indictment against Huawei, two corporate affiliates,/253 and Meng Wanzhou--Huawei's CFO and the daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei./254The New York prosecution arises out of alleged misappropriation of intellectual property and an alleged scheme to avoid U.S. sanctions on Iran and North Korea./255Huawei denies the charges in both prosecutions./256Huawei also has filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) suit against the United States in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia seeking documents relating to the investigation and prosecution of Huawei and Meng, U.S.-China trade relations, and 5G competition. /257In December 2018, Canadian authorities arrested Meng pursuant to a U.S. extradition request arising out of the New York prosecution./258Later that month, Chinese authorities arrested two Canadian citizens in China on espionage charges, in what some observers interpret as retaliation for Meng's arrest./259Meng is challenging the extradition request in the Canadian legal system./260The two Canadian citizens remain in Chinese custody./261Some Members of the 116th Congress introduced measures that would have commended Canada for apprehending Meng and expressed concern over China's detention of Canadian citizens./262The United States has also pursued charges against at least one Chinese national, Bo Mao, for conspiring with an unnamed company, which media outlets reported to be Huawei, to steal intellectual property (IP) from a U.S. company./263Mao, a Chinese professor working at a Texas university, pled guilty as part of plea agreement to one count of making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation during its investigation into the alleged IP theft./264Mao was sentenced to time served with three years supervised release and has been permitted to return to China./265Visa RestrictionsIn July 2020, the United States stated it would use existing provisions in U.S. immigration law to restrict the ability of Huawei and other Chinese telecommunication company employees to obtain U.S. visas./266Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, an alien is inadmissible to the United States if the Secretary of State has reasonable grounds to believe the alien's entry "would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States . . . ."/267Secretary of State Pompeo announced that the United States was imposing visa restrictions on "employees of Chinese technology companies that provide material support to regimes engaging in human rights abuses globally."/268Secretary Pompeo described Huawei as an "arm of the [Chinese Communist Party's] surveillance state that censors political dissidents and enables mass internment camps . . . ."/269 Huawei denies that it participates in human rights violations./270Diplomacy and Foreign AidSome in Congress have expressed interest in whether U.S. allies abroad permit Huawei products in their communications networks./271Executive branch officials in the Trump Administration encouraged foreign countries not to use Huawei equipment in their 5G networks,/272 with some success./273For example, after announcing that it would permit Huawei products in noncritical elements of its 5G networks,/274 the United Kingdom changed course in July 2020 and announced that it would bar domestic telecommunications operators from using Huawei equipment when building the country's 5G networks./275The Trump Administration launched or engaged in other multilateral efforts to promote construction and use of global 5G networks that do not use Huawei systems./276Some observers contend that Huawei's access to Chinese financial state support has allowed Huawei to sell its products and services at discounted prices worldwide./277Media outlets have reported that the Trump Administration considered using foreign aid and development programs to help wireless carriers in foreign countries buy equipment from Huawei's major non-Chinese rivals--Sweden's Ericsson AB, Finland's Nokia Corp., and South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co./278Some Members of the 116th Congress introduced bills that would have prohibited the United States from sharing intelligence with any country that uses Huawei technology in its 5G networks./279Other Members proposed resolutions encouraging U.S. allies not to use Huawei systems and equipment in their infrastructure./280National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (FY2021 NDAA)The most recently passed Huawei-related legislation came in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (FY2021 NDAA), passed over President's Trump's veto in December 2020./281Section 1058Section 1058 of the FY2021 NDAA limits the Secretary of Defense's ability to locate a major weapons systems or permanently assign forces in a country with "at risk" 5G or sixth generation (6G) wireless network equipment, software, or services if U.S. military personnel and their families will be directly connected to the "at risk" networks./282Executive branch officials previously have voiced concern about Huawei equipment installed near U.S. military bases./283Prior to making a base or forces assignment that falls within Section 1058's parameters, the Secretary of Defense must consider risks in the host country posed by "at-risk vendors," which is defined to include Huawei and ZTE./284Section 9202Some officials in the Trump Administration and Members of the 116th Congress expressed the desire to encourage development of information and communications companies in the United States or allied nations that can better compete with and serve as alternatives to Huawei./285U.S. companies do not manufacture certain key elements of the infrastructure necessary for 5G telecommunications systems./286At the same time, some observers believe Chinese state support of Huawei and other communications companies have helped those companies develop their products, gain market share, and reinvest profits in research and development./287In response to this dynamic, the 116th Congress included provisions in the FY2021 NDAA that authorize funds to support 5G research and promote telecommunications equipment providers that can act as alternatives to Huawei in the United States and abroad./288Section 9202 of the FY2021 NDAA establishes a Public Wireless Supply Chain Innovation Fund (Innovation Fund), which can make grants of up to $50 million to support, among other things, the promotion and deployment of certain communications network technology, including 5G technology and equipment./289The Administrator of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) is to administer the Innovation Fund with the advice of an interagency advisory board./290Section 9202 also creates a Multilateral Telecommunications Security Fund (Multilateral Telecom Fund) to be administered by the Secretary of State, in consultation with an interagency group./291The provision authorizes the Secretary of State to create a common funding mechanism with the United States' foreign partners to "support the development and adoption of secure and trusted telecommunications technologies."/292It also calls for the Secretary of State "to secure commitments and contributions from trusted foreign partners such as the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan" while pursuing three objectives:(i) Advancing research and development of secure and trusted communications technologies;(ii) Strengthening supply chains; and(iii) Promoting the use of trusted vendors./293Finally, Section 9202 requires the executive branch to consider how to enhance U.S. representation at international 5G standards-setting bodies, such as the International Telecommunication Union (ITU)./294Some observers believe that the Chinese government exerts influence over international bodies that set 5G technical standards to benefit Huawei and other domestic Chinese firms./295Some Members of the 116th Congress and officials in the Trump Administration described American leadership in these standards-setting bodies as important for advancing U.S. national security, foreign policy, and economic interests./296Title XCIX: Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) for AmericaTitle XCIX of the FY2021 NDAA, titled Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors for America Act (commonly referred to as the CHIPS for America Act),/297 requires the Secretary of Commerce to establish a program to provide financial assistance to incentivize investment in the U.S. semiconductor manufacturing industry./298Grants are not to exceed $3 billion per project unless the President certifies to Congress that a larger investment is necessary to "significantly increase . . . reliable domestic supply of semiconductors relevant for national security and economic competitiveness[,]" and to meet national security needs./299Title XCIX also requires, among other things: (1) establishment of public-private partnerships to incentivize domestic microchip production;/300 (2) a study of the U.S. industrial base to support microelectronic production;/301 (3) the creation of a Multilateral Semiconductors Security Fund;/302 and (4) funding for microelectronic research and development in federal agencies./303While these provisions do not target Huawei or its products directly, some observers view federal support for the microchip industry as part of a broader effort to ensure U.S. companies maintain a foothold in technology supply chains that are essential for products made by Huawei and other foreign technology companies./304ConclusionThe federal government's legal actions involving Huawei have evolved from straightforward spending restrictions to a multifaceted effort to ban the company from telecommunications networks in the United States and internationally. What began as appropriations restrictions in 2013 evolved in the FY2018 NDAA into a procurement ban in DOD's sensitive nuclear and national defense missions./305That narrow procurement ban expanded in the FY2019 NDAA to an executive branch-wide ban on procuring from any company that uses Huawei products and services./306In 2019, legal actions transitioned from the procurement context to the realm of international trade as the executive branch added Huawei to the Entity List and invoked the President's IEEPA authority./307In 2019 and 2020, the FCC took steps to limit Huawei's presence in U.S. telecommunications networks, and Congress provided additional direction for these efforts with the Secure Networks Act, enacted in early 2020./308As the Trump Administration pursued diplomatic efforts to convince allied countries to ban Huawei from their 5G networks in 2020, the 116th Congress passed the FY2021 NDAA, which contemplates using federal funds to support private competitors to Huawei domestically and abroad./309Some observers view the increasing complexity of the legal actions involving Huawei as a microcosm of the broader challenges presented by China's rise on the global stage./310At the same time, U.S. officials have sought to account for potential negative impacts of these escalating actions by, for example, calibrating U.S. export regulations to allow American companies to work with Huawei when identifying cybersecurity vulnerabilities or working in international standards-setting organizations./311The United States also has shown willingness to take increasingly strict actions--such as narrowing the foreign direct product rule for Huawei and its affiliates or instituting a "rip and replace" program--when this is deemed necessary for national security and American interests./312Given the competing considerations in Huawei policy, a balancing of interests may continue in the 117th Congress and in the Biden Administration.* * *View report and footnotes at https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46693[Category: CRSCRS]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7396817 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: February 25, 2021End of Document

LANKFORD, KAINE DEFEND OPEN INTERNET IN HONG KONGStates News ServiceMarch 18, 2021 ThursdayCopyright 2021 States News ServiceLength: 456 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, D.C. BodyThe following information was released by Oklahoma Senator James Lankford:Senators James Lankford (R-OK) and Tim Kaine (D-VA) today introduced the Safeguarding Internet Freedom in Hong Kong Act. Since July 2020, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has implemented a "national security law" that violates the basic freedoms of Hong Kongers including the freedom to peacefully assemble and the right to freely access and share information online. The bill supports firewall circumvention infrastructure in Hong Kong to strengthen the ability of the people to share information online."China has continuously shown they have no regard for the autonomy of Hong Kong or the basic rights of its people," said Lankford. "Based on Beijing's track record, I am concerned that the internet suppression the CCP uses in mainland China will soon become a reality in Hong Kong if the United States does not act. Pro-democracy advocates speaking out against Beijing's oppression should not be censored or limited in their ability to openly communicate on the internet. Investing in firewall circumvention technology protects and safeguards the basic freedoms Hongkongers have long been guaranteed while affirming the US' commitment to proudly stand with the people of Hong Kong.""Since we first introduced this bill in July 2020, China's oppression of Hong Kong has only gotten worse. Chinese telecom service providers have blocked a pro-democracy website. Chinese authorities are arresting civil society activists and taking steps to ban anti-Beijing candidates from running for office. Those developments make opposing censorship and supporting civil society in Hong Kong through this bill and other legislation more urgent than ever," said Kaine.The bill establishes an interagency working group of officials from the Department of State, the Open Technology Fund, and the US Agency for International Development to coordinate US efforts to develop and deploy firewall circumvention technology to Hong Kong. The federal government already invests in internet freedom programs in mainland China and other areas around the world with high degrees of online censorship, but ongoing events make clear that a new program is needed to address what is happening in Hong Kong.As a commissioner on the Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC), Lankford has worked to protect the rights of Hongkongers and hold the Chinese government accountable for its human rights abuses. Lankford supported the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which was signed into law by President Trump in 2019, and the Hong Kong Autonomy Act, which became law in 2020. Last month, Lankford joined a bipartisan group of senators to introduce the Hong Kong Safe Harbor Act.Load-Date: March 18, 2021End of Document

South Korea advanced.Overnight, Wall Street closed higher. Gains for tech stocks offset losses elsewhere.Optimism about the rollout of coronavirus vaccines was dented by a spike in infections in China, where the disease had been under control.

Google remembers in its Doodle the birth of the doctor Wu Lien-teh, the creator of the beardCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 10, 2021 WednesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 661 wordsBodyGoogle recalls on its cover the Chinese-Malay doctor and epidemiologist, Wu Lien-teh.The doctor was the creator, among other things, of a surgical facial protector that is considered the precursor of the N95 mask one of the most used during the coronavirus pandemic.Wu Lien-teh was born to a family of Chinese immigrants in Penang, present-day Malaysia, March 10, 1879. He died on January 21, 1960 at the age of 80.Wu would become the first student of Chinese descent to earn his Doctorate from Wu Lien-teh Cambridge University.After his doctoral studies, he accepted a position as deputy director of the Medical College of the Imperial Army of China in 1908. When an unknown epidemic hit northwest China in 1910, the government appointed Wu to conduct research on the characteristics of the disease.After a long series of studies, Wu identified it as the highly contagious pneumonic plague that spread from person to person by respiratory transmission. That's why to fight the disease, the doctor designed and manufactured a special surgical mask with cotton and gauze, adding several layers of fabric to filter out the inhalations.His great inventionWhen the Chinese plague erupted north Wu lien convinced his companions that the plague was transmitted through the air, so his companions began to cover his head with bandages, but while carrying the bodies of the deceased could not grasp both, there he came up with the brilliant idea that with two threads beside the mask , as an aggregate could be held. He was the best student of his career at the time and when the Chinese plague erupted north Wu lien 13 relatives died of him and that is why I start with this project so recognized to this day that it is the mask or cover.Wu tried to implement a harness system that would hold the mask and allow the bodies of the sick to be moved with some protection. It was an "unprecedented" measure to protect the most exposed workers and the general population.Thanks to the photographs disseminated in the press, the mask became part of the collective image of that plague and also of the way the clothing of doctors and health workers is projected in each epidemic or pandemic like the current one.Wu himself advised people to wear this mask type and worked with Chinese government officials to establish quarantine stations and hospitals; he also proposed limiting population displacement and restricting travel to prevent further contagion.In parallel with these measures for the population, he applied progressive sterilization techniques and thus grew his leadership in the field and contributed greatly to ending, on 11 April 1911, the pandemic known as the Plague of Manchuria. It was only four months after the Asian authorities commissioned him.In 1915, Wu founded the Chinese Medical Association, the largest and oldest non-governmental medical organization in the country. And several years later, in 1935, he was the first Malay - and the first person of Chinese descent - nominated for a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work to control pneumonic plague. A devout advocate and practitioner of medical advances, Wu's efforts changed not only public health in China, but that of everyone.N95. It was invented in 1992 by Taiwanese doctor, textile technology expert Peter Tsai. This mask or barbijo proved useful in curbing TB infections and then in 2003 to prevent the spread of the first epidemic of a deadly coronavirus: SARS. It is now key to protecting againstCOVID-19.TECHNOLOGY Newsletter with the most important analysis and news, every Wednesday.

Study reveals China's secret program (and particular conditions) of international loansCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 31, 2021 WednesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 688 wordsBodyChina is the world's largest creditor. However, basic data on the terms of your loans are totally unknown.In this context, the Kiel, Peterson Institute (PIIE) and the Center for Global Development, the first German and the other two Americans, today presented the report "How China Lends," where they reveal previously unknown Beijing practices."Contracts use creative design to manage credit risks and overcome execution hurdles, presenting China as a strong, commercially knowledged lender for the developing world," reads in today's report.For espionage: China restricts the use of Tesla cars to military and government personnelH&M criticized in China for its stance on forced labour in XinjiangChina approves radical reform of Hong Kong electoral systemThe study is based on the revision of 100 contracts between Chinese state entities and governments in 24 developing countries, several of which are involved in the Strip and Route Initiative and which together address committed amounts totaling US$36.6 billion.With AidData's participation in William & Mary, a comparative data analysis was developed with contracts from other multilateral, bilateral or private lenders, identifying three problem areas.Clauses under the magnifying glassTo begin with, the report states that Chinese contracts contain "unusually broad" confidentiality clauses, which prohibit borrowers from disclosing the terms and sometimes even the existence of the debt itself. Indeed, the researchers note that China's contracts have become more secret over time, with a confidentiality clause in each of the pacts entered into since 2014.Second, they note that the agreements signed "contain provisions that position Chinese state banks as major creditors, whose loans must be repaid as a priority".In the same line, they ensure that nearly one third of the contracts studied required borrowing countries to maintain significant cash balances in bank or collateral accounts. "These informal collateral agreements put Chinese lenders at the forefront of the pay line, as banks can simply take over their borrowers' accounts to collect unpaid debts," they say.From the above, Chinese lenders would also seek to ensure that the debt in question is left out of any collective restructuring. "Most Chinese loan contracts contain 'No Paris Club' clauses, which prohibit countries from restructuring Chinese loans on an equal footing and in coordination with other creditors," says Sebastian Horn, an economist at the Kiel Institute of World Economics.Finally, they argue that through the cancellation, acceleration and stabilization clauses of Chinese contracts, "lenders are allowed to potentially influence debtors' domestic and external policies."Specifically, the pacts give broad freedom to cancel loans or speed up repayment if you disagree with the borrower's policies. "For example, the Development Bank of China (CBD) treats termination of diplomatic relations with China as a 'case of non-compliance'," the report states, adding that "expansive cross-default and cross-cancellation provisions also give Chinese lenders more influence over borrowers and other creditors than previously thought."Complexities in the current scenarioBased on all of the above, the researchers argue that even if these terms established by the Chinese could not be enforced in court, "the combination of confidentiality, seniority and political influence could limit the sovereign debtor's crisis management options and complicate debt renegotiation."In this way, the terms put forward by the Chinese are particularly uncomfortable in the current context, according to Christoph Trebesch of Kiel. "China's practices complicate debt relief efforts in countries in financial difficulty due to the COVID-19 pandemic or other factors," he says.In this context, Scott Morris, principal investigator at the Center for Global Development, states that "China has adopted a cooperative tone on debt issues in the G20, but some of the provisions of these contracts clearly disagree with the objectives of the Common Framework on Debt that G20 ministers agreed six months ago."Load-Date: April 1, 2021End of Document

Jack Ma, Alibaba Under Pressure to Sell Media HoldingsThe Deal PipelineMarch 16, 2021 TuesdayCopyright 2021 The Deal, L.L.C. All Rights ReservedLength: 479 wordsByline: by Jonathan BraudeBodyThe Chinese government has asked Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd. (BABA) to dispose of media assets, including Hong Kong's English-language South China Morning Post newspaper and the micro-blogging site Weibo Corp., as officials grow increasingly concerned of the tech company's influence over public opinion.Reports in the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg on Monday, March 15, said Beijing was unhappy with the extent of Alibaba's media interests and had asked the company to "curtail" its holdings, without specifying which assets should be unloaded. Nevertheless, the SCMP could be a target. Bloomberg reported Monday that discussions about selling the newspaper began in 2020 and that while no specific buyer had been identified it was expected to be a Chinese entity.The newspaper has a devoted readership among the local and expatriate business communities, which rely on it for reasonably even-handed coverage, especially over the past year since the government has set out to tame public broadcaster Radio Television Hong Kong. Since Alibaba bought it in 2016, the SCMP has continued to carry stories that were at times unfavorable to Chinese policies and the Hong Kong government. It has allowed some critical coverage of China's imposition of new security laws and its crackdown on dissent in Hong Kong.Ma has previously insisted that he never interfered in newsroom operations.The WSJ said concerns have been growing in recent years over how Alibaba may have leveraged its investments in news and social media to reshape government policies deemed unfavorable to its businesses.It said the concerns had increased following an incident in May last year when posts on the Twitter-like Weibo site about a senior Alibaba executive's alleged involvement in an extramarital affair were deleted.The WSJ report also lists some of Alibaba's assets. These include 100% ownership of the SCMP; about 30% of Weibo, worth more than $3.5 billion; a 6.7% share worth nearly $2.6 billion in Bilibili, a popular video platform; nearly 37% of influential news outlet Yicai Media Group.The government clearly does have concerns about Ma's use of publicity to further his business interests, having begun to push back in earnest after his speech in October in which he criticized China's state-owned banks and financial regulators   and promptly disappeared from public view for months. Ma remains to keep a very low profile.The central government's subsequent decision to block the planned IPO of Alibaba affiliate Ant Group and pursue the tech companies with antitrust legislation are part of a campaign to ensure tech companies play by Beijing's rules.But it may also be responding to what it sees as a more general challenge by powerful tycoons to its monopoly on information - a response that would likely make the sale of the SCMP one of its most urgent targets.DEAL SIZEUndisclosedLoad-Date: March 22, 2021End of Document

Rep. Joyce Submits Op-Ed to Harrisburg Patriot-NewsTargeted News ServiceMarch 24, 2021 Wednesday 8:00 AM  ESTCopyright 2021 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 871 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyRep. John Joyce, R-Pennsylvania, issued the following op-ed to the Harrisburg Patriot-News on March 23, 2021:* * *In the Harrisburg Patriot-News, Congressman John Joyce, M.D. (PA-13) wrote about overcoming partisan divides to find common ground on creating American jobs for American workers. During a recent meeting with President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and bipartisan congressional leaders, Dr. Joyce addressed the growing threats posed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to America's economy and national security.Dr. Joyce continues to advocate to bring the manufacturing of items, from vital technology and defense weapon systems to essential medicines, back home to America - and far away from the CCP. As he told President Biden during their Oval Office meeting, Pennsylvania workers depend on secure and resilient supply chains.* * *I'm a Trump Republican. Here's why I went to Joe Biden's White HouseSome people were surprised when President Joe Biden invited me to the Oval Office for a meeting - although I was not. From the campaign trail to the halls of Congress, the president and I have been vocal about our conflicting ideological convictions. We share little in common, least of all our voting records. But, when it comes to creating jobs for our fellow Pennsylvanians, we are on the same team.For too long, hardworking Pennsylvanians watched American companies - and their jobs - flee our commonwealth for China. Our manufacturing industry bore the cost of mounting regulations - and families paid the price. This devastating cycle spurred widespread ramifications in local communities and across the country.To correct course, the United States must prioritize pragmatic solutions to end the Chinese Communist Party's grip on manufacturing and return family-sustaining jobs back home. It's no small feat. Right now, the Chinese government controls many of the materials used in the production of vital items - from pharmaceuticals and medical devices to technology and defense weapon systems.As I discussed with President Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and a small group of bipartisan congressional leaders, resilient and secure supply chains are the key to Pennsylvania's success in the 21st century.In many cases, this big problem comes down to a tiny chip. As technology continues to advance, semiconductors are an increasingly integral piece of our manufacturing capacity. Chips are a central component in everything from cellphones and laptops to autonomous vehicles. The pandemic-era shift to working from home and subsequent technology demand have incited a global semiconductor shortage that is likely to create major economic consequences for consumers and workers alike.Despite Americans' reliance on chips, nearly 90 percent of the world's semiconductors are produced outside of the United States. To secure our supply chains and ensure that they can withstand global interruptions, we must restore semiconductor manufacturing back to America and to our allies. As one achievable solution, I supported bipartisan, bicameral legislation to incentivize chip manufacturing on American soil, creating jobs and strengthening our national security.Another step is prioritizing the mining of rare earth metals that are used to produce semiconductors in mineral-rich Pennsylvania and similar regions. China currently dominates this crucial industry and monopolizes the supply chain. The previous administration began groundbreaking work to source rare earth metals from coal and coal ash, valuable products of our commonwealth's energy legacy. To end our dependence on the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), the United States must continue to invest in innovation that will equip our nation's capacity to capture and process these minerals domestically.Securing our supply chains not only will safeguard our economy, but also will protect our public health. In addition to the vulnerability of relying on medical devices made in China, the pandemic has revealed the urgent need to ensure that America can produce an essential supply of medicines. As I told President Biden, the American people can no longer be beholden to the CCP for generic antibiotics and other widely used pharmaceuticals. Now more than ever, we must act.Last year on the China Task Force, I helped to develop more than 400 bipartisan and achievable solutions to counter the CCP and equip Americans to lead in global innovation. Now, it's time to put to our playbook to use.While the CCP has been exerting undue influence for decades, the COVID-19 pandemic exposed this hostile regime's growing threat to the American people, our national security, and our way of life. The clock is ticking.Like many Pennsylvanians, I recognize that the daunting path ahead requires teamwork. I stepped into President Biden's office with a plan to overcome barriers and to create jobs at home in Pennsylvania.Though America is divided - east and west, rural and urban, red and blue - we are one nation. Together, as a united front, we must take the steps today to equip Americans to lead the innovation of tomorrow. Despite our differences, we're playing on the same team.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7429811 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: March 24, 2021End of Document

A tweet that quoted a study reported by the state-run china daily.Twitter justified this lawsuit to CNBC by citing its anti-dehumanization policy: "We prohibit the dehumanization of a group of people based on their religion, caste, age, disability, serious illness, nationality, race, or ethnicity."            Read Also Merkel condemns Twitter: Decision to block Trump is 'problematic'                The Uighurs are an ethnic Muslim minority living in western China and who have been repressed by the government for years, according to the United Nations, the United States and the United Kingdom. China has always denied any mistreatment of the Uighurs, notably on Wednesday when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo characterized the Chinese government's actions in the face of this ethnic group as "genocide."This blocking of Twitter came after the same social network suspended the account of former U.S. President Donald Trump earlier this month.

The Shenzhen Component Index shed 0.3%, or 38.43 points, at 15,031.70.Sentiment in Shenzhen remained weak after the White House added Xiaomi (HKG:1810), China National Offshore Oil or CNOOC (HKG:0883) and Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China or COMAC to a trade blacklist, banning investments from American entities and ordering their existing US investors to divest their shares.Tensions between Washington and Beijing further escalated after a US commission said in an annual report that the Chinese government is possibly carrying out genocide in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.Meanwhile, sentiment in Shanghai slightly improved after China reported a 3.9% year-over-year growth in the prices of newly-built commercial houses in the country's four first-tier cities in December 2020.In corporate news, Semiconductor Manufacturing International or SMIC (SHA:688981, HKG:0981) fell 4% in Shanghai after Caixin Global reported that there is a looming shortage of semiconductors, which threatens the production of vehicles in China. Shanghai-listed shares of Great Wall Motor (SHA:601633, HKG:2333), one of China's top carmakers, also fell 2.9% following the report.Load-Date: January 15, 2021End of Document

The Fifth Sino-U.S. Cultural Industry Summit Was Successfully Held in Macau; The Second Panel: The Future of China-U.S. Co-production Films under the Current Trade WarBusiness WireJanuary 8, 2021 Friday 2:35 AM GMTCopyright 2021 Business Wire, Inc.Length: 492 wordsDateline: MACAU, China BodyOn December 28, 2020, the fifth Sino-U.S. Cultural Industry Summit was successfully held at MGM Cotai, Macau, China. Chinese and American film producers, directors and scholars discussed the Future of the Sino-U.S. Film Industry under this Pandemic. This event was hosted by GTMG and Aollywood Producers Association, and co-organized by Lotus TV, Macau Daily and MGM. There were three panels: "The Future of the Global Film Industry under this Pandemic," "The Future of China-U.S. Co-production Films under the Current Trade War" and " What kind of role does Chinese film play in the global film industry after the Pandemic?"This press release features multimedia.

(Photo: Business Wire)In the second panel, Bill Mechanic, the Producer of?Hacksaw Ridge? believes that the influence of streaming media on traditional movies may be a bit over-exaggerated. "In fact, it is difficult to increase revenue by relying on streaming movie playback alone. It can be seen that in the traditional film industry, the box office plays an important role, and some movies have reached a box office of 2.8 billion US dollars. Now streaming media does have advantages over traditional film, but it may also be restricted by marketing budgets, both of which have pros and cons. I don't think traditional cinema chains will disappear completely."Michael Berry, the Professor & Director of the Center for Chinese Studies, UCLA, believes that "China is very good at controlling the pandemic, China can resume work soon, and theaters will also recover. In the short term, we can see that the development of Chinese film industry is healthy."Film scholar Zhou Tiedong believes that "After we recover from the pandemic, the global film market will face a surge in content. Therefore, content is king. Whether it is co-production or not, it depends on whether the filmmakers are well prepared to tell a good story."About the Sino-US Cultural Industry Summit:Founded in 2016, the Sino-U.S. Cultural Industry Summit is a non-profit organization that promotes culture, film, art, travel, trade, cuisine and investor relations between China and the U.S. It co-operates with relevant departments of the Chinese and U.S. governments, enterprises, and communities to engage in cultural and economic activities. The annual Sino-U.S. Cultural Industry Summit effectively builds a bridge to propel relations between Chinese and Americans.View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210108005593/en/CONTACT: GTMGPR & Marketing Manager: Sofia DingEmail: sofiading@gtmg1996.comhttp://www.businesswire.comGraphic The Second Panel: The Future of China-U.S. Co-production Films under the Current Trade War.

Biden would be faithful to the balance in mega trade agreementsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 21, 2021 ThursdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 532 wordsBodyThe new US President, Joe Biden, will be a key factor in competition between two mega free trade agreements: the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership Treaty (TIPAT) and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).TIPAT and RCEP compete to increase their economic and political weight in the world, the first with the possibility of joining the United States and the second with China as a member.In 2019, of total global trade in products, the RCEP covered 27%, while TIPAT (with only its 11 members, without the United States) had a 15% stake, according to World Bank data.According to some analysts, RCEP and TIPAT offer alternative views of the rules and rules by which trade and investment relations will be conducted in Asia and the Asia-Pacific region. In general, it is expected that its competence will define the replicable business model in the future.Japan expects the United States to rejoin the TPP-11 under President Biden and is reluctant to admit China to the bloc before this happens. But Biden, who supported the original trade deal during the Obama administration, focused heavily on national companies during his campaign. "There are 11 members in the TPP, and new countries cannot unite without their approval," Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said last December, according to Nikkei newspaper. "There is a big obstacle" for the new members, he added. "We'll think about it strategically as we respond."Also in late 2020, Japan's Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi stressed that the TPP-11 sets high standards for regulations on e-commerce, intellectual property and state-owned enterprises. "We need to make sure that any new members are prepared to meet these standards," he said.Complying with existing TPP-11 standards will test China's commitment to join the agreement. For example, the bloc prohibits special treatment for state-owned enterprises to ensure fair competition, partly a response to global excess steel and other products caused by aggressive capital investments by China's state-owned manufacturers. Some observers argue that the Chinese government seeks to promote regional economic integration in Asia that is beneficial to China and Chinese companies through the RCEP and other initiatives.According to an analysis by the US Congress, other observers claim that the Obama Administration, of which Biden was a part, similarly used the Trans-Pacific Partnership Treaty (TPP, essentially TIPAT, but signed by the United States, from which it later emerged) to establish a regional trading and investment environment that is beneficial to U.S. companies and strengthen America's leadership role in regional affairs.Some academics see RCEP and TIPAT as complementary creating a form of "competitive liberalization." Others, however, see the two as part of what some analysts call the "noodle dish" of trade agreements in the region. According to this view, RCEP and TIPAT would add more complexity for companies seeking to trade or invest in the Asia-Pacific region, as they seek to determine how best to conduct business given interrelated and sometimes overlapping trade agreements. roberto.morales@eleconomista.mx Load-Date: January 22, 2021End of Document| About LexisNexis | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions | Copyright © 2021 LexisNexis Page 26 of 334Brazil finally approves Huawei's participation in the 5G network  Page 28 of 334CLOSED-DOOR HEARING OF SECOND CANADIAN CHARGED WITH ESPIONAGE BEGINS IN CHINA  Page 30 of 334In China, a man will have to compensate his ex-wife for household chores  Page 32 of 334Us future trade secretary promises to be "aggressive" with China  Page 34 of 334CAIR Welcomes Twitter's Decision to Remove 'Horrific' Chinese 'Post Celebrating Uyghur Genocide  Page 36 of 334China In Context - The New Weekly Podcast From The SOAS China Institute  Page 38 of 334Xi Jinping endorses revamping China's legal system amid crackdown on Alibaba  Page  of China calls for Alibaba to sell its assets in the media sector  Page 41 of 334Elon Musk Assures China Tesla Isn't Using Its Cars to Spy  Page 43 of 334SEN.
