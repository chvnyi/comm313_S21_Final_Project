Human Rights Watch: Submission to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women on ChinaTargeted News ServiceFebruary 10, 2021 Wednesday 9:30 AM  ESTCopyright 2021 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 5500 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK BodyHuman Rights Watch issued the following news release:Two years after the #MeToo movement took off in China, Chinese women's rights activists face a political environment in which the Chinese Communist Party's control over the internet, media, and independent activism is tighter than the previous 30 years./1 Since the Chinese government prohibits collective actions, the country's #MeToo movement has not been able to manifest in mass street protests. But individuals who have suffered abuse have taken their cases to court, demonstrating extraordinary determination and resilience.In June 2018, Ren Liping, a student at China University of Petroleum, was detained for six days in a hotel room by university authorities after protesting the university and police's mishandling of her sexual abuse allegations against her ex-boyfriend./2In late 2019, authorities detained Huang Xueqin, a journalist and leading figure in China's #MeToo movement, for three months for unknown reasons. Upon release, Huang reportedly wrote: "This is Xueqin, and I'm back. ... One second of darkness doesn't make people blind."/3In March 2020, Inner Mongolian authorities forced Ye Haiyan--an activist advocating for the rights of sex workers and victims of sexual harassment--to demolish the yurts she and her partner had built as rentals for travelers, cutting off their main source of income./4Silenced in their home country, Chinese feminists have increasingly sought allies overseas./5 Utilizing the relatively free and safe space in Western countries, Chinese #MeToo activists outside China hold protests, discussions and trainings, and provide support to their counterparts inside China./6Human Rights Watch recommends the Committee ask the government of China:* For detailed explanations of the detentions of Ren Liping and Huang Xueqin, and the harassment of Ye Haiyan, including the legal basis for their treatment.* For a detailed breakdown of information regarding court cases since China's last CEDAW review on the basis of sexual harassment and/or discrimination.Human Rights Watch recommends the Committee call on the government of China to:* Cease all forms of harassment, intimidation, and arbitrary detention of women's rights activists.* Allow unfettered collaboration between peaceful activists inside and outside China.Violations of women and girls' sexual and reproductive rights (Articles 2, 3, 5, 12, 14 and 16)One-child and two-child policiesFrom 1979 to 2015, China imposed the "one-child policy." The policy violated women's reproductive rights. Its enforcement through measures like forced and coerced abortion and sterilization compounded the abuse.As noted by the Committee, the long-term consequences of the "one-child policy" continue to harm women and girls./7 The percentage of the population that are women in China has fallen steadily since 1987./8 The gender gap among the population aged 15 to 29 is increasing. Researchers estimate that there are 30 to 40 million "missing women" in China--women who should be alive but are not due to factors including a preference for boys that leads to sex-selective abortion, infanticide, abandonment of babies, and childcare neglect. These factors have been exacerbated by China's "one-child policy" and continuous restrictions on women's reproductive rights./9The Chinese government's 2015 announcement that it would allow all couples to have two children effectively ended the "one-child" policy./10 While a positive step, it did not change the fact that China's family-planning policies remain coercive and abusive. The state continues to play a deeply intrusive role in women's reproductive choices and bodily autonomy, controlling both how many children a couple can have and the intervals at which they can have them./11Officials have enforced birth quotas for couples by imposing hefty fines, euphemistically known as "social maintenance fees."/12 They also coerce parents by linking access to vital services, such as the household registration (hukou) of children, which is a prerequisite for access to public services such as education, to compliance with family planning policies./13The "two-child policy" has not provided any relief to the countless families suffering from penalties for past violations and were denied their right under international law to choose when and whether to have children, or the countless women who endured the pain and trauma of forced abortions.Violations of the sexual and reproductive rights of Uyghur women and girlsThirteen million Uyghur and other Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang are suffering harsh repression. The government's "Strike Hard Campaign against Violent Extremism" has entailed mass arbitrary detention, surveillance, indoctrination, and the destruction of the region's cultural and religious heritage./14There are disturbing reports that the Chinese government is imposing forced population control measures on Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities as part of this crackdown, while easing restrictions for the Han population./15 Women in Xinjiang have reported that the Chinese government carries out pregnancy checks, requires them to use intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUD), and forces sterilizations and abortions on them./16As in the rest of China, having too many children can lead to high fines. But unlike the rest of China, violating the state's birth control policies is also one reason Uyghur people are being sent to detention camps./17 There are disturbing reports of sexual violence against Turkic Muslim women in detention./18 Human Rights Watch has reported on the separation of Uyghur children from their families, and how parents often lose contact with their children after having been sent to detention camps./19Human Rights Watch recommends the Committee ask the government of China:* Why does the Chinese government continue to control the number of children that families can have, and the spacing of children?* Provide the most recent data on the implementation and outcomes of all reproductive policies across the country, both at the national, provincial, and regional levels.Human Rights Watch recommends the Committee call on the government of China to:* End all violations of reproductive rights, including all restrictions on the number and timing of births and all forced or coerced medical examinations or procedures.* Remove all policies that discriminate against children who were born out of compliance with government population control policies and their families.* Provide reparations to individuals and families harmed by policies that violate reproductive rights.Employment discrimination and workplace sexual harassment (Articles 1, 2, 3, 5, 11 and 13)Gender discrimination in hiringAlthough Chinese law prohibits gender discrimination in hiring, job discrimination remains widespread. Both the Chinese government and private Chinese companies use gender discriminatory job advertisements./20 In 2019, Human Rights Watch analyzed over 36,000 job ads between 2013 and 2018 on Chinese recruitment and company websites and social media platforms./21 Many ads specified a requirement or preference for men and some specified irrelevant physical requirements for women.Human Rights Watch found that in the Chinese government's 2020 National Civil Service Position List, 11 percent of the postings specified a preference or requirement for men. In 2018 and 2019,/22 the rate was 19 percent. In 2017, it was 13 percent./23 The decrease in the overall percentage of discriminatory postings in 2020 is partly because the most discriminatory ministries were hiring less people compared to the previous years, not because of a lower overall percentage of discriminatory ads./24Among the nearly 14,000 job postings in the 2020 National Civil Service Positions List,/25 Human Rights Watch found that 6 percent specified a preference for male applicants and 5 percent specified a requirement for male applicants. /26 The discriminatory job postings often stated, "frequent overtime work," "heavy workload," and "frequent travel" as reasons for excluding women.Discriminatory job advertisements violate Chinese law./27 However, anti-gender discrimination laws and regulations in China provide few specific enforcement mechanisms and are not effectively enforced. To address this, in February 2019, nine Chinese central government agencies, including the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security and the All-China Women's Federation, jointly outlined specific measures for implementing existing laws that prohibit gender discrimination in employment. One measure included banning job advertisements that specify a requirement or preference for a gender.Sexual objectification of women is also common in job advertising in China.28/ Many ads require women to have certain physical attributes--such as height, weight, voice, or facial appearance--that are irrelevant to job duties. Some job ads use women's physical attributes--often current employees-- - to attract male applicants./29 Besides unlawfully depriving women of job opportunities, these job ads reflect deeply discriminatory views about women: that they are less intellectually, physically, and psychologically capable than men, or that they are not fully committed to their jobs because some will eventually leave to start a family.After the announcement of the "two-child policy" in 2015, working women in China have increasingly faced pregnancy-related discrimination./30/Some women have filed lawsuits against employers who dismissed or demoted them or cut their pay after becoming pregnant./31Workplace Sexual HarassmentAmong the over 50 million publicly available court verdicts between 2010 to 2017, only 34 focused on sexual harassment according to a 2018 study by the Beijing Yuanzhong Gender Development Center./32 Among these cases, only two were brought by victims suing alleged harassers, though both were dismissed for lack of evidence. Most of the cases were brought by alleged harassers claiming breach of contract after employers dismissed them for sexual harassment, or defamation after accusations were made public by victims or employers.The tiny number of sexual harassment lawsuits does not indicate that harassment is not a problem in China. In a 2019 study, 71 percent of surveyed women said they had experienced sexual harassment in the workplace./33 The absence of court cases indicates the difficulties women face seeking legal redress for abuse.Human Rights Watch found numerous posts on Chinese social media platforms and online forums where anonymous female civil servants described their experiences of sexual harassment and sought advice on handling sexual harassment by male superiors./34In June 2020, the National People's Congress, China's rubberstamped parliament, introduced a civil code that, for the first time, defines sexual harassment and states that perpetrators can be held liable, though it is vague on what recourse is available to victims./35Human Rights Watch recommends the Committee ask the government of China:* Why are civil servant job ads still discriminating against applicants based on gender?* To provide all relevant information regarding state efforts to ensure that government agencies, private employers, and employment websites are not posting discriminatory ads.* What steps will they take to ensure that more women are able to seek legal redress for sexual abuse cases?* How will Chinese authorities ensure that the law on sexual harassment in the workplace is effective and applicable? Does China intend on ratifying the ILO Violence and Harassment Convention C190?Human Rights Watch recommends the Committee call on the government of China to:* End the use of gender discriminating job ads for civil servant positions.* Monitor advertising and ensure that an effective mechanism exists for receiving complaints regarding job ads that violate the law, and bring actions against companies violating the law.* Provide meaningful recourse, and legal assistance, for people facing gender discrimination and sexual harassment in the workplace.Bride trafficking (Articles 2, 5, 6, 9 and 16)China has a serious problem with women and girls from other countries being trafficked to China and sold as "brides." The country's gender imbalance has driven a "woman shortage" and an unmet demand for brides for young men. The difficulty to 'find' wives, combined with a lack of protections in China, has fueled a demand for trafficked women from abroad, mainly from neighboring countries./36Human Rights Watch has documented bride trafficking in Myanmar, where each year hundreds of women and girls are deceived through false promises of employment into traveling to China, only to be sold to Chinese families as brides and forced into sexual slavery, often for years./37 Most were pressured to become pregnant as quickly as possible; some were compelled to undergo forced fertility treatment. Those with children who were lucky enough to escape could usually only do so by leaving their children behind. Several of the interviewed women had been trafficked multiple times./38/Reports have found that bride trafficking occurs in Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, Nepal, North Korea, Pakistan, and Vietnam and that the number of women and girls being trafficked is growing./39 The trafficked women and girls are often ethnic or religious minorities, from impoverished communities, or, in the case of North Korea, fleeing abusive governments. Violence against women and girls is often a low priority for governments and all the affected countries have complicated relationships with China. Consequentially, their governments often show little concern about the fate of women and girls trafficked to China. However, there has been growing attention to bride trafficking in the media, and governments of the home countries of victims are becoming more aware.In June 2019, the Ministry of Public Security, China's police, said that it rescued 1,100 Southeast Asian female trafficking victims and arrested 1,322 suspects, including 262 foreigners, in the previous year.The Chinese government also seems to be promoting propaganda about bride trafficking to improve its global image. Human Rights Watch met an activist from Myanmar who had participated in a Chinese study tour for women's rights groups. During one session, an activist recalls a professor explaining that trafficking was not the problem but that "Myanmar women don't know Chinese culture. Once they learn Chinese language and culture, their marriages are fine." Participants were told to, "Tell your government the Chinese government is doing very good things for Myanmar women."The Chinese public is not widely aware of bride trafficking due to the government's tightened grip on the media and internet since Xi Jinping came to power in 2012. Speaking critically of the government often results in police harassment and arrest, and few, if any, services exist for women and girls trafficked from other countries. As discussed above, a continuing crackdown on women's rights activists and civil society groups makes it increasingly difficult for them to raise awareness and assist victims.Human Rights Watch recommends the Committee ask the government of China:* What is the government doing to tackle the issue of bride trafficking?* What kind of support and services are they providing to the victims of bride trafficking?* Provide information showing investigations and prosecutions of those involved in bride trafficking.Human Rights Watch recommends the Committee call on the government of China to:* Ensure that law enforcement agencies work actively to recover trafficked women, in cooperation with law enforcement agencies from the source country, and ensure that trafficking victims have access to support and services.Shackling of Women and Girls with Psychosocial Disabilities (Articles 12 and 15)Women and girls with real or perceived psychosocial disabilities (mental health conditions) can be shackled--chained or locked in confined spaces--due to prevalent stigma as well as a lack of adequate and accessible community-based services./40 The time periods range from days and weeks, to months, and even years./41Government-controlled media in China reported between 2013 and 2017 that people with mental health conditions were shackled or locked in cages across the country, with approximately 100,000 "cage people" in the northern Hebei province alone./42 In one case, an 8-year-old girl was tied to a tree by her grandparents for nearly six years in the Henan province./43The nature of shackling means that people live in very restrictive conditions that reduce their ability to stand or move at all. People who are shackled to one another are forced to go to the toilet and sleep together. Shackling impacts a person's mental as well as physical health. A shackled person can be affected by post-traumatic stress, malnutrition, infections, nerve damage, muscular atrophy, and cardio-vascular problems./44Ying, a young woman from the Goungdong province, told Human Rights Watch in 2019: "All through my childhood, my aunt was locked in a wooden shed and I was forbidden to have contact with her. My family believed her mental health condition would stigmatize the whole family. I really wanted to help my aunty but couldn't. It was heart-breaking."/45Human Rights Watch recommends the Committee ask the government of China:* Is there any data on the number of people, including women and girls with psychosocial disabilities, who are currently shackled or have been subjected to shackling in China?* What steps has the government taken to eliminate the practice of shackling of people, including women and girls with psychosocial disabilities?* What steps has the government taken to develop adequate, quality, and voluntary community-based support mental health services?Human Rights Watch recommends the Committee call on the government of China to:* Ban shackling in law and in policy.* Develop a time-bound plan to shift progressively to voluntary community-based mental health, support, and independent living services.* Comprehensively investigate state and private institutions in which women and girls with psychosocial disabilities live, with the goal of stopping chaining and ending other abuses.* Create and carry out deinstitutionalization policies and time-bound action plans, based on the values of equality, independence, and inclusion for women and girls with disabilities. Preventing institutionalization should be an important part of this plan. Governments should include women and girls with disabilities and their representative organizations in developing and carrying out the plans.Protection of Education from Attack (Article 10)As recognized by this Committee in its General Recommendation No. 30, attacks on students and schools, and the use of schools for military purposes, disproportionately affect girls, who are sometimes the focus of targeted attacks and are more likely to be kept out of school due to security concerns./46As of January 2021, China has 2541 troops deployed in UN peacekeeping missions in South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Mali. These are all countries where attacks on students and schools, and the military use of schools have been documented./47Peacekeeping troops are required to comply with the UN Department of Peace Operations' "UN Infantry Battalion Manual" (2012), which includes the provision that "schools shall not be used by the military in their operations."/48 Moreover, the 2017 Child Protection Policy of the UN Department of Peace Operations, Department of Field Support, and Department of Political Affairs notes:United Nations peace operations should refrain from all actions that impede children's access to education, including the use of school premises. This applies particularly to uniformed personnel. Furthermore ... United Nations peace operations personnel shall at no time and for no amount of time use schools for military purposes./49The Safe Schools Declaration is an inter-governmental political commitment that provides countries the opportunity to express political support for the protection of students, teachers, and schools during times of armed conflict/50; the importance of the continuation of education during armed conflict; and the implementation of the Guidelines for Protecting Schools and Universities from Military Use during Armed Conflict./51 As of January 2021, 106 countries have endorsed the Safe Schools Declaration, including 9 of China's fellow UN Security Council members. China has yet to endorse this important declaration./52Human Rights Watch recommends the Committee ask the government of China:* Why has the government of China not endorsed the Safe Schools Declaration?* Are protections for schools from military use included in the pre-deployment training provided to Chinese troops participating in peacekeeping missions?* Do any Chinese laws, policies, or trainings provide explicit protection for schools and universities from military use during armed conflict?Human Rights Watch recommends the Committee call on the government of China to:* Endorse and implement the Safe Schools Declaration.Footnotes:1/ Yaqiu Wang (Human Rights Watch), "#MeToo in the land of censorship" commentary, Washington Post, May 8, 2020, https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/05/08/metoo-land-censorship.2/ Yaqiu Wang, "Is #MeToo Changing China?" commentary, Washington Post, September 17, 2018, https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/09/17/metoo-changing-china.3/ Javier C.

Coalition for a Prosperous America Issues White Paper Entitled 'Reclaiming the U.S. Solar Supply Chain From China'Targeted News ServiceMarch 13, 2021 Saturday 6:38 AM  ESTCopyright 2021 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 7578 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON, March 13 -- The Coalition for a Prosperous America has issued a 19-page white paper dated March 2021 entitled: "Reclaiming the U.S. Solar Supply Chain from China".The white paper was written by Jeff Ferry, chief economist.* * *CONTENTSTHE STATE OF THE US SOLAR INDUSTRY ... 2FROM AMERICAN LEADERSHIP TO CHINESE DOMINANCE: SOLAR POWER HISTORY ... 4THE IMPACT OF SAFEGUARD TARIFFS ON US PRODUCTION ... 5PREDICTIONS OF TARIFF HARM DID NOT MATERIALIZE ... 7THE CHINA CHOKEHOLD ON THE SOLAR INDUSTRY ... 9FORCED LABOR ... 11LOSING MANUFACTURING MEANS LOSING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ... 13A US STRATEGY FOR THE SOLAR SUPPLY CHAIN ... 14POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS ... 15CONCLUSION ... 18* * *Key Points* Several US solar module manufacturers have ramped up production substantially in the last three years under the stimulus of the Section 201 safeguard tariffs on solar module imports, leading US producers to achieve a 10-year high in market share of 19.8% in 2019, a noteworthy achievement.* The Section 201 solar tariffs have had no negative impact on the US market for solar energy installations, which grew 43% in 2020. Solar installations are set to be more than 50% greater than they were expected to be prior to the implementation of the 201 tariffs in 2017.* However, Chinese manufacturers continue to hold a dominant, near-monopoly, position in several important sectors of the upstream solar supply chain, endangering the health and future of the US solar industry. China continues to raise the stakes with large subsidies supporting billions of dollars of Chinese solar industry expansion. Beijing's goal is global dominance of this industry.* Chinese dominance threatens US energy independence and US technology leadership in solar and other clean energy technologies. It also threatens our semiconductor industry, which relies on polysilicon as a raw material.* The US government should implement policies designed to secure the long-term future of an end-to-end US solar supply chain, using a mixture of incentives, tax credits, government procurement policies, and tariffs. These policies should be explicitly long-term. They should not be conditional on any foreign nation's behavior. Their goal should be to achieve US resilience and self-sufficiency in solar power technology and manufacturing.The State of the US Solar IndustryThe US solar industry continues to post very strong growth figures, with 2020 expected to have delivered 19 gigawatts (GW) of solar installations, an increase of 43% over 2019 and an all-time high for the US market. This report focuses on the state of the US solar manufacturing industry, which manufactures the hardware (solar panels and components that go into solar panels) that makes solar power possible. Despite a decade of relentless assault by the Chinese solar manufacturing industry, which is government-subsidized and dependent on forced Uyghur labor, the US solar module manufacturing industry has grown to its largest size and healthiest condition since 2010. This report looks at the current state of the US solar manufacturing industry and its future prospects.The US solar industry withstood the COVID pandemic better than almost any other major US industry. The growth was strong at both ends of the industry: residential installations at the smaller system size, and utility installations at the larger end. The industry suffered a decline in installations in the second quarter of 2020 due to COVID shutdowns freezing installation work in many states, but bounced back sharply in Q3 and Q4. Figure 1 shows the strong growth in 2020, as well as continued growth expected this year and in the following two years. The data comes from solar market analysts Wood Mackenzie. The surge in installations in 2016 was driven by concern in the industry that tax credits would end that year, so customers rushed to buy equipment and install systems before the end of that year. The next year was depressed largely due to the after-effects of the 2016 surge. Growth resumed in 2019 and gathered speed thereafter.Figure omitted:The growth in solar installations is driven by two major forces: declining prices for solar equipment, and federal and state tax credits. Figure 2 shows that system prices have fallen by around 20% over the last five years, defying predictions of price hikes due to tariffs. Compared with solar prices 15 years ago when the technology first became commercially viable, prices have declined about 90%. The fundamental driver in price decline is growing efficiency in the design and manufacture of the solar cell, the heart of photovoltaic energy production. Solar cells have become steadily more efficient at converting light into electricity, reducing the cost per watt.China too has played a role in declining solar system prices. The Chinese government views solar as a strategic industry, and as such, the solar sector has received numerous subsidies, including in land, electricity, indirect and direct financial support in addition to tax relief. This fueled an unrestrained race to the bottom in which Chinese firms overinvested, dumped product to gain market share, and then consolidated the industry. Artificially cheap prices allowed for increased deployments, but it also hollowed out the U.S. solar manufacturing industry.Solar deployment policies in the US have helped the industry grow. The federal investment tax credit (ITC) has played a large role in driving residential, commercial, and utility investment in solar systems. The ITC, currently at 26%, and recently extended for two years, enables a business or homeowner to claim a credit against income tax equivalent to 26% of the cost of the entire solar project, including land acquisition, design, and installation of a solar system. The federal ITC is supplemented by a variety of state-level credits and support programs, especially the net metering program, which allows individuals or businesses to sell power back to regulated utilities at set rates. Solar power enjoys support from the public and from lawmakers because it is seen, and legitimately so, as it is cleaner than fossil fuels, less dangerous than nuclear power, and less visually intrusive than large-scale wind farms. Unfortunately, the solar tax credit is not limited to US-manufactured equipment, so a significant share of US taxpayer support is going to Chinese companies."The market today is rock solid and the tax credit extensions will only add fuel to the fire this year," Solaria CEO Suvi Sharma told us. Solaria designs and installs custom solar systems for both the residential and the utility market. Sharma expects his revenue to double this year.Figure omitted:From American Leadership to Chinese Dominance: Solar Power HistorySolar cells were first invented in the US in 1954 at Bell Labs, by a team led by chemist Calvin Fuller. In the 1960s and 1970s, the US led the world in development of the technology, supported by government R&D funds and private research organizations like Bell Labs. The oil crisis of the 1970s provided further impetus to solar research, prompting lawmakers, business leaders, and scientists to search for alternatives to foreign oil. SunPower was founded as a private company in 1985 by academics at Stanford University and led the commercialization of solar cells. In the 1990s, Japan and Germany entered the industry with a substantial R&D and business presence in both their domestic and international markets.In the early 2000s, growth in solar power deployment accelerated, due to environmental concerns and growing worries about Middle Eastern instability. SunPower expanded its manufacturing capacity internationally. In the US, hundreds of small startups raised billions of dollars to enter the solar power market, some with the dominant crystalline silicon cell technology and others with alternative technologies such as thin film solar panels. By 2005, euphoria surrounded the solar industry and related so-called "alternative energy fields." Thousands of engineers, scientists, manufacturing workers and investors joined and supported the industry. SunPower went public that year, and its stock closed 41% over the launch price on its first day of trading.2005 was also the year the Chinese government decided to target alternative energy and solar power specifically as a key strategic growth industry for China. As a result, the Chinese government routed billions of dollars to China's nascent solar industry via Chinese state-owned banks, private banks, provincial and local governments, and other channels. According to one estimate, Suntech, once China's largest solar power company received low-interest loans of $3.7billion from local banks in Wuxi. American academics Usha and George Haley documented that Chinese solar panel maker Evergreen received two thirds of its factory's capital costs from localprovincial governments. One study found that in 2011, Chinese solar companies had an average profit margin of negative 40%. However, the Chinese government-funded these massive losses as part of the price of cornering the global market.In 2003, China had a 2% share of global solar manufacturing. By 2011, that share was more than 60%. In response to the rush of new supply from new Chinese factories, global solar prices cratered. In the US, scores of companies exited the industry. "In the US, $10 billion of investment was lost and over 100 companies went bankrupt," says Frank van Mierlo, CEO of 1366 Technologies, one of the few survivors.Over the next few years, solar manufacturing in the US declined to near-zero. While solar deployments continued to rise, the US relied almost entirely on solar panels manufactured in Asia. Anti-dumping and countervailing duties were levied on Chinese solar products in 2012 and again in 2014. The large Chinese manufacturers simply avoided the duties by opening factories in southeast Asia.The Impact of Safeguard Tariffs on US ProductionIn February 2018, the Trump administration levied tariffs on imported solar modules. Section 201 of the 1974 Trade Act allows the temporary imposition of "safeguard tariffs" when an increased volume of imports threatens the viability of a domestic industry. The investigation by the bipartisan International Trade Commission found a severe threat to the entire US solar industry and recommended tariffs on all imports. The tariffs started at 30% in 2018 and were scheduled to decline by 5 percentage points each year over a four-year period.Even though the tariffs were only temporary, and four years is a relatively short time period in the manufacturing business, the 201 tariffs gave a kick-start to the industry. "The tariffs were like a bridge to the future," says Paul Mutchler, sales director at Mission Solar. After steady growth over the past two years, Mission Solar decided to expand further. It purchased new equipment and began installing it in December 2020. This spring, Mission expects to switch on its new assembly line, increasing its capacity by 50% to 300 megawatts. Based in San Antonio, Texas, Mission has just one manufacturing facility. It sells primarily to the residential sector, but also to commercial customers. Its panels are all made in the USA and appeal to customers who want to buy American. "We're the American muscle car of solar panels," Mutchler says.Auxin Solar is an original equipment maker that manufactures solar panels sold under other companies' brand names. It was founded in San Jose, California by a group of former tech executives led by Mamun Rashid. Rashid had designed chips for Intel and retired, before coming back into business in 2008 because he wanted to manufacture in the US and he believed the solar business was set for strong growth. The Chinese invasion of the industry set back Auxin's plans."We were dead wrong believing people wanted made in USA, and it cost us millions. People wanted the lowest price," Rashid says. In 2019, in the wake of the tariffs, Auxin's business surged. Production approached the 150 megawatt capacity at the San Jose plant for the first time in years. Like Mutchler, Rashid gives a lot of credit for the resurgence to the tariffs. "We are alive today because of the 201s," he says.Three of the largest makers of solar modules on US soil are foreign-owned. Jinko Solar is a Chinese company, manufacturing modules in Jacksonville, Florida. LG Solar is a Korean company that opened a plant in Huntsville, Alabama in February 2019. Today the LG plant has a capacity of 550 megawatts and is working flat out, with 150 employees working in multiple shifts. The largest crystalline silicon solar module maker in the US is Korean-owned Hanwha Q Cells, with a plant in Dalton, Georgia employing around 650 workers producing at a rate of 1.7 gigawatts per year.First Solar Corp. is the world's largest US-owned solar module maker. It is now producing at a rate of 2.2 gigawatts a year in the US (and another 5 GW of production in Asia). First Solar uses a thin film technology, which is different from other manufacturers. Instead of assembling several dozen solar cells into a solar panel or module, First Solar's technology involves spreading a thin layer of photovoltaic material onto a sheet of glass. Thin film was a "hot" technology a decade ago. Dozens of thin film startups and pioneers were wiped out when Chinese overcapacity made prices plummet between 2010 and 2012, with First Solar as the only commercially successful survivor. First Solar is expanding its two Ohio factories to handle demand for Series 6, the latest generation of its thin film modules. In 2020, demand for the Ohio product ran at an extraordinary 109% of capacity. In its Q4 earnings report, released on Feb.25th, First Solar said it expects to sell about $2.5 billion worth of modules in 2021.In 2019, US-produced solar modules achieved a record market share of 19.8%, the highest figure in a decade, according to official figures from the Energy Information Agency, a division of the US Department of Energy. The 201 safeguard tariffs, implemented in 2018, were a major driver of the market share growth. In 2018, confidence in the growth of the renewable energy market was rising and the tariffs provided a boost to the market, signaling to module producers that this was the right moment to invest in expansion. The data for 2020 is not yet available, but we expect it to show a similar or even larger US share in the domestic market.Figure omitted:Predictions of Tariff Harm Did Not MaterializeThe Section 201 safeguard solar tariffs have been opposed with a campaign led by groups representing Chinese producers, importers and installers using gloomy predictions that have not materialized during the tariff period. In a February 22, 2021 letter, the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) argued that the solar tariffs have caused a loss of 62,000 solar jobs in the US and a loss of $19 billion of solar deployment business. These claims rely on misleading employment claims and flawed economic analysis.First, there is little if any evidence that US tariffs have been fully passed on as a price increase to the purchaser. Figure 4 shows that solar module prices have fallen steadily from 2015 to today.Prices are down from 65 cents per watt in 2015 to 27 cents a watt in Q3 of 2020. Prices plunged sharply in 2016 as importers tried to unload large inventories of modules. In 2017 prices rose as importers paid more to import large volumes of modules ahead of the implementation of expected tariffs from the Trump administration.Once the tariffs were levied in February 2018, instead of prices rising by the 30% level of the tariffs, they rapidly fell and have continued falling to this very day.Figure omitted:Second, the claim that 62,000 jobs were lost due to tariffs does not reflect what actually occurred. Solar forecasts from SEIA and Wood Mackenzie published in 2017, before the tariffs were imposed, showed expected installations of around 15 GW for 2020. Actual installations in 2020, with the tariffs in place, exceeded 19 GW.Job totals in solar are very high, according to estimates recently published (see Figure 5) by Bloomberg New Energy Finance.Figure omitted:The China Chokehold on the Solar IndustryWhile it is positive that US market share in solar modules rising sharply, module manufacturing is just one part of the solar power supply chain. Solar modules are assembled from solar cells, which are the workhorses of solar power generation. A solar cell is a silicon chip with other materials embedded that enable the chip to generate an electric current when hit by sunlight. The electricity is carried off the chip by tiny wires, normally made of silver. The manufacturing process begins with metallurgical-grade silicon, which is mined from rocks, often quartz (silicon is one of the most plentiful elements in the earth's crust). The silicon is then heated and purified up to purities of 99.9999% to make a crystalline form of silicon known as polysilicon. The polysilicon is shaped into long bars called ingots. The ingots are sliced into wafers. The wafers are manufactured into solar cells by depositing materials and contacts onto the wafer and then cutting them to the standard size of 6 inch square. Finally, the solar cells are assembled into solar panels, with a typical layout of 60 or 72 cells to a panel.The pie charts in Figure 6 show the extent of Chinese domination of the industry today. The US has viable businesses only at the start of the supply chain, in the manufacture of polysilicon, and at the end of the process, in the manufacture of the solar module. China's domination of the middle stages, the manufacture of solar ingots and wafers, is near-total, at 99%. Its domination of global solar cell manufacture, at 80%, is also very powerful.Figure omitted:The upstream businesses, making polysilicon, ingots, and wafers, lend themselves to China's form of government-managed industrial subsidy-driven mass production. These processes are energy-intensive so China's subsidized electricity enables the government to give Chinese companies a hidden cost advantage. Equally important is the use of forced labor in China's Xinjiang province. China has 64% of the world's production capacity of polysilicon. About half of that production occurs in Xinjiang. China has ample supplies of coal-fired power plants in Xinjiang producing low-cost energy. The irony of using highly polluting power plants to produce solar equipment should not be lost on us, and indeed US solar module producers like Mission Solar stress that they are focused on producing solar modules that minimize carbon emissions throughout the product lifecycle, from manufacture of the polysilicon all the way through to disposal and recycling of an old solar module.The polysilicon, ingot, and wafer-making businesses are dominated by half a dozen Chinese companies including Daqo New Energy, GCL-Poly, Jinko Solar, and Longi. Chinese industries have repeatedly used the domination of one part of a supply chain to drive foreign competition out of other sections of the chain, resulting in a Chinese takeover of a complete supply chain. The danger of China exercising its chokehold to seize ever-larger market share is a very real threat and makes it difficult for US entrepreneurs to raise money to invest in US solar manufacturing projects.The manipulation of industry-wide standards is another tool Beijing uses against international competitors. Following government direction, the Chinese solar industry is moving to a new standard power efficiency of 22.5%, up from the current 19.5% standard. That could put nonChinese makers of solar cells in a difficult spot as they may struggle to raise the investment funds needed to upgrade their equipment. On the wafer side, some Chinese manufacturers are promoting a new target for standard wafer size of 210mm (8.25 inches) instead of the current standard of 156mm (6 inches). Each of these changes requires investing in new equipment, which can often cost hundreds of millions of dollars. This can drive non-Chinese firms out of the business. Chinese firms rely on cheap finance from China's network of government-directed banks, local authorities, and local power companies. One expert estimated in 2016 that China has spent a staggering $47 billion building its solar industry.Polysilicon is a key industry segment under attack from Chinese producers. A recent report from a German analyst said China was planning increase its domination of polysilicon production by another 10 points of global market share, up to 75%. This will likely depress the price further, putting foreign producers in difficulty. Polysilicon is one sector where the US still has a significant presence, with three producers. After President Obama's antidumping/countervailing duty tariffs on Chinese solar modules in 2012, Beijing retaliated by putting prohibitively high tariffs on the import of US polysilicon into China. Since no solar ingots are produced in the US and few produced anywhere outside of China, the US poly industry relies on China as a market. The Chinese retaliation robbed the US poly industry of most of its business. One poly maker, REC Silicon, was forced to first downsize and then shut its Moses Lake, Washington poly plant with the loss of over 500 jobs. Then in December 2019, the Trump administration and the Chinese government concluded the so-called Phase One agreement. Under a confidential part of Phase One, China reportedly agreed to begin purchasing US-made polysilicon again. However, one industry source told us: "China has not bought a single gram of US polysilicon under Phase One."Retaliatory tariffs on polysilicon have a sad history. In 2012, the Obama administration levied an anti-dumping duty averaging 31% on Chinese solar cells and modules. China responded with a 50% retaliatory tariff on US-made polysilicon. Also in 2012, Hemlock Semiconductor opened a new $1.2 billion polysilicon manufacturing facility in Clarksville, Tennessee. Hemlock is a joint venture of two large US chemical firms, Dow Chemical and Corning, and a Japanese chemical maker. Due to the Chinese tariff, Hemlock never shipped a single ton of polysilicon from Clarksville. Instead, in 2014 it was forced to shut the facility, lay off a total of 700 people, and bulldoze all the buildings. Over $1 billion of high-tech manufacturing buildings were plowed into the dirt.Solar cells are another segment of the industry where US production has dwindled to near-zero. Violet Power, an Oregon startup, is working on building a greenfield solar cell plant in Moses Lake, Washington, adjacent to the REC Silicon facility. Violet Power CEO Desari Strader has said the plant will open this year and employ 500 workers, producing 500 megawatts of solar cells. This would be a very welcome development. But China is also investing heavily in solar cell production, with the aim of almost doubling its production of solar cells and modules from 94 GW to 180 GW between last year and this year. This is likely to put further pricing pressure on the US cell and module industry.Forced LaborAt the same time that China levied its tariffs on US polysilicon, it launched a crash program to build up Chinese polysilicon production in the Xinjiang province in the west of China. This took place at the same time that President Xi launched a campaign of repression against the Muslim Uyghur population in Xinjiang. From about 4,000 metric tons of polysilicon production in 2012, Xinjiang today accounts for about half of global polysilicon output of 570,000 metric tons a year.Last year, US consulting firm Horizon Advisory released an explosive report documenting the use of forced Uyghur labor in Xinjiang province. The report explained how polysilicon producers work closely with the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, a paramilitary Chinese government organization that is involved in the mass detention and physical abuse of thousands of Uyghurs whose only crime is to be of a different ethnic group than the Han Chinese that rule China. The Horizon report said use of polysilicon linked to Xinjiang was "pervasive" throughout the Chinese solar industry.The Biden administration has stated its public support for tough restrictions on products from Xinjiang, with Secretary of State Anthony Blinken recently reiterating his view that China policy in the province amounts to "genocide." Congress is likely to pass legislation this year calling for tougher restrictions on products incorporating Xinjiang forced labor. It is unclear how the US solar industry, led by its trade association the Solar Energy Industries Association, will respond. It has called for reorienting supply chains to exclude products from Xinjiang. But the Chinese solar panel makers, some of whom occupy key positions within the SEIA hierarchy have either refused to comment on their exposure to Xinjiang product or denied forced labor exists in Xinjiang. Some figures in the Chinese industry are calling for retaliation against American companies over what they call a forced labor "hoax," Industry sources tell us that Chinese poly makers are already moving some production to Mongolia, with the aim of claiming that export products come from Mongolia while Xinjiang poly will be targeted only to the Chinese market.There is hope that other participants in the US market might react more vigorously on the forced labor issue. For example, NextEra Energy, one of the leaders in deploying renewable energy, gets its solar modules from Jinko, a Chinese solar giant that buys Xinjiang polysilicon from Daqo and makes ingots and wafers in Xinjiang. In 2019, Google agreed to buy solar energy from NextEra for its data centers. With its highly outspoken staff, Google has championed equity issues in the US and condemned racism linked to US slavery that was abolished in 1863. It remains to be seen if Google will take as firm a stand on the slavery and racism--including systematic mass rape in Xinjiang prisons recently reported by BBC News--now going on in Xinjiang. Investment analysts have told Standard and Poors that the investment community will take ethical standards into account when valuing solar stocks because renewable energy companies are "held to a higher standard" than ordinary companies. But despite their rhetoric, solar organizations like the SEIA have shown more flexible ethical standards.China's goal is likely to use its dominant position in the upstream industry and its strong position (80% market share) in solar cells to force the US and other western nations into bankruptcy in those segments of the industry (polysilicon, modules) it does not yet control, on the way to consolidating complete domination of the global solar supply chain. A Chinese utility executive, Liu Zhenya, provided a glimpse of the China vision in 2016, when he gave a speech in which he outlined his vision for an international organization he called Global Energy Interconnection, to manage a global power grid relying on renewables for 80% of its energy, and which would one day unite virtually the entire world with highly efficient clean electricity. It would be, said Liu, a way to funnel cheap power from the global North to the South and from the East to the West. Unspoken was the thought that all this power would be generated largely from China by Chinese equipment, providing China huge leverage over all nations dependent on this global grid.In the 1970s, the US was dependent on the Middle East for vital oil. That turned into a crippling weakness when OPEC enacted an embargo and fourfold price hike, leading to recession, inflation, and thorough re-evaluation of US foreign policy. It was a factor in Jimmy Carter's election defeat in 1980. As our nation moves towards getting the majority of our electricity from renewable sources, it would be a tragedy if the US became completely dependent on China for this vital technology of the future.Losing Manufacturing Means Losing Research and DevelopmentIt is often said that the US should focus on research and development (R&D) and leave manufacturing to other nations. This view ignores the reality of how technological progress is achieved in most industries. New products and new processes are typically not the result of scientists working in white coats in serene isolation in a government or university lab. They are much more likely the result of men and women working in industry, in close contact with the problems and opportunities of existing products. Government and university funding can play a key role, but in collaboration with industry. The original silicon solar cell was developed by Bell Labs because Bell's parent company, AT&T, was trying to solve the problem of getting electric power to telecom huts out in remote areas like deserts or mountains.If the US loses all manufacturing capability in the solar supply chain, that R&D will also be lost to China. The strength of the US technology industry is in the entrepreneurs who are willing to take risks and the venture capital firms that are willing to back them. Frank van Mierlo is one such entrepreneur. He launched 1366 Technologies 13 years ago. It has developed a manufacturing process for turning polysilicon directly into silicon wafers using half the energy and generating half the carbon footprint of the current technology. Van Mierlo was a co-founder of Bluefin Robotics in 1997, a startup that developed the world's first commercial underwater robot or drone. Bluefin was acquired by General Dynamics and its drones are used today by the US Navy and by the airline industry for retrieval of planes that crash in the ocean. After Bluefin, van Mierlo launched 1366. He, the co-founders, and venture investors have poured a total of $200 million into 1366. Despite the technical and cost advantages of the 1366 wafer manufacturing process and van Mierlo's goal of manufacturing in the US, 1366 may be forced to manufacture in Asia because that's where the customers are."We [the US] have a massive comparative advantage in photovoltaics but China locks us out. They are not innovating in solar because it is so much cheaper to copy." If 1366 Technologies builds a manufacturing plant in the US, that would fill a missing link in the US supply chain with a superior technology. It would also benefit the US polysilicon industry, which would have a new customer.Across the country, Chris Eberspacher runs a small startup called Tandem PV. They are developing a solar cell made of a perovskite crystal which can be layered on top of a conventional silicon solar cell to tap a different wavelength of light and generate some 30% more electricity from a given area of solar cells. Eberspacher and Tandem's founder, Colin Bailey, are both PhDs from Stanford. They raised a few million dollars of seed money from the federal government's ARPA-E research agency and venture capital firms. They are building a small production facility in Silicon Valley to manufacture and prove out the first versions of their tandem solar cells. Their business plan is to raise more venture money once the prototype is working, and then move to large-scale manufacturing. Eberspacher, who has been in the solar industry for 35 years, would like that manufacturing operation to be in the US. "Perovskites will be a global industry. The manufacturing can be done here because the labor cost input is low and the value of the product is high."It's widely recognized in the industry that perovskites will be a key technology for the next decade. Eberspacher is worried because Chinese researchers are now at the leading edge, along with researchers from the US, Germany and the UK. "The federal government has to think holistically about what it wants. It's high time the US gets more serious about manufacturing and STEM education. Because it's very difficult to be a technology leader if you don't have a nexus to how products are manufactured."A US Strategy for the Solar Supply ChainThe benefits of a US-based solar supply chain are clear. They include national security and energy security. The US needs a source of solar equipment it can rely on as our energy grid moves increasingly to solar power. Today, only some 5% of US energy comes from solar, but experts expect the share of US energy from renewables could reach as high as 50% by 2030. Renewables include wind and biofuels, as well as solar, but solar holds out the most promise of cost reduction over the long term because of the opportunity for technological breakthroughs in the industry. Today a solar cell only turns some 24% of the light that hits it into electricity. The increasing efficiency of solar cells, combined with breakthroughs in energy storage (batteries) is set to let solar power take a much larger share of our energy supply.A further important issue is the synergy between solar manufacturing and semiconductor manufacturing. Both use polysilicon as the key input. Today, some 70% of the polysilicon manufactured globally goes into solar cells and the remaining 30% into semiconductors. If the US intends to remain a major player in either industry, we must be a big player in both industries. Allowing China to monopolize polysilicon presents dangers not only to a US solar industry, but to the US semiconductor industry as well.A further advantage of a domestic manufacturing industry is that it creates other jobs among suppliers of both goods and services. For example, in November 2020, Japanese global glass manufacturer NSG Group opened a 500,000 square foot facility in Troy Township, Ohio to supply First Solar's state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in nearby Perrysburg, Ohio. The glass plant, the first new float glass plant in the US in 40 years, employs 150 workers and can produce up to 600 tons of glass a day. It's estimated that the typical manufacturing job creates three additional jobs among suppliers.We must also consider the direct economic benefits of manufacturing to workers. The manufacturing sector is the only major segment of the economy that can deliver high and rising wages to a large section of the working population. That's because only manufacturing can deliver steady, significant increases in productivity year after year. Unlike R&D work, manufacturing does not require high levels of education. It requires skills, aptitudes and dedication that the average working man or woman can learn. Historian Yuval Noah Harari points out that in the Middle Ages the average farmhand was able to harvest five bushels of wheat a day. In 2014, a combine harvester set a record by harvesting 30,000 bushels in a day. That is a 6,000-fold improvement over 600 years, applied to a manual process. There is debate about how much workers have shared in recent years in the benefits of productivity improvements, but there is no doubt that they gain some improvement in real wages.Solar installation, the dominant type of work in today's import-dependent US industry, is a perfectly good job (although clambering around on roofs brings with it certain risks). But by the nature of installation work, it can never deliver the sort of constant productivity improvement that a manufacturing job can. Manufacturing jobs pay better, and include better benefits, than installer work.We can illustrate this difference with industry data. According to BLS data for May 2019 (date of the latest available occupational survey), the average manufacturing employee earned 22% more than the average solar installer, assuming both employees worked a full 40-hour week throughout the year. Of course, most solar installers do not work 52 weeks a year. It's likely that in a typical year, a manufacturing employee in a solar facility would earn 50% to 100% more than a solar installer.Table omitted:In 40 trips to China and many trips around the US and Europe, Frank van Mierlo has visited most of the world's solar factories. He had this to say about US manufacturing: "The First Solar factory in Ohio is arguably the best solar facility on the planet. It's high tech, completely automated, it has a low carbon footprint and high productivity. And when you think about the 100 US solar companies that were killed off in the years of China's solar offensive [2012-2014], it's a sobering reality that a number of those companies had the potential to be additional First Solars."Policy RecommendationsWith annual consumption exceeding 20 GW a year, the US can and must have its own end-to-end solar supply chain. The federal government should adopt policies that can achieve this objective and sustain it in the face of the predatory practices of China. Those predatory practices, in existence for more than a decade, are set to become more intense in the next several years. US policy should not be based on investigating and then "punishing" Chinese companies for specific unlawful practices; that is an approach that only creates work for lawyers and usually only delivers benefits, if at all, when the US victim companies are at death's door. Instead, our policies should be aimed at creating an end-to-end US solar industry targeting at least 50% of the market in each segment of the supply chain.Policies to be urgently considered include:* A "Made-in-USA solar tax credit" available to US-based solar manufacturers based on the US value-added in their product and their annual sales. The solar investment tax credit of 26% is a successful program that received bipartisan support in December's congressional vote. A made-in-USA solar tax credit should be initiated as a separate program at the same order of magnitude as the ITC in terms of total cost. According to one Congressional report, the solar ITC costs the Treasury around $2.7 billion a year. If we added a made-in-USA tax credit on a similar scale, we would still be supporting our solar industry at a fraction of the level by which China supports its solar industry. The tax credit would include polysilicon manufacturing, ingot/wafer production, as well as solar cell and module manufacturing. Such a tax credit would save existing polysilicon jobs in Washington, Michigan, and Tennessee, and lead to the creation of new jobs in new manufacturing locations.* Strengthened Buy American policies requiring the federal government to buy only US-made solar equipment AND power generated only from US-made solar equipment. Today's Buy American laws are more notable for their loopholes than their effectiveness. Some federal agencies do favor American solar modules but many more, including even US military bases, exploit loopholes to buy imported equipment or to buy power generated by imported solar equipment. Congress should pass beefed-up requirements that make the US government and all its agencies the lead customer for made-in-USA solar equipment, again using a value-added standard rather than one focused solely on the final assembly of the module. Recognizing China's objectives in strangling foreign competition, the upstream segments of the industry are just as important as solar module assembly, and made-in-USA preference should include that objective.* Ban products made with Xinjiang forced labor. US workers should not be competing with slave labor. The US consumer should not be supporting forced labor with his or her pocketbook. And US taxpayers should not be supporting forced labor with their tax credits. This is a human rights issue and an economic rights issue. Congress must pass a tough law citing Xinjiang solar inputs and final products as high priority banned imports as soon as possible, and institute an auditing process to gain as much visibility as possible into the manufacturing location of the materials and components of all imported solar equipment. Many solar modules imported from Malaysia and Vietnam likely contain Xinjiang poly, so country of final shipment is not a reliable guide.* Persistent, long-term tariffs on all inputs in the solar supply chain. We must recognize that however strict we attempt to make our restrictions on Xinjiang products, China will still succeed in bringing in goods linked to their forced-labor economy. To enable businesses to plan with reliability and to enforce US standards of human rights that prohibit US dollars supporting forced labor, we must implement persistent, long-term tariffs on imports of all solar inputs and products, from polysilicon through to modules. In light of China's ability to subsidize artificially low prices, a persistent tariff of 50% might be needed to guarantee a growing, self-sufficient US solar supply chain.* Dedicated federal research & development support. The US should increase financial support dedicated to the solar industry, including manufacturing as well as fundamental research. Process is as important as product and both should be supported. Increased federal support for key technologies is already envisaged in the Endless Frontiers bill now before Congress.* Increased support for STEM education. The US has fallen behind many other nations in STEM education. The fundamental driver of US technological progress is the quality and quantity of graduates coming through our universities with education in these vital areas. We must increase the number of Americans choosing to study STEM subjects. The best way to do this is with federally-supported scholarships that make it clear that these subjects are more valuable to the nation than other subjects because of their importance to national and economic security. We must also reduce the number of Chinese students, especially graduate students, in these courses. Unfortunately, there is a high incidence of spying by Chinese students, orchestrated by organs of the Chinese government. A recent study by Georgetown University found that 16% of US STEM graduate students are Chinese. Innovation is what creates the manufacturing jobs and puts the products on an ever-decreasing cost curve that is ultimately more effective than scale-driven me-too manufacturing as practiced in China.This set of policies combines carrots and sticks: carrots to induce and incentivize the return of a US solar industry and sticks in the form of tariffs to keep out predatory, subsidized foreign imports, mostly from Chinese companies and some based on technology stolen from US companies in the first place.These policies would accelerate the move to renewable energy, create tens of thousands of good jobs in many regions of the country that need an economic boost, and improve US resilience and self-sufficiency. They would encourage venture investors to support more solar technology startups, as they did in the 2000-2010 period, creating more good engineering and scientific jobs in technologies that will be vital for our future.The common objection to such policies is that they will raise the price of solar installations in the US. But as Figure 3 above shows, the price of solar equipment and solar installations has continued to fall at a rate of 8%-10% a year despite the 2018 tariffs. Our recent experience with tariffs under President Trump has shown that as long as there is sufficient competition in the US market, tariffs have little effect on price levels, and what effect they do have tends to be temporary. We have documented these effects elsewhere. One simple example is that Trump's 2018 20% tariff on washing machines led to the BLS price index for laundry equipment (the category that includes washing machines) in 2019 to be just 0.8% above the level for 2016.Despite recent increases in the price of laundry equipment in 2020 due to shortages in cargo ships to bring in consumer durables from Asia, the laundry equipment price index has risen to 103.9, yet is still below 2013 levels.More fundamentally, the US has learned that cheap goods from Asia are a poisoned chalice. The flood of cheap goods destroys good jobs and reduces living standards for thousands of workers, with corrosive follow-on effects as job losses and pay cuts reverberate through cities and states across the country. When all is said and done, the jobs and income cost of the cheap goods overwhelmingly outweighs the benefits.ConclusionThe US solar power manufacturing industry is in the early stages of a renaissance, clearly visible in the surging production of solar modules in the US. However, China continues to raise the stakes, with bigger, more aggressive targets and subsidies for the Chinese solar industry. The US must take action to reinforce our own solar industry, embracing the full US solar supply chain including tariffs on subsidized imports. Renewable energy is too important an industry to allow one hostile, undemocratic nation to monopolize the supply of the equipment to produce this vital resource* * *The full white paper, including figures and tables, can be viewed at: https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/prosperousamerica/pages/6574/attachments/original/1615320705/210309-CPA_WP-Solar_Supply_Chain.pdf?1615320705TARGETED NEWS SERVICE (founded 2004) features non-partisan 'edited journalism' news briefs and information for news organizations, public policy groups and individuals; as well as 'gathered' public policy information, including news releases, reports, speeches.

A HUMAN RIGHTS APPROACH TO US-CHINA POLICYStates News ServiceFebruary 17, 2021 WednesdayCopyright 2021 States News ServiceLength: 1221 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, N.Y. BodyThe following information was released by Human Rights Watch:Dear President Biden,On behalf of 24 organizations and individuals devoted to improving respect for human rights in China, we write to urge your administration to make human rights a priority in US-China policy. We understand that the new administration is in the process of reviewing its approach to China, and we note and appreciate remarks from you and other senior officials, including National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, reflecting the gravity of Chinese government-inflicted human rights violations in Hong Kong and the Uyghur region/Xinjiang. We also appreciate your condemnation of racism against people of Asian descent in the United States.The scope and scale of human rights violations committed by the Chinese government inside and outside the country require a fundamental shift; many of the tools previously employed are no longer relevant or sufficiently robust. We welcome senior officials' statements that the US government will hold the Chinese government "accountable for its abuses of the international system," and the suggestion that the US will impose consequences for serious violations.To demonstrate that the United States will meet this challenge, we urge that you and your administration take the following steps:Make human rights a priority in China policy. The escalating and egregious abuses by the Chinese government should be one of the priority topics of discussion with President Xi Jinping and other Chinese leaders, and should be given credibility through your and other senior US officials' public commentary. When meeting with high-level Chinese officials, ask for the release of wrongfully detained individuals, for the reform of abusive laws, for internet and media freedom, and for international standards on human rights and fundamental freedoms to be upheld. The US should consider restarting the bilateral human rights dialogue only when independent civil society groups from China and the US can participate, and when specific objectives and outcomes can be publicly discussed.Play an active role in international bodies that can promote human rights in China. The Chinese government has weakened key international human rights bodies, most notably the United Nations Human Rights Council. It has rejected requests for visits by numerous Special Procedures, blocked access for civil society to the UN system through manipulation of the Economic and Social Council's NGO Committee, and failed to uphold International Labor Organization standards. We are encouraged by the decision to reengage with the Human Rights Council and step up support to its mechanisms; the US should spearhead a multilateral coalition of like-minded democracies to ensure that rights-respecting individuals and governments serve in key positions across the UN system. This coalition should also support independent civil society groups and human rights defenders' participation in UN action to advance international scrutiny of the Chinese government's rights record. Furthermore, the US should urgently support the June 2020 call by 50 UN human rights experts for urgent action on China, which could include a special session of the Human Rights Council, and the appointment of a special rapporteur to monitor and report on human rights violations by the Chinese government. The US should, finally, also urgently support an international investigation into human rights crimes against Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims in the Uyghur region/Xinjiang.Focus on technology. The US should take a principled global leadership role in technology by implementing comprehensive privacy legislation and reforming surveillance legislation, while working with like-minded governments to set rights-respecting standards in the collection of personal data and in the use of AI-enabled technologies. The US needs to work with rights-respecting countries to stigmatize the worst forms of mass data collection the kind the Chinese government is promoting, such as facial recognition, racial profiling, and genomic surveillance. The US should put in place a series of escalating actions against technology companies found to be contributing to China's mass surveillance, including by imposing Global Magnitsky sanctions.Provide strong and steadfast support to human rights defenders and civil society activists across China. Prioritize building strong ties to and among activists, independent writers, journalists, scholars, lawyers, and leaders of persecuted ethnic and religious minorities, and commit to assisting them when they are targeted for their activism. We also urge that you engage their counterparts now in the United States. Human rights improvements in China will come from within, and these are the key players.Treat the 2022 Olympics as a diplomatic matter. Given the Chinese government's grave human rights violations and the International Olympic Committee's unwillingness to carry out human rights due diligence around the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, refrain from sending high-profile or senior officials to the Games. The administration should also begin to brief athletes and others attending the Games on the risks they face, particularly with respect to tech-enabled surveillance and severe restrictions on free speech rights in China.Maintain existing targeted sanctions. Retain the sanctions on senior Chinese government officials and Entity List designations on Chinese companies and government agencies engaged in human rights violations. Target key government officials, state-run agencies, and companies, including state or military-operated businesses, credibly alleged to have committed serious human rights abuses, and seek legal accountability under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Act, the Tibetan Policy and Support Act of 2020, the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act of 2020, and other laws and policies regarding violations in Hong Kong and the Uyghur region/Xinjiang. These sanctions will be significantly more effective if coordinated with other rights-respecting governments.Counter Chinese government and Chinese Communist Party propaganda. The US should counter state-driven views by giving independent Chinese media and influential independent opinion-makers priority access to senior US officials, and by investing in independent Chinese-language news platforms and technology to combat Chinese government censorship and cyber surveillance.Choose words carefully. Please ensure that, across the administration, public remarks and policies strictly differentiate between the Chinese government and the people, including ethnic minorities, across China. Condemning "China" for human rights violations incorrectly conflates the government and the people. Exercise similar caution and avoid restating key Chinese government propaganda points many of which are factually inaccurate and excuse gross human rights violations, such as, "China lifted millions out of poverty."President Xi and his government are assaulting human rights on a scale unprecedented in decades. Your administration's actions and responses will be critical to halting and possibly reversing that crisis. Our organizations look forward to working with you and your administration in this urgent undertaking.Load-Date: February 19, 2021End of Document

CAN CHINA BECOME THE AI SUPERPOWER?States News ServiceJanuary 12, 2021 TuesdayCopyright 2021 States News ServiceLength: 1965 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: LONDON BodyThe following information was released by Chatham House:Since 2017 China has pursued an ambitious national strategy to develop artificial intelligence-driven governance tools. Progress has been swift but there remain deeper questions about how AI might change Chinese society.Ben HortonCommunications Manager, Communications and PublishingProfessor Jinghan ZengProfessor of China and International Studies, Lancaster UniversityAt what point did China decide that it wanted to invest heavily in AI development, and what has been driving this process within China?Jinghan Zeng: Since the 1980s the Chinese government has maintained a keen interest in e-government as a way of improving its governance capacity. Since then it has sought to use cutting-edge digital technology to better equip the civil service and has expended a lot of effort to learn from the technological innovations of the West. Over time China has adapted these innovations to its mode of governance, from the development of the 'Great Firewall' to incorporating the power of big data into bureaucratic processes. And now, more recently, we are seeing attention turn to the potential of artificial intelligence.2017 is the pivotal year in China's ambition to become the AI global superpower. Before this there were efforts to invest in AI at the provincial government level or in discrete industrial sectors, but they were minimal. In 2017 the Chinese government published its own 'New Generation AI Development Plan' which set out a three-step strategy to meet its aspirations for this technology. The first step was to achieve the same level of competency as leading countries, such as the United States, and to develop an industry worth at least RMB 150 billion by 2020. The second step is to become the country which regularly makes the major breakthroughs in AI, and develop an industry worth at least RMB 400 billion by 2025. For the final step, to be achieved by 2030, China aims to become the leading AI power with an industry worth at least RMB 1000 billion. The announcement gained a lot of traction and provided impetus to capital markets within China to invest in these technologies.Now, of course, this turn to AI is not solely a Chinese one. Since 2015 the AI governance shift has become a global phenomenon with many countries developing their own strategic plans for seizing the opportunities AI can offer. In the United States, for instance, in early 2019 President Donald Trump signed an executive order to establish the 'American AI Initiative', a move that has been mirrored in almost 50 other countries. So an element of international competition on the AI question may also be driving China's approach.How successfully has this strategy been implemented?Jinghan Zeng: The 2017 plan was primarily a way of mobilizing domestic actors to push forward innovation; since then many provincial governments have jumped onto the AI bandwagon. More than 20 cities, including Beijing, Shanghai and Chongqing, have developed their own AI policies which aim to encourage companies to invest in AI development through a range of measures including tax reductions and entrepreneurship schemes. While this process may result in inefficiencies and the duplication of efforts, there is little doubt that since 2017 AI development has become a national public concern.In 2019 there was an overall fall in investment in AI and the COVID-19 pandemic has also put pressure on the Chinese economy, so it is possible that the ambitious targets set within the 2017 strategy may not be reached on time. However, as evidenced by the widespread adoption of AI technologies by provincial governments across China, the transition towards so-called 'intelligent government' has continued despite the economic slowdown.One example of this can be found in Guangdong, where the local government has used facial recognition technology to drastically streamline bureaucratic processes. Where before the application process to receive a commercial business licence took at least three days, an AI-driven approach to identity verification has reduced the wait to just ten minutes. Similar innovations have also sped up processes in the banking and transport industries.Elsewhere, police forces have demonstrated the value of AI in the fight against child trafficking, where technology is used to create detailed images of how a missing child might look five years later. This example has been prominently promoted by the Chinese government as a way of demonstrating the positive influence of AI. While the privacy trade-off is rarely acknowledged, the benefits in terms of convenience and security are constantly emphasized.Why does China's socio-political context make it uniquely well-placed to seize the opportunities afforded by AI?Jinghan Zeng: The first thing to note is the Chinese political system. China has been leading in the development of, for example, AI-driven facial recognition technologies partly because there are fewer legal barriers to this sort of work than in the United States or United Kingdom. Of course, on some level, the security services in those countries have been experimenting with facial recognition, but this has been heavily criticized by society at large. The COVID-19 crisis has provided crucial momentum for China's AI strategy. As has been demonstrated across the world, in order to prevent the transmission of the virus you must have tight controls on the movement of the population. Countries like China and South Korea have pioneered different kinds of smartphone apps to identify the movements of their populations. In the West, this form of contact tracing was accompanied by public debate about the use, processing and storage of that data. While in the UK, for example, we have seen much public criticism of the government on this question, in China people have received contact tracing technology far more positively, seeing it as a necessary trade-off in exchange for improved health outcomes.Public debates have not shaped the national agenda on AI within China. The government has a strong will to strengthen its control over society by using these technologies and, relative to the West, there is less social resistance to practices such as mass surveillance. There is some concern voiced over privacy or abuse of data, but these concerns are directed at how the private sector uses AI, not the government. That's a critical difference: the government has attempted to highlight positive AI stories in order to shape public perceptions of the technology. Additionally, Chinese public-private sector relations are also very different. Major corporations such as Alibaba or Baidu have to work very closely with the government in order to continue to conduct this sort of technological development, whereas US tech giants have more autonomy over how they conduct business, Apple's continuous refusal to cooperate with the FBI on unlocking phones being one example. There are serious adverse consequences that incentivize Chinese public-private collaboration.Can we expect to see China successfully exporting these new technologies? Or will privacy and security concerns prevent this?Jinghan Zeng: In the past certain countries have been keen to adopt Chinese governance technologies, for example Russia and Iran's interest in the 'Great Firewall' system. And I think that from a technological point of view, leaving aside the politics for now, Chinese-developed AI governance tools could well be attractive to buyers in other countries. However, if you bring in politics and ideology then that is a different matter. I cannot see how countries in the West could import Chinese systems or apps, not least because of national security concerns such as those we've seen with Huawei and 5G.But as we have discussed, China is uniquely well-placed to develop advanced AI technologies, given the vast population they can draw on to provide data to pursue the machine learning model. So, while for political reasons we may not see these tools adopted by European or North American states, we could absolutely see governments which are more willing to sacrifice individual privacy for greater control over their populations take an interest in exchange.What are the risks for the Chinese government in implementing this AI strategy?Jinghan Zeng: The first thing I think we have to understand is why China wants to become an AI superpower in the first place; the answer to this is primarily economic. The Chinese government derives much of its domestic legitimacy from boosting economic growth and raising its population's living standards. The typical approach to achieving this is through mobilizing domestic actors at the national level with high-profile announcements and ambitious targets, such as those included in the AI strategy. In contrast to the western market-based approach to economic innovation, however, this Chinese model risks considerable wastage and inefficiency, and puts the burden of innovation on the government's own resources. If the strategy fails to achieve its aims then the economic costs could be considerable.Beyond this efficiency concern, there is the much larger question of the social transformation which AI could instigate within China. For instance, very little thought has yet been put into the consequences of mass unemployment due to AI-enabled automation. A recent McKinsey report predicted that by 2030 between 400-800 million people across the world will be forced to find new professions due to automation. As China's population accounts for approximately 12% of the global workforce, they could carry the heaviest burden of this transformation. Above all, the Chinese Communist Party values social stability, but the potential disruption to the existing social order that AI promises has not yet been addressed. Some argue that AI will create a world where labour is no longer the responsibility of humans, but even if that vision is realized further questions remain about how to pursue a meaningful life without work. By aiming for AI superpower status China is accepting the risk that their society will bear the brunt of any downsides to AI experimentation, while potential competitors in the West take a more circumspect route towards the adoption of these technologies.Looking ahead, do you think China will realize its ambition of becoming an AI superpower?Jinghan Zeng: Only the United States and China have the resources to compete for predominance. China's advantage can be found in its vast internal market, which provides developers with unparalleled datasets with which to train AI technologies. But the United States has a considerable head start in developing the technologies themselves.The Chinese state approach towards AI may contribute to the fact that China lacks genuine innovations in the field, especially those that are appreciated by the market. Questions remain about the extent to which China's AI investment can turn into something that the global market will buy into. This is one of the key reasons why investment in China's AI industry declined in 2019.In addition, China's open AI ambition has alarmed its near competitors, especially in the US and Europe. Here, geopolitics including the current US-China tension and China's nationalistic tone is unhelpful to China's AI progress. Global cooperation in AI is vital to ensuring that these technologies are used in ways that benefit humanity. The geopolitical competition driving AI development is an unwelcome impediment to realising this, and could hamper China's superpower intentions.This interview draws on Jinghan Zeng's article, 'Artificial intelligence and China's authoritarian governance', which was published in the November 2020 issue of International Affairs.Load-Date: January 13, 2021End of Document

Chief Of World-Renowned Medical Journal Has Repeatedly Bashed US, Praised China For Coronavirus ResponseThe Daily CallerMarch 5, 2021 Friday 01:29 AM ESTCopyright 2021 The Daily Caller, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: DAILY-CALLER-NEWS-FOUNDATION; usLength: 1627 wordsByline: Chuck Ross, Investigative Reporter, chuck@dailycaller.comChuck Ross is a reporter at The Daily Caller.Author ImageBodyLink to Image• The editor of The Lancet, one of the world's leading medical journals, has a long history of praising the Chinese government, including during the coronavirus pandemic. • Richard Horton's pro-China and anti-U.S. remarks were used in a Facebook ad sponsored by CGTN, the Chinese state-controlled TV network. • In 2015, Horton received a Friendship award from China's State Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs, which recruited scientists and experts to help China's technological advancement. • The Beijing-controlled agency contributed funding to several studies published in The Lancet. One of China Global Television Network's most recent ads on Facebook is of an interview that the state-controlled propaganda network conducted about the coronavirus pandemic with the editor of The Lancet, one of the world's top medical journals.The editor, Richard Horton, largely praised the Chinese government's response to the pandemic while blasting the U.S. in the May 2020 interview, which garnered around 900,000 impressions at a cost of around $500, according to Facebook data.“I think we have a great deal to thank China for, about the way that it handled the outbreak,” Horton said in the interview.Horton, who is British, also criticized U.S. politicians for “being so openly critical” of China and the World Health Organization.“The U.S. has wasted the whole of February and early March, said Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of The Lancet,” reads the caption from CGTN, which the U.S. government requires to register as a foreign agent of China.“He said it is disappointing to see American politicians giving credence to conspiracy theories and promoting unproven treatments,” the CGTN caption also said.Horton's remarks may not be a surprise given his past praise for Beijing.In 2015, China's State Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs (SAFEA) gave Horton its Friendship Award for his “enthusiastic support for China's construction” and for his “friendly co-operation.”Despite the bland bureaucratic name, the now-defunct SAFEA was the agency tasked with recruiting foreign experts and scientists to work for the Chinese government.It oversaw China's “Thousand Talents Program,” which the Chinese government has allegedly used to steal trade and military secrets from companies and governments in the U.S. and other Western countries.On Sept. 13, 2019, federal prosecutors in New York indicted Zhongsan Liu, an official with the China Association for International Exchange of Personnel, which was the foreign arm of SAFEA, on charges that he conspired to mislead U.S. immigration officials to obtain visas for Chinese government employees.An official with SAFEA was also named a co-conspirator in an espionage case in which a defense contractor was sentenced to 32 years in prison for selling cruise missile technology to the Chinese government.SAFEA also worked to recruit experts to help develop China's health care system.Horton wrote for the Lancet in November 2016 that SAFEA invited the journal earlier that year to a conference on China's health system.In March 2016, a website for China's State Council Information Office, its foreign propaganda agency, reported that Horton had attended a symposium for SAFEA and contributed to a report released to the Chinese government.SAFEA helped fund several studies that appeared in The Lancet, one in October 2015, another that same month, and one more in December 2017.Meanwhile, Horton's remarks regarding the coronavirus pandemic - and China's response to it - carry significant weight, largely because of The Lancet's position as perhaps the world's premier medical journal. The journal partners with international health agencies, universities and nonprofit groups across the world to study a variety of health issues.Link to ImageScreen capture of CGTN ad on Facebook of an interview with Lancet editor Richard HortonIts influence was on display in May 2020 when the journal published a study that said the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine caused serious illness when used to treat coronavirus. The World Health Organization (WHO) paused a clinical trial of the drug in response to the findings.But the saga proved embarrassing for The Lancet after other researchers pointed to significant flaws in the data used for the research. (RELATED: Medical Journal Retracts Study That Claims Hydroxychloroquine Is Dangerous)The journal was forced to retract the study, leading to a wave of negative media coverage.In July, the journal partnered with Jeffrey Sachs to form the Lancet COVID-19 Commission.Like Horton, Sachs has a history of taking pro-Beijing positions on trade and health issues. He served as an adviser for a Chinese government economic committee in 2001 and 2002 and advised the United Nations until 2018, according to his resume.One member of the Lancet commission is Peter Daszak, a zoologist who was the only American on a WHO mission to investigate the origins of the virus in Wuhan last month.Both Sachs and Daszak dismissed a theory that the virus began as a leak from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Some U.S. officials have asserted that the virus may have started from a leak and that the Chinese government has covered it up in order to avoid embarrassment.Though the WHO and the Lancet COVID-19 Commission have said that they will investigate all origin theories without bias, both Daszak and Sachs long ago dismissed the possibility of a lab leak.In February 2020, Daszak organized more than two dozen scientists to sign a letter published in The Lancet that called the lab leak hypothesis a “conspiracy theory.” In September, Sachs called the theory “dangerous.”Chinese government officials have also publicly denied the lab leak theory.WATCH:Horton's pro-China remarks both before and during the pandemic have made him popular with China's media agencies and the government.The friendship medal he received in September 2015 is the “highest prize” that the Chinese government awards to foreign experts, according to China's State Council.In 2014, Horton met with Li Bin, a Communist party official who oversaw China's National Health and Family Planning Commission, the agency that enforced China's “one child” policy.The government began rolling back the policy in 2013.Horton has appeared multiple times during the pandemic on China's propaganda news networks, including CGTN.In a July 17, 2020, interview with CGTN, Horton said it was “completely wrong” to say that China failed to warn the rest of the world early on in the pandemic.“China is not the problem, and WHO is not the problem,” he said.Horton's comments in other venues have been picked up by China's state-controlled media.In April 2020, Horton called President Donald Trump's threats to pull funding from WHO because of its close relationship with China a “crime against humanity.” President Trump's decision to defund WHO is simply this-a crime against humanity. Every scientist, every health worker, every citizen must resist and rebel against this appalling betrayal of global solidarity. https://t.co/7hTwUZ4lJV - richard horton (@richardhorton1) April 14, 2020CGTN, published a story based on Horton's comments, as did the state-controlled Global Times and China Plus, an affiliate of the state-owned China Radio International.In an interview this month, Horton denied that China “deliberately lied” to the international community in the early days of the pandemic and said that the world owes China a “debt of gratitude” for how it handled the outbreak.He accused other countries of “xenophobia” and “racism” for blaming China for the outbreak.“It's very easy to blame another country to deflect responsibility from your own government,” he said.WATCH: Horton's emphatic defense of China's pandemic response puts him at odds with other health experts who have said that Beijing withheld key information about the virus early on in the outbreak. Chinese government officials have also released misinformation aimed at deflecting blame for the virus.Chinese authorities continued to claim through at least mid-January 2020 that the coronavirus from Wuhan was not transmissible between people.That assurance prompted the WHO on Jan. 14, 2020, to tweet the now-debunked claim that the virus did not spread through human-to-human contact.Chinese government operatives also pushed false theories in mid-March 2020 that the U.S. military created the virus and released it in China.Horton has offered some slight criticism of how local Chinese authorities responded to the virus outbreak in Wuhan.In his book “The COVID-19 Catastrophe,” Horton wrote that “there are legitimate questions the Chinese government must answer. There is a gap in the timeline of the pandemic outbreak.”He also questioned whether local officials told Beijing about the outbreak, and whether Beijing was “complicit in playing down the significance of the outbreak.”Horton also questioned why the Chinese government told the WHO on Jan. 11, 2020, that new cases of COVID-19 hadn't been detected since Jan. 3.Despite that critique, Horton said in his interview last month that he did not believe that the Chinese government “deliberately lied to the international community.”He said local officials “took steps that were completely designed to suppress discussion of the outbreak,” but asserted that that was “very different from saying that the government deliberately tried to mislead the international community.”The Lancet did not respond to a request for comment.Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Center For Strategic & International Studies Issues Public Comment on Department of Commerce RuleTargeted News ServiceMarch 29, 2021 Monday 8:46 AM  ESTCopyright 2021 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1900 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON, March 29 -- James A. Lewis, senior vice president and the director of the Technology and Public Policy Program at the Center For Strategic and International Studies, has issued a public comment on the Department of Commerce rule entitled "Securing the Information and Communications Technology and Services Supply Chain". The comment was posted on March 25, 2021:* * *We have entered the age of digital distrust. The United States is now in a conflict with China because of decisions by Xi Jinping's government. It is not primarily a competition in weapons building or arms races but for ascendancy and control in the economic and technological spheres.It is also a political contest between two very different systems, and this is China's greatest weakness given that its one-party state depends on a blend of Chinese nationalism and Leninist political techniques that make it unattractive. Espionage and intelligence collection are a major part of this conflict, crucial for China's plans for achieving technological supremacy, and a major national security threat to eh United States.A 2020 Survey of Chinese espionage by CSIS found 152 publicly reported instances of Chinese espionage directed at the United States since 2000. This did not include espionage against U.S. firms or persons located in China, nor an additional 50 cases involving attempts to smuggle munitions or controlled technologies from the U.S. to China. The Survey does not include more than 1200 intellectual property theft cases brought by U.S. companies against Chinese entities.Senior American officials have repeatedly stated that China's espionage efforts exceed in scope and scale what was seen in the Cold War. This is because global digital networks and technologies provide immense new opportunities for espionage that China has taken advantage of two decades.The question posed by the ICTS rule is whether there are transactions in digital technologies or services that could expand risk in this contest and whether they should be allowed or prohibited.An immediate conclusion is that not all transactions with China should be banned simply because the other party is Chinese. Most transactions do not create risk to national security. In assessing the risk of China as a supplier of ICTS, we can start by asking whether Chinese goods or services create intelligence advantage for China or an unhealthy dependency on Chinese suppliers. The latter question suggests that it is always preferable for the U.S. to support a diverse supply chain (and diverse does not mean that all suppliers must be located in the US).This should be a goal for U.S. policy. A good goal for regulation is to build safeguards for a connected global economy now that China is an opponent.There is always risk comes from buying items that are digitally connected to China over global networks, since there is a high likelihood that China exploits or will consider exploiting such devices or services for espionage purposes. China engages in massive domestic digital surveillance and it would be naive to assume that it does not extend this surveillance to foreign targets. China's laws give its agencies untrammeled access to networks and data from Chinese companies and take precedent over any other law or commitment. But if a device cannot "call home" to China or does not connect to global networks, this risk is low. We can consider six measures to assess the degree of risk created by using Chinese ICTS:1. Is the technology connected to or is the service operated or managed from servers or networks in China?2. To what data does the Chinese product or service have access?3. Where is the data stored?4. Who controls or owns the data5. Who are the users of the products or services6. What is the treatment of U.S. companies offering similar products in China?These measures have significant implications for allowing Chinese online services to operate in the U.S. The fundamental questions are what data does the service collect and what opportunities for access to networks or devices does using the service create. For example, use of TikTok, the popular short music video service, poses little risk after moving the storage of Americans' Personally Identifiable Information (PII) outside of China. Risk from the use of TikTok's updater service or device access exists (along the lines of what we have seen in SolarWinds), but is manageable if TikTok relies on western third party cloud services or security providers and because TikTok's young audience is not of intelligence value (although this risk may increased as TikTok's user base change. In contrast, TikTok offering ecommerce services in the U.S. creates a higher degree of risk for sensitive PII (including financial information).WeChat poses a similar problem. WeChat is managed and operated from China by a Chinese company subject to China's national laws. Its app is a fundamental part of Chinese digital life, but its users are subject to constant surveillance by Chinese security agencies. The majority of WeChat users in the U.S. are Chinese nationals. While they are the targets of surveillance and propaganda by the Chinese state, the risk of allowing them to use the app in the U.S. is low.Some Chinese services, like AliPay or WeChat Pay, are essential for commercial transactions in China. A blanket ban on their use damages American companies operating in China. For example, most Chinese use these digital payment mechanisms and the use of cash is shrinking. A Chinese citizen who sought to purchase food from an American fast food chain outlet in China would be blocked from undertaking making the transaction. This creates economic harm for the U.S. without corresponding benefit to national security. In contrast, their use in the U.S. by American nationals is high. A Chinese national temporarily in the U.S. who brings services like AliPay in on their devices does not pose national security risk. A U.S. person who install it or a similar service eon their device is now subject to Chinese government surveillance and, likely, data collectionChina's skilful efforts to make the RMB the global reserve currency are linked to the use of its central bank digital currency and to its digital payment systems. Anyone who uses these systems is unavoidably subject to Chinese government surveillance. But any regulation or restriction must be carefully designed. Blocking individuals from using a Chinese service in China is counterproductive; blocking American citizen from using Chinese services in the U.S. is justified. Some previous implementations of ICTS regulations, as drafted, did not clearly make this distinction.We can envision complex technical exploitation strategies where having a Chinese service on an American citizen's device creates opportunities for intelligence collection, but this is part of a cybersecurity problem. Chinese actors appear to have little trouble accessing American data and devices even if these do no use Chinese services or were made in China. Similarly, allowing Chinese telecom companies to have a point of presence in the U.S. may not create unmanageable risk if adequate cybersecurity measure are in place (usually they are not). The use of Chinese owned and operated cloud services or undersea cable services operated by Chinese companies creates almost unmanageable risk.Similarly hardware products if they are connected to servers in China, create espionage risk. A drone or camera connected to China over the internet allows the possibility of intelligence exploitation. This risk is not hypothetical. In other cases, such as subway cars, where there are serious trade concerns resulting from China's predatory practice, such as the use of non-WTO compliant subsidies, there is only national security risk in using a Chinese-made subway car if it is in someway digitally connected directly back to China, perhaps for operational updates or remote management.China has recently banned its official from using cars made by Tesla because it fears that the data collected by Tesla's inboard sensors could be sent back to the U.S. and exploited for intelligence purposes. The Chinese government assumes, incorrectly, that the U.S. has authorities for collection similar to those it possesses and the use of American products or services by Chinese citizens creates similar risk. This "mirror imaging" is a useful indicator of how China itself actually behaves itself, but it reflects a profound misunderstanding by the CCP of American law and the independence of action America companies possess under the law, something that would never happen in China.It is not worth trying to persuade the CCP of this difference, but it is useful to make the point in demanding better treatment for American companies operating in China or offering services to Chinese citizen. When a Chinese citizen buys fast food from an American chain using a digital payment system, he or she is not subject to American surveillance. Appeals to Snowden revelations do not contradict this and we should not accept arguments for equivalence. This is important for making the case that it is China's deviation from international norms and practices that is the source of the problems and the preferable fix is not decoupling but a verifiable compliance by China with these norms and practices.ICTS raises larger issues of data protection, content controls, taxes, privacy, and the regulation of network services operated by companies located outside of America jurisdiction. All economies face these problems. Ideally, there would be some global solution, but we have only begun to adjust to a global digital economy and in any case, the CCP is more likely to compete than to cooperate in the development of global rules.We cannot yet predict the outcome of the contest with China, although the trend points to increased tension and conflict, and this means an increased risk from the use of certain Chinese technologies. Unfortunately, the logical conclusion about China's behavior is that network connected digital goods or services produced China or operated by Chinese companies create unavoidable risk.However, not all transactions create risk. If sensitive data is not exposed or it China does not gain the potential for increased access to sensitive data, the risk from a transaction is low. Better cybersecurity and tailored regulation can reduce risk. Effect regulations can mitigate risk without the need for a complete bifurcation of supply chains. Bifurcation may be where we end up, although there is a chance, albeit a decreasing on, that China will change its policies. In the interim, the goals should be to use incremental and minimal regulation (combined better cybersecurity). A balanced approach could reduce and manage risk while minimizing harm to America companies from premature or overly expansive regulation.* * *The rule can be viewed at: https://www.regulations.gov/document/DOC-2019-0005-0073TARGETED NEWS SERVICE (founded 2004) features non-partisan 'edited journalism' news briefs and information for news organizations, public policy groups and individuals; as well as 'gathered' public policy information, including news releases, reports, speeches.

More than 92 million young adults in China live alone and have no intention of changing that. Now the Chinese government is stepping in.InsiderMarch 10, 2021 Wednesday 09:48 AM GMTCopyright 2021 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 556 wordsByline: Cheryl TehBody• The idea of "empty nest youth" in China being a "threat to society" has sparked an online debate on popular social networking platform Weibo.• Statistics released by the Chinese government indicate that around 15 million more Chinese singles have opted to live alone over the last 3 years. • Debate is swirling around whether these singles are doing so by choice, or due to circumstances beyond their control.• Visit Insider's homepage for more stories."Being single and living alone is not a mortal sin. If it were, then 92 million of us are going to hell." These were the sentiments of a 29-year-old woman who goes by the online handle Baobao. Baobao lives in Guangzhou and is a self-professed "single for life." She is among the 92 million young people in China that live alone. Statistics released by the Chinese government last week indicate that around 15 million more singles live alone now than in 2018. Young Chinese people like Baobao are termed "empty-nest" youth - as they are, by choice or otherwise - living alone, without seeking out romantic relationships, getting married, or having children. This has become a hot topic on Chinese social networking site Weibo, where 2.9 billion people have read about and weighed in on the matter. In the last 24 hours, there have been more than 1.8 million comment threads and counting.This trend prompted Chinese official Hu Wei to suggest at this year's National People's Congress (China's annual political conference) that political departments pay more attention to the "marriage and love issues of the empty-nest youths" by providing them with "services related to their physical and mental health." Concerns have also arisen that this phenomenon could hurt China's birth rate, according to a People.cn article. Chinese news site Dazhong did a poll of its readers to find out why there was an uptick in singles opting into the "empty nest life." Around 41% of those polled cited the main reason as being "actively choosing to be single, and tiring of useless romantic entanglements." Another 38% said being an "empty nest youth" was also a choice made by those "escaping from the responsibilities of starting a family." Meanwhile, 13% of poll respondents said that they were forced to live alone due to "life and economic pressures," while around 7% said it was because they were "unable to find true love."But what do young Chinese think about the "empty nest youth" phenomenon? There are conflicting views on the matter. "With so many dating apps, there's no reason why you should be single. You're either very short, very ugly, or completely broke. Think of your family and the shame it brings them to have a son who can't find a wife," said HuTaoPuTao, a 28-year-old Weibo user living in Beijing.But others think that whether you have chosen the "empty nest" life (or if the empty nest life has chosen you) - one should be left to live their life as they please. "Why do I need the burden of a wife and a child when I'm happy on my own?" said YouyouZi, 33, from Nanjing. "I do not feel like a disgrace. We live in a new world now." "It's the 21st century. I work hard, play hard, and have tons of money," said Shanghainese Weibo user WuXi, 31. "If I want to live and die alone as a leftover woman with twenty cats, it's no one's business but mine." Read the original article on Load-Date: March 11, 2021End of Document

Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Friday, February 12th.Your top stories right now, 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.Challenging China. Will President Biden get tough on China's bad behavior? The president now warning that China could, quote, eat our lunch if the left unchecked, something he totally dismissed back in 2019, as the Communist Party continues to steal intellectual property, bully its neighbors and it moves to supplant the United States as the number one superpower.We have now learned that the BBC is banned now from broadcasting in China after reporting on the treatment of the Uighurs in Chinese camps. We'll follow this all morning long, coming up.Then a scandal in New York state. An aid for Governor Cuomo says that his office purposely withheld data about nursing home mortality numbers to hide it from the feds. We are following this shocking story all morning long.Let's take a look at markets this morning. We are expecting a decline at the start of trading as markets pull back from a record-setting session yesterday. The Dow Industrials down 25, the Nasdaq down 14, and the S&P 500 lower by 6.5.This after a record day on Wall Street yesterday where the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 notched all-time highs. The Dow finished slightly lower but we are beginning with the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 this morning in unchartered territory.Stimulus showdown. House Democrats dig in on $15 an hour minimum wage as Speaker Pelosi is promising that it will be in the next relief package. The crypto craze. More companies following suit and allowing Bitcoin transactions as one major city may pay its workers in digital assets.And the classiest Valentine's Day ever. How you and your beau can spend a night all alone in your favorite dive bar. It's making a buzz this morning. We'll tell you all about it.MORNINGS WITH MARIA is live right now.European markets slightly mixed this morning. Take a look. FT 100 up 5, the CAC quarante up 11, the DAX index is lower by 59.Economic data out of the U.K. The U.K. contracted by 9.9 percent in the year 2020 according to Office for National Statistics. This is the largest contraction on record. GDP grew by 1 percent last quarter.In Asia overnight markets mostly closed for the Lunar holiday. Japan as open and it finished fractionally lower on the Nikkei average.Some of the top stories that we are watching this morning.Examining the GameStop phenomenon. The Justice Departments and the San Francisco U.S. attorney seeking information from brokers and social media companies to determine if manipulation took place or other types of criminal misconduct and whether it played a part in the recent retail short-selling frenzy. This as Massachusetts regulators have subpoenaed the man known as Roaring Kitty (ph), who was seen as one of the driving force behind that surge.Disney Plus proving to be a major plus for Disney as the pandemic has all but shuttered the Magic Kingdom's other businesses. Big surprise upside with 95 million users now subscribing to the streaming service. This is up 21 million from just in this quarter. The announcement coming alongside a surprise quarterly profit. The profit of $17 million exceeded expectations and Disney shares are up one and two-thirds percent.Democrats are digging in on their punish to increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi promising the wage hike will be included in the next coronavirus relief package. This as the House Financial Services Committee approves a proposal to give airlines another $14 billion in payroll assistance as part of that aid package.Well, Republicans are calling for New York Governor Andrew Cuomo to be removed from office after one of his aides admitted to covering up data on nursing home deaths. This reportedly happened during a video call with state Democrats. The aide says they hid the true numbers out of fear of the feds finding out. Cuomo sent 9,000 COVID patients back into nursing homes. A number 40 percent higher than originally reported. Are reported 15,000 people died in New York state nursing homes. All of this coming as Governor Cuomo is supposed to visit the White House today to meet with President Biden about his American rescue plan. We'll have more on this bombshell report coming up this morning.And Former President Trump's legal team is set to begin its rebuttal in today's impeachment trial. The Democrat case managers have spent the last two days arguing that Trump's words and actions directly instigated the Capitol Hill riot on January 6th. We are told that the former president's legal team may only use one of the two days allotted for their rebuttal, meaning that the Senate could vote or can -- to convict or acquit as early as today or this weekend.Futures pointing to a lower opening for the broader averages this morning after another record day yesterday. Take a look, Dow Industrials down 21, the Nasdaq down 12, the S&P lower by 5 points.Big tech helping push the Nasdaq to an all-time high yesterday while the S&P 500 also notched a ninth record close in 2021.Joining me right now is Fairlead Strategies Founder and managing partner Katie Stockton.And back with us all morning is Liz Peek and Dagen McDowell.Great to see everybody this morning.Katie, thanks very much for being here.What are the charts telling you right now about this record-setting performance for the markets?KATIE STOCKTON, FOUNDER AND MANAGING PARTNER, FAIRLEAD STRATEGIES: Hey, it's really been amazing. This month alone we've seen the S&P 500 up more than 5 percent. So I think investors are reasonably wondering if this is sustainable, especially at a time when we have weak seasonal influences, February and March don't tend to be great months of the year.And if you recall, of course, last year it was February 24th that we got down and saw very, very significant corrections. So there's a lot of unease out there and at the same time we're seeing big, big, steep up moves in risk assets, right? Small caps outperforming. That steep up move doesn't look sustainable here in the near-term. Bitcoin prices would be another good example of that kind of steep price action.And it usually is resolved in somewhat dramatic fashion. So for a short- term perspective, I do think that there's rest of a pullback broadly speaking in these risk assets. And when you look at measures like the 50 day moving averages, that's a great gage of downside risk and where we might start to think about adding exposure again. That's where the S&P 500 held up in January during its very brief pullback. And for the most part, these 50 day moving averages are several percent below current levels. For the S&P 500, it's maybe 4 percent. But for the Russell 2000 Index, which is small caps in its focus, it's about 10 percent. So we do think that there is some heightened risk here and we're watching very closely those short- term momentum gages, which as it stands, even with this morning's weakness, are still positive.BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, you could also look at the junk bond markets to also get a sense of where the risk is and why people -- and how people are going out on that risk curving pretty aggressively.Katie, talk more about the VIX index, that volatility index, amid heightened uncertainty. What are you seeing now and does that tell you anything in terms of what's ahead?STOCKTON: Well, the VIX is somewhat cyclical. And I'd say right now we're in sort of a high volatility regime with a floor around 20. We call that support. And as long as that 20 support level holds on sort of a consecutive closing basis, we would say that there's still risk of another volatility spike.I think that the spike that we saw last year during the coronavirus driven correction, that spike has kind of dwarfed all the other VIX spikes that we've seen. But indeed they can last for a week or two and really be pretty damaging. So we're bracing for that kind of action in the VIX as a contrarian indication for the equity indices. Right now it's kind of sitting around 21, 22 and it is indeed oversold.BARTIROMO: Liz Peek, jump in.LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Katie, good morning.Question for you. Let's look at the other side. What drives the market to a new high here? I mean we already have good news on the vaccine, pretty clear that we're going to get a big stimulus bill, earnings season is almost over, it was pretty good, what -- what could really be the sort of propulsion that moves the market to a new high?STOCKTON: I think it very simply, it's fear of missing out. So as a technician, I really focus on market psychology. And it's -- it's really about expectations. And now, more than ever, with all of these breakouts that have occurred and all these risk assets, I think folks feel like they might miss out if they don't just go ahead and get onboard with it and just buy into strength. And that's indeed what's already happened. It's what could keep a floor underneath the market. And I think a lot of people have made a lot of more probably in the past month or so with some of these trades on a short-term basis.And yet, you know, situations like the GameStop, you know, spike and retracement, those are a little bit of a reality check, I would say, for folks that did very well in January. No we're seeing some, I guess, chinks in the armor of the market. Look at Tesla for one, that loss of short-term momentum is very real there. And, of course, that has a big footprint in the major indices.So I think it's really fear of missing out that has been driving it. That could continue to do so. But we'll just be very, very respectful of short- term momentum.PEEK: Thank you.BARTIROMO: All right, Katie, we'll be watching. Great insights from you, as always. Thank you so much.Katie Stockton joining us there on what the charts are telling us.STOCKTON: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Much more ahead this morning.Coming up, Governor Cuomo under pressure. New York Congressman Tom Read is here to discuss that bombshell report surrounding nursing home deaths in the empire state. What the governor's office may have known. We'll also talk about economic issues in New York with the congressman.Then crypto going mainstream. More companies look to allow Bitcoin for transactions. Will even more follow? We'll talk about it when we come right back. Don't miss a moment of it.You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Cuomo's COVID catastrophe. A top aid to the New York governor reportedly apologizing to Democrat lawmakers on a video call for under reporting the state's nursing home COVID death toll because they were worried about the feds finding out. New records show that the governor sent more than 9,000 COVID patients back into nursing homes. That is 40 percent higher than originally reported. The controversy pushing New York Congressman Lee Zeldin to call on the Department of Justice to investigate.Meanwhile, Governor Cuomo visits the White House today with other governors and mayors to discuss President Biden's American rescue plan for COVID relief.Joining me right now is New York Congressman, Problem Solver's Caucus co- chairman, and House Ways and Means Committee member, Tom Reed.Congressman, it's good to see you. Thanks very much for joining us.Your reaction to this news from Governor Cuomo's aide?REP. TOM REED (R-NY): Well, I will tell you, now we have Governor Cuomo's second in command essentially on a taped confession to fellow Democrat lawmakers admitting she committed criminal activity to cover-up for what they were hiding from the federal officials that were responsible to get to the bottom of this, and make sure that skilled nursing homes and nursing home themselves that we learned what happened with the COVID-19 positive order that sent 15,000 people to their death that Cuomo issued back in March.This, obviously, cannot go unaccounted for. And that's why we were arguing this in the committee yesterday when we were demanding that transparency and accountability be part of this COVID-19 package. But, most importantly, the days of Cuomo are going to be numbered in Albany here. But, most importantly, we need to start with this second in command. I'm demanding -- I'm going to be looking at filing a personal criminal complaint against this individual, today, in local court -- in local law enforcement offices, as well as federal offices, because she needs to be arrested today.BARTIROMO: Well, she -- she's saying that -- that the group hid it and didn't report the transparent numbers. Why is she taking the brunt of it, she's going to be arrested? I mean who else was involved and what was behind this decision to send COVID patients to nursing homes?REED: That was Governor Cuomo's order that was in effect for 46 days that killed 15,000 of our fellow New Yorkers.BARTIROMO: Wow.REED: Now, Governor Cuomo needs to be held to account. But I'm going to not -- I'm going to make sure every person who needs to be held to account and be held for justice for those 15,000 souls is -- is held in -- in regards to their activity. And she openly confessed, in a taped confession, to engaging in criminal activity by hiding this from federal authorities that were responsible to making sure this data was accurate. She is a criminal actor here. So I'm going after her right now. But don't make any mistake about it, Governor Cuomo will be held to account. And this is where it starts. And thank God we are getting to the bottom of this COVID disaster that Governor Cuomo ordered 15,000 New York residents to their death.BARTIROMO: Well, and we just learned that it's 15,000 yesterday, right? I mean new numbers were released on Wednesday. Just Wednesday we learned that it was actually 15,000 seniors in nursing homes and assisted living facilities who died of this virus and they told us that it was 9,000 originally reported. Obviously, she admitted this.Why did she admit it? Tell us how this all came about and how you finally realized that there was this massive cover-up going on.REED: Because we didn't give up. We, as a team, from Steve Scalise, Lee Zeldin, Elise Stefanik, we have been holding the governor to account. Janice Dean -- God bless Janice Dean. I was in her living room when this report came down, celebrating the fact that finally the angels are speaking and demanding justice be done.And I will tell you, we are going to get to the bottom of this and that's where the attorney general, the Democratic attorney general for New York, thank you. Thank you for doing your job. And I appreciate that. Because what she did is she started the cracks to unravel and now we're starting to see in the daylight that justice is being done. And let's get this second in command arrested, hopefully today, by filing this criminal complaint.And I will tell you, let us then pursue Governor Cuomo to the end. He's -- he's got a knack of throwing his people around him to take the responsibilities that he should be taking. And they're sitting in jail -- one of them right now is sitting in jail as we speak. But this is the problem. You know, when you're the leader, you should take responsibility and Governor Cuomo, it's coming to you, and you're going to answer for this, because 15,000 people died because of your order.BARTIROMO: Well, we -- and we haven't seen any accountability or admission here. When he did that press conference the other day, he just said, well, people died. That's what's important. Not necessarily an order to send these patients into nursing homes. So, yes, I mean a lot of people were upset by that press conference he gave.REED: And -- amen.BARTIROMO: Yes.REED: And, remember, it's Governor Cuomo's order that sent these people to their deaths in the nursing home. They sent COVID-19 positive patients into nursing homes where our seniors, who did not have COVID-19, were exposed to this virus for 46 days when the federal government said don't do this, when we, as elected officials at this time said don't do this you are going to kill people.BARTIROMO: Wow.REED: And you have this going around this state. And we'll get into that on another day.But I will tell you, accountability is coming.BARTIROMO: That's unbelievable.All right, let me ask you about the $15 an hour minimum wage. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reports that, look, it's going to be in next stimulus bill, if not in this $1.9 trillion stimulus. The Congressional Budget Office projects that the 2021 deficit will hit $2.3 trillion even before more relief is passed, Congressman.And we know that we're talking about $5 trillion at this point in stimulus thrown at this economy in a year. How can Democrats justify this kind of spending? Is it working? And I know that there's more money left from the CARES Act that hasn't been spent.REED: Maria, amen. And that's why we're -- we're -- we're willing to come to the table and talk to Democrats about a reasonable package. But we still have a trillion dollars unspent from money we've already approve. We just did $900 billion in December But I'm willing to be at the table to come up with a reasonable package and get this done.But, you know, the $15 minimum wage, this is the old D.C. game, right? They promised their progressives that they would put this in this, the AOC's, the Bernie Sanders', and look at the hood wink that's going on here. They're -- they're lying to their progressives to get their support for this package and they know that it's not going to be in this package.And I'll just tell you, I'm watching this thing unravel as we speak. And to President Biden, we're here to work with you. We want to solve this problem for you. I want to be part of the solution. I'm willing to sit at the table. Let's get vaccines, 160 billion. We've got bipartisan support for that right. It could pass today. Let's work out a deal that's reasonable. But $1.9 trillion with these extreme ideology, illegal immigrants getting benefits, you've got the $15 minimum wage that you're putting a marker down for. This is -- this is not the time to put this agenda of politicians into this mix. Focus on what the country needs and you'll have Republicans in spades joining you.BARTIROMO: Well, Congressman, before you go, I mean, we are seeing all of this spending. I know soon into it is going to come the revenue raise, and that is higher taxes. Here's what one analyst this morning at Cowen and Company is saying, expect an immediate pivot to Build Back Better recovery bill, $4 trillion in spending, including $2 trillion in tax increases.Congressman, how soon will we see a second bill which includes $2 trillion in tax increases in your view?REED: I don't know how you're going to get that through in regards to, you're going to have to do that on a bipartisan basis. And if that's the extreme policy that you're going to be proposing, I don't know how that's going to work.So these guys have to stand down, come back to reason, and also don't pacify the extremes. Extremism has taken over Washington. These (INAUDIBLE) down the -- now on the left, but it's been there on the right, and we're willing to stand up to it in regards to, calm down, let's come up with a compromise position.BARTIROMO: OK.All right, Congressman, it's good to see you. We'll be watching the developments.Thank you, sir.Congressman Tom Reed.We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Chinese censorship. China's government now taking the BBC, British Broadcasting Corporation, off of air permanently. This after a damming report on Beijing's handling of the coronavirus, the treatment of the Uighurs, minorities in concentration camps they say, Hong Kong's new national security laws. This is also partly in retaliation to Beijing's primary international news channel losing their license in the U.K.Liz, no surprise that the communist government will not allow any decenter speech whatever.PEEK: Yes. What does this reminded you of, Maria? Does it remind you of social media's treatment of conservatives in the United States? A little bit, right?BARTIROMO: It does. Yes.PEEK: But, look, other news organization have gotten into trouble in China over the past several years. The reality is, the Chinese government is autocratic. They will not allow any kind of criticism of their policies. And heaven knows they are -- they don't want to hear about human rights abuses. But I would also say, I think this is a little bit of a test of the Biden administration. I think the Biden administration, the Biden White House is going to be tested by China on several occasions now because I think they sense a weaker presence in the White House certainly than Donald Trump. This is not the last aggressive move we're going to see. This is not directed at the United States, built I think it's going to be very telling to watch these aggressive moves from China over the next several months.BARTIROMO: Yes. And we've already seen a lot of tests here for the Biden administration. I agree with you. I mean just the fact that Jack Ma was disappeared after he made critical comments about the financial regulatory framework or the push into Hong Kong or the sanctions on former Trump officials like the former secretary of state.Do you expect that the Biden presidency, anybody in the administration will come out and denounce these things?PEEK: I think it's going to be very hard for Joe Biden to not stand up to China. I also think it's going to be very difficult for him to stand up to China because one of the reasons that big business, the chamber of commerce crowd, backed the Biden presidency is they want to get rid of all the tensions between China and the United States, tensions that came out of trade -- the efforts to get a trade deal that was more fair to Americans workers. And I think we're just going to have a real tension here as the Biden administration tries to walk that fine line between -- basically not confronting China and making sure American businesses still want to do business there and are able to do so.BARTIROMO: Yes.PEEK: I think this is a tremendously dangerous situation.BARTIROMO: Yes, they're looking at the money.PEEK: That's right.BARTIROMO: They're looking at the growth story of 1.4 billion potential customers, Dagen.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: Shareholders at any corporation publicly traded should call out kowtowing and genuflecting by their executives who are trying to curry favor with the communist government of China, because you will see a whole lot of it. Pay attention to anybody in the administration what they have to say about China. Like, are they flattering to China? Why is the question? Is it to enrich themselves or their former business? Watch that.The -- what is the slogan at "The Washington Post," democracy dies in darkness. Well, communism flourishes in it.BARTIROMO: Yes. Absolutely.MCDOWELL: There is no such thing as truth telling in communism.BARTIROMO: That's right.Coming up, the fight for 15. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's new promise over the federal wage increase. That's coming up.And then President Biden's plan for reopening schools. That takes heat as the CDC gets ready to release new guidelines. Wait till you hear this, coming up.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Friday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Friday, February 12th.A look at markets this half an hour ahead of the opening bell. We are expecting a decline at the start of trading this morning in about an hour's time. Dow Industrials down 26, Nasdaq down 22, S&P lower by 7.25, pulling back from a record-setting performance yesterday.European markets this morning are mixed. The U.K. economy contracted by 9.9 percent in the year 2020. According to the office of national statistics, the largest contraction on record in the U.K. GDP did grow in the last quarter of the -- in the U.K. of the first quarter this year.European markets, as you could see, mixed. The FT 100 up 8, the CAC quarante up 17 but the DAX index is lower by 48. In Asia, most markets were closed for the lunar holiday overnight. It is now the year of the ox Happy Chinese New Year to all of those celebrating. In Japan the market was lower, down a fraction on the Nikkei average.Meanwhile this, President Joe Biden downsizing his school reopening plan as the CDC gets ready to release new guidelines.Cheryl Casone with the details.Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: That is right, Maria.President Biden disappointing parents across the country after the White House walks back his goal of reopening schools in his first 100 days. They're now saying they hope to have at least 50 percent of schools open for at least one day a week within that time. This as the CDC gets ready to release new guidance for school reopening, putting the focus on mitigation through masks and distancing over vaccination for teachers. Schools are also going to get color-coded zones based on transmission rates with blue being minimal, red being the most severe.Well, the Justice Department asking a federal appeals court to place a hold on proceedings surrounding the Trump administration's attempted ban on the social media app WeChat. This comes just one day after it asked a different court for a similar day that involves TikTok. DOJ says it needs time to review these proposed bans.Well, Robinhood expanding despite its recent trading debacle. The Menlo Park based company going to open new offices in New York and Seattle as it looks to scale up its business. Robinhood reached $3.4 billion in January in response to the surge in trading that eventually led them to restrict certain stocks like GameStop and AMC. Robinhood was expected to launch an IPO in the first quarter of this year, but those plans have been delayed.Finally this, interest in seven figure homes hitting a record high despite the COVID-related economic downtown. Redfin (ph) says more than 10 percent of home searches on the platform were for homes with the starting price at least a million dollars. Low mortgage rates and quickly rising home values during the past year have only helped with this trend, Maria.And those are your headlines ahead of this Valentine's Day weekend.Happy Valentine's Day, Maria. See you soon.BARTIROMO: And to you, Cheryl. Thank you so much.We are looking at the fight for 15 this morning. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is promising a federal $15 minimum wage, that it will be included in the House's proposed stimulus package, the next one. She also believes the relief bill will be passed by the end of the month and signed into law before March 14th when key unemployment programs are set to expire.Joining me right now is the senior editor at "The Federalist," Chris Bedford.Chris, it's great to see you today. Thanks very the much for joining us.So right now we are talking about the $1.9 trillion relief package. And Pelosi is saying this $15 minimum wage is going to be in the next package. That next package is also expected to include tax increases.Your expectations?CHRISTOPHER BEDFORD, SENIOR EDITOR, "THE FEDERALIST": The incredible amount of attention that this has not been getting from a huge amount of our media is really shocking to me considering how -- how massive and how far the implications reach on this kind of idea.Now, are $15 minimum wage, for example, might work just fine in a -- in a city like San Francisco, which Nancy Pelosi represents, but how is that going to work in a state like West Virginia, which Democratic Senator Joe Manchin represents? How is that going to work in some of the states that really don't need that, the cost of living is not that high and the economy can't power it?We saw the CBO come out with a study that said this would knock out 1.4 million jobs in just a few years. And we've seen a whole lot so far from this administration on jobs they want to get rid of but so far not a whole lot in jobs that they're actually going to create.My prediction on this is that some of the Democratic senators, that they need to get over the threshold for this might actually get cold feet on something like this.BARTIROMO: Well, we'll see about that. These executive orders have been talked about, particularly President Biden's rescinding President Trump's emergency order at the border yesterday saying no more American tax dollars will be used to build a border wall.Your reaction?BEDFORD: You know, especially given that school report we just heard on your show just a moment before, to come in here and say that because of coronavirus we're keeping our schools closed but because of Trump we're opening our border is a really difficult message to try and sell. None of this is particularly surprising. Joe Biden said he was going to do a lot of this. Bernie Sanders told us he was promised to get the most left wing administration since FDR. But the speed with which he's done it and the amount of attention it's gotten is somewhat surprising. And how this possibly can play with people whose kids are out of school, who see that the border is now open, that's difficult politics.BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean there's also this walk back on reopening schools as well. They want to have schools reopen 50 percent of them one day a week, Chris.BEDFORD: So we're already well beyond that level, well more than 50 percent of schools in America are open one day a week at least. So the idea that in 100 days we're going to be where we are now is -- or where we were earlier this year is not exactly a good metric.Now, we saw the White House start to walk that back a little bit. Just yesterday, in the press conference, kind of flip-flopped on it, where exactly they're trying to set these incredibly low standards. But for so many Americans who -- who need to have their kids in school, who, by the way, for a lot of people, their kids are at those schools. The only people who aren't there are the teachers. Now, this is a fight that's going to come to a head. Teachers unions versus American workers.BARTIROMO: So let's talk about the China threat. President Biden had a two- hour call with Xi Jinping yesterday. He is now warning that China is making serious advancements in transportation, giving it an advantage over the United States. This following that phone call with President Xi Jinping.But these recent comments contradicted remarks made in May of 2019 where he dismissed the idea that China posed a competitive threat to the United States.Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (May 1, 2019): China is going to eat our lunch? Come on, man.They're not bad folks, folks. But, guess what, they're not a -- they're -- they're not -- they're competition for us.I was on the phone for two straight hours with Xi Jinping. If we don't get moving, they're going to eat our lunch.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: What's your reaction to this? Do you think Biden is -- is changing his tune on China or not? We have to wait to see what the policy looks like, obviously.BEDFORD: So far it hasn't given exactly promising signs to see the -- that he rescinded the last minute order from the Trump administration to monitor China's meddling with their money in U.S. universities. I don't know why it took so long for the Trump administration to do that. and I also can't imagine why Joe Biden would possibly want to get rid of it. It's worth keeping a close eye on who he puts in to oversees technologies at the Department of Commerce to try and get an idea, is he going to be hawkish on China, as some in his administration are, or is he going to say, come on, man, come on, man, they're not good -- they're not bad guys, as we heard earlier this year at some of his other appointments lean toward.BARTIROMO: Liz.PEEK: Yes, you know, it strikes me, Christopher, that basically the Biden administration is starting out just the way the Obama White House did, talking about everything but number one concern for Americans, which was jobs. We have a higher minimum wage in the offing (ph). They won't open schools, allowing more than a million women to go back to work. They're killing Keystone jobs.I just find this a remarkable indifference to the number one issue in America, which is putting people back to work. And it just seemed to me like they learned nothing from eight years of sluggish economic recovery.Do you see it that way or am I being too harsh?BEDFORD: I see it exactly that way. What -- what seems to be a lesson the Democrats have learned about -- forgetting their working class base and their working class roots, within a month after the 2016 election they'd already forgotten that and gone back to a lot of the ways that they were.I was somewhat surprised, and it's been really, really difficult for Trumka and other union leaders to try and square how they endorsed this administration, how they said that they were backing Joe Biden for president when the first thing that Joe Biden has done in office is say, union jobs matter significantly less to us in the environmentals agenda and get rid of the Keystone Pipeline. You combine the getting rid of oil sector jobs, the (INAUDIBLE) jobs in New Mexico, the raising the minimum wage and trying to raise their minimum wage on West Virginians. They're abolish the Keystone Pipeline. With all of these pie in the sky, some day there's going to be green jobs, and that is not an actual reality.And it's going to be very, very difficult for them to actually try to win back that working class voter that they had previously in history.PEEK: I agree.BARTIROMO: All right, Chris, great to talk with you this morning. Thank you so much. It is good to see you. We'll be follow all of the above, as you know.Christopher Bedford from "The Federalist."Coming up, crypto goes mainstream, or does it. More companies look to allow Bitcoin for transactions. Will more follow suit.Bitcoin Foundation Chairman Brock Pierce will weigh in coming up.And then the ultimate Valentine's Day gift. How you can win a $20,000 bar tab for you and that special someone. It's making a buzz this morning. We'll tell you all about it.You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Crypto craze. The nation's oldest bank, BNY Mellon, Bank of New York Mellon, now financing Bitcoin and other digital currencies. It follows MasterCard's announcement that it is preparing to support crypto directly on its network this year. And now the city of Miami is mulling the option to pay its workers in crypto.Joining me right now Bitcoin Foundation Chairmen, philanthropist and former child actor Brock Pierce.Brock, it's great to see you today. Thanks so much for being here.What's your reaction to Bank of New York? What is this going to do for this digital currency, Bitcoin?BROCK PIERCE, CHAIRMAN, BITCOIN FOUNDATION: Well, this is huge. And you have to remember that these are not decisions that were just made recently. You know that whole idea of an overnight success. BNY Mellon has been actively working on piloting projects and investigating blockchain and cryptocurrency since 2014. And so I think this is a watershed moment for cryptocurrency. I think it's a watershed moment for Bitcoin because organizations like BNY Mellon do not attacking their reputations of things like this lightly. It's the oldest bank in the United States and it's the largest custodial bank in the world. I think this means it is an open field for any financial institution to get involved that had been thinking about it.BARTIROMO: Well, that's a great point.So how long until digital assets, do you think, are fully integrated into the financial system?PIERCE: Well, the day before yesterday, MasterCard also announced that they're going to make cryptocurrency available to all their merchants. This is something that's been available for a while through companies like BitPay and Gocoin. Microsoft accepted Bitcoin payments. Sony accepted Bitcoin payments. Many merchants did. But now that we're seeing it at the MasterCard and potentially the Visa and American Express level, it means that we could see ubiquitous adoption where merchants anywhere in the world can just flip the switch and add this as a payment method. I think that we're at that moment where mass adoption of cryptocurrency is about to start happening.BARTIROMO: So what kind of a regulatory framework comes with that then? I mean do you expect that we're going to see new rules and regulations around the usage?PIERCE: Yes. I mean, keep in mind, there's already a tremendous amount of regulation in place. And a lot of those regulations were created that pre- date the Internet and technology. So I think we need to take a look at regulation, make sure that we're passing sensible regulation that is there to protect the people and upgrade our systems in the same way that this new technology is upgrading our systems.And you pointed out, and I think it's worth noting, that now, just yesterday, Miami has passed this resolution where the mayor of Miami is making it available for government employees to potentially receive up to 100 percent of their pay in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. This is -- this has been a wild week.And one other thing worth noting. On Monday, it was the 10-year anniversary of Bitcoin breaking the buck, meaning 10 years ago this week Bitcoin hit $1 for the first time. And this week we hit all-time highs north of 48,000.BARTIROMO: Wow. That's incredible. Here we are at 47,900.What would you say to those looking to buy it here at this price? Did they miss the boat?PIERCE: Certainly not but I never encourage people to invest in Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies. I encourage you to invest in yourself. I'd recommend if you can afford it to go buy $10 or $20 worth so that you understand what this craze is all about so that you can make informed decisions for yourself going forward. If you're thinking about investing, I encourage you to average your way in, buy a little bit today, a little bit a week from now, a little bit the week after that so that you're not buying at the top or the bottom of the market. That is, I think, the most intelligent way to buy in.BARTIROMO: All right, Brock, great to talk with you. We'll be watching. Thank you so much. Brock Pierce joining us there on Bitcoin.Coming up, the Valentine's Day gift that keeps on giving. How you can grab your bar tab covered for life. It's making a buzz this morning. We'll tell you all about it when we come back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.It is time for the "Morning Buzz."With Miller High Life of love, the beer company wants to give one couple the best Valentine's date with a private night at their favorite dive bar. They get all the bar favorites like peanuts, popcorn, bratwurst and beer to enjoy. They just need to write out their love story in 150 words or less. It doesn't end there. Winners will receive a $20,000 High Life card to cover bar tabs for life.Dagen, how does that sound.MCDOWELL: I think it sounds awesome, but I think that Miller High Life is best consumed on a boat fishing. Just saying. It's the -- it's the beer if you're going fishing. So -- but I guess that's how couples bond too is fishing.BARTIROMO: Liz.PEEK: You know, I've been sitting here trying to think what is my favorite dive bar. Not sure I have one. So I'm really not in great shape on this. But, by the way, apparently this won't be available till after actually Valentine's Day has come and gone. So it's a little disappointing that we can't get 150 words out on our romantic life before that.BARTIROMO: Oh, God.All right, let's take a short break and then get some final thoughts from this all-star panel.More MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business right after this.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Your "Morning Mover" Bausch Health. Shares rising this morning by better than 5 percent after an actor-investor -- activist investor, rather, Carl Icahn reported taking a 7.8 percent stake in the company. That includes Bausch and Lomb. He says that he may seek a seat on its board and that is moving the stock. You see activist investors moving in on stocks and they typically move those stocks.Dagen McDowell, Liz Peek, final thoughts from you.Liz, go ahead.PEEK: You know, the big overarching theme right now to me, Maria, is that the Democratic Party has become the party of big tech and big business. I don't think voters yet understand that they have abandoned the working class American. I think that's going to color everything over the next four years.BARTIROMO: Well, we certainly will scrutinize those policies if so.Dagen, final word.MCDOWELL: Will Andy Cuomo, the governor of New York, be held accountable for covering up nursing home death for his own political gain? Tim Scott, the senator, said last week, every Senate Democrat voted against his amendment to hold states like New York accountable for their misreporting data on COVID related nursing home deaths. Now we know the truth. What will the Justice Department do about it?BARTIROMO: Yes. And Congressman Tom Reed made some news on that story this morning when he joined us.Dagen McDowell, Liz Peek, great to see you ladies. Have a wonderful weekend. Have a great weekend, everybody. Happy Valentine's Day. I'll see you tonight on "WALL STREET" and Sunday on "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES" over on Fox News."VARNEY AND COMPANY" begins right now.Load-Date: February 12, 2021End of Document

China erasing H&M from internet amid Xinjiang backlashAssociated Press Financial WireMarch 27, 2021 Saturday 12:53 AM GMTCopyright 2021 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; LIFESTYLE; INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 1285 wordsByline: ZEN SOO and JOE McDONALD, Associated PressDateline: HONG KONG BodyHONG KONG (AP) — H&M disappeared from the internet in China as the government raised pressure on shoe and clothing brands and announced sanctions Friday against British officials in a spiraling fight over complaints of abuses in the Xinjiang region.H&M products were missing from major e-commerce platforms including Alibaba and JD.com following calls by state media for a boycott over the Swedish retailer's decision to stop buying cotton from Xinjiang. That hurts H&M's ability to reach customers in a country where more than a fifth of shopping is online.Shockwaves spread to other brands as dozens of celebrities called off endorsement deals with Nike, Adidas, Burberry, Uniqlo and Lacoste after state media criticized the brands for expressing concern about Xinjiang.Brands are struggling to respond to pressure abroad to distance themselves from abuses without triggering Chinese retaliation and losing access to one of the biggest and fastest-growing markets. That pressure is rising as human rights activists are lobbying sponsors to pull out of the Beijing Winter Olympics planned for February 2022.Tencent, which operates games and the popular WeChat message service, announced it was removing Burberry-designed costumes from a popular mobile phone game.In a high-tech version of the airbrushing used by China and other authoritarian regimes to delete political enemies from historic photos, H&M’s approximately 500 stores in China didn’t show up on ride-hailing app Didi Chuxing or map services operated by Alibaba and Baidu. Its smartphone app disappeared from app stores.It wasn’t clear whether companies received orders to erase H&M’s online presence, but Chinese enterprises are expected to fall in line without being told. Regulators have broad powers to punish companies that fail to support official policy.The ruling Communist Party's Youth League launched attacks Wednesday on H&M following the European Union's decision to join the United States, Britain and Canada in imposing sanctions on Chinese officials blamed for abuses in Xinjiang.On Friday, the Chinese government announced penalties against nine Britons and four institutions. They are banned from visiting China or having financial transactions with its citizens and institutions.More than 1 million members of the Uyghur and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities have been confined to detention camps in Xinjiang, according to foreign governments and researchers. Authorities there are accused of imposing forced labor and coercive birth control measures.The Chinese government rejects complaints of abuses and says the camps are for job training to support economic development and combat Islamic radicalism.State media accused H&M and other brands of improperly profiting from China while criticizing it. That prompted Chinese retailers and internet companies to distance themselves from the Swedish retailer, though other brands still were available on e-commerce platforms.“It’s a form of self-preservation,” said Shaun Rein, managing director of China Market Research Group in Shanghai.Rein said the outpouring of anger at H&M is the harshest he has seen against a foreign brand. He said companies are especially sensitive because this comes at a time when Chinese anti-monopoly and other regulators are stepping up scrutiny of internet operators."If they don’t try to criticize, they’ll also get in trouble," Rein said.In Washington, State Department spokesperson condemned China's state-led social media campaign and corporate and consumer boycott against companies.“We commend and stand with companies that adhere to the U.S. laws and ensure products we’re consuming are not made with forced labor,” deputy spokesperson Jalina Porter told reporters. "We continue to support and encourage businesses to respect human rights in line with the U.N. guiding principles on business and human rights in the OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises.”The Communist Party often pressures foreign clothing, travel and other brands over actions by their governments or in an effort to compel them to adopt its positions on Taiwan, Tibet and other sensitive issues.Most comply because China is one of the biggest, fastest-growing markets for global fashion, electronics and other consumer brands.China is H&M’s fourth-largest market behind Germany, the United States and Britain and accounted about 5% of 2020 revenue.Greater China is Nike Inc.’s third-largest market after North America and Europe.Greater China accounted for 23% of Nike’s global sales in the quarter ending in February, compared with 36.5% for North America. But China revenue rose 51% over a year earlier as consumer demand rebounded from the coronavirus, while North American sales fell 10%.An H&M outlet in Shanghai had only a handful of customers on Friday afternoon.“I wasn’t aware of the backlash. I came here to buy a coat for spring because H&M is reasonably priced and fashionable,” said Wang Yuying, a 52-year-old retiree who was shopping at the store.“I’ll still buy something since I’m already here, but if this backlash lasts for a really long time, I will buy less from this brand.”A salesman, who asked not to be identified by name due to the sensitivity of the matter, said there were far fewer shoppers than on a normal Friday. The salesman said he understood why consumers were angry but said if the backlash continues, it will hurt the livelihoods of local employees of the brands targeted.Two Burberry-designed character outfits in Tencent’s popular Honor of Kings mobile game were removed, the game's social media account said Thursday. It gave no reason.Celebrities including at least one Uyghur announced they were ending endorsement deals with foreign shoe and clothing brands.Gulnazar, an actress from Xinjiang, said she was breaking ties with Puma. On her social media account, Gulnazar said she “resolutely resists all attempts to discredit China.”Singers Eason Chan and Angelababy of Hong Kong announced they were breaking ties with Adidas. Actress Zhou Dongyu split from Burberry. Actors Ni Ni and Jing Boran broke with Uniqlo.Song Qian, a singer and former member of the Korean pop group f(x) who also is known as Victoria Song, and actor Huang Xuan announced earlier they were ending endorsement deals with H&M.In Hong Kong, pro-Beijing lawmaker Regina Ip said in a Twitter post that she would stop buying Burberry, one of her favorite brands.“I stand with my country in boycotting companies that spread lies about Xinjiang,” she said.Not all brands have shunned Xinjiang sourcing.South Korean athletic shoe brand FILA said Friday the company buys cotton from Xinjiang and will keep doing so.On its social media account, FILA China said it has started the process of withdrawing from the Better Cotton Initiative, an industry group that promotes environmental and labor standards.H&M's announcement last year that it no longer would use Xinjiang cotton cited the BCI's move to stop licensing cotton from the region because it was difficult to trace how it was produced.It was unclear why the party targeted H&M, whose expression of concern about Xinjiang was similar to that of other companies. But its home country of Sweden might be seen by Chinese leaders as more susceptible to pressure due to its small size.Relations between Beijing and Stockholm have been strained since 2015 when a Chinese-born Swedish publisher disappeared from Thailand and surfaced in China. The Chinese ambassador angered the Swedish government by referring to it in a TV interview as a “lightweight boxer."___McDonald reported from Beijing. Associated Press researchers Yu Bing in Beijing and Chen Si in Shanghai contributed to this report.Load-Date: March 26, 2021End of Document

Michael Burgess, Jason Miller, Harvey Pitt, James FreemanBodyMARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Welcome back.Good Friday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Friday, March 26.Your top stories right now, 7:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast.Fragile and confused. President Biden speaks at his first official press conference, at times talking himself into dead-ends. He was asked about new state efforts to reform election laws, H.R.1 and the chances of a 2024 White House run.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I'm convinced that we'll be able to stop this because it is the most pernicious thing -- this makes Jim Crow looks like Jim Eagle.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Have you decided whether you are going to run for reelection in 2024?BIDEN: My answer is yes. My plan is to run for re-election. That's my expectation.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: We will be covering this and his answers all morning long this morning. Hear from Texas Congressman Michael Burgess, former Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller, Eurasia Group president Ian Bremmer and former White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, all coming up this morning.Meanwhile this, China's international erasure. New sanctions for U.K. companies who are calling out China and its treatment and abuse of Uyghurs in Xinjiang. Companies like H&M completely vanishing from Chinese maps. How the U.S. should respond coming up.Markets meanwhile are rallying. We've got a pretty good gain this morning and are expecting a triple digit move right out of the gate for the Dow Industrials. The Dow futures right now up 118. The Nasdaq up 10. And the S&P 500 higher by 10 as well.A late rebound yesterday in cyclical names helped all three major indices end near the session highs. The Dow Industrials were up 200. The Nasdaq up 15. And the S&P 500 higher by 20 points yesterday on Wall Street.European markets also on the rise this morning, the momentum continues with the European Indices up. FT 100 up 46. CAC 40 up 30. And the DAX index higher by 108.In Asia overnight, green across the board, take a look. All the major indices up better than 1 percent.MORNINGS WITH MARIA is live right now.Now some of the top stories that we are watching this morning.President Biden dodging questions about the crisis at the border yesterday during his first official news conference in two months since taking office. He's blaming the surge of migrants on former President Trump again, even though the Biden administration said earlier this month that the U.S. is on track to encounter more migrants than it has in 20 years.According to President Biden though, nothing has changed except there's a nice guy in the White House now.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: I guess I should be flattered, people are coming because I'm the nice guy. That's the reason why it's happening.I'm a decent man, or however it's phrased, you know, that's why they're coming, because Biden's a good guy. The vast majority of people coming to the border and crossing are being sent back.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: New photos show that the president was holding cheat cards during the news conference, detailing key policy points as well as head shots and names of reporters that he planned to call on.Gridlock is growing in Egypt's Suez Canal meanwhile. Crews are still working to dislodge a cargo ship that has been blocking the Suez Canal waterway in both directions. The canal is a major transit point for many products, including oil.Shippers are taking alternate routes to get supplies of oil, gas and other goods (ph) to their destinations. We are looking at oil prices this morning which are rising on the news. As you can see, the price of oil now at $59.80 a barrel. That's up better than 2 percent.China is hitting European entities now with sanctions. The Chinese Communist Party has sanctioned four entities and nine individuals over what it is calling lies and disinformation. Those targeted are prohibited from entering Chinese territory. The move is a retaliation to a set of sanctions imposed by the U.S. and its allies against Beijing over what you're looking at right now, human rights violations against the Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang, slave labor in Xinjiang.Meanwhile, H&M has been completely wiped from Chinese e-commerce including from maps, ride-hailings and deal applications. This retaliation comes after the clothing brand stopped sourcing products from China's Xinjiang region because of the human rights abuses. So they completely wiped H&M off of any maps in China. Even though they still have 400 stores there.Time for "The Word on Wall Street", top investors watching your money this morning.And joining me right now is Rosecliff Capital CEO and managing partner Mike Murphy, Stifel chief economist Lindsey Piegza, and Janney Montgomery Scott chief investment strategist Mark Luschini.Great to see everybody this morning. Thank you so much for joining me.Mike, kicking you off first here because WeWork finally going public. The company agreeing to a deal with a SPAC. The SPAC deal acquirer BowX Acquisition Corp according to "The Wall Street Journal", and BowX shares are halted for news pending. So we are expecting the company to come out and officially announce this.The deal values WeWork at $9 billion including debt, far below the $47 billion that WeWork was valued at by SoftBank back in 2019. Mike, How do you see this story?MIKE MURPHY, CEO/MANAGING PARTNER, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL: I think it's really interesting, Maria. So, you know, we thought WeWork was going to go public about a year-and-a-half ago, as you say almost $50 billion.Then they went through a major restructuring. Adam Neumann out as CEO of the company. SoftBank came in and had to double down and rescue the company and really add to their position.Now look at SoftBank stock, it's at an all-time high. It's taken off over 100 percent in the last year and now WeWork comes to the market.I think the most important thing for people watching the show, Maria, is to know that a SPAC doesn't mean it's a good deal and it doesn't mean it's a bad deal. It's the exact same thing as if WeWork were going public through a traditional IPO.Once they start trading as a public company they're going to have to beat analyst expectations. They're going to have to execute as a business. And if they do, they're going to be worth a lot more than $9 billion.And just one thing to add in there, Maria, Shaq -- Shaquille O'Neal is part of the SPAC that's taking them public.BARTIROMO: Interesting. Mike, Rosecliff manages in excess of $900 million in assets in seven different fund strategies.When you look across the market today, where do you see growth and potential for acquisitions by SPACs?MURPHY: So there's a lot of different areas, Maria. We really focus on fin tech and consumer tech. So what happens when the entire country was locked in our homes over the course of the last year, technology really pulled forward by several years. so things like Zoom that were out there but people weren't using, now people are using that on a regular basis.So how we get groceries delivered to us, how we get packages delivered to us, how we shop, how we see a doctor. Telemedicine has changed dramatically over the last year.So I think those are the areas. So fin tech, people's finances and consumer tech, how people get goods that they want to consume are areas where we think there's not just a few opportunities but there's massive opportunities there.So the SPAC market is here to stay for the long-term in my opinion.BARTIROMO: Yes. I love that. You've been talking about this for a long time.Mark, let's talk retail investors getting in on an IPO and the action there. Reuters is reporting that Robinhood is aiming to allow its users access to shares of companies before they become public. Robinhood plans to carveout 13 million shares for its own IPO for users as well as after filing paperwork with the SEC. What are your thoughts on this or how you would approach this given Janney's $108 billion in client assets under management right now? How do you allocate that money?MARK LUSCHINI, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIS, JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT: Well, Maria, I'd advance (ph) some tossing around that because obviously we saw what happened in the retail frenzy that continues to create tremendous volatility in the shares of a company by the name of GameStop, and you know, other companies in and around the kind Robinhood space like Royal Caribbean and others.And so to be allowed to take advantage of pre-IPO pricing on some of these stocks that already are, you know, set up to be bid higher on their open than what the investors prior to the IPO going public is priced at is only going to create even more fever pitch in some of these stocks and perhaps in some cases deservedly so because they may be underwriting very good companies with very great prospects.On the other hand, it could create just an environment in which the share price, particularly if it's a smaller floated company with regard to its overall capitalization could be manipulated and moved around by a banding together of retail investors that have literally little interest in the actual fundamentals of the company but rather can know in a consortium to push the share price around to disadvantage, you know, less than knowledgeable investors who may have bought the IPO on the prospects of the company for all the right reasons.BARTIROMO: Sure. Yes, no, this is a good risk to raise.Mark, are you still positive on this market? Do you want to put new money to work here given the macro story?LUSCHINI: Maria, most definitely. You know, you mentioned in your opening comments about the rally in the cyclicals that we saw yesterday. The fact is, we saw it even the day before, even though it was somewhat masked by the fact that yesterday was down about a half of 1 percent.But once again, leadership in the market was both cyclical sectors, financials, industrials and energy. So I continue to like that piece very much. I believe that the rotation that we've seen in these value stocks that really began in earnest back in September is indicative of investors' conviction that this replaced (ph) the narrative, the fiscal monetary stimulus to induce faster economic activity is not only working but is more likely than not to persist for an extended period of time.And therefore, I think that is a bullish signal for stock prices. So yes, we have a price target that's still well out of the money from here for the S&P 500 so we would commit new capital to the market right now.BARTIROMO: All right. Well look, you've got interest rates at rock bottom levels. I know that's a big positive.Lindsey, got to get your take on the Suez Canal blockage. This is a big story. some people think this is going to be in place, this block for weeks. And it's blocking the global supply chains.Lloyd's list estimating the stoppage costing $400 million in goods an hour. $400 million in goods an hour, Lindsey. Your expectation here and observations on the impact on the economy?LINDSEY PIEGZA, CHIEF STRATEGIST, STIFEL: This is a very significant event. Just to put this in perspective, the Suez Canal is responsible for moving some 600,000 barrels a day of Middle East oil to the U.S. and Europe, some 800,000 barrels to China.But it's not just about the energy market. We're talking about 12 percent of global trade or roughly 30 percent of the world's shipping container volume moving through the Suez Canal.So with each passing moment, this is really putting significant pressure on the global supply chain still reeling from the impact of the virus. Now there are some alternatives, some alternative routes going, for example, down around the southern tip of Africa but this adds time and cost.But as the blockage you mentioned costing $400 million an hour, that's millions of dollars a minute or roughly $10 billion a day. If this continues much longer businesses are going to have to resort to these more costly alternatives.BARTIROMO: So what are you going to be looking at in terms of your metrics, your indicators in terms of how bad this is going to be for the global economy, Lindsey? Are you going to be focused on trade numbers? Import, export? What's the important metric that we should focus on?PIEGZA: We're going to be looking at shipping volume and how much that is cut off as a result of this blockade. That's going to give us the number one indication of how disruptive this is to the flow of goods across one of the major channels in the world.BARTIROMO: All right. That makes a lot of sense.Mike Murphy, Lindsey Piegza, Mark Luschini -- great to see you all this morning. Thanks so much. Have a great weekend.All right. Great "Word on Wall Street".Much more ahead this morning. Coming up, President Biden defending his decision about the southern border and overturning old Trump policies. Texas Congressman Michael Burgess and former White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany will react to his first news conference in two months.Plus Eurasia Group president Ian Bremmer here with his take on the tensions with China and the fallout from meetings between the world powers last week.Plus former Culture Club lead singer Boy George joining me this morning to talk about the new NFT platform. It's launching exclusive content from musicians. It's really an interesting story.Joining the conversation all morning long, Brian Brenberg and James Freeman. We're going to get back to this fantastic panel when we come right back.You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.President Biden addressing the influx of migrants at the southern border during his first official press conference yesterday, making no apology for rolling back Trump administration immigration policies.Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: First of all, all the policies that were underway were not helping at all. Did not slow up the amount of immigration and as many people coming. And rolling back the policies of separating children from their mothers -- I make no apology for that. Rolling back the policies of remain in Mexico, sitting on the edge of the Rio Grande in a muddy circumstance with not enough to eat -- I make no apologies for that.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: All right. No apologies.Joining me right now is House Energy and Commerce Committee member Michael Burgess. Congressman, thanks very much for being here. You heard what President Biden said. He's not apologizing to anybody including those border towns in Texas and Arizona and California that have seen an influx in migrants and they don't know what to do with this -- their towns.Your reaction.REP. MICHAEL BURGESS (R-TX): Well, he for sure should apologize to the men and women in Customs and Border Protection who right now are being so over- taxed by the sheer numbers that are coming across the border that they are then having to hold until they get a space in an HHS facility in the interior of the United States in the case of the children.Look, Biden knew this was a problem. It was a problem in 2014 when he was vice president. That's actually when it crossed a lot of our consciousness when we had the surge of migrants come across. They were housed at Blackwood (ph) Air Force Base. Governor Abbott and I went down to see for ourselves what was going on there.This is the same crisis except it's magnified. And it's magnified because the coyotes and traffickers on the downstream side have monetized the discussion that they hear out in Washington. So if Biden sends a message, you all come, they're more than willing to collect money from people and help them get up here.BARTIROMO: So this weekend there is a -- there is a long list of senators that are going to go visit the border as pressure is mounting on President Biden.Give us your overall assessment of that press conference yesterday, Congressman. What struck you the most? I mention the group of Republican senators that are set to visit the southern border this weekend because once again we're going to see it right from lawmakers with their cameras.You know, there's a gag order on the press. So we'll be hearing all about what they see this weekend. But more broadly speaking I just want to get your assessment of that press conference yesterday. What did you think?BURGESS: It's a triumph of low expectations. Look, the press conference was put off for so long, there was so much speculation about the president's ability to even conduct a press conference, the fact that he got through it with no major problems is in and of itself a victory for the Biden administration.But as far as border's concerned, it is not a victory -- not a victory for the American people.BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, you know, he also talked about getting rid of the filibuster. I mean, there was -- there were a lot, you know, of arguably false comments made around the filibuster, you know, if you -- he's been fighting to keep the filibuster in place for almost 50 years, being in government and now all of a sudden he says it's Jim Crow or Jim Eagle. I don't know who Jim Eagle is, by the way. I didn't get that.What was your take on the filibuster comment.BURGESS: Well, you're absolutely right. Earlier in the George W. Bush administration the filibuster was used expertly by people like Senator Biden in order to prevent Bush's judges from being confirmed, Bush's policies from going forward.So yes, I shed no tears for the Joe Biden's worry about the filibuster now. It seems oddly placed. But look, going back to the border, and again, I cannot emphasize how big this problem is.I will agree with the president about one thing. There is some seasonal variation. If it is this bad in February and March, it is going to be absolutely awful by the time we get to May and June. We've seen it before.BARTIROMO: Yes.BURGESS: And again, the folks at Customs and Border Protection just get absolutely overwhelmed with these unaccompanied migrant children who come in that have got no place to go.BARTIROMO: Yes. most people are expecting as the warmer weather comes in that this is going to turn to serious panic because the numbers will go up.What about the other issue of dominance from big tech, House lawmakers grilling the CEOs of Facebook, Twitter and Google yesterday over censorship concerns across their platforms. House Minority Whip Steve Scalise pressed Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey on the decision to block "The New York Post" Twitter account following "The Post" reporting on Hunter Biden.I mean, they just censored the New York post. They kicked President Trump off the platform.This is the kind of dominance that Twitter has. Do you have any power as a Republican in the House to hold these major companies accountable? Where's this going?BURGESS: Well, the first and perhaps most straightforward thing in my mind, the section 230 protections only apply if you're just simply a conduit for information. Once you exercised editorial discretion, you become a publisher and, of course, the liability shield is then pierced.The other thing and of course, that didn't come up much in yesterday's discussion, but really the risk of big tech companies is from anti-trust and should the government get involved in that and break up the big tech companies like Bell was broken up when I was just a child, that could be -- that could be a much bigger deal.BARTIROMO: So that's a possibility on anti-trust. Congressman, thank you. Michael Burgess.We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.President Joe Biden giving skewed numbers on the border crisis while answering questions during yesterday's press conference. Of course, that was his first press conference since taking over two months ago. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: Truth of the matter is, nothing has changed. As many people came, 28 percent increase in children at the border in my administration, 31 percent in the last year, in 2019 before the pandemic in Trump administration. It happens every single solitary year.There is a significant increase in the number of people coming to the border in the winter months of January, February, March. It happens every year.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: No, it actually not true. We are talking about the most number of people here that we've ever seen because of the overturning of policies.Biden also commented on taxes, he said President Trump tax cuts highly favored the top 1 percent which is also not true, Brian Brenberg, because we know that President Trump's tax and jobs plan lowered tax rates for all incomes.BRIAN BRENBERG, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. The president -- I hate to say this, Maria -- but the president just looks like an empty vessel here. The left is pouring in whatever data they feel like had they can talk about.The press is pouring in the positions that they have on these issues and he's just taking it and spitting it back out, looking at the notes, what do the notes say, read off the notes.And so you know, Americans look at this. They should look at this. If you're getting honest reporting, honest fact checking, Americans have to look at this and say is this person in command of the key issues moving this nation right now? There is no way in my view, yesterday's press conference showed someone who is in command of these issues, understands the facts, and can act on them in a transparent way.BARTIROMO: It is unfortunate to say it but you're right. James Freeman, that's one of the issues, people don't want to say what is true and in our faces every day.JAMES FREEMAN, "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL": Yes. It's tough. I mean, I don't want to do a long distance diagnosis. I'm not a doctor. But the questions about his ability are going to continue.But as far as the fact checking, I would say he fact checked himself. The answers were so contradictory. They were sort of self-refuting where he starts out saying nothing's changed, it's the normal wintertime. Wait a minute, something has changed, it's Trump's fault and then he got around to saying, I changed the policy and I don't apologize for it.So you could kind of pick any answer you wanted out of that series of contradictions.BARTIROMO: Yes, for sure.We'll be right back. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Friday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I am Maria Bartiromo. And it is Friday, March 26. To look at markets this half an hour, where we are expecting a rally. At the start of trading this morning for the DOW Industrials, the DOW extending gains this morning up 111 points, but the NASDAQ has turned negative in just the last few minutes. The NASDAQ is now lower by 53, and the S&P 500 currently higher by 5.25. We've been watching a rebound in cyclical stocks late in the day yesterday, as well have been all three major indices. And near the session highs yesterday, the DOW Industrials finished up almost 200 points. The NASDAQ was up 15, and the S&P was higher by 20 points at four o'clock on Wall Street yesterday.European markets this morning also on the rise. Take a look, FT 100 up 46, the CAC quarante up 25, and the DAX Index higher by 96. Similar story overnight in Asia, where you did have all the major indices up, at least better than 1 percent. China up one and two-third percent. Meanwhile, back in the U.S., Georgia's governor signing into law, changes to the state's election requirements. Cheryl Casone, with these details now. Cheryl?CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: That is right, Maria. The bill has sparked a lot of controversy. It requires absentee voters to request ballots by providing their driver's license number, the last four digits of their social security number, plus another form of identification. It limits the number of ballot boxes to one per county, except for larger counties in the state. Republicans say, the bill will help prevent voter fraud, but Democrats argue it will disproportionately disenfranchise minority voters, and will likely these Democrats are likely going to challenge this new law in court.Well, Pfizer beginning testing its COVID-19 vaccine on infants and children. 144 kids between six months and 11 years of age have already gotten their first shot. The trial aiming to determine the proper dosage for different age groups and how to best administer it to kids. Let's take a look at Pfizer, in the pre-market stock is fractionally higher. Well, Vermont Senator, Bernie Sanders, renewing his push to hike taxes on the wealthy.His first proposal would restore the corporate tax rate to 35 percent. Or it set for years before former President Trump and Republicans reduced it to 21 percent. The second, create a new progressive estate tax, including a 45 percent tax on estates worth 3.5 million or more plus tax and states worth more than a billion at 65 percent. These proposals a lot bigger than those being considered by President Biden newest call for raising the corporate tax rate to 28 percent.Finally, we're going to take a look at this. Some viral video to show you sharks caught swimming in a tank of water strapped to the back of a truck. This happened in Maryland. You can see them gladdie by the windows. The truck was barreling down a Baltimore interstate. Julianne, 52, posted this on Instagram. Here is what she wrote, things you don't see on the highway every day, hashtag sharks. Hashtag sharks of Instagram. No idea where the sharks were headed, Maria. Back to you.BARTIROMO: Wow. That is fascinating to see that on the road, Cheryl. All right. Thank you so much. President Biden holding his first solo news conference yesterday. The President fielded questions from the press but appeared to lose his train of thought several times throughout this event. Let's take a watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: The best way to get something done, if you hold near and dear to you, that you like to be able to anyway. We're ready to get a lot done. When I was United States Senator - I mean, Vice President, am I gave the too long answer, because if you don't want the detail - no, but I mean, I don't know how much detail you want about immigration. OK. Where am I here? Let me see.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you agree?BIDEN: Yes.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: If not, why not abolish it, if it's a relic of the Jim Crow era.BIDEN: And so, I am convinced that we'll be able to stop this because it is the most pernicious thing. This makes Jim Crow look like Jim Eagle. Successful electoral politics is the art of the possible. You got the right code for your credit card. You know, what was your dog's name? OK. Hang on. Sorry. Oh.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Well, joining me right now is, Former Trump 2020 campaign Senior Adviser, Jason Miller. Jason, I am glad you're here to talk about this. Obviously, no one wants to see the commander in chief of the free world, put in a position to have to be there at the podium if he is not up for it. Your reaction to what you just heard and what we saw yesterday?JASON MILLER, FORMER TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN SENIOR ADVISER: Well, Maria, good morning. And it would be funny, if it wasn't the leader of the free world to someone who we expect to go toe to toe with Xi Jinping or Vladimir Putin. Here is my biggest concern though, with yesterday's press conference. And that is this willingness from the mainstream media to equate Joe Biden's periods of silence, his political hibernation with doing work. So, as we saw on the campaign, he supposedly had this basement bunker retreat where he is coming up with COVID plans, of course, that he didn't have anything to show for it.Now, yesterday, he finally reemerged and had a press conference. And not only did he not have a solution for the crisis at the southern border he, outright lied, saying that he, nothing has changed with regard to policies. And even the fact that 87 percent of those who have entered the country illegally are being released back into the United States, Joe Biden said most of them are being turned away. So, it concerns me that the media thinks that just because he is quiet on something, he is working. When in reality, the Democrats are hiding him because of moments like this.BARTIROMO: Well, I mean, it was extraordinary when he said that the majority of people are turned away or sent back. I mean, do we have any documentation that shows the majority of people showing up, which was - by the way, 100,000 people in February alone, that the majority of them are being sent back?MILLER: Well, no, and that he was just lying to the American public. In fact, Maria, the Associated Press has a fact check out this morning, saying that Joe Biden misled on the border yesterday, when he said nothing has changed. He actually has reversed a number of successful President Trump border policies remain in Mexico. President Trump had ended catch and release. Joe Biden is stopping the wall construction. And so, for the fact that Joe Biden got up there and said, that was problematically. Here is the one other thing, Maria.Joe Biden had one job yesterday. And that was to send a clear message to folks in Mexico and Central America, that if you come to the United States illegally, you're not going to get in, you're going to be turned away. He didn't do that. And in fact, multiple times he had the opportunity. And so, when we wonder why folks are coming to our southern border, why we have this crisis, it's all on Joe Biden. When he stood up there and said, citizenship for 11 million undocumented folks back during the campaign, he was serious as is Kamala Harris.BARTIROMO: Unbelievable. Well, the former president, President Trump responded to the press conference last night. He joined Laura Ingraham on Fox News, he signaled President Biden was given softball questions from the press, something he wouldn't be able to get away with. Your reaction to that, Jason? And then, you had this one reporter saying, why don't you just do away with the filibuster if it is Jim Crow? I mean, is there an understanding in the press of what it would mean, if the filibuster goes away? And how the Democrats will be able to just jam-in whatever legislation they want, from changing election laws, the way we vote to economic policy and foreign policy?MILLER: Maria, you bring up a really good point. And that's where I don't think that the press wants to go and give that much attention to what Joe Biden is promising. I should say, to do with the filibuster, because it would be such a radical change to our voting system. Now, if it were President Trump and Republicans who were doing this, of course, the medias' hair would be on fire.Maybe they're saying, what the heck are you mean evil republicans doing, but since it's Joe Biden, and they want to see these policies, they're going to go and tamp it down. But again, with Joe Biden yesterday, when he was getting into H.R. 1, he said, I'm going to make three points, and he says, one, two, and then oh, gosh darn it. It's just - it's embarrassing at this, not just national, but international stage that this is who we have leading us right now.BARTIROMO: Well, you are right. China, and the CCP has to be watching all of this so closely. Former President Trump, meanwhile, signals that he may create his own social media platform, Jason. Obviously, he was banned from Twitter and Facebook following the Capitol riots. Here is the former President on the Ingraham Angle last night. Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, 45TH U.S. PRESIDENT: What I'm doing now, I almost like it better. I think I do like it better. So, I put out statements now from the office of and the statements are picked up by everybody. I mean, it actually works better. Now, with that being said, we may open up our own platform.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: What is the President thinking, Jason? What can you tell us about this new platform?MILLER: Well, this is something that I am very excited about. And I know that the President is excited about it as well that he has this opportunity. And we think it'll probably be in the next two or three months or so to launch his own platform, excuse me. And there are a number of different companies, number of different setups that he's taken a look at, some that are into the beta phase, some they're a little more in the conceptual aspect of it. But we got have to remember, President Trump received almost 75 million votes. He is the biggest name and not just in American politics, but I'd say even in political history. Folks want to hear what he has to say. And we're doing that right now with press releases, and with interviews and such. But I think about two, three months from now, you will see President Trump on his own platform. It'll be the biggest thing on social media.BARTIROMO: Yes. But Jason, are you also beholden to the big tech companies? I mean, you know, Apple through Parler, office Apple Store? So, do you have any assurances that this new platform will be on the Apple Store, for example, so that you could actually get users to keep signing up?MILLER: I would expect that whatever platform President Trump does get behind and put his name to, that it will be something they'll be available widely that folks will be able to get it. But also that there'll be systems in place in the backends, everything from storage to where the big tech, the censorship folks can't come back and pull the nonsense that they did earlier this year.BARTIROMO: All right, Jason. Great to get your insights on all of this. Thanks very much. We will see you soon. Jason Miller, stay with us. We'll be right back.MILLER: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Retail investors getting in on the IPO action. Reuters is reporting that Robinhood is aiming to allow users to have access of shares of companies before they go public. Robinhood plans to carve out 13 million shares of its own IPO for users, after filing paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday. Joining me right now on the phone is Former Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman, and the CEO of Kalorama Partners, Harvey Pitt. Harvey, it's great to talk with you again. Thanks very much for being here.HARVEY PITT, FORMER SEC CHAIRMAN (via telephone): Good to be with you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Yes. I want to get your take on so many things. Let's talk Robinhood for a moment and allowing retail investors to get in on that IPO, your reaction?PITT: My reaction is, this is a clever idea. It will require a loss of negotiations between Robinhood and those who create IPOs for other companies. It will be easy for Robinhood to do this for its own IPO because it doesn't have to negotiate with anyone. But it will have to negotiate with those on Wall Street for handling other IPOs. But I think it's simply a question of working out arrangements, and this will be a novel and interesting approach.BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, I'll tell you, there is so many things happening in the capital markets today, that I'd love you to comment on, for example, this boom in SPACs. Earlier this hour, we reported that WeWork is agreeing to a SPAC deal with BowX Acquisition Corp at a $9 billion deal. This company as the Securities and Exchange Commission reportedly is investigating the rise in special purpose acquisition companies according to Reuters. Harvey, we've seen a string of deals, which pretty much allow companies to go public by merging in with a SPAC. What's your reaction to this new way of doing things and the rate of growth of SPACs that we are seeing?PITT: I think that, as a general proposition, there are a lot of advantages to it. But there are also legitimate concerns about the welfare of those who are encouraged to invest. At the moment, I think a lot of people are hearing about SPACs, and without really thinking through the issues, they are following the herd. So, to speak, and investing without understanding exactly what it is they're buying into. In the sense, part of it is, you're buying into a pig in a poke if you buy a SPAC, because you don't know what the ultimate answer (Ph) it will be that the SPAC will acquire or whether it will acquire any answer it. And there are other questions in terms of both disclosures and insider trading. So, the SEC, I think is appropriately stepping back and looking at this. Right now, its inquiry is informal, which means it's asking people voluntarily turn over information. But I also believe that no one should be misled.If the SEC finds indications of concern to it about, how investors are being traded. They will get subpoena power and go after individual companies. Right now, no specific public SPAC is being targeted.BARTIROMO: I'd see. Yes. I think it's a really interesting point that you make, because all you really know is that any company is going to get acquired by a SPAC. He don't necessarily understand or it's not necessarily transparent that you know, what growth story that company may have or how that company's fortunes may or may not change, and what the growth story is right off the bat. So, there is a lot of information to be gained from the investor looking into these things. But let me turn to China, Harvey, because we've spoken a lot about China on this program, and their motives and the goals of the Chinese Communist Party wanting to overtake the United States as the number one superpower civil military fusion, and how some Chinese companies are very tied to the Chinese military. And that has led to the delisting of some Chinese companies.The Securities and Exchange Commission beginning to implement a law passed that would threaten to kick Chinese companies off of U.S. exchanges, if they did not follow the audited roles. The SEC says, it's forcing accounting firms to be able to review financial audits of companies based overseas. Harvey, you would think that all companies should follow the same rules. And if you are listed in the United States, you have to follow Sarbanes-Oxley, the way every other company does. What is your reaction to what's going on with regard to China and Chinese listed companies? I recognize this is a big growth story China is for American companies who want to sell to 1.4 billion people. But are they also not focused on the risks here and the ties to a communist nation?PITT: Well, I think there are a lot of difficulties here, Maria. One of the biggest problems is that the Chinese government takes the position that audit work papers are confidential and cannot be released without appropriate approval from the government. The PCAOB, which is the private sector oversee of audit work has attempted to work out arrangements with China and it has been unsuccessful. And this goes back for quite a period of time. The Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act is the basis for the SEC now adopting interim rules. And the difficulty that I think rises is that, without a government to government agreement, the work is going to basically be very, very difficult.BARTIROMO: Yes. That makes a lot of sense, Harvey.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Time for the Morning Buzz. Art by a robot brings in big bucks, the self-portrait by Sophia the humanoid robot, that we told you about earlier this week, sold at auction for a just over $688,000. The winning bidder, getting the art in the form of a non-fungible token as well as the physical painting. Sophia had a message for the auction participants as well, watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SOPHIA: So, thank you very much for joining with me and supporting me today. The virtual, the real, the imaginal and the literal. This kind of spirit of creativity and technology working together, gives me hope that we can solve anything.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Wow. Those eyes are scaring me. James, is this NFT craze going too far with art by robots?JAMES FREEMAN, WALL STREET JOURNAL ASSIST, EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR: NFT's facts, the fans created a lot of money and it's going lots of different places. She is a passionate and compelling artist. I am going to wait though for her more mature work. I think, once Sophia is loved and lost, you'll be able to better capture the path those of everyday existence.BARTIROMO: Brian?BRIAN BRENBERG, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Remember, when you had a clown picture on your wall in your bedroom and you couldn't go to sleep at night because you were so afraid, that's what that robot does for me. No way. Thank you very much.BARTIROMO: Be afraid, very afraid. We will be right back. Stay with us.Load-Date: March 26, 2021End of Document

China erasing H&M from internet amid Xinjiang backlashAssociated Press InternationalMarch 26, 2021 Friday 11:09 AM GMTCopyright 2021 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; LIFESTYLE; INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 1194 wordsByline: ZEN SOO and JOE McDONALD, Associated PressDateline: HONG KONG BodyHONG KONG (AP) — H&M disappeared from the internet in China as the government raised pressure on shoe and clothing brands and announced sanctions Friday against British officials in a spiraling fight over complaints of abuses in the Xinjiang region.H&M products were missing from major e-commerce platforms including Alibaba and JD.com following calls by state media for a boycott over the Swedish retailer's decision to stop buying cotton from Xinjiang. That hurts H&M's ability to reach customers in a country where more than a fifth of shopping is online.Shockwaves spread to other brands as dozens of celebrities called off endorsement deals with Nike, Adidas, Burberry, Uniqlo and Lacoste after state media criticized the brands for expressing concern about Xinjiang.Brands are struggling to respond to pressure abroad to distance themselves from abuses without triggering Chinese retaliation and losing access to one of the biggest and fastest-growing markets. That pressure is rising as human rights activists are lobbying sponsors to pull out of the Beijing Winter Olympics planned for February 2022.Tencent, which operates games and the popular WeChat message service, announced it was removing Burberry-designed costumes from a popular mobile phone game.In a high-tech version of the airbrushing used by China and other authoritarian regimes to delete political enemies from historic photos, H&M’s approximately 500 stores in China didn’t show up on ride-hailing app Didi Chuxing or map services operated by Alibaba and Baidu. Its smartphone app disappeared from app stores.It wasn’t clear whether companies received orders to erase H&M’s online presence, but Chinese enterprises are expected to fall in line without being told. Regulators have broad powers to punish companies that fail to support official policy.The ruling Communist Party's Youth League launched attacks Wednesday on H&M following the European Union's decision to join the United States, Britain and Canada in imposing sanctions on Chinese officials blamed for abuses in Xinjiang.On Friday, the Chinese government announced penalties against nine Britons and four institutions. They are banned from visiting China or having financial transactions with its citizens and institutions.More than 1 million members of the Uyghur and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities have been confined to detention camps in Xinjiang, according to foreign governments and researchers. Authorities there are accused of imposing forced labor and coercive birth control measures.The Chinese government rejects complaints of abuses and says the camps are for job training to support economic development and combat Islamic radicalism.State media accused H&M and other brands of improperly profiting from China while criticizing it. That prompted Chinese retailers and internet companies to distance themselves from the Swedish retailer, though other brands still were available on e-commerce platforms.“It’s a form of self-preservation,” said Shaun Rein, managing director of China Market Research Group in Shanghai.Rein said the outpouring of anger at H&M is the harshest he has seen against a foreign brand. He said companies are especially sensitive because this comes at a time when Chinese anti-monopoly and other regulators are stepping up scrutiny of internet operators."If they don’t try to criticize, they’ll also get in trouble," Rein said.The Communist Party often pressures foreign clothing, travel and other brands over actions by their governments or in an effort to compel them to adopt its positions on Taiwan, Tibet and other sensitive issues.Most comply because China is one of the biggest, fastest-growing markets for global fashion, electronics and other consumer brands.China is H&M’s fourth-largest market behind Germany, the United States and Britain and accounted about 5% of 2020 revenue.Greater China is Nike Inc.’s third-largest market after North America and Europe.Greater China accounted for 23% of Nike’s global sales in the quarter ending in February, compared with 36.5% for North America. But China revenue rose 51% over a year earlier as consumer demand rebounded from the coronavirus, while North American sales fell 10%.An H&M outlet in Shanghai had only a handful of customers on Friday afternoon.“I wasn’t aware of the backlash. I came here to buy a coat for spring because H&M is reasonably priced and fashionable,” said Wang Yuying, a 52-year-old retiree who was shopping at the store.“I’ll still buy something since I’m already here, but if this backlash lasts for a really long time, I will buy less from this brand.”A salesman, who asked not to be identified by name due to the sensitivity of the matter, said there were far fewer shoppers than on a normal Friday. The salesman said he understood why consumers were angry but said if the backlash continues, it will hurt the livelihoods of local employees of the brands targeted.Two Burberry-designed character outfits in Tencent’s popular Honor of Kings mobile game were removed, the game's social media account said Thursday. It gave no reason.Celebrities including at least one Uyghur announced they were ending endorsement deals with foreign shoe and clothing brands.Gulnazar, an actress from Xinjiang, said she was breaking ties with Puma. On her social media account, Gulnazar said she “resolutely resists all attempts to discredit China.”Singers Eason Chan and Angelababy of Hong Kong announced they were breaking ties with Adidas. Actress Zhou Dongyu split from Burberry. Actors Ni Ni and Jing Boran broke with Uniqlo.Song Qian, a singer and former member of the Korean pop group f(x) who also is known as Victoria Song, and actor Huang Xuan announced earlier they were ending endorsement deals with H&M.In Hong Kong, pro-Beijing lawmaker Regina Ip said in a Twitter post that she would stop buying Burberry, one of her favorite brands.“I stand with my country in boycotting companies that spread lies about Xinjiang,” she said.Not all brands have shunned Xinjiang sourcing.South Korean athletic shoe brand FILA said Friday the company buys cotton from Xinjiang and will keep doing so.On its social media account, FILA China said it has started the process of withdrawing from the Better Cotton Initiative, an industry group that promotes environmental and labor standards.H&M's announcement last year that it no longer would use Xinjiang cotton cited the BCI's move to stop licensing cotton from the region because it was difficult to trace how it was produced.It was unclear why the party targeted H&M, whose expression of concern about Xinjiang was similar to that of other companies. But its home country of Sweden might be seen by Chinese leaders as more susceptible to pressure due to its small size.Relations between Beijing and Stockholm have been strained since 2015 when a Chinese-born Swedish publisher disappeared from Thailand and surfaced in China. The Chinese ambassador angered the Swedish government by referring to it in a TV interview as a “lightweight boxer."___McDonald reported from Beijing.

Covid-19 drove hundreds of Africans out of Guangzhou. A generation of mixed-race children is their legacyCNN WireMarch 18, 2021 Thursday 00:31Invalid date found for VDI: ha89b10a2a3f3d88c7c617afba8e5e026 XCEDOCID: 4 LNI: 627G-98Y1-JBSS-S0H7-00000-00. Date output 'as-is'.GMTCopyright 2021 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 2382 wordsByline: By Jenni Marsh, CNNDateline: (CNN) Body             When the coronavirus pandemic ground China to a near-halt in early February last year, Youssouf Dieng jetted back to Dakar for, he thought, a brief sojourn.In reality, it was a year before Dieng -- who had worked as a goods trader in the manufacturing hub of Guangzhou in southern China for two decades -- could return, on an air ticket three times the usual cost, and a complicated business visa. By then, the pandemic had driven hundreds of Africans out of Guangzhou, sparked the most severe anti-Black racial clashes in China in decades, and remade business operations, with Chinese factories connecting with African customers directly over e-commerce platforms."Now it is very, very quiet," Dieng says of Little Africa, a nook of Guangzhou informally named after the swell of thriving African businessmen who once lived, ate and prayed there in huge numbers. "Not many foreigners now, and all the small shops are closed. Small business around here? No more."At the turn of the 21st century, Guangzhou -- already a magnet for internal migrants -- became an accidental experiment in multiculturalism in China, as loose immigration rules and factories churning out cheap products attracted droves of African entrepreneurs.Business boomed, and by 2012 as many as 100,000 Sub-Saharan Africans had flocked to the city, according to Prof. Adams Bodomo's book "Africans in China." While that figure was never verified, it pointed to the generally accepted opinion that, between 2005 and 2012, at least, this was the largest African expatriate community in Asia.As interracial marriages in the community flourished, Bodomo theorized that, in time, an African-Chinese minority would arise, becoming China's 57th ethnic group and demanding full citizenship rights. Today, that looks unlikely. By April last year, just 4,550 Africans were living in Guangzhou, according to local authorities, including students and diplomats as well as businesspeople.Ten months on, more than a dozen experts and Africans who spoke with CNN said that number has further dwindled, due to several repatriation flights to Nigeria and Kenya, and tougher coronavirus-era visa rules, with most foreigners barred from entry to China.  Many who remain are rooted in China by Chinese wives and children."For the whole issue of African traders in Guangzhou, I suspect that era is over," says Gordon Mathews, professor and chair of the Department of Anthropology at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. "I'm skeptical that (their physical presence in the city)will ever be at the scale that it has been."The business caseOne reason for the decline of the African community over the past year is strictly business.In 2019 alone, of the 2.95 million foreigners entering China through Guangzhou, 358,000 were from African countries, according to local officials. Many came on quick visits to buy from the region's factories, using African residents as middlemen to connect with Chinese wholesalers.When Covid-19 prevented foreigners from visiting China, the factory owners of the Pearl River Delta -- often cited as the world's biggest urban area -- had to rethink their business model.Many in the area, which includes the cities of Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Foshan and Dongguan, began advertising their services on e-commerce giants such as Alibaba. This allowed them to connect with African customers directly, rather than waiting for them to come to the city in person to place orders, as had been the way for decades.Pat Chukwuonye Chike has been in Guangzhou for nearly two decades, living on a business visa he renews each year. When Covid-19 hit, he stayed to avoid being separated from his Chinese wife and three African-Chinese children. He shuttered his clothing store, previously frequented by droves of visiting foreigners, and set up an Alibaba-type service on Facebook, which is banned in China but can be accessed via a virtual private netwoprk (VPN).His online shop, Africa China Trade Service, connects about 20 factories he knows to his contacts in Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Guinea and Ghana. The advantage, he says, is his clients know they're dealing with factories they can trust.But it's a competitive landscape. There are now hundreds of thousands of Chinese migrants in Africa who can easily order from Chinese factories themselves, and sell to locals where they are living -- cutting Africans out of the equation in their home nations.Some say that's what the Chinese authorities would prefer."China wants to be the middleman and not have Africans (in its borders)," says Mathews, author of "The World in Guangzhou." "So it would make much more sense for the Chinese merchants to move to Africa, rather than having the Africans go to China."Racial tensionsFor centuries, Guangzhou has intermittently been a nerve center for migrants, whether internal or foreign. When African traders arrived in the city in the early 2000s, they formed a particularly visible enclave -- partly because they tended to congregate in one or two relatively small areas, and partly because black skin had not before been widely seen in China in large numbers.The Africans also brought with them value systems that did not easily fit in with China's political environment.Many were deeply religious, founding underground Christian churches, which sometimes attracted Chinese congregations -- a deeply contentious practice in a country where proselytizing by foreigners is illegal. As Beijing clamped down on non-state sanctioned religion in recent years, their house churches were raided and shut down by local police.Africans from Muslim nations also continued to practice Islam, a religion Guangzhou has a long connection with, being home to China's oldest mosque. Guangzhou attracted communities of Hui and Uyghurs, Muslim minorities in China, who began serving halal food to the African incomers, as did a range of Middle Eastern eateries. But in recent years, as hostility to Islamic populations increased across China in the wake of the crackdown on Islam in the country's western region of Xinjiang, Africans have reported that restaurants serving halal food began to remove Arabic writing from their menus and signage.Africans also formed small democracies within their own communities, voting for a head of each nation within Guangzhou, to lobby on their behalf with the local authorities on matters such as visas. Permanent residency for foreigners is extremely rare in China, and most African parents live in a status of constantly renewing one-year visas.Those who cannot secure these often simply overstayed, creating an underground population of illegal African migrants in the city. A leaked WikiLeaks cable from 2008 revealed the central government was concerned by this, and had quietly funded research into the African community's impact on crime, underground religion and missed tax revenue.In 2011, the provincial authorities clamped down on overstayers, offering rewards to Chinese who turned them in, and making it illegal for employers, hoteliers or educational institutes to serve them.Then, in 2014, the government embarked on the "beautification" of Little Africa, the once-rural village consumed by the city. The campaign tore down signage in the area that celebrated foreign trade, swept up street stalls serving local cuisines, and introduced a heavy police presence.As policing of the community increased, several Africans running logistics warehouses told CNN that police installed CCTV cameras inside their premises, as well as X-ray scanners and devices plugged into their WiFi routers, in an apparent bid to clamp down on illegal exports.CNN reached out to officials in Guangdong, the province of which Guangzhou is the capital, for comments on these claims but did not receive a response.Racism in ChinaWhile many Africans spoke of leaving Guangzhou in the years leading up to the pandemic, much of the community remained, often rooted by marriages, children, a lack of better opportunity in Africa or elsewhere, and ultimately a sense of home.While there is no official data on how many Africans in Guangzhou married Chinese women, a walk through the strip malls of Little Africa in recent years made it clear: scores of shops are run by an African husband and his Chinese wife, with their children running down the corridors.Yet that sense of belonging was rocked for many last April when Africans across the city were evicted from their homes and hotels, and forced to live on the streets. After a handful of Nigerians tested positive for Covid-19, Guangzhou authorities quarantined and tested Africans all across the city, sparking unproven fears that Africans were vectors of the virus.Last year, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said: "The Chinese government treats all foreigners in China equally, opposes any differentiated practices targeted at specific groups of people, and has zero tolerance for discriminatory words and actions."Still, Vassor Dieng, a sofa seller in Senegal who imports from China, remembers that incident, which went viral on Twitter in Africa. She says she has no desire to go to Guangzhou once coronavirus restrictions lift. "I'm hesitant now to go to China from what I have heard since Covid started, and how they treat people," she says.Back in Guangzhou, Nigerian father-of-three Chike says the way he is treated by some Chinese residents in his home city makes him feel they suspect Africans "are the virus." It's something, he says, he tries not to think about. "Not everyone is comfortable in another country," he adds.Many Africans in Guangzhou, however, report the city's Public Security Bureau has been lenient with visas for those with Chinese partners and children during the pandemic. Normally, a foreigner would have to leave and reenter China to activate a visa, something several Africans told CNN they had not been made to do, as it would trigger the need for a long quarantine.Despite the challenges, many Africans want to return to their old lives in China. Congolese trader Felly Mwamba left the country during the Lunar New Year holiday in 2020 and has been living in Winnipeg since. After two decades in Guangzhou, he'd earned enough money to apply for Canadian citizenship and buy a home there, but the Winnipeg winter has been bitterlycold and he says he has few friends.Yet he cannot get back into China. His business visa expired while he was in Canada, and to get a new one requires an invitation letter from local officials -- hard for him to obtain from another continent.In the meantime, he is paying rent on his office and apartment in China.He's considering closing his languishing logistics business there, if he can't return soon. "If really it is consistent going on like this, then I prefer to get out and relax," he said. "See if I can do something in Africa."The legacy  Whatever their future, the heyday of African trade, life and love in Guangzhou has produced a generation of African-Chinese children. While many are still adolescents, some have reached adulthood, and are navigating how their mixed identity will fit into China's increasingly nationalist landscape.Zhong Fei Fei, 24, says her parents met at the turn of the century in Guangzhou, where her Congolese father was a graduate student and her Chinese mother was doing business. They fell in love, and moved to Brazzaville. But after her father died when she was a toddler, she grew up in China with her grandparents: they renamed her Zhong Fei Fei -- a name that roughly translates to China-Africa.Since then, she says she has grappled with not being"Chinese enough" in China. She said a Shanghai school teacher once told her class she spoke Mandarin well for a "foreigner." "I was so confused because how come I'm the foreigner?" she remembers thinking.But she also has dealt with not being considered black enough in Congo.Last year, her identity came to the fore when producers of the Chinese version of K-pop reality TV show "Produce Camp 2020" invited her to star in the series.When Zhong emerged from the show, she was a trending topic on China's Twitter-like Weibo platform, but not for the right reasons -- many were attacking her for her race. "I was looking at my phone and I had like 200,000 messages or something," she says of reconnecting to the world after exiting the show. The online attacks came at the same time authorities in Guangzhou were accused of mistreating Africans there.Yet Zhong says she also received messages of support, and subsequently used the platform to launch a music career.For families in Guangzhou, Afro-Chinese celebrities like Zhong could be helpful for their children. Pastor Ignatius, a Nigerian evangelical preacher who has three African-Chinese children under the age of 12, hopes that "what is happening in Japan might happen here," referencing the Afro-Japanese community there, from which many celebrated figures have emerged, such as tennis player Naomi Osaka."What we see from the school, they are very accepting -- though there are times of student discrimination here," he says, of the public Chinese school his children attend in Guangzhou. They all have Chinese passports -- without one, they would not be eligible for free education or healthcare. Dual nationality is  forbidden.Chike, who also has three African-Chinese children under age 13, says while there is "more discrimination" for the family to contend with in recent years, "as long as my kids know who I am, where I'm from," they are free to live in the society they feel will be most beneficial.Mathews, the Hong Kong-based anthropologist, previously speculated during the height of African migration to Guangzhou that the African community could provide China with its own Barack Obama figure -- a non-Han leader. In an era of growing nationalism, he now believes this community of Afro-Chinese children will more likely dilute to the point where they won't have a collective voice."They will probably blend in the overall landscape of Guangzhou because it has so many people from all over the place," says Mathews. "I don't think they'll be noticeable ... it will be a few hundred people."                      By Jenni Marsh, CNN         TM & © 2021 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

GRASSLEY, JOHNSON SEEK INTEL RECORDS RELATED TO HUNTER BIDEN'S FOREIGN FINANCIAL ACTIVITIESStates News ServiceMarch 31, 2021 WednesdayCopyright 2021 States News ServiceLength: 1410 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Iowa Senator Charles Grassley:Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) Ranking Member of the HSGAC Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, are seeking all U.S. intelligence records relating to Biden family business associates linked to Chinese intelligence services.The senators' investigative report on the Biden family's foreign business arrangements detailed financial transactions and connections between and among members of the Biden family and foreign nationals linked to the communist Chinese government, including its military and intelligence services. The senators issued a supplement to their report further detailing troubling financial connections involving the Biden family, their business associates and Chinese and Russian governments.One individual, Chi Ping "Patrick" Ho, who had a close association with James and Hunter Biden, and who reportedly paid Hunter $1 million for legal representation, was the subject of a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant, suggesting he posed a potential counterintelligence threat to the United States. He was later convicted of international bribery and money laundering offenses stemming from his work with a Chinese organization with deep ties to the communist regime. Hunter Biden was reportedly aware of those ties."It's imperative that Congress better understand the relationship Ye Jianming, Gongwen Dong, and Patrick Ho had between and among themselves, with the communist Chinese government, CEFC China Energy, and their activities in the United States, including those relating to the Biden family. Accordingly, please produce all intelligence records, including but not limited to, all FISA-derived information relating to these three individuals no later than April 14, 2021," the senators wrote today in a letter to the Director of National Intelligence and the Justice Department.March 31, 2021VIA ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSIONThe Honorable Avril HainesDirector of National IntelligenceThe Honorable Merrick GarlandAttorney GeneralDepartment of JusticeDear Director Haines and Attorney General Garland:As you know, we have been reviewing financial transactions and connections between and among members of the Biden family and foreign nationals connected to the communist Chinese government, including its military and intelligence services.[1] In particular, Hunter Biden had a close and personal relationship with Ye Jianming, who reportedly had links to the communist regime's People's Liberation Army.[2] According to an October 2017 text message, Hunter Biden spoke to Ye on a "regular basis," was the "first guest in his new apartment," "[Ye] cooked [Hunter Biden] lunch himself and [they] ate in the kitchen together," they had a "standing once a week call," and he helped Ye "on a number of his personal issues (staff visas and some more sensitive things)."[3] In addition, Hunter Biden had a close association with Gongwen Dong and Chi Ping "Patrick" Ho, who were also business associates of Ye's.In December 2017, Patrick Ho was charged and in December 2018 was convicted of international bribery and money laundering offenses stemming from his work for Ye's China Energy Fund Committee, a subsidiary of Ye's CEFC China Energy, a company with extensive links to the communist regime.[4] After his arrest, his first call was reportedly to James Biden, President Biden's brother.[5] Hunter Biden reportedly represented Patrick Ho for a period of time and received at least $1 million in payment.[6] According to recent reporting and a federal government filing, the federal government obtained at least one Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant relating to Patrick Ho, indicating his potential counterintelligence threat to the United States.[7] Indeed, Hunter Biden was well aware of Patrick Ho's links to the communist Chinese government, specifically its intelligence services. According to records reportedly released from Hunter Biden's laptop, Hunter Biden allegedly said the following:I have another New York Times reporter calling about my representation of Patrick Ho the f***ing spy chief of China who started the company that my partner, who is worth $323 billion, founded and is now missing.[8]Moreover, news reports made publicly available a September 21, 2017, email from Hunter Biden to an office manager that asked for keys to be made available to then-former Vice President Biden, James Biden, and "Gongwen Dong (Chairman Ye CEFC emissary)" and referred to them as "office mates."[9] Hunter Biden also requested that the office sign reflect "The Biden Foundation" and "Hudson West (CEFC US)."[10] If accurate, the sharing of office space with Chinese nationals and entities linked to the communist regime and its military demands additional explanation.It's imperative that Congress better understand the relationship Ye Jianming, Gongwen Dong, and Patrick Ho had between and among themselves, with the communist Chinese government, CEFC China Energy, and their activities in the United States, including those relating to the Biden family. Accordingly, please produce all intelligence records, including but not limited to, all FISA-derived information relating to these three individuals no later than April 14, 2021.Please send all unclassified material directly to the Committees. In keeping with the requirements of Executive Order 13526, if any of the responsive documents do contain classified information, please segregate all unclassified material within the classified documents, provide all unclassified information directly to the Committees, and provide a classified addendum to the Office of Senate Security. Although the Committees comply with all laws and regulations governing the handling of classified information, they are not bound, absent their prior agreement, by any handling restrictions.Should you have questions, please contact Joshua Flynn-Brown of Senator Grassley's Committee staff at 202-224-5225 and Brian Downey and Scott Wittmann of Senator Johnson's Subcommittee staff at 202-224-3721. Thank you for your attention to this matter.Sincerely,Charles E. GrassleyRanking MemberCommittee on the JudiciaryRon JohnsonRanking MemberPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations[1] S. Rep., Hunter Biden, Burisma, and Corruption: The Impact on U.S. Government Policy and Related Concerns, S. Comm. on Homeland Sec. and Governmental Aff. and S. Comm. on Fin. (2020).[2] Ye Jianming is a Chinese national, chairman of CEFC China Energy, a company linked to the communist regime, and a frequent figure in Hunter Biden's financial dealings in China. Based on public reports that were available in 2015, when his contact with Hunter Biden began to ramp up, Ye was a founder of CEFC and chairman of the board for its subsidiary, the China Energy Fund Committee. Although CEFC reportedly remained a private company until state-owned enterprises assumed control of it in 2018, reporting in 2017 indicated that it received financing from the China Development Bank, "hired a number of former top officials from state-owned energy companies," and had "layers of Communist Party committees across its subsidiaries more than at many private Chinese companies." Our recent report also showed that Ye had connections not just to the communist party in China, but also China's People's Liberation Army, the armed forces of the Chinese communist party. S.

Elon Musk assures China that data collected by Teslas is confidentialCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 20, 2021 SaturdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 276 wordsBodyTesla CEO Elon Musk vehemently denied on Saturday (20) that his cars, which gather large amounts of data, may ever be used to spy on China, despite fears raised by Beijing, reported the Wall Street Journal.The electric car maker's boss's statement came after a chinese government decision to ban its military and employees of some state-owned companies from using Teslas.Musk made the comments while attending a conference in Beijing of the government-backed China Development Forum.Chinese authorities are concerned that data collected by Tesla vehicles, such as images taken by car cameras, could be transmitted to the United States, the newspaper said.Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment from AFP.China is a crucial market for Tesla, which has a factory in Shanghai and already sells a quarter of its production in the country. The group expects to sell 200,000 vehicles in China this year.In his statements, Musk insisted that no U.S. or Chinese company would risk collecting private data and sharing it with its respective government."Whether Chinese or American, the negative effects if a trading company got involved in espionage - the negative effects for that company would be extremely bad," Musk said.If Tesla used its cars to spy in any country, he said, it would be closed around the world, so this is "a very strong incentive for us to be very confidential."Chinese fears that data collected by groups such as Tesla could pose a threat to national security comes amid an ongoing confrontation between the United States and China over technology and commerce, which has also involved companies such as Huawei and TikTok.Load-Date: March 22, 2021End of Document

Investment Opportunities of Big Data Technology in China - Growth, Trends, COVID-19 Impact, and Forecasts 2021-2026 - ResearchAndMarkets.comBusiness WireMarch 30, 2021 Tuesday 4:22 PM GMTCopyright 2021 Business Wire, Inc.Length: 998 wordsDateline: DUBLIN BodyThe "Investment Opportunities of Big Data Technology in China - Growth, Trends, COVID-19 Impact, and Forecasts (2021 - 2026)" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.The investment opportunities of big data technology in the country are expected to register a CAGR of 30%China's growth trajectory has begun to slow in spite of the government's efforts to provide stimulus. The labour costs have risen to make China lose its cost advantage to countries such as Vietnam and Cambodia. To remain ahead of the curve, China's economy will have to shift to a higher value with big data as one of the tools to empower this shift.Big data has enormous potential to revolutionise Chinese economy. China has the world's largest consumer market. The world's workshop, China, is producing countless goods for export. Big data can offer critical insights into China's highly valued consumer market and assist Chinese firms trying to engage in high-value economic activities.The other factor that further underscores the importance of big data for Chinese firms is the amount of data that China produces today on account of being the second largest economy of the world. For instance, Tencent Holdings reports that its data hoard contains 15 times as much information as the world's largest library. WeChat app, Tencent's flagship product, alone has some 760 million people, registered users.Key Market TrendsUse of Big Data in the Chinese Automotive Industry to Increase Exponentially Driving the Market Growth• Industry players across China are increasingly using sales data to come up with solutions to target potential customers. Firms across China are collaborating in areas like new car design, development, and smart manufacturing to drive an industry facing increasing challenges and pressures in the form of cost pressures, competition, globalisation, market shifts, and volatility. Big data firms across China have begun offering services to automobile companies.• For instance, relying on its experience in manufacturing and its big data technologies, Lenovo is making efforts to drive China's manufacturing enterprises to transform and upgrade. The biggest personal computer giant Lenovo and domestic automaker Haima will join forces to promote the use of big data and artificial intelligence technology in the auto manufacturing industry.• China also happens to be the largest electric vehicle market in the world. The Chinese government has already mandated the collection of real-time data on electric vehicles driving on its roads, a practice that could provide a leg up in the development of self-driving technology. Data collection is essential to being competitive in the development of self-driving vehicles. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has stated this data is to address the large number of accidents involving electric cars and other new-energy vehicles and can be used to increase safety.Need for Customer Analytics to Stimulate the Market Growth• Given the massive size of China's consumer markets, the total amount of data generated is already huge and will only grow in the future. Big data is the solution way to handle such data loads efficiently and is proving vital for companies competing in the marketplaces.• The companies across China are focussing on developing tomorrow's smart supply chains that will leverage data, natural language processing, image recognition and machine learning to anticipate consumer's needs better and achieve the highest efficiency possible by using technology. For instance, retail giant, JD.com created a model based on its consumer data that creates a profile for every individual that tracks their favourite brands, marital status and more. This data will act as a point of reference for their future marketing strategies and help JD create a personalised shopping experience for customers.• Customer analytics will hold importance across industries like BFSI, Automotive, Healthcare, where the B2C component still accounts for higher market share and provides significant opportunities for growth. However, the retail sector and online retail sales, in particular, will need customer analytics the most given the value of the industry and the increasing competition in the market space. According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China, a government agency, online retail sales in China totalled about USD 1.33 trillion in 2018, an increase of 23.90% compared with 2017.Key Topics Covered:1 INTRODUCTION2 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY3 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY4 MARKET DYNAMICS4.1 Market Overview4.2 Introduction to Market Dynamics4.3 Market Drivers4.3.1 Data Explosion: Unstructured, Semi-structured and Complex4.3.2 Improvement in Algorithm Development4.3.3 Need for Customer Analytics4.4 Market Restraints4.4.1 Lack of General Awareness And Expertise4.4.2 Data Security Concerns4.5 Industry Value Chain Analysis4.6 Porter's Five Force Analysis5 MARKET SEGMENTATION5.1 By Deployment5.1.1 On-Premise5.1.2 Cloud5.2 By Enterprise Size5.2.1 Large Enterprise5.2.2 Small & Medium Enterprise5.3 By Solution5.3.1 Customer Analytics5.3.2 Fraud Detection and Management5.3.3 Operation Intelligence5.3.4 Predictive Maintenance5.3.5 Asset Management5.3.6 Other Solutions5.4 By End-user Industry5.4.1 BFSI5.4.2 Healthcare5.4.3 Retail5.4.4 Manufacturing and Automotive5.4.5 Aerospace & Defense5.4.6 IT & Telecommunication5.4.7 Government5.4.8 Other End-user Industries6 COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE6.1 Company Profiles6.1.1 IBM China Company Limited6.1.2 SAP China6.1.3 Huawei Technologies Co.6.1.4 Microsoft (China) Co., Ltd.6.1.5 Lenovo (Beijing) Limited6.1.6 Alibaba Cloud Computing Company6.1.7 Inspur Group Limited6.1.8 Baidu, Inc.6.1.9 Neusoft Corporation6.1.10 JD.com, Inc.7 INVESTMENT ANALYSIS8 MARKET OPPORTUNITIES AND FUTURE TRENDSFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/k21wbjView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210330005869/en/CONTACT: ResearchAndMarkets.comLaura Wood, Senior Press Managerpress@researchandmarkets.comFor E.S.T Office Hours Call 1-917-300-0470For U.S./CAN Toll Free Call 1-800-526-8630For GMT Office Hours Call +353-1-416-8900http://www.businesswire.comLoad-Date: March 30, 2021End of Document

Chinese government puts pressure on Alibaba and company shares collapseCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 12, 2021 FridayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 402 wordsBodyThe e-commerce giant, Alibaba,has long been in the sights of the Chinese government. The Jack Ma-founded Group has been under investigation since December last year for "alleged monopolistic practices." According to the Wall Street Journal, theChinese authorities accuse the company of forcing merchants selling on its website to grant it exclusivity, prohibiting them from marketing their products or services on other marketplaces.For "anti-competitive practices," the company could be the victim of a record fine in China. It could exceed the $975 million paid in 2015 by US chip manufacturer Qualcomm, "the biggest antitrust fine imposed by Beijing to date," the US newspaper said. For this reason, Alibaba's shares sank nearly 4% on Wall Street.The group has been in the government's spotlight since early November, when Alibaba's online payments company Ant Group was cancelled in extremis. The annulment came following a speech by Jack Ma in which the billionaire criticized the role of Chinese financial regulators.Ant Group, the financial technology giant, planned to raise $34.5 billion on the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchange, resulting in a market valuation of US$ 313 billion. Had the initial public offering (IPO) occurred, Ant Group would have exceeded the size of JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo. But the Chinese authorities cited "major problems" in stopping the IPO.Jack Ma planned the international expansion of his online bank, Alipay, which in China processed payments of US$ 17 billion in the first six months of 2020 alone, exceeding the amounts that handle powers such as Visa and Mastercard.According to the WSJ, the Chinese authorities do not want to "crush a technology company that is as popular among the Chinese as it is among foreign investors, as long as it distances it from its eccentric founder and aligns more with the ruling Communist Party."Ant Group CEO Simon Huresigned unexpectedly. Hu, who was appointed CEO of Alibaba Group Holding's 2019 subsidiary, will be replaced by company veteran and CEO Eric Jing,Ant said in a statement.Hu's departure from the company comes when Ant is working on plans to switch to a financial portfolio company structure after intense regulatory pressure to subject it to capital rules and requirements similar to those of banks. That pressure abruptly sank Ant's IPO last year, which would have been the largest in the world.Load-Date: March 13, 2021End of Document

From ampoulets to 5G, China fights the West for control of crucial technological standardsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 9, 2021 TuesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1824 wordsBodyAlmost all products in American households, from ampoulets to sofas, windows, and Wi-Fi routers, meet the standards and measurements of a global system set to ensure perfect quality and performance.Industrial standards, created by the United States and its allies for decades, form an invisible matrix of rules that underpin the global market. As mundane as it may seem, this uniformity is critical to international trade in how it ensures that bolts, USB plugs and shipping containers can be used interchangeably around the world. The standards reflect the consensus of international panels long dominated by Western technical experts.China now wants to take the lead in the fields of the future. To the dismay of many Western countries, Beijing is using state funds and political influence to try to define standards for all kinds of cutting-edge technologies covering telecommunications, electricity transmission and artificial intelligence."Mastery of technical standards underpinning information and communications technologies and other emerging fields is an integral part of Beijing's ambitions," the China and U.S. Economic and Security Review Commission of Congress said in its December annual report.China's efforts are driven by a desire to outperform the West as well as to accumulate profits. Standards based on patented technologies often require users to pay licensing fees. Nokia Corp. and Qualcomm Inc., for example, make billions of dollars a year through patents underpinning their rivals' mobile phone systems. China would prefer to make that amount of money by designing standards that fit the technologies developed by its own companies.Standards are gaining urgency as the rules are decided for a new generation of technologies that depend on 5G networks, including driverless vehicles, so-called smart cities and the Internet of Things, advances that will connect the digital and physical worlds like never before.New fields, including facial recognition, touch on privacy and public safety, with greater implications for national security than in the past, according to the Congressional Committee.China is promoting standards that would boost exports from companies with ties to Beijing that would support its state security apparatus, said former Japan trade minister Akira Amari, who heads a group of Japan's ruling party to make society more digital. "If Chinese products are set up to collect data," he said, "you have to work on assuming it will all end up in the hands of the Chinese government."Chinese officials and executives say Beijing is simply learning to maneuver in a system long created and dominated by the West, and that as one of the world's largest and fastest growing economies, China is taking its rightful position in the global business community.Beijing plans to present soon the China Standards 2035, an ambitious plan for leadership in the field. China's standards administration and state cabinet did not respond to requests for comment."Global technical standards are still in the process of being trained," said Dai Hong, a member of China's National Standardization Management Committee, when the project was presented2018. "This gives China's industry and standards the opportunity to outperform the world."In recent years, China has focused more than the West on aligning research and standards in new technologies with its national interest, says researchers and standards specialists who follow Chinese industrial development.Chinese officials lead at least four global standards organizations, including the International Telecommunication Union, a United Nations agency governing telephone and Internet connectivity, and the International Electrotechnical Commission, an industrial group governing electrical and electronic technologies. From 2015 to 2017, a Chinese official led the International Standardization Organization, an industry-led group known as ISO that sells its standards for everything from footwear and management systems to essential oils and sex toys.China's rise in standardization coincides with stagnation among world leaders for a long time. In ISO and similar groups, Chinese delegates hold approximately twice as many secretarial positions as they were ten years ago. Positions influence proposals, discussions and priorities. The number occupied by the old guard, including the US, Germany and the United Kingdom, remains relatively stable.Europe's rivals "are very active in developing international standards in key markets to protect and increase their competitive advantage," EU Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton said in June. If unresponsive, there is a risk of damaging "our economic competitiveness and technological leadership," he said.Germany and other advanced economies pushed China to adopt global standards in the 1990s. Chinese executives and politicians now have one saying: third-tier companies manufacture products. Second-tier companies manufacture technology. World-class companies set standards.Beijing and regional governments provide annual stipends of up to one million yuan, about US$ 155,000, for companies leading the development of international standards in ISO and other agencies, according to official documents.Western funding for the development of standards, which can lead to years of costly research and negotiations, has declined. If we don't implement a change, "we shouldn't be surprised if we end up following Chinese rules," said Christoph Winterhalter, executive director of the German Institute for Standardization, known as DIN.Unlike China's state-run Standardization Administration, DIN is a private organization financed primarily through the sale of corporate rules and quotas. Less than 10% of its funding comes from the government.Breaking traditionChina's ambitions were clear at a 2016 international meeting at peppermill resort in Reno, Nevada. Huawei Technologies Corp. demanded the adoption of its preferred standard for error correction in 5G data transfers: methods to overcome communication failures that could distort information. Qualcomm's proposal of the competition already had broad support.At that meeting of the Third Generation Partnership Project – the global organization that sets 5G standards – Huawei got rid of a tradition of deferential consensus. Tense debates over the final decision lasted until after midnight.Huawei officials toldthe other executives of Chinese companies that attended, who were awaiting their support for the proposal, said Tong Wen, a Huawei researcher involved in the dispute. "And, of course, they did."The stagnation ended with an unprecedented commitment: to adopt both standards, incorporating elements of 5G technologies.A year later, Huawei introduced a candidate to lead one of the organization's most important working groups, challenging a Qualcomm candidate. Prior to the vote, the Chair warned Chinese representatives not to bring telephones to voting booths, a practice of such delegations at some United Nations meetings.The suspicion, confirmed by Chinese delegates from other companies, was that everyone had to show evidence that they voted with Huawei's candidate, a person familiar with the vote said. A Huawei spokesperson said the company acted "in a totally transparent and collaborative manner, in accordance with the spirit and rules of the standards process."Huawei, which holds the most 5G patents from all companies, also leads the Third Generation group with more than 35,000 standards proposals, according to German data analytics firm IPlytics. A quarter has been approved.'It's a trap'In April, when the world first faced covid-19, Chinese ISO delegates in Geneva presented plans for a high-tech city capable of operating in a pandemic. The plans concerned rules for collecting municipal data such as traffic flow and health emergencies. Some delegates wondered whether the proposals instead reflected the Chinese government's penchating for data collection, one participant said at the online meeting."It's a trap," said Amari, the former Japanese trade minister, at the time. Approval would mean that China will "define the standard, export the systems, and then extract data from those systems and collect it in Beijing," he said.Wan Biyu, chief scientist of the Chinese expert group Smart City Joint Labs and author of the proposal, rejected Amari's accusation. National data protection laws may block the collection of personal information, he said.In many next-generation technologies, China leads the proposals for standards because it leads the field. When EU officials recently launched a project to build advanced lithium batteries, they were surprised to learn that China was already setting up an ISO lithium committee, defining one of its Chinese secretariat and appointing committee managers.In projects from Indonesia to Nigeria, Beijing is also using its Belt and Road Initiative to promote Chinese standards, in industries as established as rail and energy transmission. China offers countries subsidies to earn the job and then uses its standards to assure partner countries that they would face significant costs to switch to international standards, industry officials say.China shows little enthusiasm for the rules affecting its sovereignty. In March 2019, the ISO committee that handles systems for writing the world's languages on a Western keyboard received a draft standard for writing Cantonese, a version of Chinese spoken by approximately 65 million people in Hong Kong and southeast China.Technical experts from Hong Kong drafted it in the hope of helping to secure the cultural identity of the territory. TheChinese delegates objected in an email, according to a former European ISO delegate who saw the message, saying that the existing standard for China's official language, Mandarin, was sufficient.At a meeting in Canada two months later, delegates discussed the draft. Hong Kong defenders said Cantonese and Mandarin are mutually unintelligible, despite occupying similar written characters.An unusually large Chinese delegation continued with dozens of slides aggressively attacking the draft, baffling some attendees, three people familiar with the meeting said. One member of the Chinese delegation told The Wall Street Journal that the proposed writing system is used only in Hong Kong, and not by the 60 million Cantonese speakers elsewhere in China.The proposal gained support from countries such as the United States, Canada and Russia, but failed on administrative technicality. In May, the proponents introduced it again and, in September, the manager of the French committee confirmed its approval and advanced it for adoption, people familiar with the process said.Soon after, Russia withdrew its support without explanation, stopping the adoption of the measure at least temporarily. Officials of the Russian standards agency did not respond to requests for comment.Load-Date: February 10, 2021End of Document

Alibaba is pampered again by the market after its challenge to the Chinese governmentCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 25, 2021 ThursdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 636 wordsBodyBefore you become a dragon, you have to suffer like an ant," reads a Chinese proverb that could well describe the current hardships of tech giant Alibaba and its founder, Jack Ma. For forgetting this popular saying, they both had to go through a quarter of suffering, applied from the highest dome of President Xi Jinping's government.It is that in the country of the single party regime, challenging and criticizing the authorities costs very dearly. If Xi himself, who was in his youth a "red prince" (as the sons of the jerarchs of the communist government) fell out of favor because of the dissent of his father, Xi Zhongxun, Mao Zedong's companion during the 1949 Chinese Revolution, will know. For not sharing the ideas of the "Great Helm", Xi was sent with his family to work in the field as a method of political re-education.So when Jack Ma disappeared from the media and official meetings in early November, everyone in the markets feared a similar fate.It is that China's wealthiesn businessman taught himself to defy the power of government by criticizing the state of the public banking system, made up of inefficient and not at all transparent companies. The leaked comments came at the worst time: just as Alibaba was preparing for the IBRO of his financial company Ant Group, which was scheduled for early November last year, but was suspended at the last minute by a government order.Believing himself a "dragon" before "suffering like an ant," President Xi demanded to put the group on the verdict, a way to show who really rules the country. Indeed, last year China had no itch in cutting civil liberties in Hong Kong in order to silence the opposition, even at the risk of damaging the golden egg hen representing its stock market, the fifth largest in global importance.For this reason, Ma's challenge ended as expected: in the best style of the years of the Cultural Revolution of the '60s, which cost a young Xi a lifetime of privilege, punished as well as thousands of intellectuals and university professors.ComebackMa's reappearance at the end of last January seemed to mark the end of the punishment, so all analysts believe that, from now on, the entrepreneur will be much more cautious in expressing his opinions in public.If his disappearance coincided with Ant Group's suspension of IBRO (the transaction was scheduled for $42 billion and was presented as the world's largest bank, with 700 million online customers), his return was orchestrated following the agreement reached between the financial company and the government. This agreement stipulates that Ant transfers its activities to a financial holding company that will be regulated like any bank, with the obligation to maintain lace and compete with the same rules as the entities it preferred to criticize.If Ant's growth project was seriously damaged, as was the value at which it was going to go public, at least Alibaba's intervention was avoidedas a whole, and Ma's return from his "inner exile."In fact, recently the e-commerce giant was able to show its full potential by successfully concluding with a debt placement of $5 billion, facing a total demand of $30 billion, according to Bloomberg agency.This allowed Alibaba to recover some of the market value lost during the last quarter, after Ant's ID was suspended and its founder "vanished." The fall was brutal between November and December 2020: 43% of its value, due to fear that the company would fall out of favor. Since then, he's only recovered 30%.For Andy Halliwell of consultancy Publicis Sapient, "the company's results are solid and many estimate that the shares are undervalued. But if the Chinese government grabs it with the companies that criticize it and takes a more conservative line with its tech companies, investor confidence will be damaged."Load-Date: February 26, 2021End of Document

AT WHITE HOUSE, SENATOR HASSAN AND BIPARTISAN COLLEAGUES DISCUSS SECURING U.S. SUPPLY CHAIN AND CONFRONTING CHINESE GOVERNMENT WITH PRESIDENT BIDEN AND VICE PRESIDENT HARRISStates News ServiceFebruary 25, 2021 ThursdayCopyright 2021 States News ServiceLength: 514 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by New Hampshire Senator Margaret Wood Hassan:At the White House today, U.S. Senator Maggie Hassan (D-NH) and a bipartisan group of her colleagues discussed strengthening the U.S. supply chain with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. President Biden is signing an Executive Order today to address supply chain vulnerabilities in pharmaceutical products and critical minerals, including those used to create semiconductors, for high-tech manufacturing and defense technology."It's essential that we take on the Chinese Communist Party's destabilizing actions and reinvest in U.S. manufacturing in order to protect national security and public health, create good-paying jobs, and power American innovation," said Senator Hassan . "The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored how important it is that we have strong manufacturing capacity including for medical supplies. We must also bring home the manufacturing of advanced technologies, including for 5G infrastructure, in order to address potential shortages and vulnerabilities. I appreciated the opportunity to discuss these pressing issues with President Biden and bipartisan colleagues of mine today, and I will continue to push on a bipartisan basis to stand up to the Chinese government and support American manufacturing."In addition to President Biden, Vice President Harris, and Senator Hassan, participants in today's meeting included Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Senator John Cornyn (R-TX), Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Senator Mike Braun (R-IN), Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Senator Rob Portman (R-OH), Senator Mark Warner (D-VA), Congressman John Joyce (R-PA-13), Congresswoman Doris Matsui (D-CA-06), and Congressman Michael McCaul (R-TX-10).Senator Hassan has worked across the aisle to confront the Chinese government and strengthen American manufacturing. The National Defense Authorization Act included two bipartisan provisions that Senator Hassan worked on to address the rise of China, including an amendment she cosponsored to help spur American-based manufacturing of semiconductors in order to increase competitiveness and decrease reliance on China. The National Defense Authorization Act also included a measure based on a bipartisan bill Senator Hassan cosponsored, the USA Telecommunications Act, which seeks to encourage and support U.S. innovation in the race for 5G by providing funds to support research and development in Western-based alternatives to Chinese equipment providers Huawei and ZTE. The Senate last year also passed a bipartisan bill that Senator Hassan and colleagues introduced that would require the U.S. to partner with allies in the Indo-Pacific region, Europe, and elsewhere to develop a unified approach to address the rise of China.In addition, Senator Hassan has worked to strengthen research and development in the U.S., introducing the bipartisan American Innovation and Jobs Act to support research and development (RandD) investments by innovative startups and by established companies making major RandD investments.###Load-Date: February 25, 2021End of Document

PROTESTS FORCE MYANMAR'S ETHNIC CHINESE TO DISTINGUISH THEMSELVES FROM CHINAStates News ServiceMarch 16, 2021 TuesdayCopyright 2021 States News ServiceLength: 1513 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Defiant anti-junta protests in Yangon and cities across Myanmar were suppressed by military gunfire that killed five protesters Tuesday, as grieving families buried their dead from violence in Yangon and China issued a warning to protect Chinese businesses after dozens were vandalized, looted and burned in previous days.The five slain protesters raised to 181 the death toll RFA has recorded as of Tuesday, including four additional fatalities from Monday, in the six weeks of protests since the Feb. 1 military coup that deposed the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi.Tuesday saw emotive scenes as bereaved families held funerals of people killed by security forces, including Khat Nyar Hein, a first-year medical student and member of the country's ethnic Chinese community who was shot dead by the police in Yangon on Sunday, the deadliest day since the coup.Today I lost my son. He was a good son. My heart aches. My heart is full of pain, said the young man's mother, speaking in Mandarin.Security forces shot 17-year-old Khant Nyar Hein in the head on Sunday during anti-coup protests in Yangon's Tamwe township. Citizen video shows police approaching his body, beating up and arresting a young woman who was trying to help him, then later dragging his body away.His mother pleaded in a video posted on social media for Myanmar's people to differentiate between ethnic Chinese citizens of the Southeast Asian country, who are among the millions of Myanmar people who oppose the coup, and the People's Republic of China in Beijing.I don't love your government'China has protected the junta from international diplomatic pressure at the United Nations, but called for legal action over arson attacks on dozens of Chinese-invested garment factories in Yangon on Sunday.I am authentic Chinese, but I don't love your government there. Not a single bit, the slain student's mother said in comments apparently directed at Beijing.The father of Khant Nyar Hein also weighed in, saying I hope [the Chinese government] will have sympathy for ethnic Chinese people in Myanmar and for our democracy movement and overturn this coup government.Like the ethnic Chinese in Myanmar, democratic Taiwan has taken great pains since the weekend attacks to inform the local population that it has no connection to China.Taiwan's representative office in Myanmar has suggested Taiwanese businesspeople hang signs in Burmese reading Taiwanese company' at their factories and to hang our country's national flag, and explain to local workers and neighbors they are a Taiwanese factory, to avoid outsiders getting confused and misjudging, Reuters news agency reported on Monday from Taipei.Ethnic Chinese, one of multiethnic Myanmar's 135 recognized ethnic groups, make up about three percent of the country's population of 54 million.After arson attacks on 32 Chinese-funded factories in several Yangon townships Sunday and Monday, causing what China's state media was nearly 240 million yuan (U.S. $37 million) in damages, Beijing stepped up pressure on military authorities to quell the protests and to protect Chinese interests in the country.The rising anti-China sentiment could strain the relationship between the two countries and put the already besieged Myanmar economy under greater duress, said an editorial by China's state-run CGTN.If it is proven that Myanmar cannot ensure the safety of foreign investments and personnel, it wouldn't only turn off Chinese investment but all investment from overseas,' it said on Monday.Chinese businesses create a large number of employment opportunities and help promote Myanmar's economic and social development, it said. We hope the Myanmar side will take further effective measures to ensure the safety of life and property of Chinese enterprises and personnel.Martial lawMyanmar political analyst Than Soe Naing told RFA that the situation became worse when the two Chinese factories in Hlaingthaya and Shwepyitha townships were hit in arson attacks Monday.The declaration of martial law is the result of the Chinese Embassy's call for an effective deterrent action, he said, echoing the widespread belief that China can influence the junta.Despite rising risk of death or injury from the increasingly aggressive junta forces, defiant anti-junta protests carried on in the cities of Yangon, Mandalay, Magway, Monywa, and Loikaw and in other parts of the country, which is the size of France.Security forces killed two protesters were killed in Kawlin, in the northwestern region of Sagaing, as more than 3,000 demonstrators rallied at the township administrator's residence, witnesses said.One of the people killed was a man in his 40s who was hit when police dispersed crowds in front of the residence, said a witness who did not provide his name.The bullet went through his arm and through his chest, he said. We can confirm he's dead. We heard there were two others injured, but we don't know exactly how many in all.When protesters regrouped in the afternoon and surrounded the police station, gunfire was heard, the witness added.Migrant workers trapped by violenceIn Hlaingthaya township, a factory zone west of Yangon that was the scene of more than 50 deaths Monday, demonstrators staged anti-military protests in defiance of martial law, only to be met with more violence by security personnel.Police and soldiers chased the protesters even into small alleyways and fired indiscriminately, said one witness. The number of casualties is not known yet.He said protesters did not confront police and soldiers because their numbers were large and they had brought in bulldozers to clear away protester barricades.Thousands of migrant workers from other parts of Myanmar had been trying to leave the township since early morning to escape the crackdown, a township resident said.The migrant workers are leaving for their hometowns because of insecurity here. There are no jobs around for them, and they have to take up the duties of security guards at night, he said.People cannot move around safely in the wards given indiscriminate shooting that has occurred for the last three days, he added.Another unnamed man said that the wards are almost deserted.We all are furious. To say it frankly, we just want to hit them back, he said, referring to security forces.Indiscriminate gunfire kills teenVideo footage of soldiers and police brutally suppressing people at a peaceful nighttime sit-in Yangon's Dawbon township on Monday have gone viral on social media, with one clip showing security personnel shooting a demonstrator and dragging him naked on the a street.Protests were staged in other townships in Yangon region, also under martial law, including North Okkalapa, where scores of young people led a demonstration, and in North Dagon, where security forces cleared makeshift barricades set up by protesters and fired their rifles down side roads, damaging cars and houses.The more they press, the more we will rise up, said one defiant township resident. Everything the military council is doing is total injustice. The security of the people has been diminishing. Some people are now having ideas to fight back until death.One protester died during a crackdown in South Dagon, witnesses told RFA.In Mandalay's Thabeikkyin township, a 14-year-old girl and a man were killed when police and soldiers fired at protesters, residents said.Local residents who were checking traffic entering their town from Mogok to the north of Mandalay, confronted policemen inside a car who shot their way out as they left the scene. About 200 soldiers who entered the area fired indiscriminately at residents, hitting the teenager who was in her house, residents said.Several others were injured, some seriously, and about 20 people were taken away by security forces, they said.The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP), a watchdog group, said that as of Tuesday, 2,181 people had been arrested, charged, or sentenced in relation to the military coup, with 1,862 still being held or with outstanding warrants.In the ancient town of Bagan, about 2,200 civil servants, including police, bankers, and General Administration Department staffers, comprising over 80 percent of state employees in the area, have joined the civil disobedience movement running in tandem with the protests, locals said.Some of the workers have stood their ground despite threats by their superiors angry that the striking employees have nearly brought services to a stop.They have prepared themselves to carry out the worst human rights violations, activist Nickey Diamond from the Southeast Asia-based Fortify Rights NGO, referring to the ruling military council.They have taken up positions in every township and have killed and injured many protesters. Their actions can be seen as crimes against humanity, he told RFA.RFA was unable to reach a military spokesman for comment.Reported by RFA's Myanmar Service. Translated by Khin Maung Nyane.

THE PROGRESSIVE CASE FOR UNIVERSAL INTERNET ACCESS: HOW TO CLOSE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE BY 2030States News ServiceMarch 2, 2021 TuesdayCopyright 2021 States News ServiceLength: 9248 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: LONDON BodyThe following information was released by the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change:Foreword by Tony BlairToday, the internet is the beating heart of the world. And just as the roads, railways and canals provided the arteries for commerce in the Industrial Revolution, today's network infrastructure is the circulatory system on which much of modern life depends. Without it, the ramifications of Covid-19 would have been far more severe.That we have been able to use the internet to mitigate the impact of the pandemic is a small relief, but the Covid-19 crisis has emphasised the importance of everyone being connected in the future. Eradicating extreme poverty, solving the global education crisis, building better health-care systems and responding to pandemics effectively all require connectivity. For low-income countries, being largely excluded from the exponential potential of the internet means that they cannot transform their nations. It is extraordinary that today half the world remains offline.Closing the digital divide by 2030 should be one of the primary global policy priorities. Accelerating internet expansion will drive economic growth and enable progress and as this report from my Institute demonstrates the benefits of investment vastly offset the costs. It outlines the urgent action required on stimulating demand, regulatory reform and greater global coordination, and how a new digital coalition needs to be formed to transform opportunity and access for billions of people.But prioritising internet access is not only about poverty alleviation. During these past years of isolationist and unilateralist policymaking by Western governments, China has been taking a more dominant role in developing economies. It has been investing in digital hardware infrastructure, taking an active role within international bodies and influencing the standards and values that underpin the internet.This requires strong global leadership. Collaborating with China, as well as competing. Stewarding the right global coalitions around investment to achieve universal internet access. Leadership with the vision, commitment and confidence to establish the internet for a prosperous and inclusive global society.We've lost our way on this in recent years, but an open and connected world will be the lifeblood for our future growth. It's time that we make it a reality.Tony BlairExecutive ChairmanForeword by Mathew Oommen, President, Reliance JioForeword by Mathew OommenThe Covid-19 pandemic has thrown out the usual playbook for economies, societies, businesses and governments around the world, and, in the process, it has accelerated the transformation to digital by as many as ten years. This shift has underscored the imperative to embrace and cultivate digital transformation across all industries, and in doing so, it has shone a stark light on the plight of the unconnected.While great strides have been made to promote connectivity on a global scale, 46 per cent of the world's population still does not have access to broadband connectivity. The pandemic has been a reality check for those countries and economies slow to adopt a strategy to connect the unconnected.Access to education, improving health care, building sustainable cities, achieving gender equality, delivering clean energy, driving economic growth and eliminating poverty all require access to digital services and technology. Nearly every aspect of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals and the revitalisation of the global economy depends upon access to broadband connectivity, the internet and digital platforms.Health, education, governance and commerce have all made a dramatic shift to online platforms and applications. Digital interaction has become the de facto mechanism for families, communities and corporations to connect, communicate and collaborate.Connectivity has become a necessity, and to lack connectivity is to lack the ability to fully participate in society and the economy.In India, Reliance Jio was the first to offer free voice and affordable 4G data, fundamentally disrupting the digital divide and providing the ability for all to connect to the internet. Using this approach, Jio has led the digital transition, enabling all Indians to realise the full benefits of access to health information, public services and citizen services, including digital payments and ecommerce. New technologies are helping to reduce pollution, improve resilience to climate change and increase energy efficiency. With access to broadband, the new digital economy has accelerated adoption of several socioeconomic platforms, including proliferation of the India Digital Stack of Aadhar (Universal Identity) and the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), and it has had a significant impact on the way people live and work.It is Jio's relentless drive to connect all of India to broadband. This is an essential and crucial first step to ensure full participation in and access to the new digital society. Universal access is critical to uplifting everyone across all income levels. The ability to access the internet provides a truly level playing field and a clear and sustainable path towards long-term economic and societal growth. By designing and developing the most affordable 4G phone in the world, the highly intuitive Jio Phone has been instrumental in providing universal access to the internet.Since day one, Jio's guiding principle has been to provide affordable, high-quality broadband to meet the inherent demand among the unconnected across India. To effect change, we fundamentally transformed and disrupted business and service models, creating and using new technology and processes that addressed the aspirations of all of India.Just four years ago, Jio was deployed as a green field, all-IP, all-4G Pan India network to ensure the greatest broadband reach. We invested in technology and talent development. We implemented an extensive fibre network and created a suite of applications, affordable devices, energy-efficient towers and sites, and meaningful digital platforms and services. Today, Jio reaches over 99 per cent of India's 1.4 billion population and has over 400 million users.Global collaboration and a coordinated effort consisting of public and private investors is imperative to accelerate connectivity in those countries still lacking broadband. Capturing the gains of the digital economy will require streamlining regulations, making it easier for startups to launch and scale, as well as introducing policies to facilitate retraining and new economy jobs for workers.Funding for digital initiatives must increase, as should policies that drive innovation and investment that equalises access to and the availability of digital connectivity and services of meaning to all people. While some organisations and governments may rethink their digital transformation as the economy has slowed due to Covid-19, it is essential that we instead use this time to expand and grow connectivity so that no one is left behind.All stakeholders need to respond effectively if the unconnected regions are to achieve their digital potential. Businesses must anticipate the digital future and invest in building capabilities, including partnering with universities and cultivating talent to deliver digital projects. Governments will need to invest in digital infrastructure and public data that organisations can leverage, all while putting in place strong privacy and security safeguards.The quantum leap in digital acceleration has driven significant change in the daily life of consumers, businesses and government, highlighting the importance and value of technology. We cannot fail to capitalise on this opportunity to bring access and, more importantly, value to all.Mathew OommenPresident, Reliance JioExecutive SummaryThe internet is a fundamental part of daily life. The connectivity it provides underpins social and economic interactions in the 21st century. This has been brought into sharp relief by the pandemic as many of us have migrated online to continue to work, to learn, to stay in touch, to buy food to eat. Yet half of the world remains cut off from these opportunities.The world is blighted by a digital divide. In total, 3.7 billion people have no internet access. The majority are in low- or middle-income countries (LMICs). In the developed world, just 13 per cent of people lack a connection compared with 53 per cent in developing nations, and 81 per cent in the least developed countries. Along with the country a person lives in, gender is also a factor: Globally, women are 23 per cent less likely than men to use mobile internet.The digital divide matters because it stands squarely in the way of progress. For LMICs seeking to transform their economies, it is increasingly the case that they cannot do so without the internet. Likewise, internet access is essential in efforts to eradicate poverty, improve education and build effective health-care systems, and it has a significant role to play in responding to crises like the Covid-19 pandemic. (The Tony Blair Institute, for instance, has partnered with Oracle to deliver a cloud-based Health Management System launching initially in Ghana and Rwanda to help countries manage essential vaccination programmes by creating an electronic health record.)The potential benefits of universal internet access far outweigh the costs of achieving it. The returns to GDP alone for LMICs are vast compared to the investment that would be necessary to bring everyone online. And there are wider socioeconomic benefits that internet access affords. These include improved health and education outcomes, and potential redress of gender inequalities through financial inclusion. This is particularly true if internet access is rolled out as a central feature of countries' socioeconomic development plans, working together, for instance, with their agro-industrialisation strategies.But expanding internet access doesn't only help to alleviate poverty and develop entire nations. A better-connected world benefits all countries, and building an open internet based on liberal values should be a foreign policy priority.China's influence on internet access in LMICs presents serious geopolitical and security challenges including cybersecurity and the fact that social media is a critical source of information for intelligence services today. Developing countries are highly unlikely to shift away from the use of China's technology in this space, so Western democracies and other democratic countries such as South Korea and Japan need to collaborate with China as well as compete. The imperative must be to build an open and inclusive internet infrastructure that is premised on human dignity, liberty and freedom, enabling all people to forge their own opportunities to learn, to innovate and to thrive. Creating a universally accessible internet based on these liberal values should be a key area of cooperation for the Biden administration and European leaders as they re-establish the transatlantic alliance.Closing the Digital Divide as a Global Policy PriorityThere are several global initiatives and coalitions focused on addressing digital inequality, and progress is being made but as yet there has not been the political leadership to drive this agenda forward with the urgency required. The Biden administration could well provide the leadership that this critical challenge requires. If the United States and other liberal democracies hope to lead the world in the 21st century, they must ensure that global access to information is protected. If China can cement its digital infrastructure throughout the developing world, it not only diminishes the influence of the United States and other liberal democratic countries abroad but could also lead to national security risks further down the road.We estimate drawing on existing analysis that the investment necessary to close the digital divide by 2030 is approximately $450 billion. To put this cost in perspective, raising these funds would require member countries of the Development Assistance Committee an arm of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to contribute 0.02 per cent of their gross national income (GNI) per year. That is the equivalent of just 3 per cent of the 0.7 per cent overseas development assistance (ODA) aid target set by the UN and which the UK once adhered to a small price to pay for a foundational investment that would enable low- and middle-income countries to forge their own paths to prosperity.But this is not just about investment. Closing the digital divide requires a roadmap to detail how universal internet access can be achieved by 2030. Based on our analysis, we propose three key policy recommendations.First, a coordinated effort to stimulate demand for 4G or equivalent broadband technologies, to make more infrastructure investments viable.The private sector can and should provide investment to expand 4G or equivalent broadband coverage, but it needs a market to drive that demand. Public investment of approximately $58 billion to increase smartphone access, build digital skills and improve internet content to make it relevant to those offline will go some way towards building up that demand for 4G or equivalent broadband networks, and could help lay the foundations for 5G in the near future.Regional coordination, such as that currently exhibited by Smart Africa, can drive down the costs associated with accessing the internet data and smartphones that prohibit much of the developing world from coming online now.It is essential that efforts to address the digital divide are situated as part of the emerging industrialisation plans of many LMICs. Efforts to transform entire economies so that jobs can be created and household incomes expanded across countries are key to stimulating demand. The connection between digitalisation and industrialisation is multifaceted and is one that merits further analysis in future research.Second, regulatory and policy reforms to open up markets and drive down prices for consumers.Regulatory changes will be essential in closing the digital divide. These must aim to both increase ICT market competition and also reduce taxes on basic smartphones and data that currently contribute to access being prohibitively expensive. National broadband plans will be critical to ensure public investments are more effective and are coordinated with private investment.Some administrations in LMICs may find it politically difficult to take the right policy steps to drive universal internet access. Donor countries can support leaders to make the politically or indeed fiscally challenging policy changes now, in order to reap the benefits of universal internet access in the medium term.Third, global coordination to diversify and expand investment vehicles for 4G or equivalent broadband coverage.More than 85 per cent of the investment required will need to address 4G or equivalent broadband network expansion and maintenance. It is anticipated that the private sector can and should meet 75 per cent of this investment, with public investment focusing on the most commercially unviable investments. But the current market for 4G or equivalent broadband network expansion is not fit for purpose. Universal 4G or equivalent coverage needs to be facilitated by boosts to demand from public investment and national regulatory change, as well as global coordination to diversify the range of investment vehicles available to make it commercially viable.Fixing this requires an investment coalition of institutional and global investors to increase the risk appetite and diversify the funds and vehicle structures available to meet the demand for 4G or equivalent broadband networks. It will also require political capital and capacity to coordinate with governments' existing infrastructure works to ensure 4G or equivalent broadband expansion is achieved at marginal cost.The Political MomentMaking faster progress on universal internet access will take determined geopolitical leadership. This should be a key agenda item for the G20 taking place in Rome in October 2021. The Italian presidency has made it a priority. As Prime Minister Mario Draghi looks to re-establish the transatlantic alliance, this could be a key area of cooperation for the US and European nations.As we have highlighted, closing the digital divide is not only about solving global poverty but also about a statement of values: freedom, inclusion and opportunity for all.The Sustainable Development Goals were an urgent call in 2016 to all countries to solve the most pressing development challenges by 2030. If universal internet access is not achieved by then, the digital divide we see today will only intensify existing inequalities. Solving the digital divide now with universal internet access built on liberal values is fundamental to building a prosperous and inclusive global society for generations to come.IntroductionThroughout the Covid-19 pandemic, internet access has been critical for the continuation of our 'normal' lives, including work, relationships and commerce. Increasingly, it is also where we engage with government and receive public services.But half of the world is still not connected to the internet.One of the most significant and lasting impacts of the pandemic will be the seismic transition from analogue to digital in every aspect of our lives. The opportunity cost for those who are still not online will only grow. The digital divide is already magnifying existing inequalities, and this will intensify as more elements of our work, and public and private lives, are facilitated by digital technologies.The Time Is NowTechnology develops at an exponential rate, in a way that no other sector does. The rapid rate of technological change creates an ever-growing opportunity cost for countries that do not invest in the foundations for internet-enabled growth and transformation. If countries do not invest soon, this will hold back development across all sectors, from health care to education.The pandemic has revealed the vast disparities presented by the digital divide. For example, 94 per cent of learners were forced online regardless of whether students had connectivity or safe access to the internet. The World Bank has estimated that, without remedial action, it expects a $10 trillion loss in future earnings for the generation of students subjected to pandemic-related school closures in 2020 and 2021. This is exacerbating the already acute crisis in education across much of the developing world, with leaders only now understanding how essential connectivity and technology will be to recouping lost education for students, and supporting the recovery of economies and societies as the pandemic eases.This growing inequality in education is being replicated across the human development indicators, with devastating macroeconomic impacts; developing economies are expected to contract by 2.5 per cent, their weakest performance for at least 60 years. Up to 100 million people are thought to have been pushed into extreme poverty in 2020, erasing all progress made in the last five years to put an end to people living in these circumstances by 2030.As many of us migrated online to continue our work, our studies, and our social and civic engagements, the vast majority of the developing world remained shut out. If they remain offline, with extremely limited access or with suboptimal connectivity (such as 2G or 3G), they will miss out on a devastating number of opportunities. Internet access would aid post-Covid-19 recovery and give people access to advanced technologies which could help them overcome everyday challenges for example personalised and adaptive learning software or AI-powered health detection and management applications. Universal internet access is pivotal to a leapfrog model of transformational development, enabling countries to bypass traditional stages of development to either jump directly to the latest technologies or explore an alternative path of technological development involving emerging technologies that offer new benefits and opportunities.The Sustainable Development Goal target 9c aimed to provide universal and affordable access to the internet in the least-developed countries by 2020. This ambitious target has already been missed. Given its deadline coincided with the year that Covid-19 ravaged the world, this should mark the moment where we meaningfully galvanise support to reach this goal within the decade.This is in all of our interests. Connecting the world will create new channels for the interchange of knowledge and information, adding to our collective understanding and creating new ideas. It will provide new economic activity and opportunity. It is a technological grand challenge and ambitious common goal that we should work towards solving today. This will require new digital coalitions for change which, as worries about the implications of a "splinternet" (or a divided internet, controlled and regulated by different countries) continue to increase, should commit to the principles of open technologies and standards. The splinternet is no longer just a concept; it is now a reality. This presents profound geopolitical and security challenges, including cybersecurity. Social media, for example, is a critical source of information for intelligence services today.There are also strong economic reasons for investing in expanding internet access. The half of the world's population that is currently unconnected represents a significant market opportunity. The Chinese government and Chinese companies are investing heavily in LMICs in Africa and elsewhere. The West must be able to match China and others on this front.This agenda should be a priority for the Biden administration and the European Union, but it cannot be unilateral. It should be about wider re-engagement with countries committed to the same values. For those who believe in an open and interconnected world and want strong national security and economic prosperity in the 21st century, creating internet-era infrastructure for all should be a key concern.Defining the Digital DivideForty-six per cent of the world's population does not have access to 4G. This is in part driven by a lack of 4G coverage, but the reasons for limited uptake extend beyond this.In sub-Saharan Africa, for example, only 10 per cent of the population is using 4G, although half of the population is covered by a 4G signal. The majority of those not accessing the internet are either unable to afford it, do not know how to or do not see the utility in doing so, as opposed to not having an internet signal.Closing the digital divide involves more than just providing broadband coverage. There are a variety of reasons why people do not access the internet. In 2018, the global telecommunications industry body the GSMA conducted a survey across low- and middle-income countries in key regions to illustrate the leading barriers to accessing the internet:barrier to using mobile internet identified by mobile users who are aware of mobile internet but do not use it, averaged across surveyed markets.Affordability, literacy and digital skills, and a lack of content that is locally relevant are usually cited as the most significant barriers to access according to the GSMA survey. These reasons were ranked higher, in fact, than access to a network. There are also some specific hurdles to overcome on a regional level. Perceived and actual safety and security online, for example, presented a great barrier for many in Latin America, but far less so in South Asia.Another barrier highlighted, "family does not approve", alludes to gender and other cultural factors that prohibit, or at least dissuade, the use of the internet by certain groups. The proportion of women globally using the internet is 48 per cent as compared to 58 per cent of men, and this digital gender gap is growing in developed countries. Digital exclusion is also amplified across social and cultural lines, affecting migrants, refugees, internally displaced persons, older people, young people, children, people with disabilities, rural populations and indigenous peoples.For the purpose of this report, we identify the following four barriers as the leading issues preventing universal internet access:Access to affordable data. A universal benchmark advocated by the Alliance for Affordable Internet (A4AI) defines affordability as "1 for 2": where 1GB of mobile broadband data is priced at 2 per cent or less of average monthly income.1 So far adopted by the UN Broadband Commission, the Economic Commission of West African States (ECOWAS), Nigeria, and Ghana.Access to an affordable 4G-compatible device. This is predominantly a smartphone2 A4AI's review into meaningful connectivity identified smartphones as the predominant means by which people access the internet (89 per cent based on a survey conducted across Colombia, Ghana and Indonesia), as opposed to only 2.3 per cent of respondents that used another device without a mobile phone. A smartphone is a mobile communication device distinguished by its operating system, its ability to download third-party applications, and its touchscreen of at least three inches. but can include any 4G-compatible device capable of running 4G-powered applications (e.g., MiFi or a 4G dongle, but not a feature phone).3 A feature phone is a mobile communication device that has the functions of a basic phone and some internet capabilities, even if limited to pre-selected applications or to basic HTML pages. These devices commonly have a 12-key touchpad or a tactile keyboard. There is currently no global metric for what constitutes "affordability" but drawing on the affordability metrics for data should offer a meaningful comparator.Digital skills and relevant content. This means the literacy and basic skills to not only access the internet itself, but the content available on it to make access a meaningful experience.4 See GSMA's 'Figure 1: Stages of digital literacy' for steps to becoming digitally literate, and 'Figure 3: Percentage of female and male respondents who cited technical literacy and confidence-related barriers to using a mobile phone, in Accelerating Digital Literacy: Empowering women to use the mobile internet, 2015 Content including government-provided (such as government services), commercial and user-generated needs to be locally relevant based on language and subject to provide an incentive to get online.Coverage by a 4G or equivalent broadband network. Although 4G access was not cited as the leading barrier by some margin in the GSMA survey, it is nonetheless critical to transformational development. 4G and equivalent technologies (highlighted in Annex C) will enable advanced applications to be developed and used, with the potential for leapfrogging. Many basic online activities which fuel productivity and prosperity rely on a 4G or equivalent connection, with enough bandwidth and low enough latency to watch videos without buffering, conduct video calls without delay and participate in activities in real time as if they were in the same room.While online security and safety and horizontal inequalities are also significant barriers to access for large proportions of the developing world, we chose not to address these directly in our analysis. This is in keeping with much of the existing literature that identifies the above barriers as the primary roadblocks to access.5 See [ITU/A4AI; GSMA; World Bank]Furthermore, increasing affordability, expanding digital skills and enhancing the relevance of internet content to meet the needs of citizens will begin to address some of the inequalities currently amplified in digital access.Online security and safety concerns must be targeted as part of a holistic digital-skills curriculum. Children and adults alike should learn about responsible internet use and ethical engagement online, allowing them to build key 21st-century skills around critical thinking and problem solving in order to considerately engage with, sift and balance the wide range of views and information online.The financial and political threats posed by cyber criminals, or even governments themselves, are risks that are beyond the scope of this report. Policymakers liaising with law enforcement will need to build up credible mechanisms to protect users from cyber criminality and will need to draw on regional and international cooperation to do so. The risk that authoritarian-leaning governments may use internet access as an instrument of political control and deterrence is in some cases a very real threat, but it is one that should be met with meaningful engagement and not be used as an excuse to deny internet access to the citizens of those countries. Political suppression through internet use remains part of the wider geopolitical case for the Global North to influence the values around which, and therefore the mode with which, internet access is expanded.The Progressive Case for ActionInternet Access Accelerates DevelopmentUniversal internet access will underpin the achievement of all the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) from the human development ambitions set out in Quality Education (SDG4) and Gender Equality (SDG5), to economic growth through the Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure (SDG9) targets.Increasing internet penetration has a significant macroeconomic impact: In low-income countries, a 10 per cent increase in mobile broadband penetration yields a 2 per cent increase in GDP; and, for middle-income countries, a 10 per cent increase in both mobile and fixed broadband penetration yields a 1.8 per cent and 0.5 per cent increase in GDP respectively. For low-income countries that continue on the trajectory towards middle income, increases in fixed broadband penetration will have a further positive impact on their economies.But the effects of universal internet access are not just felt in productivity gains. It can also transform millions indeed billions of lives. The arrival of fast internet in Africa, for example, has yielded an estimated increase of between 6.9 and 13.2 per cent in jobs, regardless of education level. And this statistic does not just represent the formalisation of existing jobs, but the creation of new and better-quality jobs that are aligned with SDG8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), with fewer workers holding jobs in unskilled occupations when fast internet is available. Increasing internet penetration levels to 75 per cent of the population in all developing countries is estimated to create more than 140 million jobs around the world.Increased internet access is and will be transformational for individual sectors and industries, too, as seen in the wider economic transformation experienced by China and the "Asian miracles" in the second half of the last century. This is often considered the holy grail of development policy: the transformation of a low-productivity, agricultural-based economy into an advanced, highly industrialised one. To achieve this, developing countries must reach 21st-century levels of digital access and technologies in order to compete globally. For example, increased access to mobile phones and the internet for farmers reduces the price of inputs and asymmetries in information, and provides real-time data (such as accurate weather forecasts) alongside better advice on agriculture practices and inputs. This allows farmers in the developing world to compete more favourably with their global competitors. Universal internet access also paves the way for more advanced AgTech, which has the potential to revolutionise the industry. This will be critical for economic transformation, addressing poverty (SDG1) and improving food security (SDG2).Universal internet access will significantly address global inequality and inclusivity, specific to SDG10 (Reduced Inequalities) but important to all the goals. It is estimated that there are 1.7 billion "unbanked" people in the world i.e., those without access to traditional financial services who would benefit from fintech by sending and receiving payments within and across borders, and accessing credit in ways that analogue methods of identification do not permit. Moreover, fintech and e-commerce promise to address the stark gender inequalities (SDG5) prevalent in financial inclusion. Digital financial services are expanding opportunities for women, increasing their engagement in the formal economy and strengthening their resilience to financial, economic and health shocks. The e-commerce revolution is reshaping the global business environment to provide more opportunity for small businesses, especially those headed by women.Returning to education, internet access not only increases access to learning, but also can improve educational outcomes. Connecting every school would make a vast array of content available to teachers and students, and empower learners to build their confidence online and develop their own discipline of knowledge-seeking. In addition, rapidly evolving advanced technology such as EdTech applications are becoming more adaptive and responsive to individual learners' needs, which could help bridge both the shortfall of approximately 69 million teachers by 2030 and the current global learning crisis in accessing quality education (SDG4).The role of big data premised on widespread mobile broadband penetration and digitised health systems in supporting epidemic preparedness and response was well documented prior to Covid-19, and will now become integral to vaccine rollout and future pandemic-preparedness strategies. Digital health innovation will also be instrumental in addressing non-communicable diseases, which account for 70 per cent of deaths worldwide (three-quarters of which occur in the developing world). And advanced technologies such as AI could begin to address the acute deficit of 18 million health-care professionals anticipated by 2030 through many promising widespread innovations in clinical care pathways (prognoses and diagnoses); patient-facing solutions, such as personalised health advice and information provision; and far-reaching efficiencies in areas like health-systems management, drug discovery and clinical-trial design.Furthermore, the transition to digital public-service delivery more broadly will yield many benefits, from cost savings and efficiencies to greater civic engagement. In the medium term this will outweigh the cost of transitioning from an analogue to digital model of government engagement, bringing related improvements to governance and transparency in public transactions too. Over time, these financial savings will likely outweigh the investments made to provide online access to all. An example of the vast progress that digital solutions can deliver for public-service delivery is the Copenhagen Consensus's advice to the government of Bangladesh on prioritising development funding. Two digital solutions were recommended to bolster the delivery of public services: first, moving to an "e-procurement" platform to lower the costs and corruption association with the current outdated system; and, second, digitising the land-records system to deliver greater transparency and efficiencies.Digital identification, or digital ID, is a primary example of how securing universal internet access can provide opportunities for significant returns on investment, contributing to the overall sustainability of efforts to close the digital divide. A secure, well-designed digital ID system can provide countries with a cross-sector platform that enables them to leapfrog to more efficient and modern systems, thus enhancing service delivery. Beyond developmental uses, digital identity promises to generate significant savings. Potential fiscal benefits include reducing fraud and inclusion errors in government-to-person transfers; lowering administrative costs; increasing tax collection; stimulating sales of goods and services; and improving labour productivity. Digital ID can therefore deliver significant economic value for the public sector, particularly in developing countries.This is already being realised in some countries. In Botswana, biometric enrolment of pensions and social grants achieved savings of 25 per cent by identifying duplicate records and deceased beneficiaries. Similarly, in Nigeria, biometric audits reduced the federal pension roll by 40 per cent. The government of India has reported estimated fiscal gains of more than INR 825 billion ($11.31 billion at current exchange rates) between 2013 and 2018 as a result of digital ID-enabled direct benefits transfers combined with reforms to beneficiary identification, and refined targeting of social programmes and subsidies. While the exact return on investment can be disputed, these savings are thought to be around nine times the cost of implementing Aadhaar, the digital-identity system used in India.6 However, the full methods and data for calculating these figures have not been made public, and there have been many high-profile debates that dispute the government's claims of savings from Aadhaar. See https://thewire.in/economy/the-curious-case-of-the-world-bank-and-aadhaar-savings ; https://qz.com/india/1519209/why-india-cant-cite-world-bank-to-brag-about-aadhaar. There is therefore clear evidence that the investment to achieve universal internet access including subsidising access for those most marginalised in society would be economically advantageous.Covid-19 has had a catastrophic impact on human life with dire economic ramifications for countries of all development levels. Yet not all outcomes are negative. One of the lasting repercussions will be the accelerated transition from analogue to digital government. The arguments for digital ID and "government-as-a-platform" were being made well before Covid-19 but, in the coming months, these concepts will become ever more critical to vaccination rollouts, mass testing and real-time track-and-trace services in order for life and the economy to resume as quickly as possible. None of this is possible without internet access, and this pandemic has illustrated how fundamental digital public-service delivery and engagement will be to building resilience ahead of future health disasters.These are just some of the ways in which increased internet access is and will be transformational for development. When a developing country faces challenges with food, water, electricity, sanitation and health, it may seem counterintuitive to prioritise the expansion of internet access. However, research shows that digital solutions to address these problems can often be the most transformative and cost-effective. For example, the Copenhagen Consensus analysed the investment opportunities that would best address the main binding constraints to growth and development in Bangladesh and Haiti. The researchers proposed two digital solutions among their top ten recommendations. In Haiti, one of these recommendations was increasing internet coverage to 50 per cent of the population.Closing the Divide Benefits EveryoneUniversal internet access should be a key component in the growth plans for every country. For developing countries, it should be a critical element in their economic transformation strategies without it they will fall further and further behind in an increasingly connected and digital 21st century. For advanced countries, this means a drawing away from aid dependency: Closing the digital divide will be critical to poor countries' self-sufficiency as it will lead to transformational development.For donor countries, the benefits of investing in universal internet access are real and are not limited to eventual reductions in foreign aid. International trade flows have been shifting away from a concentration in Global North-to-North, and even South-to-North, trade. North-to-South trade flows are already equal to those between North-to-North, and demographic trends indicate that this shift will only grow. Already, middle-class populations in advanced economies represent only 25 per cent of the world's middle-class population. Growth of this demographic in the Global South is booming and expected to increase at a rate of 6 per cent or more per year, compared with a more moderate growth rate of 0.5 to 1 per cent in the North.China already hosts the largest middle-class consumption market segment in the world, and by 2030 it will be overtaken by India, which will also surpass the US. The larger markets in the Global South Brazil, Mexico, Pakistan, Indonesia, Egypt, Nigeria and Vietnam each already host middle-class populations of over 100 million. Not only do the middle classes in the South offer a huge growth opportunity for companies in the North, but their share of e-commerce growth as a percentage of all retail spending is growing significantly. The tide of trade, in part driven by globalisation and a rapidly digitalising world, is changing and these growth markets will be ignited by universal internet access.Rich countries will depend on the Global South to sustain their own export-led growth. This trade evolution over the last 50 years, with production also shifting from rich countries to key markets in the East, has presented its own challenges to the Global North, including slower than expected labour-market adjustments for those whose jobs have been offshored. While governments in the Global North must invest significantly in their own readjustment policies to support those struggling labour groups, the growing markets in the Global South will be critical to the Global North's future prosperity and resilience.On a macro level, the case for free trade is still hugely compelling and, for those who believe in the power of information and an interconnected world, the opening up of new nodes of knowledge is therefore also about enlightened self-interest. The transformative potential of internet access can create new wealth avenues for millions of people, with an open internet and more users providing the foundation for more choice and innovation in the global market.The Internet, Inclusion and Liberal ValuesThis belief in economic openness and the power of technology extends further into the values and priorities that the centre of politics should pursue today. Harnessing technology and navigating its impact are the key challenges of our age and yet, despite being decades into the digital revolution, many still underestimate the impact of the internet. It is completely transforming all elements of society and opening opportunities that were thought nearly impossible not long ago. Part of the failure to recognise the impact of the internet is our present inability to fully quantify its value creation, let alone understand the causal effects.However, the evidence surrounds us: The superstar companies of the modern age have capitalised on the economies of scale and strong network effects provided by the internet. Many of the breakthroughs at the frontiers of science are only possible because of the power of software and AI today. And though Covid-19 has shut off huge amounts of human activity, that which remains is almost all online. For those without the internet, the knock-on consequences can be catastrophic.This is true even where access is relatively high. For example, when France reopened schools in 2020, it was partly influenced by the fact that 500,000 low-income students could not access remote learning due to no internet access. Internet access has therefore become fundamental for anyone who cares about equality of opportunities. It is a platform for life, learning and livelihoods. The centrality of the internet to modern life is why a number of political institutions including the EU and the UN have made affordable access key commitments. Some leaders, like Rwandan President Paul Kagame, have made calls for universal access.From a moral perspective, access to the internet is therefore about more than a right to information; it is a matter of human dignity and of improving quality of life. Nobody can control the circumstance of their birth, and where an opportunity exists to help those most in need, there is a compelling case for doing so. Generosity of spirit is not about the deserving and undeserving, and as politics in many countries focuses on "in" and "out" groups, there is a risk of missing the bigger picture.In an interconnected world, the case for access extends well beyond the internet being a fundamental building block for modern life. It is about liberty and freedom in that it connects people and businesses to ideas and to markets, allowing greater incorporation of developing countries into the world's economy, alongside the opening-up of new experiences and opportunities. It is not a Trojan horse that centralises power with government-to-government transfers. Conversely, it is, in many ways, key to decentralisation and democratisation of the world, empowering more individuals with autonomy and an increased ability to engage in entrepreneurship and trade.There is also a strong geopolitical component of the push to connect the world. Concerns endure over values, power and governance and, more broadly, the international democratic order for the digital world. Action should be taken by a coalition of nations who are willing to act according to principles compatible with liberal democratic values. Global technology companies, in particular the big tech giants, also have a responsibility to uphold these principles when bringing the internet to new parts of the world.China has a critical role to play. Its pursuit of technological dominance and control of the modern digital economy, including through the Digital Silk Road, includes a hardware push to connect countries, as well as an attempt to influence standards through its filling out of international bodies, including the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). As Sangeet Paul Choudary has written, such pursuits, along with other aspects including the smart cities push, form China's "country-as-platform strategy for global influence." The risk of a splinternet and a break in the internet's shared and ubiquitous architecture would present profound geopolitical and security challenges, including cybersecurity and the fact that social media is a critical source of information for intelligence services today.After years of more isolationist and unilateralist policy, democratic nations need to be more determined to collectively help build the infrastructure and standards of the digital highways that connect everyone in the world today. This should therefore be a key question for the Biden administration, whose China strategy needs to rise above the partisan rancour and be clear-eyed in its assessment, understanding that technology is central to the debate today and that competitive collaboration should define relations. Competition with China does not require confrontation.There is almost certainly going to be a break from the Trump administration in this regard, who put significant stock on this question but whose proclamations veered towards indictments. Following Donald Trump's failed bid for re-election, the State Department published a paper on The Elements of the China Challenge, which highlighted some of the key aspects that have concerned the US government. This included highlighting their view that "China aims to build the world's fifth generation (5G) wireless-telecommunications physical and digital infrastructure as a steppingstone to broader dominance in emerging and next-generation information technologies", which was central to Trump's attempt to stifle Huawei. The UK took a similar stance, banning the installation of Huawei equipment on UK networks from September, although the company already has a strong foothold in Africa.The company is active in South Africa's network and is working with Safaricom in Kenya, while another Chinese company subject to US action, ZTE, is active in Uganda. Around 70 per cent of 4G base stations on the continent are made by Huawei, which already signed a contract for South Africa's first commercial 5G network. The company is also involved in initiatives including the Smart Africa Alliance and A4AI alongside Google, Facebook and Microsoft.Chinese companies are investing in new technologies which could connect the planet. Satellite technology is advancing, opening up potential new opportunities for connecting the world's population through LEO (low Earth orbit) satellites (see Annex D). While US company SpaceX is the most advanced in its efforts with LEO satellites, the Chinese government is also investing in the technology. The Hongyun Project plans to launch 300 satellites into low Earth orbit, with the network operational in 2022 and complete by 2025. Chinese companies, usually in close coordination with the government, are also investing in LEO satellites. The Chinese firm LinkSure Network has announced plans for a constellation of 272 satellites with ambitions to provide free Wi-Fi to regions currently without coverage.Developing countries are highly unlikely to shift away from the use of China's technology in this space, which is why the US and other nations are going to have to put more weight behind this issue. This will require collaborating with China, as well as competing. The pursuit of an open internet should therefore be of key strategic interest for democratic nations, and these reasons feed into why they should put their investment in universal internet access.President Biden has emphasised the integral role of ICT to the "summit of democracies" he will convene. Access to the internet and all it entails should be central to any new digital alliance of democracies. But the issue is wider than this: New forms of technological cooperation, which also include companies, are key to the transatlantic alliance; key to relationships with countries such as Japan, South Korea and Australia; and should advance individual rights and dignity, and democratic principles and values. But China's increasing technological dominance means that it will be both pragmatic and necessary to collaborate with its government and companies on these issues in the coming years. It would be naive to believe that cooperation with liberal democratic nations will influence China's values, but finding partnerships for development will be necessary for the balance of power in the decades to come.Quantifying the ChallengeWe estimate that it will cost in the region of $446 billion to achieve universal internet access by 2030 and that it could deliver $8.7 trillion in benefits to developing countries. The sequencing of the investments is a policy decision, and the benefits are likely to accrue with an uncertain time lag. We investigated a range of different scenarios for timing and discount rates. We found that in every case the benefits outweigh the costs.The Scale of Investment RequiredThe ITU and A4AI, which do not include devices, estimate that it will cost approximately $428 billion to achieve universal internet access by 2030. We estimate the devices gap could be closed with an investment of $18 billion. This makes a total cost in the region of $446 billion to achieve universal internet access by 2030.Figure 3 Investment needed to achieve universal access to broadband connectivity by 2030 (does not include devices). Total: $428 billionSource: Estimates based on ITU, GSMA, A4AI, operator and regulator data. From ITU, 2020 Connecting Humanity.The usage gap driven by affordability, skills and internet relevance issues is the greatest barrier to internet access (see Figures 1 and 2). Despite this, the bulk of investment needed to close the digital divide is for 4G or equivalent broadband infrastructure (89 per cent). This includes: mobile radio network capital expenditure (capex) for greenfield investments to expand 4G mobile coverage to underserved areas; upgrades to existing 2G and 3G networks; the installation of network backhaul infrastructure covering metro fibre, microwave or satellite; and continued network operations and maintenance costs through to 2030. The infrastructure investment includes a satellite/Wi-Fi requirement for remote areas which are out of reach of traditional mobile networks (between 10 and 20 per cent of the rural population in most countries) and localised solutions for coverage will be needed, consisting of satellite backhaul and fixed wireless access (predominantly Wi-Fi) for the last mile (these technologies are highlighted in Annex C). Innovative technologies to increase connectivity will no doubt emerge and develop between now and 2030. The potential of LEO Satellites to bring low-latency, high-speed connectivity to this demographic is particularly promising (discussed in Annex D).This investment also includes $40 billion (9 per cent of total investment) for improving digital skills and enhancing relevant content for the internet to be meaningful. This, for example, could include access to content in local languages or information relevant to the day-to-day lives of the unconnected (e.g., pricing data for smallholder farmers).$6 billion (1.4 per cent of total investment) is allocated to driving policy change to liberalise markets and increase competition in the sector, bringing down prices and encouraging network expansion.The total estimated investment figure of $428 billion is based on a model that assumed the most cost-effective data network was available.Below is the distribution of investments by region.Figure 4 Investment requirements by region (does not include devices). Total: $428 billionNotes: Country groups based on World Bank classification. This includes high-income countries, comprising 6 per cent of total investments.Source: Xalam estimates based on ITU, GSMA, A4AI, operator and regulator data. From ITU, Connecting Humanity, 2020.Factoring in the Cost of DevicesThe ITU's global costing model does not include the cost of devices. We estimate the devices gap could be closed with an investment of $18 billion. A4AI has undertaken a separate project evaluating the cost of devices across the developing world today. Of the large number of countries it evaluated, it established that the cheapest smartphone available was in Lesotho at $17.96 (2020).By comparison, an initiative between Google and Safaricom in Kenya to expand 4G access offers a range of more affordable smartphones with repayment plans common in the West but unusual in the developing world. Its "Neon Ray Pro", for example, is a 4G Android (Go edition) smartphone retails at Ksh 6,500 ($58.83) and can be acquired with a downpayment of Ksh 1000 ($9.05), with the outstanding amount repaid over nine months at Ksh 20 a day ($0.18). Given a basic entry-level salary in Kenya is $5.00 per day, this makes device repayment 3.6 per cent of a modest lower-income salary. This is comparable to the universal target for data affordability (1GB at 2 per cent of monthly income).We estimate that between now and 2030, an additional 837 million people will need assistance in accessing a device. Of those, around 385 million will still be living in extreme poverty (Load-Date: March 2, 2021End of Document

China.- Facebook accuses Chinese hackers of using the platform to hack and spy on Uighurs abroadCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 25, 2021 ThursdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 329 wordsBody    MADRID, 25 (EUROPA PRESS)   Facebook has accused Chinese hackers of using the platform to hack and spy on Uighur activists and journalists and other Muslim minorities in China's Xinjiang region residing in foreign countries such as the United States, Turkey, Canada, Australia or Kazakhstan.   The hackers used Facebook to identify, track and send malicious links to members of the Uighur ethnic group in order to "monitor" them, and in some cases they went through news websites popular with Uighurs in order to install spy software, the company has reported.   "This group used fake facebook accounts to create fictional characters who were besurging journalists, students, human rights defenders, or members of the Uighur community to build trust with the people they targeted and trick them into accessing malicious links," Facebook said, CNN says.   However, Facebook has not directly blamed the Chinese government for being behind the espionage campaign. "We can see the geographical attribution based on activity, but we can't really prove who's behind the operation," said the company's head of cybersecurity policy, Nathaniel Gleicher, nbc News reports.   The platform has noted, however, that hackers are part of the same operation that cybersecurity company Volexity cited in a 2019 investigation into Uighur espionage as affiliated with the Chinese government.   The United States has described China's acts on Uighurs, of Turkish origin and Muslim religion, and other minority groups residing in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region in northwestern China as "genocide." Recently, us authorities, the United Kingdom and Canada have sanctioned Chinese leaders for the crackdown on this community.   China has already rejected Washington's accusations of repression or genocide against Uighurs. In particular, it has denied the existence of detention camps and ensures that these are facilities for vocational formation and to eradicate Islamic extremism and separatism.Load-Date: March 27, 2021End of Document

Chinese government asked Alibaba to get rid of his mediaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 15, 2021 MondayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 237 wordsBodyThe Chinese government asked online commerce giant Alibaba to give up its assets in the media sector, uneasy about the influence of the jack ma-based group, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) said this Monday. As far as the news broke, Alibaba's stock fell more than 1% on Wall Street.The billionaire, who officially retired from Alibaba in 2019 but remains a large shareholder, has been in the crosshairs of his country's authorities for several months.Chinese regulators stopped 'in extremis' in November a colossal $34 billion po-entry of Ant Group, Alibaba's subsidiary for online payments. And, a month later, regulators opened an investigation into Alibaba's business practices, judged as monopoly.Now the authorities urge Alibaba to drastically reduce his involvement in the media, according to the US newspaper, which does not cite sources.Nor did he specify whether Alibaba should withdraw completely from the media or cede some of his shares.Alibaba is also exposed to receiving the highest fine in China's history for its monopoly practices, WSJ had advanced  on Friday.This could exceed $975 million paid in 2015 by US microchip manufacturer Qualcomm, Beijing's highest antitrust fine so far.According to the newspaper, the authorities accuse Alibaba of forcing him to grant exclusivity to the entrepreneurs they sell on their online sites, and to refrain from marketing products or services on other similar platforms.Load-Date: March 16, 2021End of Document

Coalition for a Prosperous America, China Tech Threat Issue Report Entitled 'Maintaining U.S. Leadership in Semiconductors and Countering China's Threats'Targeted News ServiceMarch 30, 2021 Tuesday GENERAL_EDIT_CORRECTION ERROR Document ID 650 Has error Validate old format failed - Input Date Invalid - 00:26: Unparseable date: "00:26" ESTCopyright 2021 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1097 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON, March 30 -- Coalition for a Prosperous America and China Tech Threat have issued a 15-page report dated March 2021 entitled: "Maintaining U.S. Leadership in Semiconductors and Countering China's Threats".The report was co-authored by Jeff Ferry, chief economist of Coalition for a Prosperous America and Roslyn Layton, co-founder of China Tech Threat.* * *EXECUTIVE SUMMARY* China is targeting global leadership in the semiconductor industry and has put some $120 billion of Chinese government money behind this campaign. Chinese domination of the vital semiconductor industry, if achieved, would make the U.S. dependent upon China for these vital components and endanger Americans' security where chips are used for sensitive products and installations.* Taiwan is a particular exposure for the U.S. One company, TSMC, accounts for over half of global chip foundry revenue, including chips used in almost every 4G and 5G smartphone. China's long-term policy options include undermining or gaining control over TSMC's business through a variety of means, ranging from competition to outright military conquest of the island of Taiwan. More largely, China's aggression in the region threatens suppliers from nearby countries which produce a large and growing share of the semiconductors, which are used in items ranging from smartphones to automobiles to military vehicles.* The U.S. must respond by strengthening its enforcement of the 2018 Export Control and Reform Act. U.S. semiconductor equipment makers and electronic design automation tool companies must be prevented from selling to entities with Chinese military ties. Today, that enforcement is too weak, and the list of restricted companies does not capture the breadth of the relevant entities. For example, firms like Applied Materials, KLA, and Lam Research sell to Yangtze Memory Technologies (YMTC) and ChangXin Memory Technologies (CXMT), companies which should be designated as Military End Users, if not Entity List actors, for their ties to the Chinese military.* Building on its leadership in chip design, the U.S. must implement reforms to support a substantial increase in U.S. chip manufacturing, with a goal of producing 50% of semiconductors in every major category. This will strengthen U.S. national security and diversify supply and resiliency. Moreover, it will create hundreds of thousands of high-paying manufacturing jobs in the U.S.* U.S. policymakers should focus on greater international coordination on strategic trade control to ensure that semiconductor inputs and equipment are not sold to Chinese military end users or uses. U.S., European, and Japanese suppliers produce 90% of the world's semiconductor manufacturing equipment. The U.S. should provide leadership to these nations and their companies to strengthen trade outside of China and beyond Chinese influence. As a leader and innovator in the semiconductor industry, the U.S. should resume its position as the world's leading manufacturer of semiconductors.* * *CONCLUSIONThis report briefly outlined critical issues in U.S. semiconductor leadership at home and abroad. While the U.S. is preeminent in chip design, this advantage is being whittled away by the decline of advanced manufacturing, a vital component of the semiconductor industry. U.S. policy, however well-intentioned, is falling short of what is required to stand up an American-owned, advanced chip manufacturing capability in the U.S. While financial incentives are important, they are not sufficient to strengthen U.S. leadership in chip manufacturing. China will always be able to outspend the U.S., and it is unlikely to change its anticompetitive practices. The U.S. needs durable semiconductor policy to harness the resources of the U.S. government, consumers, defense community, and the U.S. research establishment to create an economic environment that favors American companies to invest in U.S.-based manufacturing over the long-term, 20 years or more.The U.S. must also curtail the activities that contribute to the growth of China's techno-nationalistic semiconductor industry, notably by enforcing existing rules that restrict the sales of semiconductor inputs to military end users and uses. Moreover, the U.S. should demonstrate leadership by coordinating more closely with like-minded nations on strategic trade control, not just to strengthen security, but to strengthen legitimate trade outside China and beyond its influence. The U.S. can restore its leadership in semiconductor manufacturing; it is only a question of will.* * *Author DescriptionJEFF FERRY is Chief Economist at the Coalition for a Prosperous America (CPA).

Facebook finds Chinese hacking operation targeting UyghursAssociated Press Financial WireMarch 24, 2021 Wednesday 7:23 PM GMTCopyright 2021 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; DOMESTIC NEWS; STATE AND REGIONALLength: 412 wordsByline: Associated PressBodyHackers in China used fake Facebook accounts and impostor websites to try to break into the computers and smartphones of Uyghur Muslims, the social network said Wednesday.The company said the sophisticated, covert operation targeted Uyghur activists, journalists and dissidents from China’s Xinjiang region, as well as individuals living in Turkey, Kazakhstan, the U.S., Syria, Australia, Canada and other nations.The hackers attempted to gain access to the computers and phones by creating fake Facebook accounts for supposed journalists and activists, as well as fake websites and apps intended to appeal to a Uyghur audience. In some cases, the hackers created lookalike websites almost identical to legitimate news sites popular with Uyghurs.The accounts and sites contained malicious links. If the target clicked on one, their computer or smartphone would be infected with software allowing the network to spy on the target’s device.The software could obtain information including the victim's location, keystrokes and contacts, according to FireEye, a cybersecurity firm that worked on the investigation.In all, fewer than 500 people were targeted by the hackers in 2019 and 2020, Facebook said. The company said it uncovered the network during its routine security work, and has deactivated the fictitious accounts and notified individuals whose devices may have been compromised. Most of the hackers’ activities took place on non-Facebook sites and platforms.“They tried to create these personas, build trust in the community, and use that as a way to trick people into clicking on these links to expose their devices,” said Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook’s head of security policy.Facebook’s investigation found links between the hackers and two technology firms based in China but no direct links to the Chinese government, which has been criticized for its harsh treatment of Uyghurs in Xinjiang. FireEye, however, said in a statement that “we believe this operation was conducted in support” of the Chinese government.China has imprisoned more than 1 million people, including Uyghurs and other mostly Muslim ethnic groups, in a vast network of concentration camps, according to U.S. officials and human rights groups. People have been subjected to torture, sterilization and political indoctrination, in addition to forced labor, as part of an assimilation campaign in a region whose inhabitants are ethnically and culturally distinct from the Han Chinese majority.Load-Date: March 24, 2021End of Document

Canalys: China's electric vehicle sales to grow by more than 50% in 2021 after modest 2020Business WireFebruary 22, 2021 Monday 2:00 PM GMTCopyright 2021 Business Wire, Inc.Length: 606 wordsDateline: SINGAPORE BodyNew research from Canalys shows that a record 1.3 million electric vehicles (EVs) were sold in China in 2020 . But year-on-year growth was modest at only 8%. In comparison, worldwide sales of EVs rocketed by 39% in 2020, as reported here .This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210222005461/en/Canalys: China's electric vehicle sales to grow by more than 50% in 2021 after modest 2020 (Photo: Business Wire)In a new digital report, Electric vehicle outlook: 2021 and beyond , Canalys publishes detailed EV sales data, forecasts and analysis on the global market with a spotlight on key markets, including China.The Chinese government has been supportive of the transition to EVs, but several changes to EV-related policies and consumer subsidies in recent years disrupted the market and car makers struggled to build sales momentum. "The Chinese EV market in 2020 was all about two vehicles: the made-in-China Tesla Model 3, the market leader in the first half of 2020, and the Hongguang Mini EV from the SGMW joint venture (SAIC, General Motors and Wuling), the market leader in the second half of 2020, which only launched mid-year," said Chris Jones, Chief Analyst for automotive at Canalys, "If it had not been for the huge success of these two very different EVs, the Chinese EV market would have declined in 2020. Between them, the two models represented one in five of all EVs sold in China."The 1.3 million EVs sold in China in 2020 represented 41% of global EV sales, just behind Europe with 42% of global EV sales. China is still far ahead of the US for EV share - in the US, EV sales represented just 2.4% of sales in 2020."Prospects are very good for China's EV market in 2021," said Jones. "There is already an excellent network of standardized public EV chargers in China, good government support and now a return to strong consumer demand." Tesla has already started deliveries of the made-in-China Model Y. Production of the Hongguang Mini EV has been increased to keep up with demand, particularly from young Chinese urbanites. Other small, more affordable city cars, such as the Baojun E-Series from SGMW and the Ora R1 from Great Wall Motors (GWM), are also proving very popular. The Ora R1, touted as the world's cheapest EV, will also soon go on sale in India, where the EV share was less than 0.5% of all cars sold in 2020. Canalys forecasts 1.9 million EVs will be sold in China in 2021, growth of 51% and a 9% share of all cars sold in China."With a share of just 6.3% of all passenger cars sold in China in 2020, EVs have many years of growth ahead," said Sandy Fitzpatrick, VP at Canalys. "But with Tesla expanding its portfolio in China, it will be hard for competitors offering premium EVs to gain market share. With that in mind, some Chinese car makers are already looking for growth opportunities in other parts of the world, especially Europe," said Fitzpatrick.China is still the world's largest car market. 30% of global car sales were in China in 2020, up from 27% in 2019. The overall Chinese car market will return to sales growth in 2021.Canalys' Electric vehicle outlook: 2021 and beyond report offers data and insights in an easy-access digital format. It includes:• The latest market trends.• Historical and forecast sales, with interactive charts• Market shares of the leading EV brands.• New product developments.• Analysis of the EV charging infrastructure.• Motorization and urbanization trends.• Government policies around the world.View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210222005461/en/CONTACT: More information :Chris Jones: chris_jones@canalys.com+44 7867 389 727Press: press@canalys.comhttp://www.businesswire.comGraphic Canalys: China's electric vehicle sales to grow by more than 50% in 2021 after modest 2020 (Photo: Business Wire)Load-Date: February 22, 2021End of Document

Where's Jack Ma? Alibaba founder 'disappears' after facing Chinese governmentCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 4, 2021 MondayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 365 wordsBodyThe whereabouts of Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba, is a mystery. The Chinese businessman, confronted with Xi Jinping's government, accumulates more than two months without appearing in public, as Yahoo reports, and that has untied all sorts of rumors.The last event in which his absence was noted was the delivery of the program's talent awards from his conglomerate Africa's Business Heroes in late November. The Telegraph reported its replacement with an Alibaba executive and, since then, no image or documented public appearance of him has been obtained. According to the Financial Times, sources of Alibaba itself claim that this is simply an agency problem. The truth is that in August Jack Ma assured his Twitter profile that he "couldn't wait" to deliver those awards.This 'disappearance' of Jack Ma from public life has taken place after the owner confronted the Chinese government and the communist party of the country, who he called for not to "use yesterday's regulation to manage the future" by referring to market rules and indirectly criticizing Xi Jinping's executive in ensuring that China needed "less bureaucracy."     Ma's speech, delivered on October 24 at a forum in Shanghai, had almost immediate repercussions. China stopped the IBRO of Ant Group, Alibaba's financial services subsidiary, to impose new conditions that would equate Ma's company with banking at leverage levels and capital demands. The OPV was to be the most expensive in history, reaching 29 billion euros on its simultaneous departure in Hong Kong and Shanghai.Weeks later, Alibaba took a new hit from Chinese government as he saw him open an antitrust investigation and accuse her of forcing other companies to sign exclusivity agreements. Previously, the regulator accused the company of expanding its stake in the Intime Retail chain without permission and fined Tencent's e-book subsidiary, China Literature, also owned by Alibaba. Since November, Alibaba Group has been left with more than 20% of its value on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and reached lows since July following new investigations by the Chinese government by monopoly. commentsforum2WhatsApp  Facebook  Twitter  Linkedin       Load-Date: January 5, 2021End of Document

After criticizing the Chinese government, the founder of Alibaba did not appear publicly againCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 5, 2021 TuesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 422 wordsBodyJack Ma, the billionaire founder of technology companies Alibaba and Ant Group, disappeared after criticizing China's financial system for changes and reforms. Ever since he made these comments, he never saw his face again.Ma is one of the richest people in China. His net worth, according to Forbes, is US$ 58.4 billion. The 56-year-old man grew up in humble circumstances in communist China. It's more than one opportunity, he told people how he double-tested his college entrance exams and was rejected in all the jobs he ran for after college, including the fast food chain KFC.After many initial setbacks, he, along with a team of 18 people and $60,000, co-founded Alibaba in Hangzhou city in 1999. Some 20 years later, Alibaba became one of the world's largest retail and e-commerce companies, with more than 100,000 employees.Ma was seen as a breath of fresh air in traditionally conservativeChinese business culture. He cultivated the personality of an irreverent company ambassador, adopted exaggerated stunts, included a Michael Jackson-inspired dance at an Alibaba anniversary party, and appeared in his own kung fu film, Gong Shou Dao.He "retired" from Alibaba in September 2019.  At the time, it was speculated that his departure was due to tension with the Chinese Communist Party. Party leaders were believed to be suspicious of their enormous power and influence.The Washington Post reported that prominent Chinese entrepreneurs who receive press attention are more likely to be investigated or arrested compared to those who avoid media coverage. Ma ominously and prophetically told a group of rural teachers in 2016: "I think among the richest men in China, few have good endings."In late October 2020, he criticized China's banking system,considering it run by a pawn shop mentality, during a conference. His speech preceded the planned initial public offering of his Ant Group. Since then, the Chinese government has taken action against him and his companies,including an antitrust investigation into Alibaba.Ma, who feels comfortable being the center of attention, made no public appearances in recent weeks, does not tweet three months ago and was replaced for the final episode of his talent show Africa's Business Heroes, which is something like Shark Tank.The disappearance of wealthy entrepreneurs is not unusual in China,being something that has happened for some time. According to a 2017 article in The Independent, "Chinese billionaires and CEOs continue to disappear into 'state sanctioned kidnappings'."Load-Date: January 6, 2021End of Document

Point by point, all the tentacles of Argentina-China's ever-deepest relationsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 12, 2021 FridayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 5293 wordsBodyThe inauguration in December 2019 of President Alberto Fernández and Vice-President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner in Argentina brought to power a Peronist government that has not only moved the nation in an increasingly leftist-populist direction, but has also opened the door to a substantial deepening of the country's already significant relationship with the People's Republic of China (RPC).As has been China's practice with Venezuela, Ecuador and Bolivia, the CPR is not explicitly building an anti-American alliance in Argentina. Rather, it is the CPR's important commitment in a wide range of trade, political and security areas that threatens to facilitate a self-destructive trajectory on the part of Argentine Peronist leaders. Chinese resources and other support diminish the extent to which the Argentine government must worry about responses from investors, banks, multilateral institutions, and Western governments, while increasingly disdemocraticly consolidating power and undermining America's agenda in the region, for China's trade and strategic benefit.The Chinese-Argentine relationship inherited by President Fernandez and Vice President Kirchner is one of the most entrenched in the region. During the previous governments of former Presidents Néstor Kirchner and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, China-based companies established themselves with local partners in a wide range of economic sectors: from oil, mining and agriculture to transportation and logistics, telecommunications, banking and finance, and even the aerospace and defense industries.The reopening of the CPR, launched by the return to power of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner as vice president (and increasingly with power behind President Alberto Fernández), reverses the trend of greater transparency and supervision imposed on the relationship (however, expanding) between Argentina and China under the government of Mauricio Macri.For the CPR, the opportunity to return to a less restricted form of engagement with his old friends - Vice President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner and the Peronistas - represents a huge strategic opportunity. For China, Argentina offers a combination of benefits and access that no other populist (or non-populist) regime in the hemisphere can match. On the one hand, the nation has important natural resources, including strategic minerals such as lithium (in addition to traditional ones such as iron and copper). Pampas are also a major supplier of soybeans, pork and other important agricultural inputs to feed China's 1.4 billion inhabitants. Reciprocally, Argentina offers an important middle-class market for the purchase of high value-added Chinese goods and services, and access to even greater markets through its membership in the regional trade organization MERCOSUR. Argentina's diversified economy includes sophisticated manufacturing, services and technology sectors, with which China-based companies can partner to absorb technologies and refine their product and service offerings.Argentina's geographical position is close enough to the United States to be strategically relevant to it, but far enough away for the CPR's trade and other activities in Argentina to appear only moderately threatening. Argentina's position allows it, and its partners operating to and through it, to influence the political and economic dynamics of the South American continent, as well as to project commercial and other influence across the South Atlantic. Argentina's geographical location in the Western Hemisphere also provides the CPR with a necessary site inthe opposite side of the earth to support China's space program, supporting continuous communication and tracking of spacecraft from a rotating earth for lunar missions and others.It can be said that this appeal contributed to China selecting Argentina as a "Strategic Partner" in 2004, to the relationship being elevated to Integral Strategic Partnership during President Xi Jingping's visit in 2014, and to expanding cooperation in 2018, marked by 35 new agreements in a number of areas.Given Argentina's multidimensional potential for advancing Chinese interests, the prospect of accessing the country through a friendly populist government - which has become malleable through a combination of political alignment, economic dependence, and a network of trade relations that personally engage its leaders - is arguably as attractive to the CPR as it should be threatening to the United States.The current Argentine government has clearly prioritized the relationship with China. Although a state visit to China scheduled for November 2020 was postponed due to the pandemic, President Alberto Fernandez spoke to his counterpart Xi Jinping in January, and the trip to China is expected to take place in May 2021 (probably before a similar visit to the United States).The CPR is one of three foreign governments (along with Russia and Cuba) for which Vice-President Fernández de Kirchner has maneuvered to install a personally loyal ambassador to manage the relationship. In the case of China, he chose Sabino Vaca Narvaja, son of one of the founders of the leftist guerrilla movement Montoneros of the 70s, and uncle of his grandson. The Argentine government also assigned an officer with the rank of general to serve as its defense attache in the CPR, a level of seniority previously reserved exclusively for his defense attache in Washington, D.C.Although overshadowed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the win-win relationship between the CPR, the Peronist government and its trading partners has rapidly deepened over the past year. In September 2020, the Argentine Congress, controlled by Peronism, approved the country's participation in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (BAII) of China. Argentina is expected to formally join the Belt and China Route Initiative during the State visit to China in May 2021, with the twentieth nation of the Americas doing so (but the first of the region's largest countries, a list that also includes Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia).Chinese aid to Argentina on pandemics has also been important, as the Argentine government began negotiating in February 2021 to purchase up to 30 million doses of the Chinese Sinopharm vaccine, following delays in the arrival of vaccines previously contracted in Russia.Sino-Argentine cooperation also extends to the subnational level, including important agreements with China signed by the governors of the provinces of Jujuy and San Juan, among others.This article details the depth and breadth of the Sino-Argentine relationship.TradeSino-Argentine trade has grown enormously over the past two decades. The $16.1 billion of bilateral trade in 2019 represents an 11-times expansion since China was admitted to the WTO in 2001. The trade relationship has been favourable to the CPR since 2007, with Argentina mainly exporting soybeans, minerals and other commodities to the CPR, while purchasing a wide range of higher value-added Chinese goods and services.MiningChinese companies have had a limited stake in Argentina's mining sector for nearly two decades, but in thein recent years its presence has increased significantly, especially in the extraction of strategic lithium metal, fundamental to the manufacture of batteries for electric vehicles, consumer electronics and a number of other items.China Metallurgical Corporation (CMC) has two large mines in Argentina where it is currently seeking to restart operations: the Campana Mahuida copper mine (whose operations have been suspended since 2009 due to problems with the local community), and the Sierra Grande iron mine, which stopped production in 2016 due to low ore prices.In February 2020, The Chinese company Hanaq acquired Ochre Mining, the Argentine subsidiary of ECR Minerals, which operates a gold mine in La Rioja.In 2017, Chinese firm Shandong Gold bought a 50% stake in Veladero, Argentina's largest gold and silver mine, for $960 million. Shandong is considering investing another $145 million to extend the mine's life by 2030.With respect to lithium, in 2019 The Chinese firm Ganfeng paid $160 million to acquire a 50 percent stake in the major Cauchari-Olaroz mine in Jujuy and has agreed to make additional investments of $400 million there. Ganfeng is also conducting lithium surveys as part of the Mariana project in Salta. The Chinese company Hanaq, mentioned above, operates four lithium projects in Chubut, where it is also conducting uranium explorations. Jinchuan, based in the People's Republic of China, is conducting lithium explorations in Catamarca, Jujuy and Salta.These Chinese lithium operations are particularly important, given the impediments to Chinese lithium mining in the other two countries that make up the "lithium triangle" of the hemisphere. Water constraints restrict the exploitation of the SQM mine in Chile's Atacama desert, while the Bolivian government's left-eastern government bureaucratic requirements and attempts to promote local lithium "industrialization" have restricted the progress of projects, including those of the Coipasa salt flat in Uyuni.OilWith regard to oil, Argentina was one of the first Latin American countries in which China significantly expanded its presence through mergers and acquisitions following the global financial crisis of 2008. It is worth noting the acquisition of Flanges by China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) in March 2010 for $3.1 billion, and Sinopec's acquisition of Occidental Petroleum for $2.45 billion, announced in December of that year. The Chinese company Sinopec currently operates in the provinces of Santa Cruz, Chubut and Mendoza.In addition, through Bridas and its subsidiary Pan American Energy (a joint venture between Bridas and British Petroleum), CNOOC has participated in fracking operations in Vaca Muerte, gaining experience with technology thanks to its role in the consortium. One of the projects that can be covered during the May 2021 presidential visit is the Zárate energy complex (Zárate Energy Pole) to support vaca Muerta gas extraction.AgricultureWith regard to agriculture, Chinese companies have left behind unsuccessful attempts to acquire land and create agrologistic enterprises (such as the fruitless projects attempted by Chongqing Grain in Cordoba and Beidahuang Nongken in Rio Negro), moving to acquire companies established in the sector that possess desirable agricultural technologies. Examples of such companies are the multimillion-dollar purchases of H.K. Noble by COFCO (completed in 2015), and Nidera (completed in 2017), both with major operations in Argentina.The Chinese company Sinochemit also has a presence in the country, through the Swiss-based fertilizer and seed company Syngenta. Reciprocally, seed technology company Donmario, a major small-scale player in Argentina, has increasingly important commercial stakes in China.As the People's Republic of China has become Argentina's main soybean buyer, it has used that influence in other areas; examples of this are the suspension of purchases of soybean oil by COFCO in 2010 to signal its discontent with Argentina's historic protectionist measures.However, despite the emphasis on soybeans, the swine flu outbreak that is ravaging China has led to an increase in Chinese demand for Argentine pork, marked by a possible investment of $3.5 billion in the construction of 25 industrial pig farms in northern Argentina; although these farms could double the country's swine production, they have generated major local protests. The project seemed to be underway until President Fernández's propip created confusion by appearing with Argentine vegan activists opposed to the project, resulting in a photo of the president embracing a box with an anti-project slogan being sent through official government channels. The Chinese were reportedly particularly offended by the broad anti-chinese rhetoric employed by the group with which the president had partnered, and put the entire agreement on suspense. In mid-February 2021, some provinces were negotiating separate agreements with the CPR to increase pork production and meet Chinese demand.Construction / LogisticsChina-based construction and transportation infrastructure companies have advanced a number of projects in Argentina. In recent years, Argentina has embarked on some 11 projects, financed by loans from Chinese political banks and led by Chinese companies. The most significant has been a $4.7 billion agreement signed in December 2020 to improve the San Martín and Belgrano Norte lines of the Belgrano Cargas rail system, which was built to link Argentina's interior with its neighbors, but which had fallen into a state of deterioration. In 2010, during a state visit to the CPR, then-President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner signed a multimillion-dollar commitment to China to improve that infrastructure. During Macri's rule, a 580 km stretch of railway lines was renewed with the help of Chinese companies; and in 2019, prior to the last agreement mentioned, the government signed an additional $1 billion contract with the China Railway Construction Corporation to improve lines from Rosario to Mendoza.Other major rail businesses with China include the purchase of locomotives and wagons for line B of the Buenos Aires metro (Subte), agreed in 2010, and the proposal of new works on the San Martín and Roca light rail lines in Greater Buenos Aires.Chinese companies are also interested in building an $800 million rail link from vaca Muerte shale deposits in Neuquén to the port of Bahía Blanca, in support of the oil industry, although the official offer has not yet been submitted.They have also expressed interest in a $1.5 billion road tunnel that will connect Argentina and Chile through the Andes.Beyond transportation, China National Technical Import-Export Corporation (CNTIC) is building a $50 km gas pipeline in Entre Ríos worth $200 million, along with a 132 km high-voltage power line and fiber optic cable. Previously, companiesof the People's Republic of China attempted to supply low-priced steel pipes for a major pipeline that Odebrecht was building in Cordoba, although the initiative was shelved as a result of strong pressure from competing Argentine steel supplier Techint (Dinaris), for accusations of Chinese dumping.For nearly two decades, Hong Kong-based port company Hutchison Whampoa, increasingly controlled by mainland China, has managed a port concession in Buenos Aires.Perhaps Argentina's most strategically important project involving China is a contract to dredge and exploit a river toll on the Paraguay-Paraná River corridor, critical for agricultural exports from five South American nations (Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Brazil and Bolivia). It appears that Argentina is going to grant the project to Shanghai Dredging, above competitors such as Belgian and Luxembourg's Jan de Nul, which has led to the dismay of Argentina's neighbors. The issue emerged as an important topic of discussion at a meeting this month between the presidents of neighbouring countries, Brazil and Uruguay.Electrical infrastructureArgentina has been the scene of multiple Chinese clean energy projects, although many have been accompanied by a large number of problems. A $4.73 billion project to build two hydroelectric facilities on the Santa Cruz River (Condor Cliff and Barrancosa), led by a consortium that included Chinese group Gezhouba, was halted for environmental reasons in 2016 by a decision of the Argentine Supreme Court, and subsequently restructured. With Fernandez and Kirchner's return to power, the project has restarted, despite the lack of resolution of the environmental issue. The project will appear to continue to involve China's Argentine partner, Electroengineering, whose boss was involved in the "notebooks" scandal. The project is reportedly moving slowly, and has now been completed by approximately 15 percent.The survival of the Santa Cruz River hydroelectric project also demonstrates the growing sophistication of Chinese companies and their understanding of the political risk involved by Argentine governments. When the project was initiated under the chairmanship of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, the Chinese included a "cross-default clause", which made it difficult for Macri's subsequent government to end the project without compromising the financing of the People's Republic of China for the modernization of the Belgrano-Cargas rail system (previously mentioned, and even more importantly).Beyond the Santa Cruz River, new agreements that could be asserted during the May 2021 presidential visit include Chinese support for the current or future construction of the El Tambolar, Potrero del Clavillo and Los Blancos hydroelectric facilities, as well as the long-delayed $2 billion Chihuido project.In jujuy province in the north of the country, Power China has built the 300-megawatt Cauchari solar park, the largest in South America, as well as other solar farms in Salta and Córdoba. Power China is also involved in the construction of the "Loma Blanca" wind farms in Chubut and the Cerro Arauco project in La Rioja.China's largest energy project in Argentina is the construction by China National Nuclear Corporation of the fourth nuclear reactor in the Atucha nuclear complex. During her presidency, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner reached an agreement with China for the construction of two reactors that would be financed mainly by the CPR. One of them would use the same Siemens/Canadian (CANDU) design used by the otherthree reactors from the facility. A second reactor, reflecting China's wishes, would use the new Hualong-1 design of the CPR (previously used only in the CPR and Pakistan). In 2015, macri's government revised and reduced the purchase agreement for a single gigawatt Hualong-1 reactor, and the CPR contributed $8 billion from project funding of $12 billion. However, due to Argentina's fiscal crisis, Macri's government was unable to provide its share of the funding. The continued lack of progress in fernandez's new government's one-year flagship project has become a source of irritation in the Chinese-Argentine relationship, and is likely to be a key agenda item during President Fernandez's state visit to the CPR in May 2021.Unlike Brazil, Chile and Peru, Chinese companies have not yet established their presence in the electricity transmission sector in Argentina, due to the dominance of the state-owned CAMMESA (Electric Wholesale Market Management Company), which has so far effectively protected the Argentine market from Chinese intrusion by partnering exclusively with private allied companies.TechnologyIn the telecommunications sector, Chinese company Huawei has been operating in Argentina since 2001. Huawei currently has more than 500 employees in the country and is the leading infrastructure provider of Argentina's three major telecommunications providers: Claro, Personal and Movistar. However, its presence in the mobile phone market is lower and generally does not provide direct customer service. Huawei has held talks with the current Peronist government regarding 5G, and is positioned to become the provider of choice when the government builds a 5G network, probably in 2022.Several Chinese companies assemble televisions and other consumer electronics in the remote southern department of Tierra del Fuego, although the nature of manufacturing operations in that province remains minimal, and is mainly concentrated around the huge tax incentives that the government offers to companies operating in the region.Finally, Argentina is a focus of Chinese attempts to export its "smart cities" technologies and surveillance systems to Latin America. In 2019, ZTE signed an agreement with Jujuy Province, home to major Chinese mining and power generation operations, to install a facially recognized camera system and other sensors. The city of Vicente López, in the province of Buenos Aires, has also installed a system of Chinese cameras. During the pandemic, Huawei lent thermal imaging cameras to Argentina's major international airports and bus terminals to measure passenger temperature as part of the fight against COVID-19. Huawei has also positioned itself for the opportunity to build "smart cities" infrastructures in Argentina.Space cooperationThe telescope radar operated by China in Bajada del Agrio, Neuquén, has become the presence of the CPR in the country. The installation, the subject of a series of non-public memorandums of understanding signed between the CPR and Cristina Fernandez's previous government, is largely operated by Chinese military personnel.The station's location and known characteristics of the satellite dish seem to coincide with the RPC's need for facilities in the hemisphere capable of continuously tracking objects in space, in support of its lunar and planetary space program. Although the telescope installation has no openly military purpose, the head of U.S. Southern Command has mentioned it as aelement of concern, as it is conceivable that it may intercept signals from US or other satellites over the space, or support other Chinese strategic missions.However, the Chinese space radar telescope is not the only case of THE CPR's collaboration with Argentina on space-related issues. Great Wall Industrial Corporation has helped build and launch 13 satellites for Argentine trading company Satellogic. In addition, the state-owned satellite company ARSAT also maintains contractual relationships of commercial services with companies based in the CPR.BankingBeyond technology, China also has an important and multidimensional banking presence in Argentina. On the one hand, since 2005, Chinese political banks have provided the country with some $17.1 billion in loans to support the modernization of the railway and other projects involving Chinese companies. At the same time, they have also provided a $18.5 billion foreign exchange credit line to support Argentina's financial liquidity and the country's ability to transact with companies based in the People's Republic of China; to date, only approximately $300 million of this funding has been used. In August 2020, the CPR signed an agreement with Fernandez's new government to renew the line of credit for three more years, but did not agree to increase its size, as the Argentine side wished.In the field of retail banking, Chinese banks entered Argentina to accept deposits and provide credit for local transactions in 2016, with ICBC's approval of ICBC's $600 million acquisition of Standard Bank, which had a significant bank presence of branches in the country. Currently, ICBC and HSBC are the two main Chinese banks operating in Argentina, and their operations include the provision of RMB-denominated accounts to commercial customers. The Bank of China reportedly also attempted to enter Argentina in 2019, but has so far been unable to do so.In terms of e-commerce, China's presence is relatively limited. Alibaba signed an agreement in 2018 that allows it to ship products to the country, although Argentina's high taxes on the importation of goods have limited demand for its services. Similarly, Chinese travel company Didi Chuxing has explored the possibility of doing business in the country, but such services are currently illegal, in part due to resistance from Argentina's taxi union.Today, Argentina's delicate financial situation at the national, provincial and local levels, and the difficult relationship between the left-wing Peronist government and Western creditors, such as the International Monetary Fund, has increased the need for financial support from the CPR and its banks.Security cooperationDuring the presidency of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner - and since her return as Vice-President - Argentina has joined her left-wing counterparts in Venezuela, Bolivia and Ecuador as major partners for the military commitment to the CPR in Latin America. The current era of cooperation was possibly formalized in May 2007, with the signing of a formal defense cooperation agreement between Argentina and China, which provided for the exchange of military personnel and equipment, among other elements.During the government of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, Argentina bought from the RPC armored personnel transport vehicles WMZ-551 for $2.6 million to equip its share of the binational peacekeeping brigade it maintains with Chile; and in 2007, Argentina pursued the acquisition ofChinese helicopters X-11. However, he abandoned that purchase due to pressure from France, which argued that the helicopter was a stolen copy of a Eurocopter design.At the end of the presidency of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, Argentina was negotiating the purchase of JF-17 fighters, five P-18 patrol vessels and VN-1 armored personnel transport vehicles to the CPR. These purchases were eventually abandoned when the central-right government of Mauricio Macri was elected in 2015.The return of the Peronists has resurrected each of these initiatives, among others. In 2019, China indicated its interest in building a polar logistics vessel for Argentina to support the resupply of Argentine stations in Antarctica from Ushuaia. In mid-January 2021, the Chinese ambassador again submitted the Chinese offer to supply Argentina with Norinco 8×8 armored vehicles. According to defense experts interviewed for this work, the JF-17 (the block 3 variant, which requires some local assembly) is under discussion again. The return to this latest aircraft model is apparently a compromise following serious Argentine-Chinese discussions about the acquisition of the more capable J-10CE. The J-10CE was eventually ruled out by Argentina for being too expensive, and would have been the most advanced Chinese military aircraft exported to the hemisphere. The only exceptions to the restart of arms purchase negotiations have been Chinese-made patrol vessels, due to Argentina's purchase of four of these vessels from France during Macri's rule.Despite ongoing discussions between the two governments regarding the acquisition of military goods, the Argentine military reportedly has mixed feelings about Chinese products. These concerns relate to the fact that the goods in question are export items, not used by the Chinese themselves, and without a solid history of performance or maintenance. The JF-17 has multiple points of concern, including its dependence on Russian engines, which complicates the reliability of maintenance and replacement, and the small size of the interior of Chinese vehicles, which makes them uncomfortable for Argentine personnel.Beyond its sales to the Argentine military, the CPR has also donated $17.5 million worth of goods to Argentine federal police and gendarmerie, including four CSK 162 armored vehicles, 30 motorcycles, bomb detection equipment and protective vests, donated for use during the November 20 G20 summit in Buenos Aires.Outside of material support, Argentine military and other defence personnel regularly travel to the CPR for vocational military education courses and institutional visits. The National Defense University of Argentina has created a "strategic cooperation program" with China, which includes a course on Argentina-China cooperation that doubled its enrolment in 2020 compared to the previous year. The RPC has received students from the program on visits to China and, reciprocally, has sent its own staff to attend courses at the institution in Argentina. The RPC has also sponsored visits by current and former Argentine defence personnel to China through the Argentine Security-Oriented CARI (Argentine Council for International Relations) study center, as a 2019 trip by between 15 and 20 Argentines to a seminar in Tibet.Chinese naval ships have made stopovers in Argentina, including a three-day visit to the Port of Buenos Aires in October 2013 by the PLA Navy frigates Lanzhou and Liuzhou and the supply ship Boyanghu. However, there have been no publicized incidents of suchactivities ever since.Organized crimeAs the legitimate ties between the CPR, Argentina and its entrepreneurs and officials have grown, the criminal ties involving the two countries have also expanded, provoking both social reactions in Argentina and Chinese-Argentine collaboration to combat such criminality. China's organized crime in Argentina continues to expand, despite growing government efforts to combat it, including Argentine collaboration with Chinese police.The expansion of Chinese companies in the area has corresponded to an increase in the activities of Chinese organized crime groups. In 2015, Kirchner's government brought in a Chinese National Police officer (known by the undercover name "Martin") to collaborate with local Argentine authorities in However, as had happened elsewhere in Latin America, this effort only led to the fragmentation and transformation of the Chinese underworld in the area, and the continuation of extortion and attacks. In 2019, Chinese organized crime syndicates were even non-Chinese entrepreneurs in the country.Illegal fishing of Chinese vessels in Argentina's Exclusive Economic ZoneIllegal fishing in Argentina's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and outside Argentina by ships from the high-altitude Chinese fleet has become a growing problem for Argentina over the past decade, threatening to collapse its fisheries. Notable cases of illegal fishing include the 603 tonnes of illegal shrimp found in the Hu Shun Yu 809 hold in 2015, discovered when the ship broke down while illegally fishing in Argentine waters; although the ship was boarded by the Argentine Coast Guard, the crew then mysteriously disappeared from their detained ship while in Argentine custody. In March 2016, Lu Yan Yuan Yu accidentally sank while trying to avoid capture while illegally fishing in Argentina's EEZ. In 2018, the Jing Yuan 626 was seized after a 5-hour chase, during which five of its fishing companions performed dangerous maneuvers against Argentine Coast Guard ships to help their counterpart escape.ConclusionsAs seen in the examples highlighted in this work, the Chinese-Argentine commitment is significant not only in terms of trade and activities of Chinese companies in Argentina. The substantial and growing political and security commitment between the two countries is also facilitating the worrying direction in which Argentina's current Peronist government moves, as it continues to advance China's trade and strategic interests in the country and hemisphere.In the short term, the United States may not be able to do much to avoid these trends, beyond crediblely attracting attention to the Argentine actions of concern; remind Argentina, and the Latin American region at large, of the possible consequences of the self-destructive course to which its new government appears to be returning; and continue to provide quality, market-based alternatives to Chinese participation wherever possible. In this way, the United States can respect Argentine sovereignty while helping the Argentine population understand and resist agreements that can benefit China without Argentina in the long term and ultimately threaten the independence and pride that characterize the Argentine nation.Evan Ellis is a research professor on Latin America at the U.S. Army War School's Institute of Strategic Studies.

Marjorie Taylor Greene Faces Backlash Online for Calling Biden President of 'Communist China'Newsweek.comJanuary 20, 2021 Wednesday 5:55 PM ESTCopyright © 2021 Newsweek Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 595 wordsByline: Jeffery MartinHighlight: On the day of President Joe Biden's inauguration, Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene tweeted that "Communist China has their President ... China Joe."BodyGeorgia Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene described newly inaugurated President Joe Biden as the president of China. Meanwhile, China's government imposed sanctions on some members of the administration of former President Donald Trump.Greene, a freshman lawmaker who aligned herself closely with Trump, said in January that she would introduce articles of impeachment against Biden for abuse of power. Greene has alleged that Biden and members of his family received money from foreign entities, including the Chinese Communist Party.Trump's departure from the White House was lauded by the Chinese media. Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was one of the Americans sanctioned by China's government, prohibiting them from doing business with the country.Greene, who has voiced support for conspiracy theories in the past, referred to Biden as "China Joe" in a Wednesday tweet."President @JoeBiden is going to play clueless Grandpa by standing aside and allowing America's enemies to go after his political enemies," Greene tweeted. "Communist China has their President ... China Joe."Author Brian Solis responded to Greene's tweet by referring to her espousal of conspiracy theories."Welp, when you aim to sow division through lies and conspiracy theories, that's the way the fortune Qookie crumbles, I guess," Solis wrote."Don't you have a job to do?" wrote Seattle resident Kevin Zelko. "Twitter is not how politicians work. Go make the country better. Become a representative for your state. Not a Twitter account."Communications Director for United Rural Democrats Max Pinkerton offered a suggestion for Greene's political future."You should leave," Pinkerton tweeted. "Now.""Sit down," tweeted songwriter Tom Maxwell. "Your time has passed, and your hero's defeated."Twitter user Cranky Old Dude wrote, "Deal with it sweety." Embedded in his tweet was a GIFof Biden smiling at the camera.Greene's comments about Biden's connections with China came in the wake of China's announcement of sanctions against some American lawmakers.On Tuesday, Pompeo equated China's treatment of minority ethnic communities, including the Muslim Uighurs, to genocide. Both the U.S. and human rights groups have alleged that China is holding more than 1 million individuals from ethnic minorities in concentration camps. The U.S. government has placed sanctions against some members of the Chinese government in response to the treatment of the Uighurs. After Trump left office on Wednesday, China announced reciprocal sanctions.In a statement from China's foreign ministry, a spokesperson alleged that some U.S. lawmakers "have planned, promoted and executed a series of crazy moves which have gravely interfered in China's internal affairs, undermined China's interests, offended the Chinese people, and seriously disrupted China-U.S. relations."Among the 28 individuals blacklisted by the Chinese government are Pompeo, Trump's former Director of Trade and Manufacturing Policy Peter Navarro, former Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and former national security adviser John Bolton. Sanctions were also announced against former Asian diplomat David Stilwell and Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon. Trump pardoned Bannon, who had been charged with fraud, on Wednesday.According to the statement, the individuals named and their immediate family members are prohibited from entering China, Hong Kong and Macao.Newsweek reached out to the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in the United States of America for further comment.Link to ImageGraphic marjorie taylor greene calls biden communistDustin Chambers/GettyGeorgia Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene implied in a Wednesday tweet that President Joe Biden was aligned with the communist government of China.Load-Date: January 20, 2021End of Document

Understand how the Chinese government wants to regulate fintechsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 9, 2021 TuesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1938 wordsBodyIt's hard to imagine life in China today without Alipay and WeChat Pay. Whether buying products and services online or in an old-fashioned store, movie tickets or train tickets, ordering a taxi or a delivery, booking a table at restaurants, paying bills, getting a small loan, sending money to a friend or donating to an institution – almost everything can be paid for in these two ubiquitous digital wallets today, with just a few clicks on a smartphone or with a QR code.After a modest start offering payment systems for commercial transactions on the internet, WeChat Pay and Alipay have become giants in China's payment industry and have extended their tentacles to virtually everything, scanning up to the Lunar New Year tradition of giving money in red packages. But these closed ecosystems have become a growing concern for Chinese regulators, not only because their market power has the potential to fend off competition and encourage monopolistic behavior, but also because of the potential risks they can bring to the financial system.                                               Alipay logo at Ant Group offices in Shanghai, China - Hector Retamal/AFP                    Today, after a decade of unimpeded success, Alipay and WeChat Pay face regulatory changes to curb their domination, build a more level playing field for competition and control potential risks. But the rules don't just target these two players. They intend to tighten oversight of all non-bank institutions operating in the payments sector, as the People's Bank of China (BPC) explained in a statement that accompanied the release of a draft of the "Regulations of non-bank payment institutions" on January 20. The draft contains six chapters and 75 articles, and if approved will give the government and regulators new powers to fight monopolies and contain dominant actors, even forcing them to sell some of their businesses.Here are four things to know about theprovisional rules.    What's behind the new regulation?    BPC laid the groundwork for regulating non-bank payment institutions (IPNBs) in 2010, when e-commerce largely decoted. Alipay, which was created by Alibaba Group in 2004 and is now owned by its affiliate Ant Group, was becoming a dominant force in processing payments for customers who bought goods and services on its e-commerce platform through phones and computers. Tencent Holdings set up Tenpay in 2005, but its now ubiquitous Paymentplatform WeChat Pay, Alipay's biggest competitor, only emerged in 2013.Online payments have exploded over the past decade thanks to the massive growth of e-commerce and smartphone adoption by consumers. WeChat Pay and Alipay built ecosystems around their payment apps that have become trampolines, allowing users to do just about everything.In 2019, the value of transactions made via the cellular payment system facilitated by IPNBs alone reached 204.9 trillion yuan (US$172 trillion), up from just 8 trillion yuan in 2014, according to data compiled by research firm Analysis. That number is expected to have increased 18.5 percent by 2020 to 242.8 trillion yuan, the firm said in a report released in December.Today there are more than 230 licensed IPNBs in China, also known as third-party payment providers. They include GoPay, a company controlled by U.S. fintech PayPal, which became the first foreign company to get a license in China in 2019 after buying a majority stake in the Chinese firm. But the market is dominated by the two giants – Alipay and WeChat Pay. Alipay had 55.39% of the third-party mobile payments market in the second quarter of 2020, while Tenpay, Tencent's payments business consisting primarily of WeChat Pay, held 38.47%, according to Analysis data.The massive growth of the payments industry over the past decade has left the 2010 regulations seriously outdated."In recent years, the payment services market has developed rapidly," The BPC said in a statement accompanying the draft. "There is constant innovation, and the risks are complex and changeable. Dealing with struggling institutions and exiting the market has brought new demands" on regulation, he said.Regulators are concerned that Alibaba and Tencent are abusing their dominance, using their platforms to give their other businesses an unfair competitive advantage. Alibaba's Taobao, the country's largest and dominant online shopping platform, for example, only allows users to pay for products and services with bank cards or Alipay, blocking WeChat Pay and other similar platforms. Similarly, tencent's social networking ecosystem and other platforms are not open to Alipay.                                               Alibaba Headquarters in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China - Aly Song - Feb 14,2019/Reuters                    Another concern of financial authorities is the risk of contagion, that if a crisis breaks out in an IPNB can spread rapidly through the financial system. BPC Deputy Governor Pan Gongsheng wrote in a January 27 commentary in the British newspaper Financial Times that the nature of the financial sector "crossing borders, industries and regions means that financial risks are spreading faster and further away, with a greater ripple effect.""The network effects mean that competition from fintechs often leads to results of 'the winner takes it all', including market monopolies and unfair competition," Pan wrote.Of course, authorities intend to fill regulatory gaps as the industry develops and ensure that IPNBs stay in their original business.Caixin learned from sources informed that authorities began working on the new regulations in 2019 and consulted with relevant government agencies, commercial banks, clearing institutions, industry associations and payment providers, including Alipay and WeChat Pay, as well as other financial technology firms.    What are the highlights of the new regulation?    The BPC draft covers broad ground, such as compliance with money laundering regulations such as prepayments and client funds need to be managed, and improving corporate governance, especially with regard to shareholders.But the main focus and the most addressed issue in the news is competition and monopolistic behavior, which according to consensus is a clear attack on Ant Group and Tencent, which practically hold a duopoly of outsourced payments in China.One of the main changes involves how IPNBs are supervised and licensed. The current system is based on the type of technology and means of payments, and licenses are issued under three broad categories – internet payments, prepaid cards and bank cards at points of sale, according to a report by lawyers from Han Kun Law Offices, which specializes in international and domestic transactions. But they say that classification is outdated. For example, a payment using QR code doesn't actually fit any of these types, the report said.The proposed regulations redesign the licensing system and reclassify non-bank payment companies into two types, according to their function: those offering payment accounts with stored value and those dealing only with payment processing ofTransactions.                                               Ant Group logo in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China - Aly Song/Reuters                    A payment system with stored value covers anything that requires opening an account and offering prepayment services. This could include a prepaid card operation or providing electronic wallets, which allow consumers to store money and use it digitally, experts told Caixin. Transaction payment processing basically covers the processing of payments between customer and seller, without involvement in payments with stored value.A veteran of the payments industry told Caixin that the new classification is a significant innovation, as the current one does not fully cover the activities of the outsourced payments field.Several industry sources also told Caixin that the proposed change in classification may indicate that a reform of the licensing system is on the way.    How will the new rules deal with monopolistic practices?    Attacking monopolistic behavior is one of the key objectives of the new regulations, part of a broader agenda of the authorities to contain monopolies and the abuse of market power in a broad territory of economic activity, not just in financial services. Strengthening and improving the enforcement of laws against monopoly and unfair competition are among the priorities highlighted in an action plan to build a "high-standard market system" over the next five years, jointly released by the Communist Party and the Council of State on January 31.The BPC has made it clear that if it finds a monopoly it will break it, but the devil is in the details and we don't know enough at the moment.While the draft offers a definition of monopoly – basically examining market share – and outlines intervention measures to attack monopolistic behavior, it does not define how it will measure the participation ofmarket, whether by number of transactions or by value. Caixin has learned from sources on the issue that the central bank is considering publishing more detailed guidelines.                                               Tencent logo at event in Beijing, China - Tingshu Wang/Reuters                    The draft defines a monopoly on third-party payments such as any IPNB with market share of 50% or more in electronic payments, or two institutions that have two-thirds market share or more, or three representing at least 75% of the market. BPC has previously defined electronic payments as online and mobile payments and payments made by phone, ATMs, or via terminals at retail points in physical transactions.Any provider that falls under the BPC's monopoly definition may be subject to investigation by the antitrust body of the Council of State, although the draft does not cite the body. If the survey confirms that there is a monopoly, the BPC may recommend corrective action, which goes from suspending a service to partial disruption of an institution, forcing the sale of certain operations.An IPNB with a market share of a third or two with a combined 50% market share of non-bank payments would trigger a warning or "regulatory interview," according to the draft.It is clear that BPC is in view of Alipay and WeChat Pay and wants to break its domination in the mobile payments market by opening up access to alibaba and tencent's dominant ecosystems to other players.Other tech giants such as food delivery service Meituan, app transport company Didi Chuxing, e-commerce and online retail platform JD.com and smartphone maker Xiaomi are among rivals trying to open a gap in the industry but have small market shares. China's state-owned UnionPay – the largest paymentand clearing organization that dominates the bank card market – has been trying to get into mobile payments with itsQuickPass service since its launch in 2017, but is still a minor actor.The last to enter the dispute is ByteDance, owner of TikTok, which obtained its license for payments through the acquisition of Wuhan Hezhong Epro Technology last year. In January, its short video platform Douyin launched the Douyin Pay eWallet, which allows its nearly 600 million daily users to buy third-party articles, make virtual donations to artists and pay to watch shows, as well as buy products during live e-commerce sessions. But just as Alibaba and Tencent Douyin is excluding other major platforms that it increasingly considers its rivals – in October, links to Taobao, JD.com and Pinduoduo were removed from the app's live sessions.Load-Date: February 10, 2021End of Document

Human Rights Watch Issues Commentary on China's Big Tech CrackdownTargeted News ServiceMarch 18, 2021 Thursday 9:20 AM  ESTCopyright 2021 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 924 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK BodyHuman Rights Watch issued the following commentary:* * *China's Big Tech Crackdown is Not a Model for the U.S.By Yaqiu WangChina ResearcherChinese President Xi Jinping called on the country's regulators to ramp up control on the internet economy in a speech on Monday, spelling more trouble for Chinese tech giants that have already been in the government's crosshairs for their monopolistic behavior.On Tuesday, Alibaba's popular internet browser was removed from app stores in China after the state media criticized it for allegedly allowing misleading medical advertising. Alibaba -- whose core business is online retail, much like its American counterpart, Amazon -- has over the years amassed a large portfolio of print, broadcast, digital and social media platforms. The government is now reportedly ordering the company to divest and dump its media assets as authorities grow more concerned about the tech giant's influence over public opinion.In the United States, the Biden administration is recruiting high-profile leaders in the Big Tech antitrust space, but while Washington is responding to pressure to improve transparency and accountability in the industry, Beijing's motive is to solidify political control to ensure that no private company will grow too large or deviate from serving the political and economic goals set by the ruling Chinese Communist Party.On Friday, China's regulators fined several other large tech companies in the country, including Tencent, Baidu, Didi and TikTok developer ByteDance, for past acquisitions and investments.Last June, China's internet regulator censured Chinese social media platform Weibo -- of which Alibaba owns 30 percent -- after it appeared to have censored posts about an Alibaba executive's alleged extramarital affair.But don't mistake the party's move as a defense of free speech. In November, Xu Lin, a top official in the party's Central Propaganda Department, said in a public speech that China must "resolutely prohibit dilution of the party's leadership in the name of convergence," meaning media convergence, and "resolutely guard against risks of capital manipulating public opinion."The message is clear: Only the party can censor and manipulate public opinion.Beijing maintains the world's most sophisticated online censorship and surveillance apparatus. And private tech companies' compliant participation in the system is essential to the efficient running of the apparatus. Companies censor and surveil users on the government's behalf and hand over user data when so-called sensitive information is discovered.Authorities also directly embed cybersecurity police units in major internet companies. Numerous users of WeChat, which is owned by Tencent, have gone to prison for criticizing the government. ByteDance, owner of the video-sharing app Douyin, worked closely with the police to disseminate state propaganda that whitewashed Beijing's human rights violations in Xinjiang.Chinese tech CEOs have little room to object or negotiate with regulators because there is no rule of law or redress. Few know the perils of straying from the party line better than Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba and its affiliate financial firm Ant Group. In November, Chinese regulators abruptly suspended Ant's IPO days before it was set to list, following Ma's public speech in which he sharply criticized China's financial regulatory system for stifling innovation.After the speech, Ma disappeared from public view. It was not until late January that he resurfaced in an online video in which he spoke about his philanthropic activities supporting Xi's signature economic initiative to root out rural poverty.In the age of government versus Big Tech, we already know which side will win out in China. Big Tech never even stood a chance.On the surface, the party's crackdown on tech companies is to protect the public from misinformation as well as the rights and interest of consumers. This is not entirely a facade; in recent years, laws and regulations have been promulgated to protect internet users against commercial privacy abuses and cybercrime. Last October, the government unveiled a draft of the Personal Information Protection Law, which, strikingly, has many provisions modeled after the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation.In response to pressure from the Chinese government, foreign governments, investors and users, some Chinese companies in the past several years have taken meaningful steps to protect consumer privacy and security, according to research by Ranking Digital Rights, a digital rights organization. Search engine company Baidu, as well as Tencent, have improved transparency in relation to how their users' data is used, shared, stored and amplified.These are positive developments for Chinese internet users, some of whom in the past have fallen prey to false and harmful online advertising and scammers due to tech companies' irresponsible or predatory data-sharing practices. But the government's clampdown on Big Tech will not solve the bigger problem for Chinese users: The abuse is by the unelected and unaccountable government itself.Beijing's efforts to stem the power of tech giants offers a cautionary tale: Antitrust measures are not a panacea to addressing the outsize power of Big Tech. Without a robust legal framework to protect freedom of expression and privacy, they will more likely further consolidate power in an abusive government.[Category: International]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7424047 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: March 18, 2021End of Document

China: the government's crusade to educate children to be "more manly"CE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 16, 2021 TuesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1026 wordsBody              While China wants its young people to choose to be soldiers, it is not everyone's ambition.            Barcroft Media/Getty Images While China wants its young people to choose to be soldiers, it is not everyone's ambition.       The Chinese government believes the country's young men have become too "feminine."This was suggested by a recent message from China's Ministry of Education that did not escape controversy. The statement, posted on the ministry's website, was described as sexist by many indeternet users, but some say China's male celebrities are partly guilty.The "Proposal for the Prevention of the Feminization of Men and Adolescents" urges schools to completely reform their physical education offer and strengthen the recruitment of teachers.The text advises recruiting retired athletes and people with sports backgrounds and "vigorously developing" particular sports such as football with the aim of "cultivating student masculinity".The measure is pushed in a country where the media often shows immaculate and "socially responsible" stars.  "Weak, shy and self-destructive"  There were some previous signs in China that suggested such a movement was coming. Last May, a delegate from the government's top advisory body, Si Zefu, said many of China's young men had become "weak, shy, and self-destructive."               TF Boys (photo) are extremely popular, but the media question whether they are good role models.            VCG/Getty Images TF Boys (photo) are extremely popular, but the media questions whether they are good role models.       He stated that there was a tendency among young Chinese men towards "feminization," which would "inevitably jeopardize the survival and development of the Chinese nation" unless it was "effectively managed."The official said the home environment was partly guilty, as most Chinese children are raised by their mothers or grandmothers. He also noted that the growing appeal of certain male celebrities meant that many children "no longer wanted to be 'heroes of the army'."He then suggested that schools should play a more important role in ensuring that young Chinese receive a balanced education.  "What are men afraid of?"  The public's reaction in China to the communiqué was overwhelming and most of the responses were negative. Hundreds of thousands of Chinese expressed their anger on social media and many called the government's message sexist."Isfeminization now a derogatory term?" asked a Weibo user, receiving more than 200,000 likes. "In their minds it's like going to war": what gaokao is like, "the most difficult test in the world" for which young Chinese study more than 12 hours a day for yearsAnother said: "Children are also human. being emotional, shy or kind, these are human characteristics.""What are men afraid of? Being equal to women?" asked a third."There are 70 million more men than women in this country," said another. "No country in the world has such a deformed gender ratio. Isn't that masculine enough?"              President Xi, a well-known football fan, ?? he visited the Manchester City court on his visit to the UK in 2015.

Much has been written before about how China's leadership is significantly male-dominated.However, in some media, there was a positive reception of the measure. The Global Times noted that it had "gained some support."On social media platform Sina Weibo, comments suggested that China's male celebrities were to blame, especially those known as "little fresh meat" (??). This is a fashionable word that refers to youngChinese who are seen as impeccable,well groomed and with delicate features.The musical band TF Boys and Chinese singer Lu Han fall into this category, as do many K-pop stars.What is the "revenge development" practiced by millions of young workers in ChinaWhile figures such as basketball player Yao Ming achieved fame abroad, it is notable that football is specifically included in the proposal.That's no surprise. President Xi has spoken in the past of his hopes that the country will become a "world superpower of football" by 2050.               Lu Han and TF Boys are known as "little fresh meat" from China.            Getty Images Lu Han and TF Boys are known as "little fresh meat" from China.       But repeated attempts to improve the level of China's footballers have failed and even mocked them.Two years ago Marcello Lippi, who led Italy to win the 2006 FIFA World Cup, resigned as coach of the China national football team.Meanwhile, the government has worked in recent months to introduce and promote new role models for young ChineseAs far as women are concerned, the covid-19 pandemic has been a good opportunity to demonstrate the important role of women as frontline workers.And China's achievements in space last year were a great opportunity to promote figures like Zhou Chengyu, who became a viral sensation as a space commander at just 24 years old.But as Si Zefu insinued last year, for young Chinese people the appeal of being brave and strong soldiers, police or firefighters is diminishing.               Zhou was described in the state media as an "big sister" that young Chinese can admire.            CCTV Zhou was described in the state media as an "big sister" that young Chinese can admire.       The phenomenon of"fresh little meat" remains a proven success,but young male celebrities are under greater scrutiny and find it difficult to be anything that departs from an impeccable mold.In recent years, the media has struggled to allow young male stars to appear on Chinese screenstattoos or hoops. And one of China's leading pop stars was the subject of harsh online reviews in 2019 when he was photographed smoking.Remember that you can receive notifications from BBC Mundo.

Media freedom fight threatens to escalate UK-China tensionsCNN WireMarch 10, 2021 Wednesday 12:37 PM GMTCopyright 2021 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 931 wordsByline: By CNN staffDateline: (CNN) Body             Beijing has summoned Britain's ambassador to China over an article she wrote on press freedom, escalating a bitter row between the two countries that has spilled over to the media industry.On Tuesday, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spoke to Ambassador Caroline Wilson and lodged a formal complaint with her against a post she published last week on WeChat, the popular Chinese social media network.In the piece, Wilson argued that "foreign media in China are being misrepresented, which obscures their positive role.""Foreign media criticism of the Chinese authorities does not mean that they dislike China," she wrote. "On the contrary, I believe they act in good faith and play an active role as watchdogs of government actions, ensuring that people have access to accurate information and protecting those who do not have a voice."Tensions between the United Kingdom and China have been growing in recent months over a series of issues, including the political future of Hong Kong and human rights in Xinjiang. The various disputes have already ensnared some businesses, including Chinese tech firm Huawei and British bank HSBC. Regulators in both countries have also bannedeach other's most prominent media outlets.Last month, UK regulator Ofcom yanked state broadcaster China Global Television Network, or CGTN, from British airwaves, saying that the channel's license holder did not have "editorial responsibility" for its output. Officials also said CGTN could not transfer its license to a new entity because it would ultimately still be controlled by the Chinese Communist Party.A week later, China's National Radio and Television Administration (NRTA) banned BBC World News, claiming that the network had broadcast reports on China that "infringed the principles of truthfulness and impartiality in journalism."In her WeChat post, WIlson added that local news organizations in China often face tougher conditions than foreign ones."Unlike foreign media, Chinese media can only report critically under the conditions allowed by the government," she wrote.The article angered Chinese officials, who called Wilson's post "inappropriate."In a statement Tuesday, the head of the department of European affairs at China's foreign ministry said that Wilson was "complaining[on behalf of] individual foreign media outlets sanctioned for false news and inaccurate reports, deliberately confusing news defamation with news monitoring, and being 'selectively blind' to the foreign side's crackdown on Chinese media."During their meeting, the Chinese official "stressed that the Chinese government and people never oppose foreign media, but those who produce fake news and viciously attack China, the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese system under the banner of 'freedom of the press' and 'freedom of expression,'" according to the Chinese Foreign Ministry statement.The ministry said that Wilson's article had spread "widespread discontent among the Chinese public and was strongly criticized." It has since been restricted from being shared further on WeChat.Tencent, the Chinese tech giant that runs the messaging platform, added a notice to the post, saying it "violates" the platform's rules. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.Wilson doubled down on her post Tuesday."I stand by my article," she said on Twitter.The American social networking service is blocked in China."No doubt the outgoing Chinese Ambassador to the UK stands by the 170+ pieces he was free to place in mainstream British media," Wilson added, referring to Liu Xiaoming, China's longtime envoy to Britain."The UK is committed to media freedom, and to championing democracy and human rights around the world. We will always defend media freedom and the right of journalists to do their job," a spokesperson for the UK's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said in a statement. The British embassy in Beijing declined to comment beyond Wilson's remarks.In another swipe Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian called Wilson's piece "an intervention in China's internal affairs, [which] reflects her consistent double standards and deep-rooted ideological bias."Simmering tensionsChinese authorities have often criticized the portrayal of the country in Western media outlets, but its focus on the BBC has been particularly sharp in recent months. Beijing has repeatedly expressed frustration with the outlet's reporting on China's crackdown on Uyghur and other ethnic Muslim minorities in Xinjiang.Before CGTN was banned in the United Kingdom, Chinese state media unleashed numerous attacks on the BBC for what it called "malicious" reporting on the human rights issue in Xinjiang. The BBC has defended its reporting.A few weeks after the United Kingdom revoked CGTN's broadcasting license, CGTN posted a video titled: "Why is BBC making fake news against China?" referring to the British network's coverage of Hong Kong and Xinjiang.Ofcom also slapped CGTN on Monday with a £125,000 ($173,000) fine over several programs that it aired in 2019 on the Hong Kong protests. The agency had previously ruled that CGTN repeatedly breached impartiality standards with its coverage of the demonstrations.The agency also announced a £100,000 ($139,000) penalty for the airing of the confession of a British citizen who was arrested in China in 2013. The man, Peter Humphrey, said his confession was forced.                      By CNN staff         TM & © 2021 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

FROM COVID TO BLACKFACE ON TV, CHINA'S RACISM PROBLEM RUNS DEEPStates News ServiceFebruary 18, 2021 ThursdayCopyright 2021 States News ServiceLength: 837 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, N.Y. BodyThe following information was released by Human Rights Watch:High-profile blackface scandals typically produce public embarrassment, apologies and promises of self-reflection but not when the Chinese government is responsible. That's what we saw last week on the eve of the Lunar New Year, when the Chinese state broadcaster CCTV televised its annual live variety show, which draws hundreds of millions of viewers, featuring dancers in blackface.For those who think the official line from Beijing is bad, check out the Chinese internet, where the rampant racism against Black people is often too appalling to repeat.This performative use of blackface belies a rampant racism problem in the country, which comes on the heels of growing discrimination against Black people and Africans by the Chinese government, which appears to be compounded by the pandemic.Last April, authorities in the southern city of Guangzhou, which has China's largest African community, launched a campaign to forcibly test Africans in the city for the coronavirus, and ordered them to self-isolate or quarantine in designated hotels. Landlords evicted African residents, forcing many to sleep on the street, in hotels or in shops. Some restaurants refused to serve Black customers.Scenes of Africans sleeping on the street with their belongings were shared widely on social media, which sparked outrage among African communities around the world and prompted rare public rebuke from some African governments.But the Chinese government denied that the authorities' conduct was discriminatory, and blamed "Western media" for provoking "the problems between China and African countries."For those who think the official line from Beijing is bad, check out the Chinese internet, where the rampant racism against Black people is often too appalling to repeat. The use of racial slurs is ubiquitous on social media discussions about Black people. People of African descent living in China are often depicted as overstaying visas, not paying taxes and encroaching on Chinese culture.People of African descent living in China are often depicted as overstaying visas, not paying taxes, and encroaching on Chinese culture.African migrants as well as African Chinese intermarriages are commonly described as spelling doom for the Chinese race. "In a China, where the birth rate is gradually decreasing due to family planning policies," meaning the one-child policy in the past and the two-child policy of the present, "not too many years later, China will become a country with a Black and foreign Muslim majority," lamented one person on the Chinese social media platform Weibo. In other instances, some Chinese women in relationships with Black men were doxxed and vilified.During the Lunar New Year live show last week, as the "African Song and Dance" number began, dancers launched into a performance allegedly meant to celebrate traditional African culture. But viewers quickly realized that the dancers were Chinese, their skin darkened by makeup.Criticism came quickly. On Twitter, Black Livity China, an activist group run by Africans in China, called the show "extremely disappointing." "We cannot stress enough the impact scenes such as these have on African and Afro-diasporic communities living in China," the group stated.In response to the backlash, China's foreign affairs ministry stated that the performance was a sign of respect and that those who "make a fuss" about the program "obviously have ulterior motives."This isn't the first time the Lunar New Year show has featured racist caricatures. In CCTV's 2018 Lunar New Year gala, a skit intended to showcase the Chinese government's friendship with African countries and China's investment in Africa featured a Chinese actress in blackface with an exaggerated fake posterior and a basket of fruit on her head, reciting lines like, "China has done so much for Africa" and "I love Chinese people! I love China!" Accompanying her was an actor from Ivory Coast dressed in a monkey costume.Just like in 2021, the 2018 skit drew outrage from audiences around the world. "[C]ringworthy at best, completely racist at worse. It's Africa, so bring out tribal dancers and animals?" one person commented on Twitter.Meanwhile, Chinese President Xi Jinping has been touting the establishment of a "community of shared future for mankind" on the international stage. One has to wonder whether these displays are merely a manifestation of the kind of community or international system that Xi wants to build.The Chinese government and social media companies occasionally censor online hate speech, and some users have been warned by the authorities to stop their racist rhetoric. But Beijing largely has itself to blame for the persistence of online racial hate. It is the result of decades of severe repression of any discussion or activism that promotes the ideas of racial and ethnic equality and human rights, combined with ever-increasing nationalistic and chauvinist propaganda from the government.Load-Date: February 18, 2021End of Document

2 films offer 2 tales ahead of Wuhan lockdown anniversaryAssociated Press InternationalJanuary 22, 2021 Friday 11:54 AM GMTCopyright 2021 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWS; ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLength: 848 wordsByline: EMILY WANG FUJIYAMA and HUIZHONG WU, Associated PressDateline: WUHAN, China BodyWUHAN, China (AP) — Two new films about Wuhan were released Friday, the eve of the anniversary of the start of a 76-day lockdown in the central Chinese city where the coronavirus was first detected. How they were released and who their audiences are stand in stark contrast.The first, a state-backed film praising Wuhan's sacrifices, is being screened throughout China, targeting audiences that firmly back the ruling Communist Party’s response to the outbreak. The second, a somber documentary about the pandemic from artist and political activist Ai Weiwei, has been forced to seek viewers online, a testimony to the party’s influence over the global film industry.The Chinese government has sought to control the narrative and deflect blame about the pandemic's origins. It has weaved a story of triumph against the virus through TV shows, social media campaigns and books, lauding nurses and doctors and government-backed vaccine companies. Any criticism of early missteps is silenced.The state-backed film “Days and Nights in Wuhan” features contributions from 30 filmmakers portraying the suffering of the city's 11 million residents, medical staff and front-line workers as they battled the virus that began racing through the city in December 2019.Ai’s “Coronation” has been rejected by festivals, theaters and streaming services including Amazon and Netflix, he said. He attributes the censorship to fears over offending the ruling party, which controls what movies can be shown in China and what Chinese films can be displayed abroad.“I don’t care about the film festivals,” Ai said in a virtual news conference Friday hosted by the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan. “But they are a platform, they should present meaningful films. That's their duty. If there's a failure of this duty, then I feel ashamed of them.”The lockdown in Wuhan, imposed on Jan. 23, 2020, was eventually extended to surrounding areas in Hubei province, confining some 56 million people to their homes.“Days and Nights in Wuhan,” directed by Cao Jinling, debuted in Wuhan earlier and was released nationwide Friday. The film echoes China’s official line that the measures it took, including the lockdown, bought precious time for the world to prepare for the pandemic. Critics say habitual Communist Party secrecy and weak control measures allowed the virus’ initial spread.It's not clear if there are plans to show it overseas.“We wanted to record the journey of battling against the COVID-19 epidemic via motion picture. Some of the details, including the intense care, anxious waiting, heartbreaking farewells and hopeful rebirths, might strike a chord with viewers,” Cao was quoted as saying by state broadcaster CCTV.In the trailer, medical staff repeatedly express their determination to prevail over the outbreak. “I have a burning love for my hometown and I will do whatever I can to save it," says one ambulance driver.Ai’s film tackles the same story from the perspective of construction workers, delivery staff, medical workers and Wuhan residents. Like the other film, it is a collage, but draws instead on footage filmed sometimes surreptitiously by friends, colleagues and amateur videographers, some of whom remain anonymous to avoid repercussions from the authorities.His film offers a rare glimpse of the pain that COVID-19 patients in China suffered, with footage of them struggling to breathe as medical workers in protective gear attempted to save them.Hospitals and morgues were overwhelmed at the height of the crisis and Wuhan accounts for the bulk of China's death toll of 4,635.Following a thinly attended showing of “Days and Nights in Wuhan” on Friday morning, Wang Yu said the movie had awakened both memories of the trauma of lockdown and fears for what might still lie ahead.“It’s hard to describe. It’s been a year since then, and to think back now, it’s still painful," said Wang, 31. Relatives of her husband who died in the outbreak appeared in the film, she said.“There is the mutated virus, there’s fear. It’s the second Lunar New Year holiday that we have to pass like this,” she said. “Things are little better than last year but I’m worried, its not completely over. You’re still under the effect of the virus, the fear and the terror."Wuhan has been largely free from the virus since the end of lockdown, while smaller outbreaks have set off renewed containment measures in many other Chinese cities.China’s government has sought to cast doubt that Wuhan is the source of the pandemic, pushing fringe theories that the virus was actually brought from outside the country, possibly by U.S. soldiers.The city is now hosting a team sent by the World Health Organization to begin investigating the virus’ origins.A panel of experts commissioned by the WHO criticized China and other countries this week for not moving faster to stem the initial outbreak, prompting Beijing to concede it could have done better but also to defend its response.___Wu reported from Taipei, Taiwan.

China is raising the alarm over corporate surveillance. But it's got a massive network of its ownCNN WireMarch 19, 2021 Friday 8:32 AM GMTCopyright 2021 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 992 wordsByline: By Laura He, CNN BusinessDateline: (CNN) Body             A popular annual consumer rights show in China has sparked a national debate about privacy and surveillance and sent companies scrambling to stay on Beijing's good side.The firestorm first erupted Monday during a two-hour primetime program called "315" that coincides with World Consumer Rights Day. The program is frequently used by China's state media to lambast brands over perceived shortcomings - Nike, McDonald's and Apple have all been targeted by the show in prior years.This year, concerns about surveillance and privacy were front-and-center. Chinese state broadcaster China Central Television, or CCTV, used the program to accuse several companies of secretly collecting data about their customers using facial recognition - notably, without mentioning the massive network of facial recognition cameras that the Chinese government has built, capable of tracking people in real time.CCTV accused the Chinese unit of American manufacturer Kohler, for example, of installing cameras in hundreds of its stores in China and capturing the faces of customers to analyze their gender and age, among other details."No matter which store the customers visit, or how many times they go, Kohler would know," the Chinese state broadcaster reported during the program. It also singled out a BMW dealership and a Max Mara retail store in the Shanghai area for using similar technology.Nationwide uproarWhile those brands weren't the only ones criticized by the program - big foreign companies like Ford and Nissan's Infiniti brand were also accused of poor behavior, such as defects with car parts or other disputes - it's the surveillance issue that appears to have gained the most traction.CCTV posts about the claims have generated tens of thousands of comments on the social media platform Weibo, where people worried about whether their personal information was being abused."It's not just Kohler," wrote one Weibo user. "Did you forget even our residential buildings require facial recognition?"Kohler wrote on its official Weibo account on Tuesday that it had "already arranged" for its stores to remove the cameras "overnight," and would power off any devices that it could not physically dismantle. The company denied, however, that it had stored or analyzed any data it collected with the cameras, adding that it only used them to count customer arrivals.Zhengtong Auto, a luxury car dealer that operates the BMW store, said it had removed its cameras, too. And Chinese state media reported that Max Mara suspended the use of store cameras, though the company added that it was only using data to count customer traffic.Chinese authorities, meanwhile, have started investigating some of the companies featured on the program. Prosecutors announced Wednesday that they would open a probe into Ovopark, a Chinese company that supplied cameras to Kohler. Regulators in Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Shanghai all said they would investigate companies accused of misusing facial recognition data, too.A 'far cry' from Beijing's surveillance networkThe "315" show has broadcast in China for decades, often focusing on hot-button consumer rights issues of the moment.It's well known for eliciting a quick response from the companies accused of bad behavior. Apple CEO Tim Cook even apologized in 2013 after the company's warranty services were criticized on the show.This year's focus on privacy and surveillance highlights rising worries in China about the use of such technology in the digital age, according to Willy Lam, a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong who studies Chinese politics and societal issues.It's not just Weibo users who have gotten wrapped up in the fallout, either."The '315' program is a reminder of how easily people's facial IDs can be obtained" and "how rampant the use of the technology is," wrote the editorial board of the Guangming Daily, a major state-owned national newspaper, on Wednesday. "Our regulation is lacking behind in the facial recognition industry."But state-driven concerns about privacy and surveillance might ring a bit hollow to some."Impinging on people's privacy isn't a good look for Kohler and BMW, but it's a far cry [from] China's massive [closed-circuit television] surveillance network," said Paul Bischoff, a consumer privacy expert and the editor of Comparitech, a UK-based technology research firm.CCTV reported in 2017 that more than 20 million cameras had been installed across China at that time for the purpose of "maintaining public security." And the total number through now may be much higher: China had 349 million surveillance cameras installed as of 2018, nearly five times the number of cameras in the United States, according to a report from IHS Markit Technology.Lam said that Beijing may think that stopping companies - and especially foreign ones - from obtaining large amounts of biometric information is a responsible decision.But the government still has a much farther reach than businesses to when it comes to surveillance. And Lam added that since discussions about such projects are restricted in mainland China, the public may not be aware of how far Beijing's reach extends."Yes, some tech companies do collect and store people's photos to use in face recognition applications. And I support regulations restricting such data collection without consent," said Bischoff. "US and European laws still lag behind in that regard. But unlike China, these applications are not being used to restrict freedom of movement or assembly."Lam also suggested that the program - along with the fallout that has stemmed from it - points to another longstanding government priority: making sure that businesses know they aren't above the government."It's a reminder that companies need to listen and play by the rules," he added.                      By Laura He, CNN Business         TM & © 2021 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

WHO TEAM UNLIKELY TO MEET WITH CRITICS OF CHINA'S HANDLING OF PANDEMIC: RIGHTS GROUPStates News ServiceFebruary 1, 2021 MondayCopyright 2021 States News ServiceLength: 866 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:World Health Organization (WHO) investigators probing the origins of the coronavirus in China are unlikely to be allowed to meet with critics of the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)'s handling of the early stages of the pandemic, an overseas-based rights group said on Monday.The team visited two disease control centers on Monday that had an early hand in managing the outbreak in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.Since emerging from a 14-day quarantine period, the team -- which has said it isn't trying to apportion blame for the pandemic -- have also visited hospitals and a seafood market linked to an early cluster of cases.But the Chinese Human Rights Defenders (CHRD) group said that even if the group were to try, they would have problems talking to anyone offering a different view from the government's official narrative."Even if they try, the WHO experts would have difficulties finding anybody to talk to, from whistleblowing doctors, citizen reporters, to victims' families, or any critics of the Chinese government's handling of the coronavirus outbreak," CHRD said in a report on its website.Rather, the authorities have been suppressing information and penalizing dissent, it said."Citizen journalists who went to Wuhan in the early days of the coronavirus outbreak to report from the frontlines have either gone missing or went to jail," it said."The exact whereabouts of Fang Bin and Chen Qiushi remain unknown; Zhang Zhan was sentenced to 4 years in jail; and Chen Mei and Cai Wei, who tried to preserve censored COVID information, are still detained."It added: "Outspoken critics of President Xi Jinping for his handling of the pandemic are locked up Ren Zhiqiang received 18 years in jail, Guo Quan and Xu Zhiyong remain in pretrial detention."Disappeared, presumed detainedThe group also cited the cases of two women who spoke out about vaccine safety who have "disappeared," and are presumed detained by the authorities.Hua Xiuzhen was last seen on Jan. 13 in Shanghai, escorted away by Yangpu district neighborhood committee officials, while He Fangmei went "missing" in Henan province on Oct. 9, it said."What the two missing women have in common is their tenacious campaign for transparency in the government's vaccination programs and their efforts to seek accountability," CHRD said.The WHO team is looking for large quantities of evidence including animal samples, genetic analysis, and epidemiological studies that will help it pin down the origins of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.According to Reuters, no full itinerary for the group's field work has been announced, and journalists covering the tightly controlled visit have been kept at a distance from team members.However, the WHO tweeted last week that the team would include a visit to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which carries out research into bat coronaviruses, sparking speculation that there is a link with its activities and the emergence of COVID-19 in the same city."Field visits will include the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Huanan market, Wuhan CDC laboratory," the agency said via its Twitter account, adding that the team would speak with some of the first people to be confirmed as COVID-19 patients.Seafood market reorganizedPolitical commentator Fu Shenqi said city authorities have "reorganized" the South China Seafood Market linked to the start of the first outbreak beyond recognition."Equipment, materials, and data in P4 laboratories have been . . . hidden and the hospitals are fully prepared for these visits," Fu said in a commentary broadcast on RFA's Mandarin Service."What is there left for the experts to investigate?" he said, adding that the team is fully expecting this."The WHO doesn't want the international community to have high expectations for this investigation," Fu wrote. "Official CCP rhetoric is even clearer that this isn't an investigation, but more of a collaboration ... with Chinese experts on the origins of the virus.""We can expect the WHO to go through the motions with this probe ... and China wants it to conclude that the source of the virus wasn't in Wuhan," Fu wrote.Despite speculation around the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Beijing has repeatedly tried to change the narrative around the origins of the coronavirus, with state-run media frequently suggesting that it was brought to the country from somewhere else.Fu said a vaguely worded report from the WHO team would be most likely to win the approval of the Chinese government.China recorded more than 2,000 new domestic cases of COVID-19 in January, the highest monthly total since the final phase of the initial outbreak in Wuhan in March 2020.Two people died of the disease in January, the first fatalities in several months.Meanwhile, travel bans and quarantine restrictions are being implemented nationwide ahead of the Lunar New Year celebrations starting Feb. 12, with schools only operating online, and government incentives offered to people who stay put and don't travel back to be with relatives for the festive season.Reported by RFA's Mandarin and Cantonese Services.

'Fascist China, Nazi China': Uighurs Demand US Prosecute Chinese Ambassadors For Genocide, Boycott Beijing OlympicsThe Daily CallerFebruary 6, 2021 Saturday 03:24 AM ESTCopyright 2021 The Daily Caller, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: DAILY-CALLER-NEWS-FOUNDATION; usLength: 1105 wordsByline: Kaylee Greenlee, Reporter, kaylee@dailycallernewsfoundation.orgBodyLink to Image• Uighur gathered to lobby the U.S. government to boycott the 2022 Beijing Olympics and to prosecute Chinese ambassadors for genocide.• Most young Uighurs are afraid to participate in demonstrations in the U.S. because the Chinese government will send them messages threatening to harm their families, protesters told the Daily Caller News Foundation. • The only way to end the Chinese genocide against the Uighur's will be to restore independence to Eastern Turkistan, the Prime Minister of the East Turkistan Government in Exile told the DCNF. WASHINGTON, D.C. - Uighurs protested outside the State Department on Friday asking that the U.S. government boycott the 2022 Beijing Olympics and to prosecute Chinese ambassadors for genocide.Around 30 demonstrators thanked the U.S. government for helping the Uighur people and asked that it declare China's actions of genocide against the Uighurs to the United Nations Security Council. The protesters asked the U.S. government to allow Uighurs to seek asylum in the U.S.They said between 2,000 and 3,000 undocumented Uighurs live in the U.S. and asked that they receive permanent resident status.“Right now, under the genocide designation, the U.S. has a moral and legal obligation to act,” Prime Minister of the East Turkistan Government in Exile Salih Hudayar told the Daily Caller News Foundation. Chinese government occupied East Turkistan in December 1949 and renamed the region Xinjiang, an “offensive” term that means “new territory,” according to the East Turkistan Government in Exile's website.Link to ImageUighurs protested against the upcoming Beijing Olympics and asked the U.S. government to continue helping the Uighur people in Xinjiang, Chia, outside the State Department in Washington, D.C. on Feb. 5, 2020.“China is a threat to America. We hope that the U.S. implements its own laws and punishes Chinese officials,” a woman named Mahira told the DCNF. She did not give her last name because she feared repercussions.“We don't want what is happening to us today to be what will happen to America tomorrow,” Mahira said.Most of the Uighurs in the U.S. aren't able to contact their families who are stuck in concentration camps in Xinjiang, she told the DCNF.“A lot of kids are afraid to show up to protests because they are scared of what will happen to their families,” Mahira's daughter, Sarah, told the DCNF. She broke down in tears as she spoke.“They're just so scared to speak in public because the Chinese government will send them threatening messages, threatening their families over social media,” Sarah said. “They're all wanting to speak about what is really happening to them, but they're afraid of what will happen to their families. So, the U.S. government needs to help these kids.”Millions of people, including Uighur Muslims, were sent to concentration camps in 2014 and were faced with forced sterilization, labor, and other forms of torture under Chinese occupation, Hudayar said. Over one million people in the region have been detained by the Chinese government, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.“Time is running out for East Turkistan and its people,” Hudayar told the DCNF. “Our women are being systematically raped and sexually abused by Chinese forces in East Turkistan. Men are being killed, organs are being harvested and our children have been forcibly taken away from us and sent to state-run orphanages to be raised as loyal Chinese citizens.”Hudayar was born in East Turkistan before seeking political refuge in the U.S. with his family in 2000, according to the East Turkistan Government in Exile's website. He was elected was elected prime minister in November 2019 nd also founded the East Turkistan National Awakening Movement.Hudayar said that boycotting the 2022 Olympics would be more significant than a diplomatic statement and that it would affect China's political and economic standing with other countries. (RELATED: Investigation Finds That China Uses Uighur Labor To Produce Masks: Report) “The Olympics would be one thing China uses to show off its prestige. So this would be hitting back against China prestige saying 'we're boycotting this because you are engaging in genocide,'” Hudayar told the DCNF.The East Turkistan region, known as the Xinjiang Chinese autonomous region, has been under the control of several different empires and dynasties over the last 100 years, according to Hudayar. If the U.S. declares East Turkistan an occupied country, then it would be subject to international law and the Chinese control over the region would be considered illegal, he said.“The only way we can truly end this genocide in East Turkestan is if we restore our country's independence because over the past 100 years we have had multiple Chinese administrations, not just the [Communist Party of China] today. All of them have engaged in the same atrocities, except in the CCP is much worse on a much larger scale,” Hudayar told the DCNF.Secretary of State Antony Blinken agreed in January with former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that China committed genocide against Muslims in the Xinjiang province.“My judgment remains that genocide was committed against the Uighurs and that hasn't changed,” Blinken said.The CCP has labeled Uighur Muslims as enemies of the state and forces them into camps where they are given medication, tortured and forced into labor, according to Hudayar.Azat Mahmut Srekashdari said he attended the demonstration in remembrance of the people who were killed in the Ghulja Massacre, which he said he witnessed.He said young people participated in peaceful demonstrations on Feb. 5, 1997, and the Chinese government responded by spraying people with cold water causing over 400 deaths. Between 300 and 400 people were arrested and hosed down with icy water and kept in an open amidst freezing temperatures for around two hours, according to Amnesty International.Srekashdari told the DCNF that he fled to America shortly after to provide a better life for his children. He said 78 members of his family have been jailed since 2016, and many of them received 20-year sentences for telling other Uighur's about how amazing America was after visiting for a wedding.A private security guard with Intercon told Hudayar that there was no one inside the State Department building who could respond to the concerns of the group.Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

'Be relentless': What it will take to free two Canadians detained in ChinaCNN WireMarch 23, 2021 Tuesday 5:50 PM GMTCopyright 2021 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1383 wordsByline: By Paula Newton, CNNDateline: (CNN) Body             From her home in Toronto, Vina Nadjibulla fields hundreds of emails, texts, and phone calls, all about the only person she really wants to hear from.Nadjibulla's husband, Michael Kovrig, has been detained in China for more than two years, on espionage charges the Chinese government refuses to explain and Canada's Prime Minister says are "trumped up" and politically motivated.Kovrig's detention -- along with that of fellow Canadian Micheal Spavor -- followed the arrest in Vancouver of Meng Wanzhou, a top executive with Chinese telecoms giant Huawei, who is currently fighting extradition to the United States, where she is wanted on charges of breaching sanctions with Iran.On Monday, Kovrig's trial finally began in Beijing, but behind closed doors, with journalists and diplomats from more than two-dozen countries refused entry by the Chinese authorities, who said this was because the case involved "state secrets."Over the years, Canada has tried patience, pleas, and more recently concerted pressure, to no avail. Kovrig remains in a Chinese prison, where Nadjibulla said he has showed remarkable resilience and resolve."He inspires us to stay strong and to be relentless in our efforts to get him freed," she told CNN in an interview this week. "That is the word that he has used for us: 'Stay relentless,' and that is what we must do."Though the two separated prior to Kovrig's arrest, Nadjibulla is still married to Kovrig, and has been a forceful advocate for his release.Political detentionBeijing claims that Kovrig, a former Canadian diplomat who works for the International Crisis Group, was "stealing sensitive information and intelligence through contacts in China since 2017," while Spavor, a businessman with a focus on North Korea, is accused of providing intelligence to Kovrig.But most outside observers see the case as politically motivated, and even China has linked the fate of the "two Michaels" -- as they are known in Canada -- to that of Meng, the Huawei executive, who has enjoyed a far more comfortable detention, allowed to live in her Vancouver mansion and travel within the city of Vancouver with security and a tracking device on her ankle.Ottawa and Washington have denounced the use of the two men as "bargaining chips." What becomes of them may well foreshadow what China's reflex will be in the years to come when confronted with Western rules and laws it will not abide by.After months of attempting to reach a solution via diplomatic channels, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has become increasingly blunt, accusing China of engaging in "coercive diplomacy." But while he has come under criticism from some Canadians for not doing more, his options for forcing a release may be limited, with the solution China clearly desires -- releasing Meng -- more dependent on Washington than Ottawa."We've known since day one that ... Michael's fate and that of Michael Spavor are linked to a bigger geopolitical dispute and we must find a solution for that and that is the only way to bring Michael home," Nadjibulla said.She remains cautious about every word she utters on the case, not wanting in any way to compromise Kovrig's quest for freedom. For months following the two men's detention, their families were silent, believing that diplomatic negotiations would be successful in arranging their release.But as their cases have dragged on, with the two men held under difficult and worsening conditions in Chinese prisons, this strategy has proven unsuccessful. As well as being denied access to both men's trials this month, Canadian officials were denied access to their citizens for 10 months last year, after China introduced new limits on prison visits due to the coronavirus pandemic.In contrast, Meng has had dozens of hearings open to the public, the media and Chinese consular officials, as prescribed by Canadian law. She also has a battery of lawyers working on her case in both the US and Canada, while both Canadians have a lawyer provided by the Chinese government, and have not been able to confer with legal advisers of their choice.And while the "two Michaels" have been largely cut off from the outside world, Meng has, by her own admission, continued to live a relatively normal life in her multimillion dollar Vancouver home. Canada also recently confirmed that it had granted her family visas to visit her there, even allowing special exemptions from pandemic restrictions.Nadjibulla said she last heard from her husband in a letter in January. He is afforded few privileges, even things that are taken for granted in Canadian prisons, like exercise and fresh air."Michael describes the conditions as difficult, they're almost monastic," she said. "He gets to read books, which has been his solace, that is something we advocated quite hard for, for him to be able to get access to books and reading books is what's keeping him going."Despite not being allowed outside, Nadjibulla added that Kovrig has been committed to walking 7,000-steps per day around his cell.Digging inCanada's ambassador to China returned to Ottawa in recent days to further consult with government ministers on China policy as Beijing was hit with a new round of international sanctions -- including by Canada -- over its crackdown in Xinjiang.Those sanctions were announced in coordination with Washington, which has stepped up its advocacy for the "two Michaels," who many Canadians see as being detained as a result of US actions.Canadian officials said US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken raised the issue during a meeting with Chinese diplomats in Alaska last week, adding that the US has agreed to "treat these two individuals as if they were American citizens."Speaking earlier this month, Trudeau said "China needs to understand that it is not just about two Canadians, it is the respect for the rule of law and relationships with a broad range of Western countries that is at play with the arbitrary detention and the coercive diplomacy they have engaged in."China does not appear shaken, however, and if anything is digging in. The country's embassy in Ottawa has recently criticized the Canadian government for the arrest of Meng, and steadfastly insisted that the "two Michaels" were arrested for undermining national security."On the one hand, the Canadian side claims that it upholds the rule of law, but on the other hand, it makes irresponsible remarks with regards to China's handling relevant cases in accordance with law," the embassy said in a statement."How hypocritical and arrogant! When it comes to arbitrary detention, Ms. Meng Wanzhou has been arbitrarily detained for over two years despite the fact that she hasn't violated any Canadian law. This is arbitrary detention in every sense of the term."Such rhetoric has raised the stakes for the men's families. What could have been a tricky bilateral dispute resolved within months has escalated into a major confrontation that could play a role in reshaping China's relations with the West for years to come.Nadjibulla believes the support of the Biden administration could give efforts to free the two Canadians new momentum. But she is also realistic about the Chinese position, and what it will take to reach a compromise that will satisfy both parties, particularly with Beijing tying the case explicitly to that of Meng."There are people who I know are working on this and my sincere hope is that they see this moment and this development [of a trial] as a stark reminder that real lives are on the line and we must do everything we can to bring them home," she said.And as relentless as the past two years have been for her, Nadjibulla said she is always mindful that Kovrig is completely alone."It has been difficult for all of us here but nothing in comparison to what Michael has endured and he has done so with so much dignity and strength of character, his courage, his resilience, his ability to remain positive is what inspires me," she said. "He is in a fight for his life, for his freedom and it is my honor to be in his corner and to continue that fight until the day he's freed."                      CNN's James Griffiths contributed reporting from Hong Kong.         TM & © 2021 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

State phone China Mobile wins 1.1% more by 2020CE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 25, 2021 ThursdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 375 wordsBodyShanghai( China), 25 Mar (EFE).- Chinese state telephone company China Mobile, the world's highest-subscriber operator, made a net profit of 107,843 million yuan ($16.5 billion, EUR 13,963 million) in 2020, up 1.1% from the previous year.In his results account referred to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange today, the company's chairman, Yang Jie, explains that last year he presented a "complex environment" for China Mobile's operations, which maintained its business "despite various challenges and difficulties."China Mobile's operating revenues advanced by 3% to 768,070 million yuan ($117.568 billion, EUR 99,452 million), of which more than 90% came from telecommunications services - especially from wireless data traffic - a business that increased its turnover by 3.2% year-on-year.However, the number of mobile service customers contracted by about 8 million to 942 million, a negative trend that was not replicated in the fixed broadband user segment, from 187 million in 2019 to 210 million last year.Despite the reduction of mobile service users, the percentage of mobile service users using fifth generation network packages (5G, the great commitment of the Chinese government and China Mobile in the telecommunications sector) increased sharply in 2020 after its launch the previous year, adding 162 million to the total of 165 million at the end of December.By 2021, the company says that "a new wave of technological revolution and industrial transformation has emerged," integrating 5G, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, or big data.However, rapid market developments and the diversification of business models, coupled with an "increasingly complex and volatile" environment, mean that "the window of opportunity to develop the information services market is closing at an ever-increasing rate."China Mobile continues to bet on joining the group of "world-class information services technology companies" and will focus on building infrastructure and "facilitating the intelligent and digitized transformation of society as a whole."Thus, China's state-owned operator believes that this year will be a "milestone" in its plans to consolidate its market leadership and deepen the development of 5G.Load-Date: March 27, 2021End of Document

China Wants Your DNA | OpinionNewsweek.comFebruary 10, 2021 Wednesday 6:00 AM ESTCopyright © 2021 Newsweek Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 694 wordsByline: Rick BermanHighlight: The Biden administration and Congress need to make protecting Americans' privacy and our personal information an important priority at home.BodyWith all of the events of the last month, it was easy to miss one chilling bit of news: China used the COVID pandemic to try to collect the DNA of American citizens.BGI Group, China's largest genetics company, approached a number of states last year offering COVID testing and laboratories. But beware of the Chinese bearing gifts. The ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) funds BGI Group, which runs China National GeneBank, a giant DNA database. While most U.S. states rebuffed the "generosity," testing supplies were used in at least one state.Intelligence experts recently warned that Chinese companies also try to obtain personal data, including DNA, through partnerships or investments in U.S. companies. According to the MacroPolo database, Chinese interests have purchased almost 2,400 U.S. companies, including more than 20 in the field of health care and pharmaceuticals.China likely has the DNA of many Americans already.The COVID outbreak exposed U.S. overreliance on China for medicine. According to a federal report, 97 percent of U.S. antibiotics are controlled by China. Additionally, 30 percent of our personal protective equipment comes from China.One Chinese economist, Li Daokiu, acknowledged in 2019: "Should we reduce the exports, the medical systems of some western countries will not run well."That's an understatement. Many Americans would die.Now we see the Chinese government using the pandemic to attempt an invasion into our personal privacy. It raises an obviously frightening question: Why do they want our DNA?It's fair to assume it isn't for your benefit. The Chinese Communist Party has one objective: Power. It has developed a massive security state that spies on its own citizens and censors news. It's notorious for violating the human rights of its own people, including putting over a million ethnic minorities into concentration camps.The Chinese government already collected DNA samples from its own citizens to help improve facial recognition technology that tracks the movement of individuals. Analysts believe the Chinese government could also use DNA data to track down family members of those who have criticized the government.The CCP has global ambitions too, which includes dominating the medical technology field under its "Made in China 2025" program. Some experts believe this is the motivation behind the Chinese government's acquisition of our personal DNA information, to develop drugs and treatments to help treat risks we didn't even know we had. In turn, this would keep up the cycle of dependency on China for medical goods.Other possibilities for foul play:—Chinese military scientists could create biological weapons that affect people based on their genetics.—It could fuel scammers. Imagine getting calls from people who claim to know your genetic information and are selling you a supposed cure.—Disorders including alcoholism have a genetic component. Chinese intelligence could exploit a target's weaknesses—weaknesses that a target may not even know he has.Some see a silver lining. Wouldn't it be nice for medical companies in the future to know your DNA and give you tailored medicine? In theory, yes.But our personal data needs to be protected from abuse. We go to great lengths to shield credit card numbers and passwords. Why should any foreign power be allowed to access our detailed health profiles?Right now, your data is being collected and sold by companies, often without your full realization. Companies track what we buy. Your phone and apps track your location data constantly. Many people give data to apps about their physical activity and diet. Such data may have beneficial uses in self-help apps, but it can also be used against us.Much of our national security policy has focused on China's externalities like suppression of human rights, Hong Kong and Taiwan.The Biden administration and Congress need to make protecting Americans' privacy and our personal information an equally important priority at home.Rick Berman is the executive director of the American Security Institute, which runs ChinaOwnsUs.com.The views expressed in this article are the writer's own.Link to ImageGraphic Test tubeSean Gallup/Getty ImagesA medical worker prepares to test a throat swab sample.Load-Date: February 10, 2021End of Document

Elon Musk invited Vladimir Putin to speak at Clubhouse: what they answered from RussiaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 15, 2021 MondayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 646 wordsBodyBillionaire Elon Musk doesn't hide the fury he feels for Clubhouse, the fashionable social network. Following his auspicious debut in early February, the world's richest man invited Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday to have a trending conversation on the social audio network in Silicon Valley, a proposal they considered "interesting" from the Kremlin.Founder of electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla and space company SpaceX, Musk raised the idea in a tweet: "Would you like to meet me for a conversation at Clubhouse?"he wrote, tagging the Kremlin's official account in English. "It would be a great honor for me to speak to you, " added in Russian the billionaire.Consulted on Monday by the press, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called the proposal "very interesting.""But first you have to understand what this means, what it specifically proposes (...), before responding," he said, recalling at the same time that Putin "does not use social media."Clubhouse "shields" against ChinaResearchers at Stanford University's Internet Observatory (California, USA) demonstrated that the Chinese government could access Clubhouse user data, including un edited audio material, due to the application's data protection practices.As confirmed by stanford's Internet Observatory in a statement, the Clubhouse audio application uses Agora, a Chinese provider of real-time voice and video engagement software based in Shanghai and Silicon Valley, California, as a support infrastructure.Agora provides the basic infrastructure so that other applications, such as Clubhouse, can focus on interface design and other specific functionalities.Analysts demonstrated that outbound Clubhouse web traffic targets servers operated by Agora.When you join a channel, a package is generated for Agora's support infrastructure, and that contains metadata about each user, including their unique Clubhouse IDENTIFICATION number and the room ID to which they join.That metadata is sent in plain (uns encrypted) text over the Internet, implying that anyone with access to a user's network traffic can access them. Therefore, "a spy might know if two users are talking to each other, for example, detecting whether those users are joining the same channel," the researchers explain.In addition, Agora may have access to Clubhouse's un edited audio material. This implies that if the audio is not end-to-end encrypted (E2EE), something that analysts say is "extremely unlikely," Agora could intercept, transcribe, and store the audio.In its defense, Agora states that it does not store audio or user metadata, except to monitor network quality and bill its customers.Because Agora is based in the U.S. and China, it is subject to the cybersecurity law of the People's Republic of China,so "if the Chinese government determines that an audio message compromises national security, Agora would be legally obliged to help the government locate and store it," the Stanford Internet Observatory determines.The Chinese government may legally require audio or other user data stored in China if Clubhouse has a partner or subsidiary in China with access to the data. Therefore, if Clubhouse stores your audios in the U.S., and you don't have a Chinese partner to store the data in China, the Chinese government probably wouldn't be able to uselegal processes to obtain audio data from Clubhouse.However, "if the Chinese government could obtain audio directly from Clubhouse's support infrastructure in Agora, it may not resort to using international legal channels to search for data," the researchers explain.For the time being, Clubhouse reported, in a statement sent to the Observatory, that they are implementing changes to add additional encryption and blocking and prevent Clubhouse clients from transmitting IP addresses with user data to Chinese servers.With agency information.SlLook too       Load-Date: February 16, 2021End of Document

Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it Wednesday, January 13th.Your top stories right now, 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.Impeachment 2.0 is on. The House set to vote on impeaching President Trump again in just about an hour from now. This after Vice President Mike Pence said that he will not invoke the 25th Amendment to get Trump out. We are looking at all of the implications this morning as some Republicans plan to join Democrats.Silencing President Trump. Google owned YouTube becomes the latest social media company to suspend the president's account. What this means for free speech coming up.Markets this morning are declining. We are near the lows of the morning right here with the futures indicating a decline of 80 points on the Dow Industrials. The Nasdaq down 46, and the S&P futures right now lower by 14.25.Inflation is the theme we are watching today. We are getting an update on consumer inflation in about 30 minutes' time when the December consumer price report comes out. We will see if that movers markets this morning.Yesterday market were higher across the board, finishing in the green. Take a look, Dow Industrials up 60 points at 4:00 on Wall Street. The Nasdaq up 36 and the S&P 500 higher by 1.5.Well, the price of progress. We are taking a closer look at paid family leave this morning and how a new, blue government plan is going to be rolled out.And then fancy footwear. Luxury brand Jimmy Choo is swapping out the stilettos for sneakers and it is making a buzz this morning.MORNINGS WITH MARIA is live right now.European markets this morning are fractionally moving but mostly lower. Take a look. FT 100 down 6, the CAC quarante down 2, and the DAX index in Germany lower by about 40 points.In Asia overnight it was much more of a mixed story where Japan was open after a holiday and it was up better than 1 percent. The others moving fractionally.Now some of the top stories that we are watching this morning.YouTube becomes the latest social media company to silence the president. Overnight, the Google owned platform gave President Trump official account a strike saying that he cannot post for at least seven days. YouTube citing potential violence quote/unquote as the reason after last week's Capitol Hill riots. All video comments will also be permanently removed in this attack on free speech.Amazon Web Services responding to Parler's antitrust lawsuit, meanwhile, saying that the claims are meritless and do not meet the threshold of the Sherman Antitrust Act. The company claims Parler failed to live up to its contract by demonstrating an unwillingness and inability to remove public safety threats from its pages. It even cited Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act saying Amazon has the right to remove content they see fit. No word on all the violent posts we see on Twitter. They are still on Twitter.In just about an hour, the House will vote to impeach the president for a second time. It comes after Vice President Mike Pence rejected a push by Democrats to invoke the 25th Amendment. Wyoming Congresswoman Liz Cheney is the third ranking House Republican, she is leading a list of GOP members who say they will vote to impeach. In response, House Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Biggs is calling on her to step down from her post as conference chairwoman. Others have joined that fight as well, like Marjory Greene also wants her to step down, as well as others.President Trump calling the move another Democrat witch hunt that's, quote, causing tremendous danger to our country.Meanwhile, the president is celebrating his promised border wall yesterday during a tour in Alamo, Texas. He touted the newly constructed 450 miles of wall and gave a seal of approval by signing it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: But unlike those who came before me, I kept my promises. The policies I put into place are uniformly and strongly supported by the men and women of ICE and Border Patrol.To terminate those policies is knowingly to put America in really serious danger.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: And there is still over 300 miles of border that's currently under construction in the -- or preconstruction right now, in the preconstruction phase, rather.The CDC is now changing its guidelines for international and domestic travelers, saying that those flying into the United States will need a negative COVID test before boarding any planes. Airlines can refuse to board a passenger if they refuse a take a test. The change will take effect on January 26th, two weeks from today.Impeachment showdown. The House gears up to vote on one article of impeachment in just about an hour. This comes after Vice President Mike Pence said that he would not invoke the 25th Amendment despite the House passing a resolution which urged him to do so. President Trump spoke out yesterday saying that the impeachment will only damage the country.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESET: The impeachment hoax is a continuation of the greatest and most vicious witch hunt in the history of our country and is causing tremendous anger and division and pain, far greater than most people will ever understand, which is very dangerous for the USA, especially at this very tender time.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is Texas Congressman, and medical doctor himself, Michael Burgess.Congressman, it's great to see you this morning. Thanks very much for joining us.REP. MICHAEL BURGESS (R-TX): Good morning.BARTIROMO: Can you walk us through what will take place today in the House in terms of this impeachment vote? We know that this is not going to remove President Trump from office because it's not going to go to a trial in the Senate. There's not enough time. So what does today look like?BURGESS: Today looks like, the House comes in at 9:00 a.m., and we'll immediately take up the rule that passed out of the rules committee late last night. And that rule is to take up the one article of impeachment. The rule debate takes about an hour, and then under the rule there's two hours of debate for the article of impeachment. So setting your watch and allowing for normal time lag, sometime just after noon this -- this second impeachment 2.0 vote will occur.BARTIROMO: Congressman, how will you vote?BURGESS: Well, I'm -- I'm voting against it. Look, I -- a year ago we probably had this same discussion and impeachment, which should be a constitutional exercise that is rarely used a year ago was described as a purely political maneuver. And it was a -- it was a rush job. And with 90 days from October something to early December when the -- when the articles of impeachment came to the floor of the House.Now we have really just literally less than a week that Nancy Pelosi has decided she wants to once again impeach the president. And this is being done to damage the president going forward. Democrats are fearful that he could run for a nonconsecutive term. They don't want that to happen. They don't want to ever have to face him again at the ballot box and this is their way of -- have you ever heard the term "insurance policy" before? My opinion, that's what this represents.BARTIROMO: Yes. Yes, we know all about the insurance policy that they wanted to take Trump down during the dossier days.Let -- Congressman, why are they so fraud of him? Look, I know they don't like his personality. I know they don't like him inciting -- and that come -- that talk he gave on Wednesday, which partly led to what happened at the Capitol.But you've got Liz Cheney really leading the move in terms of Republicans. We know she's always been a Trump hater. But now Andy Biggs, Matt Rosendale, as well as Marjory Greene, freshman congresswoman, are all calling for her -- for Liz Cheney to step down as the House GOP conference chairwoman.Is she speaking as the House conference chair or is she speaking for Liz Cheney?BURGESS: Well, you'll have to ask her.Look, a couple of things. Number one, I have normal respect for Congresswoman Cheney. We actually did serve together on the rules committee a couple of terms ago and I always found her to be very thoughtful and very keen with her insights. And, clearly, she has a great knowledge, a vast knowledge of the history of the House of Representatives because of her dad and his time in government.I will also say that what happened on the grounds of the Capitol absolutely never, never must happen again. And I also -- I'll hold Nancy Pelosi partly responsible for a week ago because she is the one that is constitutionally charged with protection of the House of Representatives. We're hearing stories about how offers of additional help were declined. We need to have those investigations. We haven't heard -- we, the House, rank-and-file House members have not heard from the FBI on what has been learned. It's been a week. It's time.But I also believe that at some point we're going to learn that offers of additional help were declined by the speaker and that was wrong. And they knew or should have known. It gets back to the old, what did you know and when did you know it question. But we need to find that out. It's our obligation to find that out.BARTIROMO: OK, hold on, hold on. You're telling me right now, and our audience, that Nancy Pelosi is in charge of overseeing the security of the House of Representatives and there were efforts to ask for more security help and Nancy Pelosi declined? Is that what you just said?BURGESS: I don't know whether Nancy Pelosi herself declined. It was reported widely in "The New York Times" yesterday that additional offers of help were declined. Nancy Pelosi is the highest constitutional officer in the United States House of Representatives and it is her job to ensure the safety and security of the -- of the Capitol. No one -- no one does anything unless she makes the decision. Not the sergeant at arms, the head of the Capitol Police, they all answer to her.BARTIROMO: Now, have we heard anything from any of your colleagues on the left this summer when we saw virtually all of our big cities under attack. We remember the CHOP Zone in Seattle. We remember the Molotov cocktails being thrown in the faces of police. Bricks being thrown in winds of small businesses, forcing small businesses to board up in New York, in Chicago, in Los Angeles, across the country, were they angry when they saw all those statutes coming down, 100-year-old statutes coming down, breaking to the ground over the summer of 2020?Did you see the same kind of upset that you're seeing today?BURGESS: Well, from -- from -- from Democrats on the left? Absolutely not.BARTIROMO: Yes.BURGESS: And, of course, you recall, Rand Paul's experience as he left the White House lawn at the conclusion of the Republican Convention. I was at that. The scene on the street afterwards was quite chaotic. I didn't go through anything like Senator Paul went through to get -- to get out of the event, but, clearly, there was a -- it was a very dangerous environment.And, no, I heard no House members then, Democratic House members, speak up on how wrong it was to assault a sitting United States senator as he left an event at the White House.BARTIROMO: And that's just one senator. Josh Hawley had massive mobs outside his house and his newborn last week. A number of others had mobs and activities as well. No comment from the Democrats on that.Now House Democrats are proposing a $500 fine for lawmakers who do not wear face masks on the House floor, going up to $2,500 for a second offense.What's the problem with wearing a mask on the House floor? A third lawmaker tested positive following last week's Capitol lockdown.Congressman, is there an issue in terms of lawmakers wearing a mask on the House floor because she's blaming the Republicans for testing positive?BURGESS: Yes, it -- here's the deal. Wear a mask on the House floor. It's - - it's not -- it's not for very long. My personal feeling is that the House should make available to every member at the entrance to the House floor an N95 mask to place on their face before they go on the House floor.BARTIROMO: Yes (ph).BURGESS: If we're serious about masks, let's be serious about masks. These flimsy paper masks that people are wearing, sometimes they'll wear them for a week or longer. I'm not sure about the level of protection they provide. But if we're going to do this, let's do it right.We spent a lot of money under the CARES Act for countermeasures. Let's spend that money correctly, which would be for N95 masks available to members as they enter the House floor.BARTIROMO: Yes.BURGESS: They're making us go through magnetometers now. There's plenty of time to issue a mask.BARTIROMO: Congressman -- Congressman, real quick before you go, this impeachment move today really lacks seriousness given the fact that Nancy Pelosi has named Eric Swalwell as one of the managers of the impeachment trial and the impeachment move. We know that he and his special friend from China have been under severe pressure because she was hoping to get as much information and he was China's man, obviously, helping him to get elected and then he was put on the Intel Committee.Your reaction to Eric Swalwell running the impeachment trial and what that says about the whole thing?BURGESS: Well, its' fundamentally wrong. I tried to find out last night in the rules committee who the managers were and I was told I couldn't know. And then I found out just on -- on news shows that this individual has -- has been named.Look, there is no one who is more excited about Donald Trump leaving the presidency than the Chinese government. They are reveling in what is going on right now. They see their ascendency now as virtually assured because their number one obstacle, which was President Trump, is being taken out of the way.BARTIROMO: Yes.Well, look, I said it earlier and I'll say it again, China won. China won.And, Congressman, have we heard one peep out of China -- out of Joe Biden on China's role in the coronavirus yet? Has Joe Biden said anything about China's role in the coronavirus? Have you heard him say anything?BURGESS: No, but aren't we grateful that President Trump did get the vaccine delivered in record time.BARTIROMO: Congressman, thank you, sir.BURGESS: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Michael Burgess joining us there.We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Markets are watching Washington. We are looking at a decline at the start of trading this morning. Dow futures down 72, Nasdaq futures down 47 and the S&P lower by 12.75.Visa and Plaid calling off their merger as political turmoil roils Capitol Hill. Investors are watching for stimulus down the line while the House will hold an impeachment vote against President Trump in just under an hour.Joining me right now with the impact on your money is Bank of New York Mellon investment management chief strategists and managing director Alicia Levine.Alicia is it great to see you this morning. Thank you so much for being here.You laid out the biggest risks for investors this year. Tell me what you're watching, because we've been talking a little about inflation today. I want to get your take on what 2021 looks like, Alicia.ALICIA LEVINE, INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT CHIEF STRATEGIST, BNY MELLON: Yes. And great to see you again, Maria. Thank for having me.Look, our three big risks this year are the vaccine rollout, inflation, and, of course, higher taxes in 2022, but let's go to inflation, because that's a market oriented issue.I think inflation, we're going to see higher reads coming into the spring as we have base effect from last year when the pandemic and the lockdowns started. Now we're also in a really interesting period of a new regime at the Fed. And part of the reason that the market hasn't sold off yet is the understanding that the Fed is going to wait with average inflation targeting and may need to see inflation at 2.75 before it even thinks about raising rates.And so that pocket of a shift in regime at the Fed will keep markets buoyant for a while, but at some point we will have inflation coming through, both from the demand side, as we have increased savings getting to work with greater use of services, and the supply side, because we still have supply chain shots. So those two things are going to create inflation down the road, not just the reads in the spring, but throughout the summer.BARTIROMO: You know, Alicia, we were just looking at some commodities. I mean have you looked at copper? Have you looked at the XLE? Look at soybeans, you know, corn, all of these, you know, big ticket items that people need. Food prices are moving up. If the Federal Reserve sees inflation rearing its ugly head, do they taketh their foot off the pedal in terms of easing, in terms of stimulus, and does that send markets lower in 2021? Let's talk about the impact here.LEVINE: Yes, the impact is really, I think, going to be felt on the long end, on the 10-year yield first before the Fed moves, which is why we're seeing the steepening of the yield curve the with that the cyclical trade and the inflation trade get going.We do think they're going to be cautious on raising rates because of the shift in focus in trying to get the U.S. back to full employment. But it's going to be very hard to ignore on the long end because that's market driven. And the Fed can't control the long end. And the question here is whether they embark on some kind of yield control where they start buying longer dated paper.I think the real risk for those watching is that the talk about tapering comes sooner than 2022. And if you have increase inflation reads throughout the year, you're going to start hearing talking of tapering at the end of 2021. And I think that could have a real impact in the market because --BARTIROMO: Uh-huh.LEVINE: Because raising rates is within 12 months after that.BARTIROMO: Of course. Why would I want to take the risk of investing in stocks if I'm going to get 2 percent, 3 percent in Treasuries. It's a lot less risky.Alicia, we've got to have you back to talk about how to protect ourselves and where to allocate capital. We hope you'll come back soon. Thank you so much.LEVINE: Thanks, Maria.BARTIROMO: Have a great day.Alicia Levine.We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Joe Biden's incoming administration looking to implement more flexibility sick leave under his presidency.Edward Lawrence has more now on the cost to the American taxpayer.Edward.EDWARD LAWRENCE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Maria, as part of the President- elect Joe Biden's Build Back Better plan, he wants to guarantee universal paid sick days and expand paid family leave. Vice President-elect Kamala Harris guaranteed that on the campaign trail.Now, for paid family leave, it would be 12 weeks guaranteed and federally funded. Under the plan, Biden would trigger if a -- it would trigger if a worker or a family member has a serious illness. It's modeled -- if it's modeled after the Family Act, as Democrats like, it would cover two-thirds of a salary and be paid for through a payroll tax increase on companies.Now, firms could choose to path that cost on to employees through smaller raises, limiting hiring, or just stop offering additional family leave. And that's the rub, though, according to senior fellow at George Mason University, Veronique De Rugy.Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)VERONIQUE DE RUGY, MERCATUS CENTER AT GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY: It will cost workers more. They will see less money out of their paychecks because the program is financed through the payroll tax. But the reality is, when they are going to come short of what they're planning on distributing through this program is going to be coming from -- from general funds, so that is all taxpayers, not just workers and employees, of course.(END VIDEO CLIP)LAWRENCE: And she says most companies offer some sort of family leave but there will be incentive to stop taking on that extra cost and just have workers apply to the federal government to pay, passing on all the costs to taxpayers. She thinks there would be a cycle there, more people taking federal help, more government needing more money to pay for it. And it comes through, Maria, taxes.Back to you.BARTIROMO: It sure does.Edward Lawrence, thank you so much.A quick break and then we've got the December consumer price index right on the other side of this break.Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Breaking news right now, the December consumer price index hitting the tape.Let's get right to Cheryl Casone. She's got the numbers.CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: We're seeing some numbers pretty in line here. Probably six months now of stable inflation data, Maria.For month-over-month, December CPI, the estimate, .4 percent higher. We came in at 0.4 percent. Year-over-year, the estimate, 1.3. A little bit hotter than expected, 1.4 on that number. For the core, that excludes, of course, volatile food and energy prices. The month-over-month coming in, in line, 0.1 percent expectations, as well as the year-over-year 1.6 percent coming year-over-year. Markets were really watching this as Alicia Levine mentioned to you just a couple of moments ago, Maria, because, obviously, bond yields have been rising since the beginning of the year and inflation could be a key market driver coming in for the markets in 2020.And, again, talking about Target. You mentioned that earlier in the show, Maria, with those retail earnings. This could be a good indicator at least for some strong retail earnings. And, obviously, those numbers are going to kick off on Friday with the banks.Maria, back to you.BARTIROMO: You know, it's interesting numbers, Cheryl, because it's pretty much right in line with expectations and yet we see specific commodities moving up, like soybeans, like oil.Dagen McDowell, not a major reaction, although we are off of the lows on stocks after the CPI number. Your reaction?DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: I think that inflation is definitely percolating. As you talked about, commodity prices, the CRB, raw material index, is just below the highest level it's been in six and a half years. All those agricultural commodities. And if you line up, according to Peter Bokvar (ph), the CRB index, with the 10-year note yield, looking at the last five years, they kind of move in the same pattern. So you better be careful of the inflation that is on the horizon and what -- how that will destroy investments in say even Treasuries because of all the stimulus that we've gotten from the government, in particular both the monetary stimulus, the printing of money, and the fiscal stimulus from Congress.BARTIROMO: Yes. And it's also the way the Federal Reserve used it. If this Fed does deem inflation a problem, the Federal Reserve will lessen the stimulus, take their foot off the pedal, and that may very well send stocks lower.MCDOWELL: Right.BARTIROMO: So this is an important issue to watch throughout 2021. We, of course, will be watching it for you as well.We want to look at social media censorship, however. One of the biggest stories of our time. An attack on free speech. YouTube has become the latest platform to crack down on President Trump's account. YouTube has locked him out from uploading anything for at least a week. The move follows Twitter, FaceBook, and Instagram, which appear to be coordinating, taking action against the president following last week's Capitol riots.Joining me right now is Starship Capital Managing Partner John Meyer.John, thanks very much for being here.Your reaction to big tech being under pressure here. This has been one of the best performing groups from an investment standpoint. Will this crackdown and attack on our free speech come back to haunt these companies?JOHN MEYER, MANAGING PARTNER, STARSHIP CAPITAL: Well, it really depends on how much the big tech companies are going to extend a lot of these restrictions onto other apps and other platforms.Now, to give you some context, you know, this is a precedent that's actually surprisingly to many people been around for a while. You know my business, you know, we -- we were developing apps for the iPhone back in 2009. And in 2010 developed an app that was effectively moderated by Apple and we were given warnings, similar to Parler was, that, you know, if we didn't effectively moderate content that it would be removed.So, you know, big tech has been flexing these muscles for well over a decade and I think it's now getting attention simply because it's affecting the highest levels of the country and the government and also the highest levels of other tech start-ups, such as with -- with Parler.BARTIROMO: So what do you want to do at this point if you own these stocks and you've been making money as they moved up? Is there any change to the regulatory environment that you foresee?MEYER: Well, that's what's interesting about this is, you know, the timing of all this is really interesting. You know, you mentioned that it appears to be a sense of coordination. And I think, you know, given that the Democrats are now taking control of the Senate, it's pretty obvious that they will be less of a push to regulate some of the, you know, let's say Section 230 aspects of big tech companies. And so I do think that's a little bit less likely now. However, what's more likely is the general breaking up of these big tech companies by, you know, Congress and I think especially Apple and Amazon.Now, what to do with app such as Parler is, they're going to have to go and literally build their own server farms. They can't rely on a company, third party company like Amazon to host their content. And I think they need to be -- either be fully independent or go to fully almost decentralized and block chain route, which would be building a fully decentralized servicer system that doesn't have anyone who can even flip the switch on or off.BARTIROMO: Dagen, jump in.MCDOWELL: That was the trade-off, whether you're in the publishing business, and you have a website that has content on it that's a news site, if you will, that's conservative. You sign up for say Google and its ad platform and you don't have to go out and hire ad salespeople. Oh, so easy, wasn't it and it was so cheap. It's the same with Amazon and its servers that they provide the kind of base for your social media platform, like Parler, but they can pull the plug on you at the drop of a hat if they see fit.It's arbitrary. You have no way of appealing. The same thing goes for an individual. So it's individuals and companies that are being censored, silenced and shut down by these giant companies.And you used the word, what, coordinated. Well, that's -- those -- that's antitrust. If you coordinate your actions, that's an antitrust violation.But, Maria, I -- the right and the left, conservatives and liberals, were largely responsible for this. Republicans sat back for years and said, oh, these services, you know, free markets, everything is so cheap. We're just going to let these companies grow. Well, they got so big and now they're monopolies and you -- and it's almost impossible to unwind them.But then, on the left, the Democrats, they -- their campaigns were funded by these tech companies. The people who work there are of like minds and group think. And so they let it happen too.BARTIROMO: Right.MCDOWELL: And now these companies, I believe, are just trying to curry favor by cracking down on conservatives. Curry favor with the Democrats now in power who, just three months ago, were talking about how do you rein in and break up these monopolies.BARTIROMO: Yes. Yes.MCDOWELL: So, what do you do? You start censoring political content and political messaging and conservatives in hopes that say Jerry Nadler and Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer don't try to break you up.BARTIROMO: Yes, because, John, obviously the Democrats probably just perfectly fine with social media censoring Republicans. Will we ever see any legislation here?MEYER: So that's the --BARTIROMO: How does this play out?MEYER: That leads me to my next big issue. So one -- one interesting aspect here, and I -- and I can give you this context, but even the inner circles of the tech and venture capital and start-up community, one, big consensus is that social media companies have done a terrible job, especially Twitter, at essentially enacting their powers on accounts in an equal fashion. That is very, very, very clear. It's -- it is clear that, you know, more right leaning accounts have been suspended or banned than left- leaning accounts. There's -- it's almost full stop.And the other thing that's clear is that Twitter still has on their platform, you know, third world country leaders that are prosecuting their citizens and, you know, they're not suspending or banning them.So, you know, that sense of equality needs to be improved upon by a huge measure or else I think the scrutiny is just going to continue.BARTIROMO: Yes.All right, John, great to get your insights. Thanks so much. John Meyer joining us there on tech censorship.MEYER: Thank you.BARTIROMO: A quick break and then countering China's rise to power. How the United States is utilizing its ties with India and Taiwan to take on President Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party.Then Jimmy Choo's new kicks. The luxury brand releasing a sneaker. The price tag making a buzz this morning.And be sure to tune in Friday for my interview with businessman, entrepreneur, and former New York Yankees Alex Rodriguez. A-Rod will be here with future plans with the economy looking to bounce back this year. Wait until you hear his latest entrepreneurial move.You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Now the China threat. The Trump administration moving to declassify its plan to contain China's influence. The outline includes working with India to take on China, denying Chinese military influence in Taiwan and negotiating total denuclearization of North Korea. The United States will also act under the assumption that China aims to dissolve American alliances in the Indio Pacific region.Joining me right now is the founder of the Atlas Organization, and the author of "China's Vision of Victory," Jonathan Ward.Jonathan, it's great to have you. Thanks very much for joining us.Let's assess where we were. I have here this statement from Robert O'Brien, the national security adviser, discussing the threat of China. We've talked a lot about this subject.Where do you think we are in terms of what many are calling a cold war between the U.S. and China?JONATHAN WARD, FOUNDER, ATLAS ORGANIZATION: Hi, Maria. It's great to be here.I think it's -- it was important for the administration to release this document. It provides, I think, a very clear set of objectives. It's a good road map. I think it shows that the incoming administration really can stay the course. I mean this is a very practical and reasonable set of goals here that I think should be passed from one administration to the next because we're going to have to find this continuity on this issue. I mean this is still the most important geopolitical challenge of our lifetimes. You know, China is poised to surpass the United States economically. They're building a military that's designed for combat with the U.S. and with their neighbors.And this particular strategy emphasizes the outlies (ph), especially India and Japan. It clearly recognizes the importance of those two countries in the Pacific. And it also outlines essentially, you know, a broader constellation of democracies, which I think is something that every American can agree on when it comes to Pacific deterrence and dealing with China. And I think it certainly gets the China issue right. I mean it understands Beijing's objectives, Beijing's desire to dominate this region. And where it falls, you know, where I think one finds the limits, is that, of course, it does not go so far as to demonstrate China as a global issue. I mean China has economic relationships from Europe to Latin America to Africa, all of which, you know, empower it in Asia and create the ability for it to ultimately find military dominance. So we're going to have to be countering China globally and form a global strategy towards China. But, as an Indo-Pacific document, I think it's great and I think it's very important that it, you know, showcases the role of India in U.S. strategy.BARTIROMO: Jonathan, the State Department announcing its canceling U.N. Ambassador Kelly Kraft's trip to Taiwan this week, China slammed the proposed trip. China, the communist party, said that the U.S. was, quote, playing with fire by any normalization of relations with Taiwan.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says all travel has been canceled as part of the Biden transition and not just the Taiwan trip. So what should be believe about what's going on between the U.S. and Taiwan as China tries to stop it saying that Taiwan is a Chinese territory?WARD: Well, I don't think China can stop the deepening of U.S.-Taiwan relations. I think it's been very much in the making in the last four years certainly. And I think it's also very important for all Americans to understand and appreciate the importance of Taiwan. I mean Taiwan -- the government in Taiwan was our ally in the Second World War. When the communists took over China, they fled to Taiwan. And we basically disengaged in many ways in order to bring about the Kissinger-Nixon opening. And that's so out of date at this point. I mean really particularly if we're going to have a framework of democracies in the Indio-Pacific, I mean Taiwan fits very naturally into that.And, you know, Taiwan is one of the most important pieces of military geography. It's also the home for a whole lot of the world's most advanced semiconductor manufacturing. So if Beijing were to ever seize that island, it would change the balance of power, you know, permanently.So it's going to be -- I think it's an incredible important thing and beginning to start to bring them more into the broader Indo-Pacific picture. I mean Taiwan has substantial relations with, you know, India and Japan, for example, and pulling that framework together is going to be essential.So as to the cancellation, I think on some -- in some ways that's overshadowed by the fact that the State Department has removed, self- imposed restrictions last week, which I think was much bigger news.BARTIROMO: Yes.WARD: All of this irritates Beijing, but, you know, I don't think there's much to be gained from pleasing Beijing at this point. I think we all have to know that.BARTIROMO: Well, I'm glad that the U.S. is telling us about the strategy with India because corporate America needs a strategy for growth. You know that a number of banks right now are gearing up to own and operate their own businesses in China. JP Morgan was given a license. Goldman Sachs was given a license.So they're about to gear up to have their own business in China. But I think if anybody is questioning who's in charge, just look at what just happened to the Chinese jewel that is Alibaba and the Ant Group. I keep asking the question, where is Jack Ma? Jack Ma is the billionaire founder of Alibaba Group. And I used to see him at all sorts of conferences whooping it up with Wall Street executives because they took him public and Alibaba. They were going to get -- make some money in the Ant Group huge IPO until China pulled it because Jack Ma made criticizing comments about the Chinese Communist Party's regulations in the financial services industry.Ever since he made those comments, Jonathan, they pulled the Ant Group deal and he hasn't been seen for two months.WARD: Right.BARTIROMO: So where's Jack Ma? And is this a lesson for those companies that are about to gear up and open their businesses in China? Make sure you understand who's in charge. It's not you. It's Xi Jinping. And that's what they did to Jack Ma.They're also heightening the crackdown on the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong. Reports show today that the Chinese government could put reforms on elections there to silence the pro-democracy advocates. This coming a week after over 50 were arrested in Hong Kong.We're looking at the pictures, Jonathan. This is just another broken promise, China, with the handover of Hong Kong promised autonomy for 50 years. They came in and started putting rules down, sending people to go to jail in China, 27 years earlier.So tell me about the corporate sector and where we are and do you know where Jack Ma is? Have you seen him anywhere?WARD: I haven't seen him. And then there's another rule that's just come out of Beijing that's going to prohibit Chinese companies from complying with U.S. sanctions or with foreign law if they don't think it's conducive. So you see why these systems have to split. At the end of the day we're not going to have a healthy commercial relationship with China. That's -- that's the story of the past. And yet the banks and the corporates have not got the memo here. I mean they really are going to have to change course, they're going to have to look for other opportunities.The U.S.-China relationship is so fundamentally damaging by the communist party's ambitions. And you look at something like Alibaba. I mean you leave aside that Alibaba is also, you know as the communist party sort of seizes power over its corporations, it's going to be bring all these big tech companies -- it's already started this -- into its military ambitions and into its surveillance goals.I mean here was just a Huawei patent that came to light that was talking about surveillance, you know, facial recognition on the Uighur. So they're all participating in this stuff.BARTIROMO: Yes.WARD: I think the banks are going to regret what they're doing in China, but they don't get it yet. They just don't get it. They're going to have to be restrained.BARTIROMO: Well, and this is why the Trump administration is saying, don't invest in Chinese companies. You are expanding the growth of the Chinese military.Jonathan Ward, it's great to have you as China's goal is to be the number one superpower overtaking the United States.And we'll be right back. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Time for the "Morning Buzz."From stilettos to sneakers. Luxury brand Jimmy Choo's glamorous sneakers are resurging in popularity now that there's no red carpets for celebrities to sport high heels. These crystal Incrusted diamonds black sneakers look cool, maybe, but will set you back nearly $5,000 a pair.Oh, my God. If this is not a story for Dagen McDowell, I don't know what is.Who the heck is going to wear diamonds on their sneakers, Dagen? I -- I'm going to be running in the sand, running in the dirt.MCDOWELL: Yes, they're ugly and dumb.You know, the pandemic shutdown and the fact that like -- people are suffering and not just from the virus but, you know, there's still more than 19 million Americans who are on unemployment. I have actually begun to loathe luxury goods like this. There -- you know, the Louis Vuitton (ph) Shark (ph) sneakers are -- they're almost $900, but that's less than one- fifth of the price of these stupid kicks.So just -- you know, one -- buy one nice bag and keep it with you for the next 20 years. The was the way my mother raised me.BARTIROMO: I'm not -- I'm not exactly going to wear these sneakers on my hike, that's for sure. I mean it's I guess to wear outside when you're going out because you're not doing anything anymore.MCDOWELL: I -- some of the -- people are clearly -- I've eaten out like once and -- since the pandemic shutdown.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: And I went out and clearly every woman there was wearing all at once every single thing that she bought during the first months of the pandemic shutdown, hats, earrings, bracelets, necklaces. Like -- like over the knee boots when it was like 80 degrees outside. It's --BARTIROMO: Yes, I understand. I understand. You can't wear any of your stuff anymore.MCDOWELL: No.BARTIROMO: All right, a quick break and then more MORNINGS WITH MARIA right after this. Stay with us.Load-Date: January 13, 2021End of Document

U.S. sanctioned two senior Chinese officials for "serious human rights abuses against ethnic minorities"CE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 22, 2021 MondayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 488 wordsBodyThe United States on Monday announced sanctions against two Chinese regime officials for the crackdown on the Uighur minority in Xinjiang, where they are forcibly subjected to concentration camps.Joe Bien's government based its decision on the "serious human rights abuses of ethnic minorities" in that Chinese region and sanctioned Wang Junzheng, secretary of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps party committee, and Chen Mingguo, director of the Xinjiang Public Security Office."The Chinese authorities will continue to face the consequences as long as there are atrocities in Xinjiang," said Andrea Gacki, director of the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control.The order was taken in conjunction with the European Union, which hours ago disclosed that four Chinese officials were sanctioned by Brussels.The US measure freezes all assets of sanctioned on American soil and also prohibits Americans from doing business with them.China denies the existence of Uighur detention camps in the Xinjiang region, as it considers them re-education and job training camps for people immersed in jihadist ideology. Beijing also denies that human rights violations are occurring there.Xinjiang used to be a focus of subversion against the Chinese government, but Beijing now says its security measures have calmed the region.A few days ago, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken held his first bilateral meeting with China and greeted foreign ministers in Alaska with an offensive speech, accusing Xi Jinping's regime, in front of chambers around the world, of "threatening global stability."Angry reactionAs soon as EU sanctions were known, China published a list of 10 European citizens, including parliamentarians, and four sanctioned entities. In one statement, China's chancellery noted that European sanctions consted "gross interference" in its internal affairs. "This gesture, based on nothing but lies and misinformation, dismisses and disstortions facts" in addition to affecting the relationship between the EU and China, the chancellery noted.The EU sanctioned former Sinkiang Political and Legal Affairs Committee Secretary Zhu Hailun, as well as three other officials from the same autonomous region.In return, the list of sanctions by China includes five MEPs - Frenchman Raphael Glucksmann, Germans Reinhard Butikofer and Michael Gahler, Bulgarian Ilhan Kyuchyuk and Slovakia's Miriam Lexmann - as well as German academic Adrian Zenz, among others. "I'm not surprised (...) given my role in revealing the extent of human rights violations in Sinkiang," Zenz told AFP.The Dutch government summoned the Chinese ambassador to the Netherlands for Chinese sanctions against his deputy Sjoerd Sjoerdsma.(With AFP information)READ ON:The Chinese regime conducted a cyberattack on the IDB in 2019Secret trial of two Canadians accused of espionage in China: regime prevented foreign diplomats from enteringLoad-Date: March 23, 2021End of Document

The "unusually aggressive" cyberattack that Microsoft accuses China of (and why it's not just a new cybersecurity crisis)CE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 9, 2021 TuesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1036 wordsBody              Tens of thousands of Microsoft Exchange users might be affected.            Getty Tens of Thousands of Microsoft Exchange users might be affected.       A powerful hack to Microsoft's email service is at risk to tens of thousands of organizations.And the scale of the filtration is just beginning to be sized,according to the specialists.Microsoft claims to have a "high level of confidence" that behind it is a group of China-sponsored attackers,something Beijing denies.Last week, when the attack was announced, it was thought to have been limited, but then there has been an increase in the use of these tactics,perhaps because other hackers are taking advantage of the system's weaknesses that were made public, according to Gordon Corera, the BBC's security correspondent.Joe Tidy, a BBC technology journalist, says that while many may think that this is simply another cybersecurity crisis, it is actually an "extremely serious" hack.Computer security specialist Brian Krebs called the attack "unusually aggressive."• How the first tweet in history generated a million-dollar auctionAt first there was talk that some 30,000 organizations in the United States could have been affected.Now, however, it is estimated that it could be about 60,000 victims,according to a bloomberg agency report citing an anonymous source of the U.S. government.               Specialists consider it an "extremely serious" attack.            Getty Specialists consider it an "extremely serious" attack.       Victims have already been reported outside the U.S..On Monday, the Europe BankingAuthority confirmed that its mail servers had been compromised because of this hack.Among the targets of what Microsoft considers an attack may be local governments, small businesses, and also large banks.Microsoft Exchange is an email service widely used in large companies and governments,but so far few organizations have admitted to having been victims of the attack. • How lack of access to components is suffocating HuaweiOver the weekend, U.S. authorities warned that this situation still poses an "active threat."What is known about the attack?Since March 2, Microsoft reported that its systems were under attack.Filtering takes advantage of a Microsoft Exchange vulnerability, or password theft, to impersonating someone who has authorized access to the system.If you manage to log in that way, the attacker can take control of the email account remotely and steal data.               The leak could allow access to the victim's private data.            Getty Filtering could allow entry into the victim's private data.       Accusations against ChinaMicrosoft has singled out a group known as Hafnium to be responsible for the attackwith the backing of the Chinese government.China has denied the allegations.Microsoft spokesmen have said Hafnium "primarily attacks entities in the U.S.",stealing information from organizations such as "infectious disease researchers, law firms, educational institutions, defense contractors, public policy think centers, and NGOs."The cybersecurity company Huntress, however, says that 300 of its non-compliant partners have been affected.Among them he mentions local governments, health centers, banks and power companies, but also others "less sexy" such as an ice cream parlor, small hotels and old people.Outside the U.S. the European Banking Authority reported that she had been infiltrated and that the attackers may have had access to personal data.What is Microsoft doing?News of the hack led the U.S. Agency for Infrastructure Security and Cybersecurity (Cisa) to issue an emergency directive calling on agencies and departments to take urgent action.               Jake Sullivan, a White House national security adviser, urged them to download the security patches as soon as possible.            Getty Jake Sullivan, a National Security Adviser at the White House, urged those to download the security patches as soon as possible.       Jake Sullivan, a White House national security adviser, also urged the owners of these systems to download the security patches as soon as possible.Microsoft has not confirmed the number of victims talked about, but says it is working closely with the U.S. government.Its users were informed that "best protection" is to "make updates as soon as possible on all impacted systems".He also said he was implementing some mitigation techniques designed to help those who can't update quickly, but warned that they were not "a solution if their Exchange servers have already been compromised, nor are they total protection against attacks."Microsoft contends that the attack is not in any way related to the SolarWindsattack, which hit U.S. government agencies late last year.               Cybercriminal organizations might be taking advantage of Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities.            Getty Cybercriminal Organizations might be exploiting Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities.                            BBC       Analysis by BBC technology journalist Joe TidyAn unsuspecting reader will be forgiven for considering this to be just another cybersecurity crisis.After all, the U.S. government is still dealing with the widespread SolarWinds attacks that occurred in December.But hacking to Microsoft Exchange is itself extremely serious for several reasons.The SolarWinds attack was simple. It was about Russia stealing U.S. national security intelligence.In the case of Microsoft Exchange, a Chinese hacker team called Hafnium is blamed, but their motives are less clear.Some small agenciesgovernment may be affected, but the victims here are a much more diverse group of organizations, from large banks to small businesses.In addition, it seems that the number of hackers taking advantage of the new techniques developed by Hafnium is multiplying.The attacks that have been reported are so numerous that there are already indications that other groups, including cybercriminal gangs,could also be getting involved.It's a mess.            Bbc         Now you can receive notifications from BBC World.

Sen. Lankford, Colleagues Advocate to Protect Hongkongers From Chinese OppressionTargeted News ServiceFebruary 10, 2021 Wednesday 8:20 AM  ESTCopyright 2021 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1351 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodySen. James Lankford, R-Oklahoma, issued the following news release on Feb. 9, 2021:Senator James Lankford (R-OK) today joined Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL), Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Todd Young (R-IN), Ben Cardin (D-MD), John Cornyn (R-TX), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), and Chris Coons (D-DE) to reintroduce the bipartisan Hong Kong Safe Harbor Act, which would ensure those Hongkongers who peacefully protested Beijing's corrupt justice system and have a well-founded fear of persecution are eligible for Priority 2 Refugee status. The bill is in response to the People's Republic of China (PRC) anti-democratic national security law, the Law of the People's Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region."China wants to suppress pro-democracy voices in Hong Kong, limiting Hongkongers' access to the internet, and silencing freedom-loving people. The US should not turn a blind eye to Beijing's suppression efforts," Lankford said. "The Hong Kong Safe Harbor Act allows eligible Hongkongers to seek refuge in the US to protect them from Chinese retaliation. China's action to erode Hong Kong's autonomy and clamp down on free people should not be taken lightly.""The CCP is tightening its stranglehold on Hong Kong and with that comes the targeting of Hong Kong pro-democracy leaders and activists," Rubio said. "We have already seen activists, including Joshua Wong, Agnes Chow, and others get dragged away to prison for nothing more than exercising the rights guaranteed to them. The US must do all it can to assist those Hongkongers who have courageously stood up to defend the city they love from the CCP's persecution and open our doors to them. I am proud to re-introduce this bipartisan bill that will do just that. We must also continue to encourage like-minded nations to make similar accommodations in support of those Hongkongers in need of safe harbor.""As the people of Hong Kong continue to face Beijing's tightening grip on their autonomy, freedoms and basic human rights, the United States must hold its torch high and proud for the tired, the poor and the huddled masses yearning to breathe free," Menendez said. "We are introducing this bipartisan legislation to reiterate to the Chinese Communist Party that the United States stands foursquare with the people of Hong Kong and that we are committed to ensuring that they will not fall through the cracks of our broken immigration system if they seek refuge for standing up for their rights.""Hongkongers have lived in fear for far too long. I've been vocal about condemning the Chinese Communist Party's egregious and numerous human rights violations. Last year, I sent a letter to the US Secretary of State encouraging the United States to work with the United Kingdom and Australia to welcome Hongkongers seeking refuge from the Chinese Communist Party's authoritarian crackdown," Young said. "I'm proud to keep this push moving forward with the reintroduction of the bipartisan Hong Kong Safe Harbor Act.""China's continued oppression of the people of Hong Kong must come to an end," Cardin said. "The Hong Kong Safe Harbor Act makes clear that the United States will not stand idly by as Beijing continues its authoritarian tactics to target peaceful demonstrations and freedom of speech. Peaceful protest is the backbone of democracy and must be protected at all costs.""If we want to fulfill our founders' hope that this county would be a beacon of hope for the oppressed around the world, then we can't slam the door in the face of Hongkongers who are being persecuted for standing up in support of democracy," Merkley said. "We must immediately create a pathway to safety in America for the victims of these brutal Chinese crackdowns on basic human rights and freedoms, and hold the perpetrators of those attacks accountable.""I have been moved by the courage of the pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong in the face of increased repression and Chinese government meddling. It is appalling that thousands of protesters in Hong Kong have been persecuted for fighting for the liberties that Americans enjoy," Durbin said. "I believe that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle share my feelings about the crisis in Hong Kong. The question is--what are we willing to do about it? We should act quickly to pass legislation to protect Hongkongers in need, and show them and the world that Congress stands united on a bipartisan basis in the face of China's repression.""It would be a moral failure if the United States didn't support individuals abroad exercising their right to speak and assemble freely and peacefully, especially when it comes to Hongkongers dissenting against the Chinese government," Wyden said. "It's critical that Congress provide safe harbor to Hongkongers fleeing political persecution. The Chinese government needs to feel the consequences of undermining democracy and violating human rights, and Hongkongers deserve our protection.""Protecting the persecuted is at the core of America's leadership and our strength as a nation," Blumenthal said. "Offering refuge for those fighting for democracy in Hong Kong will not only protect the lives of activists, it will also help constrain the worst abuses of the Chinese Communist Party. Our country's willingness to help protestors escape persecution helps deter and discourage acts of authoritarian oppression. We should seize this moment to protect the people of Hong Kong, and show repressive regimes around the world that the United States stands by fellow citizens fighting for freedom.""The Hong Kong Safe Harbor Act provides refuge to those brave individuals who peacefully protested Beijing's efforts to undermine freedom of speech and the right to assemble in Hong Kong," Coons said. "China and the UK signed a treaty in 1984 that affords Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy. The rights of Hong Kong citizens should be respected and protected, and this bipartisan bill reaffirms our shared commitment to protect Hongkongers facing persecution for exercising their fundamental rights."The Hong Kong Safe Harbor Act would:* Grant certain Hongkongers Priority 2 Refugee Status: Hongkongers who participated peacefully in the protest movement and have a well-founded fear of persecution will be eligible for Priority 2 Refugee processing in Hong Kong or a third country. Refugees from Hong Kong will not be subjected to the numerical limitation.* Waive Immigration Intent as a Factor for Non-Immigrant Visas: For those Hongkongers who have been arrested for protest-related offenses or served in a humanitarian or organizing role in the protests, the intent to immigrate will not be considered as a factor for non-immigrant visas to ease the way for an asylum claim.* Treat Revocation of Hong Kong Residency in Retaliation for Applying for Refugee Status or a USVisa as Political Persecution: If Beijing revokes the residency of Hongkongers for applying for refugee status or a US visa, then those individuals will remain eligible for refugee status as victims of political persecution.* Sunset Clause: The bill will cease to have an effect five years after its enactment.Lankford is a commissioner on the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC). In July, Lankford cautioned his colleagues and the Trump Administration to remain vigilant of communist China's ongoing push to spread its regime and ideals in the region and beyond. Additionally, last Congress Lankford and Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA) released the Safeguarding Internet Freedom in Hong Kong Act, which pushes back on China's aggressive actions to undermine Hong Kong's autonomy and freedom by bolstering firewall circumvention infrastructure in Hong Kong. In 2019, Lankford sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to push for additional firewall circumvention tools to diversify the technology portfolio and increase the effectiveness of the federal government's efforts.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7380475 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: February 10, 2021End of Document

China Automated Material Handling Market Report 2021-2026 - ResearchAndMarkets.comBusiness WireMarch 30, 2021 Tuesday 4:16 PM GMTCopyright 2021 Business Wire, Inc.Length: 828 wordsDateline: DUBLIN BodyThe "China Automated Material Handling Market - Growth, Trends, COVID-19 Impact, and Forecasts (2021 - 2026)" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.The China Automated Material Handling market was valued at USD 10330.7 million in 2020 and is anticipated to register a CAGR of over 10.9% during the forecast period (2021-2026).China has been the largest market for the robotics industry since 2012, and the country shows no signs of a slowdown. In fact, the country is in the exact path of becoming a leader in technology and automation by 2020, as targeted by the country's 'Made in China 2025' policies.By the adoption of automation in manufacturing, China is expected to cut manufacturing costs by 30%, by 2025. According to National Bureau of Statistics China the country had around 29.85 of the population aged above 60 years in 2018. It is further anticipated that by 2050, 330 million Chinese will be over age 65. This is would result in dearth of skilled labor which would require job activities to be eased, in order to maintain productivity at work, which will boost the growth of the market studied.In the next four years, the current investments being made in the foreign technology companies are expected to be diverted toward R&D activities in the country itself. The Chinese government is taking necessary steps to strictly control the flow of capital abroad, and approving plans for establishing a National Robotics Innovation Center. This proves the diversion of investments.The forecast from the International Federation of Robotics indicate that 950,300 industrial robots are expected to become operational in the country by 2020. Thus, the automated material handling market in the country is expected to experience positive growth over the forecast period.Key Market TrendsAGV to Register Highest CAGR• AGVs in China are being used across automotive, food and beverage, pharmaceutical, retail, electronics, and manufacturing industries.• The automotive and general manufacturing industry in China is expected to gain traction in the future, owing to industrial developments.• There are several government initiatives to support the change, for example, Made in China 2025 (China) was introduced to promote the future of productivity and growth in manufacturing industries. Due to these strategies, the Chinese Central Government expects China's automobile output to reach 30 million units by 2020, and 35 million by 2025.• In addition, the IoT has ramped up logistics into high gear in China, which has encouraged sales of various retail and e-commerce companies. Billions of connected objects have the potential to support direct customer interaction and automate sales and ordering processes.• Hence, logistics companies are investing in automated warehouses, with higher demand for AGVs. For instance, in July 2017, Cainiao, a logistics subsidiary of Alibaba Group, opened the smartest warehouse with China's largest population of robots. Here, AGVs came equipped with Wi-Fi and self-charging batteries. These factors have propelled the adoption of AGV in the country.Competitive LandscapeThe China automated material handling market is fragmented and highly competitive in nature. Product launches, high expense on research and development, partnerships and acquisitions, etc. are the prime growth strategies adopted by the companies in the country to sustain the intense competition.Key Topics Covered:1 INTRODUCTION1.1 Study Deliverables1.2 Study Assumptions1.3 Scope of the Study2 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY3 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY4 MARKET DYNAMICS4.1 Market Overview4.2 Introduction to Market Drivers and Restraints4.3 Market Drivers4.3.1 Resilient Backing from the Government Policies4.3.2 Rapid Growth of E-commerce4.4 Market Restraints4.4.1 The Staffing Challenge4.5 Industry Value Chain Analysis4.6 Industry Attractiveness - Porter's Five Force Analysis4.7 Industry Policies5 MARKET SEGMENTATION5.1 By Product Type5.1.1 Hardware5.1.2 Software5.1.3 Services5.2 By Equipment Type5.2.1 Automated Storage and Retrieval System (ASRS)5.2.2 Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV)5.2.3 Conveyor5.2.4 Sortation System5.2.5 Palletizer5.3 By End-user Vertical5.3.1 General Manufacturing5.3.2 Automotive5.3.3 Retail5.3.4 Food and Beverage5.3.5 Pharmaceutical5.3.6 Post and Parcel5.3.7 Airport5.3.8 Other End-user Verticals6 COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE6.1 Company Profiles6.1.1 Guangzhou Sinorobot Technology Co.

Op-ed: Transformative technology: China's leap into the future - The Tufts DailyTufts Daily: Tufts UniversityMarch 10, 2021 WednesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2021 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 899 wordsBodyThrough the course of the past year, we have been part of the 2020-21 Education for Public Inquiry and International Citizenship curriculum, and our chosen area of interest has been the intersection of technological growth, surveillance and privacy in China. The salience of such issues within the United States magnifies the relevance of this interest. The U.S. does not have any centralized federal legislation about data privacy and lacks strong regulations of it at the state level. This may come as no surprise when one considers how ill-informed many lawmakers have demonstrated themselves to be in congressional hearings, including in April 2018 when Sen. Orrin Hatch asked Mark Zuckerberg, "How do you sustain a business model in which users don't pay for your service?" While the level of congressional inquiry has improved since then, the fact remains that lawmakers have largely let companies develop their own data protection policies, expecting Americans not to use monopolistic services such as Facebook if they have concerns about their data privacy.The main difference between the U.S. and China is the level of state control and access to data. Despite increasing regulations over time, the Chinese state has access to big data directly via governmental programs and indirectly via its involvement in corporations. This access to vast stores of data may rival that of Facebook and Google, but unlike social media companies, the Chinese state has the unilateral power to imprison its citizens. That is why its capabilities and practices are complicated, and perhaps more dangerous. Governmental practices include the use of cameras (an estimated 1 billion worldwide by the end of this year), facial recognition, internet surveillance, biometric data, the social credit system and the ability to access people's computers and phones. In fact, most of China's security apparatus is focused on maintaining domestic stability, with a large portion of its budget going toward these tools. Given this focus, we are motivated to inquire about the regulations that govern the relationship between the Chinese government and the Chinese tech sector. These regulations extend to many aspects of this relationship, including, but not limited to, tech funding capabilities, government access to corporate owned-data and government intent in using that data to monitor civil society and relevant security threats. The complicated nexus of control between Chinese tech giants and the Chinese state government is accentuated with the rise of Chinese technology in mobile phones, semiconductors (a historically dependent but recently developing industry) and other tech advancements (e.g., TikTok and Baidu) across the world. Not only does this give rise to the need for appropriate practices and safeguards within the issue-prone areas of intellectual property regulations and the quality of Chinese technology, but it also has direct effects on which country will win the technological race of our lifetimes. In our understanding of the nature of the China-U.S. technological and economic relationship, it is integral for the two countries to navigate opportunities for collaboration and development within the realm of technology.The future of technology in China holds direct implications for the future of technology growth, privacy and surveillance across the world. In a world with increasingly few barriers between the private and the public, the outcome of the technological competition race has direct effects on our behaviors, connectivity and freedom. The extent to which the Chinese state controls the growth of domestic private technology has direct effects on the norms, practices and ethics of global data privacy, surveillance and intellectual property regulations. It is our responsibility to become informed about the dynamics of Chinese technological growth in order to better respond to the evolution of the global techno-ethical infrastructure during our lifetimes. In order to discuss some of these questions, the panel on China and Technology in the EPIIC Symposium (March 18 - March 20, 2021) brings together a diverse range of speakers and includes academics, journalists and professionals from think tanks, companies and eminent universities. At the moment, the list of speakers includes academics such as Qing Wang (Warwick Business School), specialists such as Robert Williams (executive director of the Paul Tsai China Center at Yale Law School) and journalists such as Rebecca Fannin (Forbes). With debates that include not only the science and engineering aspects of technology, but also the societal, legal and economic implications of Chinese technological dominance, this conversation aims to bring together students of all disciplines, faculty and the broader public in an effort to educate ourselves about and better understand the nature of the international technological revolution that we are in. We are very excited for this panel and sincerely hope that you can join us. Atrey Bhargava is a senior majoring in economics and international relations. Leo Westgard is a sophomore majoring in political science and civic studies. Both are in this year's EPIIC program on "China and the World" and are organizing a panel on Chinese technology for the March 18-20 symposium.

Chinese women's group video challenges government's idea of a real manCNN WireMarch 8, 2021 Monday 9:24 AM GMTCopyright 2021 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1106 wordsByline: Nectar Gan and Steven Jiang, CNNDateline: (CNN) Body             For years, Chinese state media has marked International Women's Day with effusive praise for the country's women, thanking them for their contribution and sacrifices to their family, society and nation.But this year, a video asking pointed questions about deep-rooted gender prejudice disembarked from the usual compliments -- taking Chinese social media by the storm.The two-minute clip, which challenges gender stereotypes for both women and men, is surprisingly progressive for a state-run publication. It is all the more remarkable considering some of its lines are a bold contradiction -- and seemingly thinly-veiled criticism -- of the Chinese government's recent efforts to entrench certain gender norms, such as promoting often narrowly defined "masculinity."The video was a collaboration between Chinese skincare brand Proya and China Women's Daily, the official publication of the state-run All-China Women's Association, to mark International Women's Day on Monday.As of Monday afternoon, it had been shared tens of thousands of times on Weibo and Wechat, two of China's most popular social media platforms. A related hashtag -- "It is prejudice, not gender, that draws the boundary" -- had racked up more than 100 million views on Weibo, China's heavily-censored version of Twitter.The huge and mostly positive reaction to the video speaks to the growing dissatisfaction among many Chinese, especially the younger generation, against staid gender stereotypes -- even as the government under President Xi Jinping moves to reinforce traditional family values and turns against male role models deemed too effeminate.What's in the video?The video begins with the presenter speaking into the camera and asking a question that is repeated throughout the clip: "Under what circumstances do you judge something based on gender?""Seeing a traffic accident, we say: 'Oh, a female driver.' We say: 'You've really got a nerve, you're not like a girl at all.' We say: 'You're so quiet, you're not manly,'" she says.The video goes on to highlight a series of gender norms and prejudice against women, from being bad at math to the expectation to "marry well" and focus on family life."We ask women: 'How do you balance your family and career?' But we never ask men the same question," the presenter says. "We ask: 'What does it mean to be an independent woman?' But nobody ever discusses what it means to be an independent man."The video also questions gender norms and roles Chinese men are expected to fulfill. For example, the presenter asks why "a real man" is not supposed to cry, like the color pink or learn ballet."Why don't men have the right to be fragile? Why is it derogatory, not praise, to say 'you're like a woman' to a man? Why are nice qualities such as being gentle, considerate, family-oriented, or neat exclusive to women? Is it true that only men can be independent, courageous, strong and career-focused?" a group of voices -- of both women and men -- ask toward the end of the clip.In contrast -- and in line with tradition -- other state-media outlets marked International Women's Day by praising Chinese women for their contributions to society.People's Daily, the official mouthpiece of the ruling Communist Party, on Tuesday called for the public to pay tribute to "Her strength.""They're striving in all professions and trades, showing their female demeanor by being selfless and fearless, contributing the female power by shouldering their responsibilities," it said in a Weibo post.Make young Chinese men more "manly"?The challenge to male stereotypes in the China Women's Daily's video is out of step with the Chinese government's recent campaign to "cultivate masculinity" among the country's young men.With that stated goal, the Chinese Ministry of Education last month announced a plan to reinforce physical education classes and hire more sports instructors in schools.The campaign is a response to the suggestion of a delegate to China's top political advisory body that the country needed to prevent the "feminization" of teenage boys, who he said had become "weak, timid and low in self-esteem."The announcement was met with a torrent of criticism on Chinese social media, with many questioning why "feminine" is a derogatory term. Some gender and sexuality experts also called the focus on masculinity discriminatory, and warned that it could have a detrimental impact on society, including increased domestic violence.The Education Ministry's call to action is not the first official effort to tackle what state media has called the "masculinity crisis" among young Chinese men.Under Xi, China's nationalist leader, the government has turned against male celebrities, from movie stars to boyband members, that are deemed too effeminate. In 2019, China's major video-streaming platforms began censoring male actors' earrings, blurring their earlobes.But in the eyes of the Chinese authorities, the lack of "masculinity" is not only a matter of taste, but a great risk to the country.In 2018, state-run Xinhua news agency published a widely cited commentary that said: "Whether a country embraces or rejects (effeminate men) is ... a grave matter that affects the nation's future."Focusing its ire on wildly popular male idols, the article blasted the "sickly aesthetics" that had propelled "gender-ambiguous, heavily made-up, tall and delicate" young men to stardom on television and online."The phenomenon of 'sissy men' has caused a public backlash because the impact of such sickly culture on the youth cannot be underestimated," it said. "When critics say 'sissy young men turn a nation sissy,' they may sound somewhat facetious," it added. "(But) nurturing a new generation that could rejuvenate the nation requires the resistance of erosive unhealthy culture."In response, a growing number of so-called "masculinity programs" aimed at instilling traditional gender roles in boys and young men through outdoor sports and classroom training have become popular in recent years. In 2018, one such club in Beijing attracted attention -- and some criticism -- for having its students run shirtless in the dead of winter.On Weibo, many users applauded the video by Proya and China Women's Daily for speaking out against the trend."This is the best promotional material for International Women's Day I've seen in 24 years," a comment said. Another said: "There's no 'what I'm supposed to become.' I forever have the right to choose my own life."                      Nectar Gan and Steven Jiang, CNN         TM & © 2021 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

China, Britain lock horns over ambassador's article on press freedomsUPIMarch 10, 2021 Wednesday 10:19 AM ESTCopyright 2021 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 352 wordsByline: ELIZABETH SHIMDateline: March 10 BodyBritain's top diplomat to Beijing is defending a post on Chinese social media platform WeChat after being summoned to the Chinese foreign ministry about the article.Ambassador Caroline Wilson said Tuesday evening on Twitter that she "stands by" her article and pointed out her Chinese counterpart in London wrote more than a dozen editorials for British media."I stand by my article. No doubt the outgoing Chinese Ambassador to the UK stands by the 170+ pieces he was free to place in mainstream British media," Wilson tweeted.Wilson's article on Chinese social media described the role of foreign journalists as a "watchdog." The foreign press' criticism of the Chinese government also is not the equivalent of "China-hating," the ambassador had said, according to Hong Kong Free Press."Foreign media in China is independent and supervises the behavior of both the local government and the Chinese government," she said."I think they act in good faith and play an active role as a supervisory agency of government actions, ensuring that people have access to accurate information, and protecting those who have no voice."The article has drawn a sharp response from China's foreign ministry.Diplomatic spokesman Zhao Lijian said Wednesday at a regular press briefing that "any argument for or against China's system would be interfering with China's internal affairs."Zhao also said Wilson's writing reflects "double standards" and "deeply rooted ideological prejudice" against China."Diplomats have an obligation not to interfere with the domestic politics of the host country, and this is a principle that must be observed," Zhao said.Conflict is growing between China and Britain at a time when Beijing could be wary of the multilateral Quad partnership and U.S. plans to resuscitate alliances in Asia.Zhao said Wednesday that China does not oppose the Quad, but that "all cooperation initiatives" must be undertaken with "peace and development" in mind.The White House said Tuesday that President Joe Biden and his counterparts in Japan, India and Australia are expected to convene their first Quad summit Friday.Load-Date: March 10, 2021End of Document

Jack Ma hasn't appeared in public for two months after criticizing the Chinese governmentCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 4, 2021 MondayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 267 wordsBodyThe strange absence of the media focus of Jack Ma, founder of the Alibaba Group e-commerce, has led to rumors about his current whereabouts, while China's regulatory system is investigating his business, CNBC reports.The first doubts about his whereabouts began on Friday, January 1, when Jack Ma did not appear as a judge on the final episode of his own talent show, Africa's Business Heroes.Ma was replaced by an Alibaba executive and his photo was removed from the contest website. A spokesman for the trading platform noted to the Financial Times that, "due to a time conflict, Mr. Ma could not be part of the final panel of judges."The entrepreneur's problems began when Chinese regulators suspended in November the IBRO of their fintech company Ant Group, owner of the Alipay payment service and a subsidiary of the Alibaba consortium.The failed IBRO – which could have been "the greatest in history" – caused Alibaba's stock to plummet. In addition to the fact that on 24 December, China's State Market Regulation Administration reported that the Alibaba Group consortium is being investigated on suspicion of monopoly.Since OctoberJack Ma has not been seen in public since last October, when he criticized China's regulatory system and state banks for hindering business opportunities.On the other hand, the millionaire called for a new, inclusive and universal banking system, according to Reuters. "The current financial system is the legacy of the industrial age," Ma said."We must establish a new one for the next generation, for young people. We need to reform the current system," he added.Load-Date: January 5, 2021End of Document

I'm Jackie DeAngelis in for Maria Bartiromo. It is Thursday, March 18th.To your top stories at 7:00 a.m. Eastern time.The immigration debate. The House set to vote on immigration reform today as thousands of migrants flood the southern border. The Biden administration now saying that tax increases on high earners will apply to families, not individuals.Reform today as thousands of migrants flood the southern border. The Biden administration now saying that tax increases on high earners will apply to families, not individuals. What that means for you if it passes.And checking the market action, futures are mixed this morning after yesterday record rally, the Dow indicated higher. The Dow and the S&P 500 closing in record territory following the Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates low.European markets pointing up this morning as well, green across the board.And a similar sentiment in Asia overnight. Green there as well.MORNINGS WITH MARIA is live right now.All right. Let's get to some of the top stories that we're watching this morning. The House is going to vote on two immigration bills today as the United States faces a surge of migrants at the southern border.The bills create a path to citizenship for farm workers and younger immigrants living illegally in the United States.Meantime, Texas Governor Greg Abbott demanding that the state be allowed to interview unaccompanied migrant children in federal facilities, this is coming as part of an investigation into human trafficking at the border.While the White House has not called the border surge a crisis, a senior CBP official tells Fox News, quote, "The president understands it is a crisis which is why he told migrants don't come."New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's office will carry out its own investigation into the sexual harassment claims against him. The New York state attorney general and state lawmakers have an ongoing probe into these allegations. Cuomo has denied the claims.Meanwhile, a New York nursing home manager tells Fox News that he was, quote, petrified by Governor Cuomo's order to take in COVID patients. More than 15,000 people have died in New York state nursing homes and long-term care facilities due to COVID-19.The Biden administration will give schools $10 billion for COVID testing to help kids get back in the classroom. The funds will come from the recently passed $1.9 trillion relief package. Biden has pledged to reopen K through 8 schools during his first 100 days in office.And the IRS delays the April 15th tax filing deadline to May 17th. This is coming after lawmakers urged the government to allow more people time to complete those tax returns. It also gives tax filers more time to adjust to the tax law changes that were implemented during the pandemic.It is time for "The Word on Wall Street", top investors watching your money.Joining me now UBS Financial Services private wealth advisor Alli McCartney, Strategic Wealth Partners president and CEO Mark Tepper, and TJM institutional services director James Iuorio.First up, Alli, let's go ahead and start with you. Talk about the fed yesterday, certainly making some dovish statements there, giving this market a little bit more wind at its back if you will.Futures are mixed at the moment. But we're still sitting at records.ALLI MCCARTNEY, PRIVATE WEALTH ADVISOR, UBS FINANCIAL SERVICES: Yes, Jackie. look, yesterday was a really interesting meeting. The economic community is calling it somewhat salacious because of how much transparency and how sort of off-the-cuff Chairman Powell was.Yesterday was a day where the dove doesn't cry, they partied, they partied like it's 1999 or maybe the end of the pandemic. It was a really, really interesting meeting.So interestingly enough, what happened was basically at the same time that they prognosticated and greatly increased their growth forecast for the coming years, they made very, very clear that they are going to remain accommodative, that there will be no rate increases until 2023, and that they have a reaction function and a reaction function is really just a fancy way of saying these are the tools, these are the issues we use those tools from and this is how we pair it. And we're going to do everything we can to keep that coming.And so basically yesterday, that's what drove the markets to new highs and took the Nasdaq out of, you know, much lower on the day because it seems that at least for the first time in a while the market really believed that the fed is going to have easy money for at least the next two years.DEANGELIS: Yes, it likes to hear that reassurance from Jerome Powell.Mark, I want to move on to you because gas guzzling is dropping. That's at least according to the IEA. The demand for fuel is never going to return to the pre-pandemic highs because of the more efficient vehicles that are out there and also a rise in remote work.I'm wondering what you think about that because I'm watching gas prices closely. And they're around $2.88. They've been climbing due to the fallout from Texas storms, and higher oil prices in general. Some of that attributable to the administration and its policies.So your thoughts on this issue?MARK TEPPER, PRESIDENT/CEO, STRATEGIC WEALTH PARTNERS: Well, gas prices are going up because of a reduction in supply, not necessarily an increase in demand which is, you know, that's part of the problem.There's no doubt gas is in a structural decline. It's peaked. But you said COVID-19 brought us work from home and that's not going anywhere. That's here to stay. That's reducing miles on cars. Vehicles are more fuel efficient. You don't need as much gas.Younger people don't even buy cars anymore. They participate in ride sharing. Governments around the world are pushing for low carbon alternatives. And then you've got the rise of EVs, electric vehicles.So gas may have peaked but it's not going away any time soon. The EV path is going to be a very, very long path. Right now, EVs account for about 2 percent of total vehicle sales. I've heard a lot of people say that it could get to 70 percent by 2040 but we have a lot of work to do if we want to get there.The biggest issue as I see it right now, I've got a gas station on every corner. There is a lack of charging stations. So that infrastructure needs to be built out all around the country. That's going to take a long time because right now, EVs they're basically commuter cars only. So we're still going to need gas for the next 20 years or so but I do believe it's peaked.DEANGELIS: All right. Jim Iuorio, over to you. Welcome and great to see you morning. Institutions are embracing bitcoin and Morgan Stanley is actually one of the first U.S. banks to offer clients access to crypto funds.There's some restrictions baked in there. The funds have to have at least $5 million with the bank, they have to have been active for at least six months, plus they can't risk more than 2.5 percent of their net worth.I'm wondering what this means for the broader acceptance of bitcoin right now. We're starting to see it be used and integrated in so many different ways, Jim.JAMES IUORIO, TJM INSTITUTIONAL SERVICES DIRECTOR: Well, the validation of bit coin started a couple of years ago when the CME launched its features contract on bitcoin. And even today, you mentioned Morgan Stanley. There's also a headline about Bank of New York Mellon buying a crypto, I don't know all the details on it, buying a small crypto firm as well.So all of that validates as well. And when you hear what Alli said about yesterday's fed meeting being interesting. So here's what I heard from the Fed meeting yesterday is that we are willing to ignore inflation now.We're willing to pretend that the CPI can show us inflation. We're wiling to pretend that the dollar index is still a valid instrument for measuring the dollar. And we're willing to do that for a long time.That scares people. The first time bitcoin rallied to 20,000 back in 2017, I think it was just a fear of missing out. It was kind of similar to the GameStop trade right now. Now to me it seems like, yes, there's a fear of missing out too, but there's actually a real need to diversify away from the U.S. dollar.I'm not saying that we're looking at hyper inflation anywhere in the horizon any time soon, but if, you know, run away inflation is something that's even possible why not hedge yourself.Morgan Stanley I believe, or JP Morgan said maybe 1 percent of people's money should be in crypto, their words not mind. But I've been in it for about a year -- not a huge amount but just as a hedge.DEANGELIS: Alli, what do you think of that because, the bitcoin trade does say something about what investors are thinking about inflation. And there is this tendency for the Fed to say look, we strip out energy and food which are the most volatile, at the same time there happens to be what impact consumers the most and really drive inflation. So it's six of one half dozen of the other, right?MCCARTNEY: Yes. So look, I mean bitcoin -- look, if you talk about inflation and you're talking about inflation in one of the lowest historically low yielding environments ever. Then there are a couple of places you can go.You can go to dividend companies. You can go to real estate, you can go to gold which doesn't have as much of an opportunity cost as it did before because of that absence of yield in the fixed income market and you can go to bitcoin, right. You can go to places that are sources that have limited supply but where demand is being professionalized into a much more mature market.So I think it's really -- you know, one of the things that I think is fascinating about cryptocurrency is you really can't say at this point how it is correlated even -- maybe you can say over the super short term but you can't really say how it's correlated over the long term.But I think that what it is indicative of certainly is that whether we have inflation now I think everybody agrees now, thankfully including the fed, that this is a blip, not a sustained inflation and as Jim very correctly identified, the fed is focused on employment and social inequity in the country --DEANGELIS: Right. MCCARTNEY: -- not on temporary inflation. So, you know, people are going to have to find ways to invest that aren't tech because of everything we've been talking about, about how an increase in interest rates an inflation, hurt big growth companies.So bitcoin clearly is going to be a beneficiary of that as are, you know, the number of clients that I've seen buying physical real estate, REITs or private REITs and --(CROSSTALK)DEANGELIS: -- right trying to really diversify.MCCARTNEY: -- for the same reason. Exactly.DEANGELIS: Yes, trying to diversify. Jim, I just want to go back to you real quick on the bitcoin point that Alli makes as well.You know, we're looking at this year as a year where the administration may crack down in some ways and bitcoin may be a target of regulation. Would that pour some cool water on this trade? Many expect that it would.IUORIO: It certainly would temporarily, I think. And once the selling starts, if people are bulled up on a position, you know, selling begets selling.But historically in countries that tried to really crack down on bitcoin, eventually bitcoin goes -- you know, trades at a premium to the other countries.I'm blown away by the way that the government hasn't, you know, focused on bitcoin and tried to crack down on it before. I can't imagine that there's a government on the planet that wants transactions to be happening outside of their control.So I think when it happens, if they wise up and do start to crack down, I think it will create an initial cascading of selling but I think that probably long-term it creates more of a buying opportunity.DEANGELIS: All right. Ali, Jim -- great to see you. Mark, stick around.We have much more ahead this morning.Coming up on the show, the first high level talks of the new administration, D.C. International Advisory CEO, Steven Yates, previews the White House's upcoming meeting with China as Beijing plans to ask for a rollback of Trump era policies.Then, the border crisis and transparency, why some in Congress say that the Biden administration isn't doing enough to curb the influx at the border.Hear from West Virginia Senator Shelley Moore Capito and Arizona Congressman Andy Biggs on this.And cancel culture running rampant, how one generation may hold the key to stopping it in its tracks.Joining the conversation all morning long: Mark Tepper and Steve Forbes.You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.DEANGELIS: The House will vote today on two immigration bills that would provide a path to citizenship for dreamers and immigrant farm workers.This as the Biden administration sets up new emergency shelters in Texas to House the growing number of migrant minors. The White House still refusing to give the media access to those facilities or call the surge in migrants a crisis.Joining me now, "The Washington Examiner" chief political correspondent and Fox News contributor, Byron York.Byron, the situation at the border continues to get worse and it doesn't appear that this administration has any plan to change the policy, the actual policy that is to straighten it out.You know, the president saying don't come isn't really much of something for people to sink their teeth into, to subscribe to. They see the policies at the border are loose and they're still going to come.BYRON YORK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: You know, I think it's fair to say that what the Biden administration has done now, rather than change its policies, is impose a blackout on the border. You know, one thing that characterized the uproar over the Trump immigration policy, the so-called kids in cages policy in 2018 is that there were photos of it and those photos of it really touched people, they made them angry, they led to an uproar in Washington and in other parts of the country.You're not seeing that with this situation. The Biden administration is keeping reporters away. They will not allow reporters to go on what are called ride-alongs with border patrol agents as they go out and pick up people who crossed into the United States illegally. And you are not seeing pictures inside any of these detention facilities.And you're seeing more and more complaints in the press about that because reporters are asking for this.DEANGELIS: Yes.YORK: But so far, the administration has blacked this out.DEANGELIS: You make a great point because not only are they doing that, not allowing the access to the facilities to us, to journalists who would like to be able to tell those stories. But also they're not going down there themselves.President Biden doesn't have any plans to go. You have that GOP group that went earlier this week and gave us some accounting for what's going on down there and they say that these facilities and the conditions for which these children are being housed just because the system is overrun are really in bad shape.YORK: You're right. President Biden was asked if he had any plans to go down to see what was going on and he said no.And there's one other group they're denying access to. There's a court settlement called the Flores agreement which dictates how children have to be treated in custody and it allows lawyers, nonprofit lawyers to go in and inspect conditions to sort of oversee if the government is keeping its end of the bargain under the Flores agreement.And those lawyers played another big part in the uproar over the Trump policies because they went in, they came out and they told their stories of what they saw. And so far those lawyers are not being allowed access to these facilities by the Biden administration.DEANGELIS: Yes. And to me it's another double standard, an example of hypocrisy. You know, if those people are supposed to go in there and account for what's happening, why aren't they given opportunity to do it now.I want to switch gears for a moment, speaking of hypocrisy, because climate czar John Kerry facing some backlash after being photographed yesterday not wearing a mask during a commercial American Airlines flight.The former secretary of state responding on Twitter, saying, in part, quote, "Feels like there's some St. Patrick's Day malarky afoot on Twitter. Let's be clear, if I dropped my mask to one ear on a flight it was momentary," end quote.Now, American Airlines is reportedly looking into the incident. Byron, your reaction to this? There are some out there who are saying it was more than a moment and he's saying well, you know, I'm on an airplane, I need to eat, drink, whatever -- I need a second with the mask.But you know, somebody of his stature, somebody in his position should really kind of be the pinnacle, right, the example to set for everybody.YORK: Well, you would think. I mean some people are saying well, at least he's flying commercial because, you know, he was the object of much controversy, being the climate czar, flying around the world in private jets.But look, Kerry's defense is look, I just did it for a second. Sorry. And I put it back on. Now, the problem with the whole story is, it's a still photograph. It shows what happened in that moment and Kerry doesn't deny that he's not wearing the mask at that moment.DEANGELIS: Right.YORK: And if you're on American Airlines or other airlines, they announce multiple times, you've got to wear a mask. If you refuse to wear a mask you may be taken off the plane. So Kerry's saying it was just for a second, sorry about that.And that's what -- I mean there were other people on the plane. That's what an investigation would actually show.DEANGELIS: All right. Steve Forbes?STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA: I think Dagen McDowell made that observation that Secretary Kerry wanted to show the world that he could actually slum down and fly commercially.But Byron, before you go, I want to hit the question of the filibuster. What's been the reaction to McConnell's throwing down the gauntlet.One, is the Republican Party and the senators actually totally united on this? And two, is it going to give pause to the Democrats, especially Manchin, they don't want a scorched earth policy that senator McConnell has said will happen if they go ahead and try get rid of the filibuster.YORK: I think it may have given some pause to some democrats. You know, you have Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, Joe Manchin of West Virginia saying they will not vote to kill the filibuster. Now, you've had Dianne Feinstein of California saying that she might not vote either.I mean it was a very powerful speech by Mitch McConnell and he pointed out that in 2017, less than four years ago, a majority, 33 -- 33 Democratic senators signed a letter supporting the filibuster, opposing any measure to kill the filibuster.And now have they just suddenly flipped around? The answer is yes, they have. By the way, in that letter in 2017 a majority of Republicans also supported the filibuster, even though there a Republican majority in the Senate and a Republican president who wanted to kill the filibuster.DEANGELIS: That's a great point. Byron, we could talk on and on about this. But we are going to have to leave it there. We thank you so much for your time this morning.YORK: Thank you.DEANGELIS: Coming up, Governor Cuomo is under fire. Why one nursing home manager says he was, quote, "terrified", to defy the governor's policies. We're going to get into it next.Plus, ready to travel? We have a list of the top towns that are ready for you to visit. It's making a buzz this morning.DEANGELIS: New York Governor Andrew Cuomo doubling down on his refusal to resign even after president Biden said that he should resign if an investigation proves the sexual harassment claims against him. This as Governor Cuomo's office launches its own investigation into these allegations.Meanwhile, a New York nursing home manager tells Fox News that he was, quote, petrified by Cuomo's order to move COVID patients into long-term care facilities. The manager also says that his concerns were shot down by state officials.Steve, your reaction to this? Cuomo is dealing with battles on many different fronts here.FORBES: He knows he has no future if he leaves the governor's office now so he's going to fight every inch of the way.A couple of things. One is, what happened with the nursing homes is a real, real disaster and tragedy and scandal and he should be punished for that. And the other thing is, the coverup, trying to cover it up shows they did wrong and knew they did wrong.The other thing is, president Biden says the governor should have a due process on the sexual harassment charges. I hope the president tells his education department that students on campus should be afforded due process when they face such accusations.But the nursing home thing, it's also happened in New Jersey, killing thousands of people unnecessarily and that's got to come out.DEANGELIS: It's a very good point there on all fronts that you make and when it comes to the nursing homes, you know, they say sometimes the coverup is worse than the crime.In this case, the underlying crime was pretty bad. And the coverup just added to it.Mark, you know, Governor Cuomo is definitely digging his heels in. He doesn't want to resign, possibly for the reasons that Steve mentioned there. But it seems like he's doing his own investigation now and going to fight this to the end.TEPPER: I think Steve hit the nail on the head, right. He's digging his heels in because he knows he has no future. So he's going to try and salvage what he has left.Jackie, I fully believe in due process over being tried in the court of public opinion. I think people should be viewed as being innocent until proven guilty but with six plus allegations things obviously look very messy for Governor Cuomo.But also let's shoot straight here. This is pure hypocrisy. If the tables were turned, everyone would be calling for the Republican's head -- everybody. You just look over the last four years. There was no due process. Everyone was guilty until proven innocent.DEANGELIS: Right.TEPPER: And then even when they were proven innocent, they were still guilty. So --DEANGELIS: Right. And that's the issue, right?TEPPER: -- you know, it's just pure hypocrisy. That is the big issue.DEANGELIS: Let's not have a double standard. If we're going to wait for investigations, you know, to a determination to decide what to do then let's let that be the standard for everybody on both sides of the aisle. But that hasn't been the case as you point out.Gentlemen, stay with us.Because coming up, we are gearing up for the first high level talks with China. Why the country's asking for a roll back of Trump era policies.Plus Disneyland is back in business, when you can expect to get back to the happiest place on earth. That's next.JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Welcome back. I am Jackie DeAngelis, in for Maria Bartiromo. It is Thursday, March 18. And we are taking a look at the markets this half hour. Futures are mixed this morning after yesterday's record rally. You can see the DOW is indicated higher there, but the NASDAQ looking to open with a pretty decent size loss more than 1 percent.The DOW and S&P 500 closing in record territory, following the Federal Reserve's decision yesterday to keep those interest rates low. European markets pointing up this morning. And in Asia overnight, we saw green pretty much across the board with the Hang Seng logging of 1.3 percent gain. Millions of Americans are bracing for more tornadoes today. Cheryl Casone has more on that threat. CherylCHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: That is right, Jackie. Tornadoes, thunderstorms and more on the way for the southeast portion of the country. At least 21 reported tornadoes already touching down overnight, leaving a trail of destruction in particular in Alabama and in Mississippi. And Arkansas severe storms causing flash flooding and the threat is not over yet. The National Weather Service says, large hail and high winds expected from Virginia to Florida today.Well, a Texas man was arrested yesterday outside the home of Vice President, Kamala Harris. Paul Murray was wanted by police and stopped by the Secret Service at the Naval Observatory. After a bulletin was sent out, police found a rifle, a large amount of ammunition, and several gun clips in his car that was parked several blocks away. Now Murray is facing several charges. The VP and her family were not home at the time.Well, Ford is reportedly breaking a promise to workers, building a new plant in Mexico, not Ohio is the promise. The United Auto Workers Union is issuing a letter, accusing Ford of going back on an agreement to build a next generation vehicle at its Cleveland area plant. Project was supposed to begin in 2023. Former President Trump tried repeatedly to stop Ford from making the move to Mexico. And get ready to get happy, the happiest place on earth. Disneyland, California can officially reopen on April 30 at 15 percent capacity. Park has been closed for more than a year. Per state guidelines, only those living in California can buy tickets. So no, out of state visitors are going to be allowed. For now, they're going to reopen the hotels in phases. Disney plans to bring back about 10,000 of its furloughed employees. Let's get happy. Have some fun.DEANGELIS: That is great news, but 15 percent capacity is still low.CASONE: Yes. Well, that's California for, yes.DEANGELIS: Disney World, different story.CASONE: Different story.DEANGELIS: That is true. Great to see you. Thank you. Holding China accountable, Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, and National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, set to meet with Chinese counterparts. In Alaska today, in the Biden administration's first meet or meeting between the two nations. The Chinese officials are reportedly planning to ask the United States to reverse the policies put in place by the Trump administration. That's according to The Wall Street Journal. Yesterday on Fox News Primetime, Maria Bartiromo, spoke with former White House Trade Adviser, Peter Navarro, on what he expects from this meeting. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PETER NAVARRO, FRM. WHITE HOUSE TRADE ADVISER: What's going to happen tomorrow in Alaska, the CCP, the Chinese Communist Party, infected this nation with the deadly virus and they spent a pandemic around the world. Will Blinken, confront the Chinese about that. Ask them, let us into those labs. Let's figure out how that started and charge them a bill for the trillions of dollars that they put on it. Will they hold China accountable for the concentration camps, it has 2 million Uyghurs? Will Blinken lay around lying down in the sand and say, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you are not taking Taiwan on our watch. I don't think any of that's going to happen.(END VIDEO CLIP)DEANGELIS: Joining me now, D.C. International Advisory CEO, former Radio Free Asia President and former Deputy National Security Adviser for Dick Cheney, Stephen Yates. Stephen, good morning, and great to see you. You heard the sound bite there from Peter Navarro. He lays out a lot of the issues that you would want to hear the administration pushback on.Right now, the administration is saying, oh, well, we are not necessarily going to back off the tariffs that President Trump imposed in the last round, but - and we are taking a hard stance on China. But there is a lot outstanding regarding the virus, regarding human rights violations, and regarding technology, and IP theft, for example.STEPHEN YATES, FRM DICK CHENEY DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: Yes, absolutely, Jackie. The plate is very, very full. When the National Security Adviser travels to meet with a counterpart in China, that is usually a scene setter for setting up a presidential engagement. And this is the first in the Biden administration to get a sense of where will they lay down their markers and priorities? The Trump administration was very clear and making somewhat of a historic course correction on what the American approach to China was. And it brought allies along over the course of four years and some of those areas you mentioned.For the Biden administration, early signals were a preference for global issues like climate change, perhaps walking back on pressure from tariffs, and also sort of a pullback from the Communist Party of China's influence operations what they've done. But perhaps most importantly, is what Peter Navarro said, accountability for the mishandling and unleashing a virus on the world that had profound economic costs and otherwise.DEANGELIS: And Stephen, how do you get that accountability from this administration where they barely or even acknowledging the fact that the virus originated in China?YATES: Well, that's one of the toxic consequences when you allow politics to get in the way of real analysis of what's happening in the world. Basically, the political infection of the World Health Organization is what led to the actual infection of the world and our economies. And so, that Chinese influence operation in the United Nations and affiliated organizations like the World Health Organization, is a significant issue that this administration has frankly taken the wrong side on because of domestic politics here.DEANGELIS: Let me ask you about this, the Alaska meeting. It's coming as a Commerce Department announces that it's subpoenaing a number of Chinese companies over potential threats to national security. The department has not specified which companies specifically were targeted there. How do you think they are going to handle this issue, because it is a really important one, and it was one that was on the Trump administration's agenda to tackle?YATES: It's also on our allies' agenda. This administration likes to talk about how it's improving relations with allies. But a lot of our allies are concerned about clean supply chains, clean 5G, and clean semiconductor supply chains. So that, when we use our technology, we are not aiding and abetting abuse in, say the Chinese Muslim minority area or other surveillance state activities by the Chinese.So, this sort of tea leaf reading from the commerce move is in the right direction. The real question is, when they have to really follow up on the subpoena, and what information they find, what action will they take against these companies. Huawei is probably the one that most Americans have heard of a little bit. The others, perhaps they haven't.DEANGELIS: Tick Tock is another one, not talking a lot about them anymore. Any kind of security breach there. Steve Forbes?STEVE FORBES, FORBES MEDIA CHAIRMAN: Stephen, you headed up Radio Free Asia. And one of the great weapons during the cold war in the battle of ideas was these broadcasts at the U.S. did RFE/RL, which I was involved in VOA. What should the administration do, probably won't do it in terms of broadcast to China, to Russia, to Iran, beating them up and also concerns about the journalism that we are finding at the VOA today. That's one reason why Biden fired Michael Pack who is trying to clean that up.YATES: Yes. I was one of those that was had a large prejudice supplied to me, simply because even though I've spent my entire career in and out of government, fighting the Chinese Communist Party influences, a somewhat pro-China person was appointed, and they made a clean sweep of all the appointees. I think it raises significant concerns of politics, and narrative and D.C. getting in the way of real hard charging analysis.These unfree media environments need programming that goes in and encourages and informs people to stand up for themselves. That is the single best asset we have to avoid actual war is enabling people to take care of business themselves. And so, I hope that we get a better approach to these broadcasts. I suspect it's going to have to come from the private sector, not from government though.DEANGELIS: Yes. Let's take that point a little further and turn to North Korea because the Rogue Nation speaking out and saying, that it's got no plans to re-enter negotiations with the United States unless it eases up on policies. And North Korean official called nuclear talks with the U.S. "a waste of time." Stephen, that wasn't the case when President Trump was dealing with Kim Jong-un there. You know, this administration isn't taken seriously by some of these leaders.YATES: Well, in fairness, I think that this has been a long-standing challenge in terms of trying to change the trajectory of North Korea. And there's been a bipartisan failure to be able to do it, but that's not necessarily the fault of Americans. This is the North Koreans made a strategic choice to pursue the world's most dangerous weapons.And it turns out international organizations and diplomacy, don't really sway those that are most determined to do this. President Trump tried some bold moves to change the outlook of the new leader of North Korea. I think it was worth trying those things. But the net result is, they are still moving in this direction. And the Biden team seems to be walking back to the conventional approach of the past, which I think it was a proven failure in the Obama and Bush administrations.DEANGELIS: Yes. And I just to clarify. My point wasn't that, you know, President Trump had made so much progress with North Korea. But he had a way of dealing with President Kim in a way that was different than any other politician, and it seemed like he was making some strides forward and that was something to look forward too.YATES: Absolutely.DEANGELIS: Stephen Yates, it's great to see you this morning. Thank you.YATES: My pleasure. Thank you.DEANGELIS: Coming up, the cancel culture is running rampant. My next guest says that, one generation may hold the key to stopping it in its tracks plus fair trade. How Coors wants you to help clean your clutter and rewards you with booze. It's making a buzz this morning. You are watching "Mornings with Maria" live on Fox Business.DEANGELIS: One generation may be the key to ending cancel culture, a New York post op-ed cancel culture is out of control, and Gen X is our only hope saying, "kids stopped learning what Gen X and every previous generation learned in high school: Free speech is good for everyone. Witch hunts and moral panics always end in terrible, terrible injustice, blacklists are un-American. Instead, they started learning that speech could be violence and purges could be heroic.Victimhood is currency and someone to the - pardon me, someone to the Gulag makes you feel superior." Pardon me for that. Joining me now, the Author of the op-ed Wall Street Journal, Deputy op-ed editor and author of Zero Hour for Gen X. How the last adult generation can save America from millennials, Matthew Hennessey. Matthew, great to see you this morning. You know, so many people are saying, it's just gone too far. And the question at this point is, how much further can it go from here. It seems like it doesn't stop.MATTHEW HENNESSEY, WSJ DEPUTY OP-ED EDITOR: Yes. Maybe I was dreaming, but I am pretty sure I grew up in a country that didn't ban books. It seems like, we have a lot of people in the country these days who didn't pay attention during the lesson in high school on McCarthyism. And who maybe didn't do the reading in English class, who skipped the crucible in the scarlet letter. If they had done the work there, they might have learned that we don't do witch-hunts in this country and we don't do blacklists.And so, I'm calling on the people who remember those lessons and who grew up in that country to stand up for themselves. If we don't start pushing back on a lot of this stuff, I am afraid we're going to end up in a situation that that's out of our control. They call it accountability. They say that they are just holding people to the fire for their statements., but this isn't accountability. This is Maoism. This is the Stasi. This is Stalinism.DEANGELIS: Right. You can make the argument, Matthew, that really what this is it should be about is about the dialogue, and that we should use these opportunities as teachable moments to have that conversation instead of just completely erasing them. Because when you look back in time, when you look back throughout our history, these are symbols. Things that we are talking about, even historic figures were canceling to a certain extent. And so, you say, it really should be about teaching, not about a racing.HENNESSEY: Yes, of course. I mean, this is not an outrageous thing to say. But 20 or 30 years ago, this was the consensus view that everyone had a right to their opinion. Everyone had a right to speak their mind, and that in the United States, we don't get people fired. People don't have to lose their jobs or lived in shame on the margins of society, sent to the Gulag or to Siberia because of something that they might have uttered or rumor of something that they might have uttered 2025 years ago.It was very clear up until very recently, that these are the kinds of things that unfree societies do that authoritarian rulers do to their people. And the big difference that we were all supposed to learn in school is that we don't do that here. So, there's been some sort of a breakdown in civic education, and we've all been aware of it for a long time. But I'm afraid that the fruits, the poison fruits are really coming to bear these days.DEANGELIS: That's a very interesting point, because we've been talking a lot about China and the control that it has on the messaging over its people. And you are making a very parallel point there to a certain extent that that is not the kind of country that we live in. There is free speech here and there is an opportunity to have a dialogue, Matthew, and I think people need to think about that a little bit more. Great to see this morning.HENNESSEY: Thanks, Jackie.DEANGELIS: Thank you. Coming up, ready to travel. We've got a list of top towns that are ready for you to visit.DEANGELIS: Time for the Morning Buzz. We are looking at Airbnb releasing its top travel destinations for spring and summer, and the list might actually surprise you. In the wake of the pandemic, people are gravitating towards non-traditional states that offer privacy and plenty of outdoor space. Southern Maine tops the list based on growth and searches, followed by Cape May, New Jersey, Round top, Texas, and Lake Powell, Arizona, Cape San Blas, Florida, rounds out the top five. Steve, there was a gorgeous picture and the bump shot of Florida there in the beach. I would give a limb to be able to travel right now. Where would you want to go?FORBES: Well, I like Southern New Jersey. I love Maine, not just Southern Maine, but the coast of Maine as well. I think what this BnB survey shows the American people are ready to go if the politicians, and they too cautious healthcare officials would just get out of the way. And let us get out an explorer of extraordinary country this is. And you also have one of the top places, the Mammoth Cave in Kentucky. And we are fraying from jokes about certain institutions, Washington that may have should go to the Mammoth Cave, but it's a fantastic what's out there. And this just goes to show people are ready to move, not just in terms of work, but also enjoying and what this extraordinary country is. I am excited.DEANGELIS: They are and getting ready to move, means spending money too, which is going to help. You know, as long as we keep people locked down, they have no incentive to spend that stimulus money. The next question is for Mark. And I am wondering if you bought too much stuff during the lockdown, because Coors Light wants to swap your quarantine clutter for beer.You can drop off unwanted items at the battery in Atlanta or Allegiant Stadium in Nevada on Saturday. 10 pounds will get you a 12 pack of Coors Light, 20 pounds gets to a 30 pack, over 20 pounds is going to get you a pair of 30 packs, and Coors is donating the collected items to charity. I'm wondering if you did comfort buying on Amazon, Mark, and you're having some second thoughts and want to cash it in here.MARK TEPPER, STRATEGIC WEALTH PARTNERS, PRESIDENT AND CEO: Look, I have the Leaning Tower of Pisa on my front door, pretty much every day throughout lockdown. Package after package from Amazon. So yes, I've got a lot of stuff. I want to get rid of free beer, sign me up. So, the deal as I get you, I guess you pack up all the junk you bought when you were locked in at home, that you're never going to use again. Go to their waystation and boom, they send you a rebate for up to 60 beers. And Molson Coors gives all your stuff to charity. Sounds like pretty solid deal to me, sounds like a woman (Ph).DEANGELIS: Oh, let me ask you this. What did you buy that you don't plan to use again, because I had the mountain of packages, but it really was offered the household items, things that I needed? I don't have a lot of junk from the pandemic.TEPPER: Yes. Well, I could tell you that, if I actually wasn't so lazy that I never opened the boxes, so some of the stuff is still in boxes. That's my problem. It shows up on my front door, and I look at it and I'm like, God, there's six boxes. I really don't feel like opening them, you know. So that's part of my problem.DEANGELIS: Right. I heard some people got a little compulsive during all of this, because it was tough staying at home. You have to keep yourself entertained and those fingers on the phones, sometimes they just do the buying for you.TEPPER: Too easy.DEANGELIS: All right. Gentlemen stick with us. Because still ahead on the show, we are going to be talking about the future of remote work. Why more New Yorkers won't return to the office even when it's safe to do so. It all starts next hour on "Mornings with Maria" live on Fox Business.DEANGELIS: Good morning, everybody. I am Jackie DeAngelis in for Maria Bartiromo. It is Thursday, March 18, with your top stories at 8 a.m. eastern time.Load-Date: March 18, 2021End of Document

CHINA: COMPANIES SHOULD RESIST BOYCOTT THREATSStates News ServiceMarch 27, 2021 SaturdayCopyright 2021 States News ServiceLength: 709 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, N.Y. BodyThe following information was released by Human Rights Watch:Companies threatened with Chinese government-promoted boycotts should stand firm in their opposition to forced labor, Human Rights Watch said today.Chinese authorities have recently encouraged consumers across China to boycott companies that have publicly expressed concerns about forced labor and other human rights violations against Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims in and from the northwest region of Xinjiang."The Chinese government is showing its true colors by pressuring companies to be complicit in abuses rather than working together to end violations against Turkic Muslims," said Sophie Richardson, China director. "This is a litmus test of companies' upholding their human rights commitments."On March 22 and 23, 2021, Canada, the European Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States announced new coordinated sanctions on four Chinese government officials and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC) Public Security Bureau. The sanctions were imposed because of those individuals' and the XPCC's alleged involvement in human rights violations, including forced labor, in the Xinjiang region and particularly in the cotton and textile sectors.The Chinese government then announced sanctions on various European politicians, academics, and institutions. Chinese government agencies and netizens have focused fresh attention on international brands that had expressed concerns about forced labor. On March 25, a Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson said, "Pure and flawless Xinjiang cotton cannot allow any forces to smear or blacken it." Netizens have sharply criticized several companies in online forums and called for boycotts of the companies' products.On March 24, the Communist Youth League targeted the Swedish retailer HandM, which had publicly expressed concerns about Turkic Muslim forced labor in September 2020. At that time, HandM announced that it would end its relationship with Huafu Fashion, a yarn supplier with operations in Xinjiang that had been identified as using forced labor. Within a day of the Youth League statement three major Chinese e-retailers had removed all HandM products from their online stores. Some netizens commented on HandM's official Weibo account: "Are you ready? Completely disappear in China," "Countdown to the beginning of withdrawing from the China market," and "I won't buy any products from you anymore, will ask people around me not to buy too."Within hours, the online criticism had spread to Nike. The company had said nearly a year ago it was "concerned about reports of forced labor in, and connected to, Xinjiang." A celebrity said on Douyin, China's version of TikTok: "Is Nike crazy? Dare to wrestle with China."At least three major brands have taken down statements on their websites. Inditex, which owns Zara, has removed a statement explaining its policies against forced labor; PVH has done the same. VF Corporation has taken down a statement specifically addressing its concerns about Xinjiang.Other companies, including Fila and Hugo Boss, said in late March they will continue to use cotton from Xinjiang. Neither company made references to forced labor or a need to perform human rights due diligence.Increasingly governments require and consumers expect companies to comply with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Under those standards, companies have a responsibility to conduct human rights due diligence throughout their supply chains to ensure that their activities do not cause or enable harm, and that there are meaningful remedies available to workers or others effected. Some major brands, including Eileen Fisher and Marks and Spencer, have joined the "Call to Action" developed by the Coalition to End Forced Labor in the Uyghur Region.The Chinese government's actions effectively punishing the companies trying to uphold those standards are a brazen attempt to weaken an emerging global norm, Human Rights Watch said."Chinese authorities are once again arbitrarily punishing a particular group for expressed views it doesn't like," Richardson said. "Beijing may find that lashing out at companies only amplifies precisely the concerns they expressed."Load-Date: March 26, 2021End of Document

State Department Releases Human Rights Report Blasting China For Committing Genocide Against UyghursThe Daily CallerMarch 31, 2021 Wednesday 02:58 AM ESTCopyright 2021 The Daily Caller, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: WORLDLength: 435 wordsByline: Varun Hukeri, General Assignment & Analysis Reporter, varun@dailycaller.comBodyLink to ImageThe State Department released its annual human rights report Tuesday that notably called out China for committing genocide against Uyghur Muslims and other ethnic minorities in its northwestern Xinjiang region.The report, required annually by law, detailed the human rights situation last year in nearly 200 countries. It noted that in China, “government authorities committed genocide against Uyghurs” along with “crimes against humanity including imprisonment, torture, enforced sterilization, and persecution.” Honored to release the 45th annual Human Rights Report. It demonstrates that human rights, transparency and accountability are at the forefront of U.S. foreign policy. We acknowledge the work ahead and expect all nations to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms. #HRR2020 pic.twitter.com/G7BO475AoG - Secretary Antony Blinken (@SecBlinken) March 30, 2021Current estimates indicate China has detained at least one million Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in reeducation camps, according to Axios. The report also mentioned there were “an additional two million subjected to daytime-only 're-education' training,” new information not included in last year's report.The report's use of “genocide” rhetoric suggests the Biden administration intends to use more assertive language to describe the Chinese government's actions in Xinjiang, according to Reuters.Blinken said during his confirmation hearing in January he agreed with former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's determination that China was committing genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang. During the final days of the Trump administration, the U.S. became the first nation to call China's actions in the region a genocide. (RELATED: Why Do So Few US Companies With Business In China Speak Out About Genocide? Look What's Happening To H&M)The report also called out China for arresting citizen journalists during the initial COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan and censoring critics who strayed from Beijing's official narrative about the pandemic.Another country mentioned in the report was Russia, where opposition leader Alexei Navalny was reportedly sent to a prison camp in late February. The State Department also mentioned humanitarian crises and a deteriorating human rights situation in countries like Syria and Venezuela.“The trend lines on human rights continue to move in the wrong direction,” Blinken told reporters Tuesday during a press conference, according to Reuters.He added that some governments had used the COVID-19 pandemic as a “pretext to restrict rights and consolidate authoritarian rule.”Graphic The flag of the People's Republic of China flies behind barbed wire at the Consulate General of the People's Republic of China in San Francisco, California on July 23, 2020. - The US Justice Department announced July 23, 2020 the indictments of four Chinese researchers it said lied about their ties to the People's Liberation Army, with one escaping arrest by taking refuge in the country's San Francisco consulate.

Report: Cornell Professors Revolt Against Joint Program With Chinese UniversityThe Daily CallerMarch 15, 2021 Monday 10:04 PM ESTCopyright 2021 The Daily Caller, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: EDUCATIONLength: 725 wordsByline: Varun Hukeri, General Assignment & Analysis Reporter, varun@dailycaller.comBodyLink to ImageProfessors at Cornell University reportedly protested a joint degree program with China's Peking University over concerns about academic independence and human rights, according to meeting minutes and audio obtained by the Washington Free Beacon.Alex Susskind, an associate dean at Cornell's School of Hotel Administration, reportedly promoted the joint degree program funded by China's education ministry, according to the Washington Free Beacon. The program with Peking University caters to mid-level Chinese executives and could generate up to $1 million in annual profits for Cornell, Susskind reportedly said.Cornell faculty members pushed back against the program and the Faculty Senate postponed a vote on whether to approve the venture, the Washington Free Beacon reported. Some faculty reportedly said the program seemed to be purely for financial gain, and Susskind discounted human rights concerns during a faculty meeting in February. A new joint degree program bankrolled by the Chinese government has caused an uproar among @Cornell professors, prompting soul searching at the Ivy League institution. Via @kakutani_y https://t.co/kOmz2jDpaM - Free Beacon (@FreeBeacon) March 15, 2021“When I talk to my colleagues at Peking University, there's a dean and then there's a political officer,” Cornell computer science professor Ken Birman reportedly told Susskind. “I'm wondering how we maintain Cornell's independence and freedom of bias and our standards?”Susskind reportedly responded by telling his colleagues he understood their concerns but did not consider them “overwhelmingly significant.”University provost Michael Kotlikoff called for another faculty meeting Feb. 24 to discuss concerns among faculty members, according to the Cornell Daily Sun. During the meeting, he reportedly warned professors over objecting to the joint degree program.“The proper role of the faculty senate is really to set general principles,” he reportedly told faculty members, urging them “not [to] hold individual programs hostage to individual concerns.”Federal records show Cornell raised $27 million from Chinese donors between 2014 and 2019, the Washington Free Beacon reported. A partially-redacted Education Department report in October 2020 noted that Cornell failed to disclose more than $1.2 billion in foreign funds, including $1 million in contracts from Chinese tech giant Huawei, according to The Wall Street Journal.Peking University, widely considered one of China's most prestigious universities, has faced scrutiny in recent years over academic freedom issues. The university, for example, fired a professor with views challenging the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in 2013, The New York Times reported.Peking University and other top academic institutions in China amended their university charters last year to include provisions emphasizing loyalty to the CCP and, in some cases, removing written commitments to academic freedom, NPR reported.Cornell professors reportedly brought up human rights concerns as well during faculty meetings in late February and early March, according to the Washington Free Beacon. China is facing allegations of genocide over its treatment of Uighur Muslims and other ethnic minorities in the northwestern Xinjiang region.Link to ImageThe flag of the People's Republic of China flies behind barbed wire at the Consulate General (Philip Pacheco/AFP via Getty Images)If we were running a joint degree program with a Nazi university, then we would have said, 'Well, we shouldn't be doing that, because they're committing genocide,'” Eli Friedman, a professor who researches Chinese labor issues, reportedly said during a March 10 meeting.China's government has held at least 1 million people in internment camps in recent years, according to some estimates. Multiple reports have found evidence of forced labor, forced sterilization, torture and mass imprisonment in Xinjiang. (RELATED: Independent Report Finds Evidence Of Beijing's 'Intent To Destroy' Uighurs In Xinjiang Genocide)Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in late January that China's treatment of Uighurs constituted a genocide. His successor, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, has also used “genocide” rhetoric to describe China's actions.The Daily Caller has reached out to Cornell University faculty members for comment.Load-Date: March 15, 2021End of Document

DF Connection to China | Trade and Metamorphosis of the Chinese ConsumerCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 30, 2021 TuesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 421 wordsBodyMartín González Solar and Hernán Jaramillo SotoIn these extraordinary times that the pandemic has brought, it is no surprise that digitization and process reconfiguration have become an urgent priority for companies with a view to resilience in the long run. And consumers are demanding it, if we look at the metamorphosis of the Chinese consumer during 2020.In 2021, the Chinese government's 14th Five-Year Plan began, defining the policy model to be used in economic and social development over the next five years. China has started a new path, no longer focusing exclusively on exports and gravitating heavily towards consumption. In this direction, the advancement of Chinese consumers in the search for a better quality of life is unstoppable, and this momentum will change key aspects of countless industries and consumption trends globally for this year and the next. Referencing a recent Mckinsey post: "The Chinese consumer is coming out of the Covid crisis and is proud, confident and confident that his country has managed to dominate the pandemic much better than other parts of the world. And that confidence is translating into spending."In this context, there is a "remodeling" of consumer choice patterns, which are no longer primarily motivated by what "everyone" consumes or what the "community" consumes, as happened until a couple of years ago, moving towards "individual"-centered consumption. The consumer has stopped consuming a bottle of wine because the "world" likes it, but rather because "he or she" likes it.E-commerce has quickly adjusted to change and developed strategies that no longer necessarily target a "mass audience," giving way to "selective" trade. For example, The Chinese social network Tik Tok runs promotional campaigns for defined people, with a first and last name. Hence the metamorphosis of the Chinese consumer. Now, none of these trends we're seeing right now in China is entirely new. The radical difference that has occurred is that they have acquired enormous speed and importance in the last year and a half.This gives light of hope in the face of a fatigued global market. So the questions that exporters should ask themselves during 2021 should go in the following line: how do we invest in promotion and find new online channels and niches in China? Or will we perpetuate the old pre-pandemic practices? Understanding how Chinese consumers' needs and preferences are changing will be critical to product or brand growth and thus achieve sustained growth in the future.Load-Date: March 31, 2021End of Document

How a kiss with a pilot in an elevator changed this man's life and could help fight LGBTQ discrimination in ChinaCNN WireMarch 27, 2021 Saturday 00:48Invalid date found for VDI: hcd82034d304900a14c90feeb476722ac XCEDOCID: 48 LNI: 629D-33H1-JBSS-S3BH-00000-00. Date output 'as-is'.GMTCopyright 2021 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1494 wordsByline: By Steven Jiang, CNNDateline: (CNN) Body             Former flight attendant Chai Cheng still has nightmares about the moment of passion that cost him everything.In October 2019, footage was leaked online of Chai kissing a male pilot from the same airline -- China Southern,  the country's largest carrier.Both men were off duty, and the kiss -- which has since been viewed millions of times -- occurred in an elevator in a private apartment building in the southern city of Shenzhen.As the clip spread online, Chai was quickly grounded by the company and eventually let go.He is now suing the airline for lost wages, in a case that is seen as a test of China's stance on workplace discrimination.Campaigners say Chai's dismissal highlights the perils faced by LGBTQ workers in China due to lack of legal protection -- and now they're calling for workplace equality laws.On Chinese social media, Chai is often referred to as "the China Southern cabin boy." But in China's LGBTQ community, he has become a hero and an unlikely activist.The 29-year-old said the episode has upended his life, both professionally and personally. He lost his dream job, and has struggled to start a new career or find a relationship."I sometimes wish I could rewind to the time before the incident," said Chai. "So I could just be an ordinary flight attendant."CNN has sought comment from China Southern, a state-owned mega-carrier that flew more than 151 million passengers in 2019, on Chai's case and its corporate policy on LGBTQ employees, but has not received a response.Against 'socialist core values'Homosexuality is not illegal in China and it was officially removed from a list of mental disorders in 2001. But experts and activists say LGBTQ people still face persistent discrimination and prejudice.Chai said he had kept his sexuality private during his five years working at China Southern for fear that it would damage his career prospects.After the video of him kissing his coworker went viral, Chai said he was taken aside by a senior manager who told him that homosexuality was against "socialist core values," and asked him to remain silent on the topic.Chai said he complied but in April 2020 his managers told him they would not be renewing his contract."They told me 'it was for obvious reasons,'" Chai said."But I didn't break any laws or corporate rules. I went from being an outstanding employee, recognized by the company with fast promotions, to someone they wanted to have nothing to do with simply because of my sexual orientation."That's wrong ... and anyone could be the next victim."Peng Yanhui, who heads the China Rainbow Media Awards, an LGBTQ rights advocacy group, said companies rarely fire LGBTQ employees "explicitly" for being gay. "They use excuses -- and this case is no exception," he said.The pilot in Chai's case wasn't fired by the airline, according to a person with knowledge of the situation, who is not authorized to speak on personnel matters. The source said a likely reason was that China's state airline companies often pay for their pilots' training, and because carriers are much more reluctant to forego that steep investment, pilots have significantly more job security.In August 2020, Chai decided to sue China Southern over lost compensation as a result of the company's decision to ground him for six months following the appearance of the video. The suit isn't technically about discrimination but his lawyer said, if they win, it could pave the way for another legal case directly addressing that issue.A 2008 law prohibits employment discrimination based on "gender," which has been interpreted by some lawyers to cover sexual orientation, but it doesn't seem to have been tested in court yet."China Southern is a state-owned behemoth," said Zhong Xialu, Chai's lawyer. "Their corporate decisions represent the stance of mainstream employers.""LGBTQ employees often take it for granted that they have to stay in the closet to survive and function in such workplaces," she added. "Through this case, we're trying to tell them that it's the employers who are in the wrong -- and employees shouldn't feel compelled to put up with a company's wrong policy."Although Chai recorded some of his supervisor's homophobic remarks -- including calling homosexuality "abnormal" -- during their conversations, Zhong said the airline insisted in court that those represented personal opinions, not a corporate position.Deep-rooted homophobiaIn 2016, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and two local NGOs released a study on the acceptance of sexual minorities in China. Of the 28,000 LGBTQ participants, they found that 64% were "not sure" if they were accepted by their supervisors at work and 19% said they were rejected. Only 17% saying they were accepted.The same survey found only 5% of respondents had come out to their family and friends, while the overwhelming majority chose to live in the closet.Chai remembered times when coworkers mocked more effeminate gay flight attendants at China Southern -- he said he stayed quiet to avoid unwanted attention.After he was outed by the video, he said many fellow gay employees retreated further back into the closet for fear of becoming targets themselves."Many people who used to hang out with me stopped interacting with me," he said. "Everyone is afraid."Since 2016, Chinese censors have banned portrayals on TV and online of what they see as "abnormal sexual behaviors," including gay relationships. Most media and businesses in China have long stayed away from the subject to avoid running afoul of government restrictions.With Chinese leader Xi Jinping increasingly stressing the ruling Communist Party's absolute control over every aspect of society, some analysts suspect a more direct link between the lack of LGBTQ rights and top officials' worldview.Many of the country's current leaders grew up during the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s and '70s, when authorities attempted to purge any "non-socialist" elements -- including homosexuality -- from Chinese society."LGBTQ employees are still forced to live a lie in a place where they spend so much time," said Peng, the gay rights advocate. "It may be an executive's personal opinion that homosexuality is abnormal or immoral -- but if there is a workplace equality law, what that executive thinks won't matter anymore."Zhong, the lawyer, also sees the lack of legal protection as the root cause to Chai's case. In the United States, employment discrimination based on one's sexual identity is now prohibited by federal law following a landmark Supreme Court ruling last year.Jesse Liu, a 28-year-old Chinese national who has worked as a flight attendant at Texas-based American Airlines for five years, said Chai's plight underscores the vulnerability of  LGBTQ workers in China.After reading Chai's story, Liu, who is gay, left an angry comment on the official Instagram page of China Southern, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and had been rapidly expanding its global network before the pandemic."You're trying to be an international carrier, but the way you handled this incident is against every single human right value that international society is rooting for," he recalled what he had written. "As a gay passenger, I wouldn't want to spend any money flying your airline."'I needed this fight' Chai's lawyer, Zhong, takes a long view when it comes to China eventually enacting a workplace equality law."We are just at the stage of raising the issue," she said."Laws tend to lag behind issues. Bringing up an issue, prompting public debate and reaching some kind of consensus usually take place before laws are revised."The 2016 UNDP study found less than 5% of the LGBTQ respondents in China reported that employee equality training was available at their workplaces, and less than 10% confirmed their companies had such regulations.Compared with their straight coworkers, sexual and gender minorities also experienced lower job stability and a higher unemployment rate, the survey found.After Chai lost his job at China Southern, he moved to Beijing to start anew, but kept hitting a wall in his job hunting when prospective bosses found out about his employment history. His personal life has also suffered. People often see him as a scandalous figure, he said.Although Chai finally found work at a healthcare provider in February, he still dreams of flying. He said he is keenly aware of one devastating consequence of suing China Southern: No Chinese airline will ever hire him.After a court hearing on his case last November, he is still waiting for a verdict."I gave up a career that I've felt passionate about since childhood," he said. "But I needed this fight."Whether it's to improve the laws, protect our rights, or promote social equality and openness -- someone needs to push it forward."                      By Steven Jiang, CNN         TM & © 2021 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

China slams US plan to expel phone carriers in tech clashAssociated Press InternationalMarch 18, 2021 Thursday 9:59 AM GMTCopyright 2021 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 455 wordsByline: JOE McDONALD, AP Business WriterDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) — China’s government on Thursday called on Washington to drop efforts to expel three state-owned Chinese phone companies from the United States in a new clash over technology and security.The Federal Communications Commission voted Wednesday to begin revoking the companies' U.S. licenses. It said they are security risks controlled by the communist Beijing government.The foreign ministry accused Washington of misusing security complaints to hurt Chinese commercial competitors.The United States should “stop the wrong practice of generalizing the concept of national security and politicizing economic issues” and “stop abusing state power to unreasonably suppress Chinese enterprises,” said a ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian.The decision adds to mounting U.S.-Chinese conflict over the ruling Communist Party's industrial plans, access to American technology and accusations of computer attacks and theft of business secrets.President Joe Biden has said he wants a better relations with Beijing but has given no indication he will roll back sanctions imposed by his predecessor, Donald Trump, that limit Chinese access to U.S. technology and financial markets.The latest announcement came as U.S. and Chinese envoys were flying to Alaska for the highest-level face-to-face meeting between the two sides since Biden took office in January.Zhao said Beijing will “take necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises” but gave no details. Officials have issued similar warnings in the past but those usually have resulted in no action.The latest action targets China Unicom Americas, a unit of China Unicom Ltd.; Pacific Networks Corp. and ComNet (USA) LLC, a unit of Pacific Networks. They sell international voice and data service.The companies were ordered to explain their ownership and operations, and “failed to address the serious national security threats posed by their continued operation in the U.S.,” said Commissioner Brendan Car in a statement.National security officials “advise that traffic on these networks ‘remains subject to exploitation, influence, and control by the Chinese government,’” Carr said. He said some Chinese telecom companies have operated in the United States for decades and “security threats have evolved substantially in the intervening years.”Earlier, state-owned China Mobile Ltd. was blocked in 2019 from entering the U.S. market on security grounds.Trump also blocked access to most U.S. technology for telecom equipment giant Huawei Technologies Ltd. and some other Chinese tech companies. Trump issued an order prohibiting Americans from investing in securities of companies deemed by the Pentagon to be linked to China’s military.Load-Date: March 18, 2021End of Document

China has unleashed the nationalist genie. Beijing may regret letting it out of the bottleCNN WireMarch 27, 2021 Saturday 00:46Invalid date found for VDI: h30a74019e4f6d8ada618f78b1017cb78 XCEDOCID: 8 LNI: 629D-33H1-JBSS-S3BC-00000-00. Date output 'as-is'.GMTCopyright 2021 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1264 wordsByline: Analysis by Ben Westcott, CNNDateline: (CNN) Body             "The United States does not have the qualification to speak to China."As far as slogans go, it's not necessarily the catchiest. But the phrase, along with several others uttered by top Chinese diplomat Yang Jiechi during heated talks with the US earlier this month, has become an unlikely fashion hit in China, appearing on T-shirts, phone cases and other items.The arrival of the T-shirts on Chinese e-commerce sites -- just hours after Yang traded barbs with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Alaska -- captures the changing mood in Beijing, as policy makers signal a new willingness to push back against criticism of alleged human rights abuses, particularly those centered on Xinjiang.In recent days, China has leveled reciprocal sanctions against the United Kingdom and the European Union, targeting lawmakers and academics, which it accused of "maliciously spreading lies and disinformation" regarding Beijing's treatment of Uyghur Muslims.China's so-called "wolf warrior" diplomats and state media have attacked Western governments online, rallying against what they term "hypocritical double standards," while drawing attention to the West's own legacy of historical injustice.And all this has come as the government appears to be stoking a new wave of online nationalism.Major European clothing label H&M was pulled from several e-commerce stores in China on Thursday after the ruling Communist Party's youth organization highlighted a months-old company statement speaking out against allegations of forced labor connected to Xinjiang's cotton industry.Other businesses, including Nike, Adidas and Burberry, were soon dragged into the social media outcry, amid calls for a nationwide boycott. Posts containing an "I support Xinjiang cotton" hashtag on China's Twitter-like platform, Weibo, have been read almost 5 billion times.In an editorial Friday, the editor of state-run tabloid Global Times, Hu Xijin, said the "battlefield" over Xinjiang could become the "frontline" in the ideological conflict between the US and China.With the 100th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party just months away, an apparent line has been drawn for those wishing to negotiate or do business with Beijing -- making clear that Western values are not necessarily compatible with access to the China market.Reset rollbackWhen US President Joe Biden took office in January, the Chinese government appeared to be publicly angling for a reset in relations.Under former US leader Donald Trump, tensions between Beijing and Washington rapidly escalated, with both sides imposing a series of retaliatory tariffs, sanctions and visa restrictions.At the same time, the Chinese government faced allegations of serious human rights abuses in Xinjiang, where Washington alleges up to 2 million people from Muslim minorities have been detained in a network of camps across the region. China denies the allegations, insisting the camps are voluntary "vocational training centers" designed to stamp out religious extremism and terrorism.The reset Beijing hoped for never came. Shortly before the Alaska meeting, the US announced new sanctions against officials in Hong Kong over the Chinese government's crackdown on civil liberties in the global financial hub. At the meeting in Alaska on Thursday, US and Chinese officials feuded in front of the media.On Monday, the US, Canada, UK and EU all announced targeted sanctions against Chinese officials in Xinjiang. In a joint statement, the grouping decried China's alleged "use of forced labor, mass detention in internment camps, forced sterilizations, and the concerted destruction of Uyghur heritage."In the wake of the Alaska meeting and new sanctions, Chinese officials and state media have escalated their attempts to deflect criticism by highlighting alleged human rights abuses in Western countries.On Tuesday, Global Times published a list of "European countries' misdeeds on human rights," which included a reference to the continent's ongoing migrant crisis, as well as the Holocaust, in which more than 6 million Jews died at the hands of the Nazi Germany regime in concentration camps across Europe.At a news conference on Thursday, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying claimed the US was a far worse violator of human rights than China. "We hope that the US side and its Western allies will abandon hypocrisy, arrogance and double standards, face up to their own human rights issues, and take concrete actions to improve and protect human rights," she said.And in a post to its official Twitter account Friday, state-run news agency Xinhua compared allegations of forced labor in cotton production in Xinjiang to the former use of slavery in the US.Patriotism blowbackWith political tensions again running high, business is among the few remaining bridges between the two sides. On Thursday, that too began to buckle under political pressure.A post from the Communist Youth League, the Party's youth wing, highlighted a statement by Swedish clothing giant H&M from September where the company said it was "deeply concerned" over reports of human rights abuses in Xinjiang, specifically around allegations of forced labor in the production of cotton.H&M had its products pulled from e-commerce stores, and Chinese celebrities quickly dropped out of sponsorship agreements with the company under pressure from those online.Social media users helped to track down other Western brands that had previously voiced concerns about alleged human rights issues in Xinjiang, with the backlash spreading to include Nike, Adidas and Uniqlo.China is less than a year away from hosting the 2022 Winter Olympics, and brands and participants will likely be looking on with trepidation at the apparent dilemma they now face: speak out against alleged human rights abuses and face a boycott in China. Stay silent, and risk blowback at home.On Thursday, Japanese chain Muji appeared to change the labeling on its online store in China to highlight the cotton came from Xinjiang.Global Times editor Hu said it was right for Chinese internet users to express their patriotism. "Let us mobilize various forces, give full play to their specific strengths and fight a people's war to safeguard our sovereignty and dignity creatively," he said in his editorial Friday.The backlash is reminiscent of previous bursts of nationalistic fervor that have swept the country. In 2012, there were large -- and at times violent -- protests in China targeting Japanese stores and cars, amid a dispute between the two countries over the ownership of isolated islands.In 2017, 23 stores from South Korean supermarket chain Lotte were closed in China after protests over the installation of a US-made THAAD missile defense system.In the past, however, diplomats and officials have usually presented a calm front in a bid to quell the patriotic anger and prevent major diplomatic and economic damage. This time around, the rise of "wolf warrior" diplomacy makes such a possibility seem less likely."The Chinese people wouldn't allow foreigners to reap benefits in China on the one hand, and smear China on the other ... we reject any malicious attack on China and even attempts to undermine China's interests on the basis of rumors and lies," said Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying on Thursday, referring to the H&M boycott.The campaign online was "not nationalism" added Hua, rather it was "simply patriotism."                      Analysis by Ben Westcott, CNN         TM & © 2021 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

China promotes Covid-19 origin theories: 'Virus came out of US military lab'CE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 25, 2021 MondayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 903 wordsBodyCHINA.- While the ruler of the Chinese Communist Party faces questions about China's vaccines and further criticism of his initial management of the pandemic, the authorities respond by fueling minority theories that some experts say might be harmful.Chinese state media have also expressed doubts about Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine and whether it could be lethal to the elderly; a spokeswoman for the Government of China suggests that the coronavirus may have left a U.S. military lab.In this regard, state media and officials report doubts about Western vaccines and the origin of the coronavirus in an apparent attempt to deflect attacks, so the two issues arouse interest due to the global deployment of vaccines and the recent arrival of a WHO team in Wuhan, China, to investigate the origins of the virus.Although statements may seem strange abroad, efforts are directed at a more receptive audience in China. The "American's Ft. Detrick" social media label, initiated by the Communist Youth League, was seen at least 400 million times last week, after a Foreign Ministry spokesman called for a WHO investigation into maryland's bio weapons lab.Its goal is to deflect blame for the Chinese government's mismanagement in the early days of the pandemic from a US conspiracy, said Fang Shimin, a writer currently based in the United States and known for exposing false qualifications and other scientific fraud in China. The strategy is quite successful because of the widespread anti-American sentiment in China.Yuan Zeng, an expert in Chinese media at Leeds University in the United Kingdom, commented that government stories are so far spread that even well-trained Chinese friends have asked her if they can be true.Continuing to spread conspiracy doubts and theories can increase public health risks while governments are trying to clear suspicions around vaccines, he said. "That's very, very dangerous," Yuan Zeng added.Meanwhile, Chinese state media have called for an investigation into the deaths of 23 elderly people in Norway after receiving the Pfizer vaccine, in this regard, a host of CGTN, the English-language channel of state CCTV television, and the Global Times newspaper have accused Western media of ignoring the news.In response, health experts said non-vaccine deaths may occur during mass immunization campaigns, and a WHO committee determined that the vaccine did not contribute to deaths in Norway.Following a report by researchers in Brazil that the effectiveness of a Chinese vaccine was lower than advertised; Experts initially stated that the Sinovac drug was 78 percent effective, but scientists then reduced it to 50.4 percent after including cases with mild symptoms.After the news was published in Brazil, researchers at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, a group of government-supported studies, reported an increase in vaccine misinformation in the Chinese media.Articles on sites such as popular science and health blogs have thoroughly studiedquestions about the effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine, prompting an opinion column this month in the British Medical Journal that raised doubts about the data from its clinical trials."It's very embarrassing for the government," Fang said in an email. As a result, China is trying to sow doubts about Pfizer's vaccine to cleanse its image and promote its vaccines, he said.Also, senior Chinese government officials have expressed their concerns about mRNA vaccines developed by Western pharmaceutical companies without regard, using a newer technology than the traditional strategy employed by today's Chinese vaccines.Gao Fu, director of the Chinese Centers for Disease Control, said he could not rule out the negative side effects of mRNA vaccines. Noting that this is the first time they have been given to healthy people, "there are safety concerns."As will be remembered, WHO's mission has rekindled persistent criticism that China allowed the virus to expand globally by reacting too slowly at first, and even rebuked doctors who tried to warn the population. Visiting researchers will begin their fieldwork this week after completing their 14 days of quarantine.In turn, the Communist Party sees WHO research as a political risk because it focuses attention on the Chinese response, said Jacob Wallis, senior analyst at the Australian Institute of Strategic Policy.The party wants to "distract national and international audiences by preemptively distorting the message about where responsibility lies for the appearance of Covid-19," Wallis said.Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying launched the conversation last week calling for WHO research on the US military lab. The place had previously been mentioned by CGTN and other state-controlled media.If the United States respects the truth, then please open Ft. Detrick and make public more information about the 200 or more biological laboratories outside the United States, and please allow the WHO expert group to go to the United States to investigate the origins.Moreover, China is not the only government that points to others. Former U.S. President Donald Trump said last year in an attempt to deflect responsibility for his management of the pandemic that he had seen evidence that the virus came from a lab in Wuhan. Although this theory has not been definitively dismissed, many experts believe it is unlikely. With excerpts of information from El FinancieroLoad-Date: January 26, 2021End of Document

China targets Silicon Valley to dominate tech marketCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 23, 2021 TuesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 837 wordsBodyThey began by infiltrating the Communist Party into American companies based in China and by bringing experts to China to showcase their knowledge. Xi Jinping's communist regime targets start-ups but also silicon valley corporations.The goal remains in place: to acquire advanced technology from the United States. From there it is named after AXT Inc., an American-based company dedicated to the design and manufacture of semiconductor substrates. These are used to manufacture chips used in almost all electronic devices.By May 2018, he would have signed a contract with the Dingxing County government in China's Hebei Province, according to documents obtained by The Epoch Times. The contract between the company and the government would establish several conditions according to that means:• Dingxing's government promised to support the development of AXT Dingxing through "national policies" and provincial regulations.• AXT would invest more in research, development and send more specialists to work at Dingxing.• AXT Dingxing would establish a postdoctoral research station, which would focus on new technological innovations."Made in China 2025"The Asian country's route is embodied in "Made in China 2025", a political-economic plan presented by China in 2015 to ensure industry growth. The idea is to increase the national content of basic materials to 40% by 2020 and to 70% by 2025.It focuses not on simple manufactures, but on high-tech ones such as the aerospace, robotics, computer science, pharmaceutical and semiconductor industries. The latter is precisely the market of AXT Inc. co-founded by Taiwanese-American Morris Young in Fremont, California, in 1986.Currently all its manufacturing is carried out in China, including a factory in Dingxing, which is called Baoding Tongmei Crystal Manufacturing (AXT Dingxing), according to the report. A register of Internet-enabled Chinese companies reads that AXT Dingxing established that factory in July 2017 with more than $29 million.However, the plan will not end in 2025. On the contrary, it will be only the first phase, in which China hopes to be listed as a global manufacturing power. Phase two, from 2026 to 2035 will be to position itself at an average level. Phase Three, from 2036 to 2049, China wants to become the world's leading manufacturing country.The government's millionaire economic boost was reflected in a note published by the Chinese government's State Council. From 2016 to 2020 he intensified the investment with $1.5 billion.Influence in Silicon ValleyIn addition to the deal with AXT Inc., a 2018 visit to Silicon Valley and Toronto of a Chinese official named Li Baosen broke down in the documents. The invitation would have been issued by David C. Lee, CEO of Globaleur, a travel software provider based on artificial intelligence.After his visit, Baosen, who is director of the high-tech zone management committee in the city of Baoding, informed baoding city government that he visited and discussed possible cooperation with Globaleur, Dilili Labs Inc., R2.ai, Luxena Pharmaceuticals Inc., Maykke and Lifeliqe, and visited the Hewlett-Packard, Nvidia, Google and Apple campus, adding The Epoch Times.In his report he added that he wanted to invite these companies to open headquarters in Baoding. They also open "innovation centers" in Silicon Valley and Toronto, Canada.From PepsiCo to NASASeveral cases of Chinese intervention in the U.S. have jumped in recent months. The list is varied and goesfrom politics to technology.A Justice Department report reported that a NASA employee admitted links to a Chinese program aimed at attracting foreign talent under unusual hiring conditions.Scientist Meyya Meyyappan had not revealed his participation in a Chinese regime recruitment program called the "Thousand Talent Program" that led him to give talks on nanotechnology at universities in China. By 2018, this technique would have recruited 8000 experts. On par with his work at NASA, he gave these government-funded talks. He had similar commitments at a South Korean university since 2009 and at a university in Japan since 2013.Months earlier, it had become known how Chinese Communist Party (PCCh) militants are part of the IBM, PepsiCo and 3M payrolls, which are based in the country ruled by Xi Jinping. This technique of incorporating party sympathizer into foreign companies is not new. By 2016, the PCCh would have joined supporters in around 75000 foreign companies in China.In addition, China is already working on the development of 6G technology that will provide higher download speed and a whole catalogue of possibilities that would be rated in fiction. The fact, more than positive, could lead to mistrust in countries that have already avoided adopting the 5G network, whose market is dominated by more than two-thirds by Chinese companies.At this time, MWC Shanghai 2021 is held, the technology event of the year in Asia where you will see advances in artificial intelligence, connected industry and innovations.Load-Date: February 24, 2021End of Document

CHINA TO CHRISTIANS: WE'RE REWRITING THE BIBLE, AND YOU'LL USE IT OR ELSEStates News ServiceFebruary 10, 2021 WednesdayCopyright 2021 States News ServiceLength: 908 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the Family Research Council (FRC):Arielle Del Turco is Assistant Director at the Center for Religious Liberty at Family Research Council. This article appeared in The Federalist on October 26, 2020.When a Chinese Christian, Chen Yu, was caught boldly selling religious publications not authorized by the government, his punishment was a seven-year prison sentence and an approximately $30,000 USD fine, handed down by a court last month.Such steep punishment for promoting and adhering to a religion is all too common in China today. Faith is increasingly under attack in President Xi Jinpings China. As religious expression becomes more dangerous there, people around the world should be speaking up in defense of Chinas persecuted believers.In addition to Chens fine and imprisonment, the court ordered local police in the Zhejiang province to destroy 12,864 religious books from his online bookstore. Make no mistakethis is a regime that is deeply afraid of the growth of Christianity.The estimated 100 million Christians in China make the eradication of Christianity from China difficult. Chairman Mao tried and was unsuccessful. President Xi prefers a more subtle tactic than Maos, a campaign to Sinicize religion to make it more compatible with the teachings of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).One way China seeks to Sinicize Christianity is by re-writing the Bible. A complete communist translation has yet to be revealed. The news of one chapters government-approved revision left Christians outraged last month.A textbook for a class on professional ethics and law at the government-run University of Electronic Science and Technology Press quotes the Bibles book of John, chapter eight. In this passage, an adulterous woman is brought to Jesus, and her accusers ask if she should be killed by stoning for her sins.In every authentically translated version of scripture, Jesus responds, Let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her. These words disperse the angry crowd, and Jesus tells the woman, Go, and from now on sin no more (ESV).The Chinese Communist Partys version takes a different turn. In this telling, the crowd leaves, but Jesus tells the woman, I too am a sinner. But if the law could only be executed by men without blemish, the law would be dead. Then Jesus proceeds to stone the woman.The Partys distortion of scripture whereby the Savior kills a woman is offensive and defamatory. That the CCP made this change is revealing. The Partys story teaches that forgiveness, an important Christian value is rejected and the law must be obeyed without question. In China, the law is whatever the CCP says.While China may technically allow Christianity, it only allows a version of Christianity remade in the image of the CCP. These developments, among many others, make this a critical time in the history of religion in China. On Friday, the Vatican officially renewed its controversial deal with Beijing from 2018, making it even more so.The secret agreement between the Vatican and Beijing in 2018 gave the officially atheist Chinese government a role in bishop appointments, while Chinas burgeoning religious oppression was overlooked. The aim of this deal may be admirable to unify the Catholic Church in China, long divided between underground Catholics loyal to the Holy See and those belonging to the government-approved Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association. Despite the agreement, however, two years later, conditions have not improved for Catholics or any other religious adherents in China.In September, reports surfaced that Chinese authorities tortured a 46-year-old priest in the Fujian province for refusing to join the state-approved Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association. The torture method allegedly included shining a bright light into his eyes for days and repeatedly banging a gong beside his ear. In July, bishops and priests from the unregistered Catholic Diocese of Yujiang, in Jiangxi province, claimed that Chinese authorities had prohibited any pastoral activity, and several priests were forced to undergo patriotic training.After China lifted COVID-19 lockdown restrictions in June, some Catholic priests were instructed that Mass could resume, as long as they preached patriotism. Keep in mind patriotism in China means loyalty to the CCP. Catholics reluctant to join the state-approved church, which is often influenced by Party-approved teachings, are under more pressure than in previous years.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has urged the Vatican to speak to Beijing about religious freedom in China. During a speech in Rome last month, he emphasized the impact a pope, the worlds most influential faith leader, can make, pointing to the example of Pope John Paul II, who played a pivotal role in igniting the revolution of conscience that brought down the Iron Curtain. For Catholic human rights activists like Benedict Rogers, Pope Francis lack of interest in publicly speaking up for believers in China is disappointing.Christians in China who refuse to bend to the Communist Partys agenda are under intense pressure. Government restrictions are growing tighter, and Chinas capacity to surveil and control its population is unprecedented. As it grows more dangerous for them to express their faith in the face of government crackdowns, it is left to the rest of the world to speak in defense of believers in China.Load-Date: February 10, 2021End of Document

Google celebrates epidemiologist Wu Lien-teh's birthplace with lively doodleCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 10, 2021 WednesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 362 wordsBodyToday's doodle celebrates the 142nd birthday of Chinese-Bad Epidemiologist Dr. Wu Lien-teh, who invented a surgical cover for the face, considered the precursor to the current and much-needed N95 mask.Wu Lien-teh was born into a family of Chinese immigrants in Penang, Malaya (present-day Malaysia) on March 10, 1879. Wu became the first student of Chinese descent to earn a doctorate in medicine from the University of Cambridge. After his studies, he accepted a position as deputy director of the Faculty of Medicine of the Imperial Army of China in 1908.In 1910, an unknown epidemic hit northwest China. The Chinese government decided to appoint Wu to investigate the disease, which it identified as the most important of the time. These were contagious pneumonic plague, transmitted from person to person by airway.To deal with the disease, Wu designed and manufactured a special surgical mask with cotton and gauze, to which he added several layers of fabric to filter out the inhalations. In addition to advising people to wear their newly invented mask, he worked with government officials to establish quarantine stations and hospitals, restrict travel, and apply progressive sterilization techniques.Thanks to his leadership he was able to placate this pandemic, known as the plague of Manchuria, in April 1911, after four months of being tasked with controlling its spread.Wu founded the Chinese Medical Association in 1915, the largest and oldest non-governmental medical organization in China. In 1935, he was the first Malay, and the first person of Chinese descent, to be nominated for a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work to control pneumonic plague.His illustrious life culminated after suffering a heart attack. He died on 20 January 1960, aged 81. The loss was lamented by the international medical community. Not only is he recognized as the father of modern medicine in China, he is also remembered as a devoted advocate and practitioner of scientific-medical advancement, but in vain his efforts changed public health in China and around the world to this day."Happy birthday to the man behind the mask, Dr. Wu Lien-teh!" greets Google.Load-Date: March 11, 2021End of Document

U.S. and China Relations: Rising to New Global ChallengesPR NewswireJanuary 28, 2021 Thursday 10:12 AM ESTCopyright 2021 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1248 wordsDateline: HONG KONG, Jan. 28, 2021 BodyPR Newswire Global leaders and experts agree that China and the United States remains the world's most crucial relationship, and the two must work together to combat global challenges. During a three day virtual forum"US-China Relations: The Way Forward", hosted by the China-U.S. Exchange Foundation (CUSEF) and the China Center for International Economic Exchanges (CCIEE), speakers examined the new and existing global challenges facing U.S.-China relations and the key areas that the two countries will need to focus on including fighting COVID-19, climate change, and cybersecurity.2020 was a year of unprecedented turmoil. The pandemic sent humanity a message: the world is fundamentally changing, and the U.S. and China are more successful combating these challenges together rather than apart. The high level forum gathered panelists including Carlos Gutierrez, Former U.S. Secretary of Commerce, Zeng Peiyan, Chairman of CCIEE, Yasuo Fukuda, Former Prime Minister of Japan, Steven Chu, Nobel Laureate in Physics & Former U.S. Secretary of Energy and Tung Chee-hwa, Vice Chairman of the 13th CPPCC National Committee & Chairman of the China United States Exchange Foundation, amongst over 40 other senior business leaders, current and past government officials, and renowned scholars.The ongoing U.S.-China trade war along with the fiscal hardships exacerbated by the pandemic is expected to plunge the world into a recession unlike anything seen since World War II. The distinguished speakers asked to reconsider the rhetoric issued by leaders, noting COVID-19 is a virus not isolated by borders. Executive Vice President and Head of International Affairs for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Myron Brilliant stated that COVID-19 is not a U.S. pandemic, nor a Chinese pandemic, but rather a global emergency that will be eradicated only by collaboration and contribution from the world's two biggest and most innovative economies. Economic and trade experts attested for a dire need to salvage and redefine the complex U.S.-China relationship, predicting that collaboration could hasten economic recovery. Xu Bu, President of the China Institute of International Studies, acknowledged that the U.S. and Chinese economies are more complementary than competitive, and should act accordingly. Only through allowing transparency and partnership will scientists be able to continue to make significant progress in areas imperative to global health that include research and development, the COVID-19 vaccine, and prevention of future pandemics.Michael Spence, Nobel Laureate in Economics and Philip H. Knight Professor Emeritus of Management in the Graduate School of Business at Stanford University, analyzed how the Trump administration's efforts to isolate China involuntarily compelled China to begin transforming themselves, accelerating the shift of the global economy to Asia. "Whether it is short term or long term, this kind of pressure put on Chinese companies forced them to innovate themselves, and they became the true winners. Just like the U.S. wants to invest in China, Chinese companies want to invest in the United States," Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at CCIEE Zhang Xiaoqiang observed. While many admired the transformation, it is essential for both countries to be more inclusive and re-establish people to people exchanges, as partnerships could lead to beneficial advancements in areas of education, tourism, civil institutions, and think tanks.According to the President of the National Committee on United States-China Relations Stephen Orlins, "people to people relationships are the foundation of our political relationship. It's going to determine how and whether that relationship creates a more secure and prosperous world." To do this, he recommended both China and the U.S. open its borders to each other on every level. This includes reopening the consulates in Houston and Chengdu and restoring the U.S. Fulbright Program in China, which David Firestein, President and CEO of the George H.W. Bush Foundation for U.S.-China Relations reaffirmed.Aside from the pandemic, we continue to face other world challenges such as terrorism, natural disasters, and climate change. Competition is healthy both in technology and science, but ultimately, these areas should be based on rules and directed towards positive results that benefit all. Technology lies at the heart of all these challenges and will play an integral part in finding the solutions. Among the speakers who asserted the importance of cooperation and honest exchange in the technology discussion, there were six business leaders of large corporations in China who participated."Not just by words, but by deeds," proclaimed former U.S. Ambassador to China and former U.S. Senator from Montana, Max Baucus. In his opinion, it will be difficult for students and politicians to visit China until each country indicates to the other the fact that they want to work with each other by actions. Yet, hope is on the horizon. Though the future of the U.S.-China relationship remains uncertain, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs Wang Chao expressed his confidence in the foundation of U.S.-China relations "built through our joint efforts over generations." Mr. Wang added that goodwill shall remain unchanged and optimism will prevail regarding people to people exchanges.Tung Chee-hwa, Vice Chairman of the 13th CPPCC National Committee & Chairman of the China United States Exchange Foundation, ended the forum on a positive note: "Indeed, our many speakers and panelists have pointed out what should be done. If I were to summarize their thoughts expressed in these three days...return to the dialogue table, restore respect and trust, allow competition and cooperation to coexist. Let's work together now. The road is not easy, but together we will find a way."Note to Editors:About the China - United States Exchange FoundationThe China-United States Exchange Foundation (CUSEF) is an independent, non-profit and non-governmental foundation committed to the belief that a positive and peaceful relationship between the strongest developed nation and the most populous, fast-developing nation is essential for global wellbeing.

China/EU.- China responds to EU sanctions with a blacklist of 14 politicians and entitiesCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 22, 2021 MondayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 386 wordsBodyThe President of the Eurochamber warns that they are "unacceptable" measures and "will have consequences"   MADRID, 22 (EUROPA PRESS)   The Government of China has announced sanctions against ten politicians and four EU entities in retaliation for the punishments agreed on Monday by the foreign ministers of the Community bloc, as it believes they are based on "lies and misinformation" about the situation in the Xinjiang region.   China's Foreign Ministry believes that the EU "distorts facts, seriously interferes in China's internal affairs, flagrantly violates international law and the basic rules governing international relations, and seriously impairs bilateral relations."   "The Chinese government is determined to safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests," which is why it has blacklisted a number of politicians, including German MEPs Reinhard Butikofer and Michael Gahler, Frenchman Raphael Glucksmann, Bulgarian Ilhan Kyuchyuk and Slovakia's Miriam Lexmann.   The punishments also extend to national parliaments, with measures against Dutch MP Sjoerd Wiemer Sjoerdsma, Belgian Samuel Cogolati and Lithuanian Dovile Sakaliene, as well as academics such as Germany's Adrian Zenz and Swede Bjorn Jerdén.   In institutional matters, Beijing is acting against the Eu Council's Policy and Security Committee, the Eurochamber Subcommittee on Human Rights, the Mercator Institute for Chinese Studies of Germany and the Alliance of Democracies Foundation of Denmark.   Sanctions involve travel restrictions and trade relations, and with them Beijing urges the EU to "reflect" on "the seriousness of its mistake." "You must end the hypocritical practice of double standards and stop moving forward on that wrong path. Otherwise, China will not hesitate to take further reactions," the Ministry has warned in its note.EU RESPONSE   The President of the European Parliament, David Sassoli, has expressed his unease at the sanctions imposed by China, on the ground that "human rights are inalienable rights" and that they are punishing individuals and entities "for expressing opinions in the exercise of their democratic duty."   "China's sanctions against euros, the subcommittee on human rights and EU agencies are unacceptable and will have consequences," he said on his Twitter account.Load-Date: March 23, 2021End of Document

Reps. Rodgers, Rush Urge Commerce Secretary Raimondo to Secure U.S. Innovation and Emerging Technology LeadershipTargeted News ServiceMarch 13, 2021 Saturday 8:50 AM  ESTCopyright 2021 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 600 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyRep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Washington, ranking Republican member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, issued the following news release on March 12, 2021:Republican Leader of the Energy and Commerce Committee Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) and Democratic Chair of the Energy Subcommittee Bobby Rush (D-IL) sent a letter today urging Secretary of Commerce Gina M. Raimondo to address the need for increased U.S. leadership in the innovation and deployment of emerging technologies. Last year, Energy and Commerce led the way in enacting the American Competitiveness Of a More Productive Emerging Tech Economy (COMPETE) Act, which provides a unique role for the Secretary of Commerce to plot a path for America to beat China in emerging technologies.Excerpts from the letter:"During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen just how helpful and impactful these emerging technologies can be. Artificial intelligence (AI) is helping to stem the tide of scams and misinformation being shared across the internet. AI also is helping to develop automated driving systems that are delivering essential goods to families in need with contactless delivery. Blockchain technologies offer innovative solutions to secure consumer privacy, and three-dimensional (3-D) printing is being used to address shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE)."That is why, last year, we passed H.R. 8132, the 'American Competitiveness Of a More Productive Emerging Tech Economy (COMPETE) Act.' With unanimous approval in the Committee on Energy and Commerce and then on the House floor, the "American COMPETE Act" was included in the "Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021," enacted at the end of the Congress. The legislation provides a unique role for the Secretary of Commerce to plot a path for U.S. competitiveness for emerging technologies. The Secretary is asked to look at the state of AI, quantum computing, blockchain, new and advanced materials, Internet of Things (IoT), IoT manufacturing, 3-D printing, as well as unmanned delivery systems, and then report recommendations to Congress."We are looking forward to hearing from you on how we can grow the U.S. economy through the advancement of these technologies, develop national strategies to advance the U.S. global position on these technologies, develop strategies to mitigate current and emerging risks to the marketplace and supply chains of these technologies, and how to incentivize expeditious adoption of such technologies."As you know, the U.S. is at risk of losing our competitive advantage in these sectors to China. The Chinese government launched 'Made in China 2025,' a strategy to surpass our advanced technology industries. Through 'Made in China 2025,' China is looking to continue to further bridge together manufacturing and smart technologies through IoT and become the global leader in the space. China also is predicted to outmatch the U.S. in blockchain innovation and deployment and become the global leader of the technology. Last year, the Chinese government launched the Blockchain-based Service Network, a platform led by China's State Information Center aimed at providing small and medium sized enterprises the ability to use the technology and build decentralized apps - not only in China, but all over the globe. Maintaining U.S. leadership in these technologies is essential for our American economic security."CLICK HERE (https://republicans-energycommerce.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.12.21-COMPETE-Letter-DoC-Secretary-Raimondo-.pdf) to read the letter.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7418031 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: March 13, 2021End of Document

CHINA IN TIGHTENED SECURITY CLAMPDOWN IN TIBET'S CAPITAL LHASA AND ON THE BORDERStates News ServiceMarch 1, 2021 MondayCopyright 2021 States News ServiceLength: 687 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Chinese authorities in Tibet are tightening security and carrying out arrests in the regional capital Lhasa and along Tibet's border with Nepal in the run-up to a month of politically sensitive anniversaries beginning in March, sources in the region say.Among those taken into custody are Tibetans suspected of sharing information on the deaths of Chinese soldiers killed in a border clash with India last June in the Galwan Valley of Ladakh, a source in Lhasa told RFA's Tibetan Service on Monday.The Chinese government has increased these arrests and crackdowns in Lhasa and in border areas, RFA's source said, speaking on condition of anonymity. And those who are suspected of exchanging information regarding the deaths of the Chinese soldiers on the border are immediately arrested.They have also deployed more blue-uniformed soldiers in Lhasa and in [Shigatse prefecture's] Nyalam county, an area located along the mountainous border with Nepal, the source said, adding, and authorities are stepping up their checks on the use of social media in Tibet these days.Chinese authorities in Tibet maintain tight controls over information flows in the region, arresting Tibetans for sharing news and opinions on social media and for contacting relatives living in exile, sometimes with news of anti-China protests, according to rights groups and other experts.Particular targets of censors and police are images of exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama shared on mobile phones and calls for the preservation of the Tibetan language, now under threat from government orders to establish Chinese as the main language of instruction in Tibetan schools.'More restrictions in place'China does not want reports of conditions inside Tibet to spread outside the country, Tsewang Dorjee, a researcher at the Dharamsala, India-based Tibet Policy Institute, told RFA.And with March 10, observed by Tibetans around the world as National Uprising Day, approaching in just a few days, the authorities are putting more restrictions in place and cracking down even harder on Tibetans," Dorjee said.And not only in Tibet, but also in China, the government has imposed tighter restrictions all around because there have been more criticisms from citizens on how the Chinese Communist Party handled the border dispute, he said.Though India quickly acknowledged the names and numbers of its dead on the border, China did not comment on its own casualties until September, Dorjee said.Politically sensitive anniversariesChina regularly tightens security in Tibet's regional capital Lhasa and in other Tibetan areas of China during important political gatherings in Beijing and in March, a month of politically sensitive anniversaries.On March 10, 1959, Tibetans in Lhasa rose up in protest of Beijing's tightening political and military control of the formerly independent Tibet, sparking a rebellion in which thousands were killed.And on March 14, 2008, a riot in Lhasa followed the suppression by Chinese police of four days of peaceful Tibetan protests and led to the destruction of Han Chinese shops in the city and deadly attacks on Han Chinese residents.The riot then sparked a wave of mostly peaceful protests against Chinese rule that spread across Tibet and into Tibetan-populated regions of western Chinese provinces, and hundreds of Tibetans were detained, beaten, or shot as Chinese security forces quelled the protests.Formerly an independent nation, Tibet was invaded and incorporated into China by force nearly 70 years ago, and the Dalai Lama and thousands of his followers fled into exile in India and other countries around the world following the failed 1959 uprising against Chinese rule.Chinese authorities maintain a tight grip on the region, restricting Tibetans' political activities and peaceful expression of cultural and religious identity, and subjecting Tibetans to persecution, torture, imprisonment, and extrajudicial killings.Reported by Lobsang Gelek for RFA's Tibetan Service.

How a Chinese website for pirated TV shows became a cultural touchstone for millennialsCNN WireMarch 3, 2021 Wednesday 1:46 AM GMTCopyright 2021 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 2115 wordsByline: By Nectar Gan, CNN BusinessDateline: (CNN) Body             When Bill Liang realized that popular video download and streaming service Renren Yingshi might be gone for good his heart sank.The website, also known as YYeTs.com, was how the 24-year-old film school student was able to watch hundreds of episodes of pirated American TV shows when he was growing up in northern China.But the site - one of China's largest, longest-running and last-remaining destinations for pirated, subtitled foreign content - was shuttered on February 3 as part of a sweeping police clampdown on piracy. While the website is still live, none of its services work anymore."I was heartbroken when I found out," Liangtold CNN Business. "I feel like there is one place fewer in China through which we can expand our horizons."Police in Shanghai arrested 14 people they claim ran the website and app after a three-month investigation into suspected intellectual property infringement. At the time of its closure, Renren Yingshi had amassed over eight million registered users and was home to more than 20,000 pirated TV shows and movies. The site's operators made some 16 million yuan ($2.5 million) in the past couple of years from ads, subscription fees,and selling hard drives loaded with pirated content, according to police.Renren Yingshi did not respond to a request for comment from CNN Business.The crackdown was lauded by state media and intellectual property experts as a sign of China's resolve to enforce copyright protection - criticism over which has dogged Beijing for years.But it also drew a wave of backlash from fans who, like Liang,had long relied on the site for uncensored foreign content.An outpouring of support for Renren Yingshi dominated China's Twitter-like Weibo platform in the days after the crackdown. Some thanked the site for "opening a door for us to the world."The public outcry came, at least in part, because of how tightly the Chinese government restricts access to foreign content. It is one of only four countries or regions, alongside North Korea, Syria and Crimea, that doesn't allow access to Netflix, the world's most-popular streaming platform, for example.China also strictly limits how many foreign films can be screened in cinemas each year. And of the content that is allowed to air in the country, much is heavily censored.For Chinese millennials, watching foreign shows and movies is not only a favorite pastime - it's an opportunity to learn about the world. And many of them say the roadblocks imposed by the Chinese government leave them with little choice but to turn to pirated websites, even though they are willing to pay for legitimate access to uncensored, foreign content.While the demise of Renren Yingshi and the country's censorship crackdown suggests the status quo might not change, the reaction to its closure and the popularity of uncensored work shows that there remains a huge appetite for such content within China.Strict censorship rulesFounded in 2003 by a group of Chinese students in Canada, Renren Yingshi-a phrase that means "everyone's film and TV" - was born out of a desire to spread foreign TV shows and movies more widely within China.Young, internet-savvy Chinese were drawn to foreign content as China reformed its economy and opened up to the world. They found that such films and shows offered an edgier, more diverse alternative to the heavily censored content produced at home - as well as a way to learn about other cultures and societies.Getting access to that kind of content through legitimate means, though, is difficult in China.Since the early 1990s, authorities have allowed just a few dozen foreign films to be screened in the country each year - only nine of the 26 Oscar best picture winners were screened publicly in China from 1994 to 2019, for example.International streaming services, including Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime Video, have also been unable to crack the market. Netflix, for example, told shareholders in 2016 that the "regulatory environment for foreign digital content services" was "challenging" in China. A subsequent attempt to partner with a local company to distribute content failed.The content that is allowed to air in China, meanwhile, needs to meet strict guidelines. Movies or shows with controversial themes - such as those that depict China in a bad light, portray taboo subjects like the 1989 Tiananmen Massacre, or feature LGBTQ storylines - are kept out entirely. And since China lacks a film rating system, any content approved by Chinese regulators is heavily edited to remove certain scenes, such as graphic sex or violence.When the Oscar-winning Freddie Mercury biopic "Bohemian Rhapsody" was released in China in 2019, for example, any mention of the Queen singer's sexuality - as well as his AIDS diagnosis - was edited out.And the American blockbuster fantasy drama "Game of Thrones," which built its popularity on graphic sex and violence, was censored so heavily on Chinese streaming giant Tencent Video that some viewers complained that it was turned into a staid "medieval European castle documentary.""There were too many 'sensitive' scenes deleted that I could hardly understand the plot anymore -- it was so confusing," said a fan of the show who watched on Tencent Video. The fan asked to remain anonymous because she once helped translate shows for a website that featured pirated content, and she also spoke to CNN Business about that experience.There's little indication that these rules may change. Under Chinese President Xi Jinping, tolerance for foreign ideas and values has declined drastically. Popular Western culture is seen by Beijing as a key risk for foreign infiltration that targets Chinese youth - making such content important for the government to control.A long history of legal issuesThe sweeping restrictions have motivated fans of shows and movies that run afoul of censorship rules to subtitle them in Chinese and upload unauthorized copies online. They operate in loose networks of volunteer translators known as fansub groups.Renren Yingshi was among the largest of these networks, exploding in popularity as American series like "Prison Break," "The Big Bang Theory" and "Gossip Girl" became smash hits in China.Long before the latest crackdown, Renren Yingshi was running into trouble with authorities. In 2009, it wasone of more than 100 Chinese websitesshut down for "rectification" after the government issued rules that banned the dissemination of unapproved movies and TV shows on the Chinese internet.At the time, Renren Yingshi vowed to give upits video downloading service, and in 2010pivoted to translating open online courses offered by American universities. The strategy won the blessing of Chinese state media, which heralded the website as "a knowledge evangelist in the internet age."That love-in didn't last. The website eventually resumed offering pirated shows, and its servers were shut down by Chinese regulators in 2014, not long after the Motion Picture Association of America included Renren Yingshi on a list of pirate sites. It eventually popped back up, and at one point even moved its servers to South Korea for a time as it continued to look for ways to stay operational.Ultimately, Renren Yingshi's interest in making money might have led to its downfall. While it began as a volunteer endeavor, Renren Yingshi eventually started accepting advertisements on videos, and charged members to view its content."According to Chinese law, if copyright infringement was conducted for the purpose of making a profit, it is very easy to constitute a crime," said Xu Xinming, an intellectual property lawyer at Beijing Mingtai Law Firm.Xu noted that in China, a business needs to make just a few thousand dollars in order to run afoul of copyright crime laws - well short of the millions police claim Renren Yingshi raked in.It's not surprising, Xu says, that Beijing would want to go so hard against a platform with such a high profile. The government has worked harder over the last decade to address infringement, especially given Western accusations that copyright abuse runs rampant in the country.In 2020 alone, Chinese authorities shut down more than 2,800 websites and apps offering pirated content and deleted 3.2 million links, according to the most recent data available from the National Copyright Administration of China.'Using my love to generate power'It's not clear when the case may be resolved, though copyright infringement results in a punishment of up to seven years in prison, depending on the severity of the violation. Police in Shanghai did not respond to a request from CNN Business for more information on the case.No matter what happens to Renren Yingshi, though, it leaves behind a vast legacy of cultural exchange."Many friends around me have grown up watching American series. They gave us a lot of extra parameters in our way of thinking," said Lin, the Game of Thrones fan. She said shevolunteered for a fansub group in high school called"Garden of Eden." "If you've had so much exposure to different cultures, races and people from different backgrounds since a young age ... it is easier for you to be able to see things from another perspective."She said she was "using my love to generate power" - a phrase commonly cited by volunteers who want to emphasize that they are motivated by their passion for the shows, and not money.The translation work wasn't easy, Lin said."Every Friday, when the latest episode came out, the timer was on," said Lin, who translated episodes of the American supernatural teen drama "The Vampire Diaries," as well as sitcoms "The Big Bang Theory" and "Two Broke Girls."Someone in the United States or Canada would record the show and send it along with English subtitles. Teams would then divide the episode into 10-minute segments and assign them to translators."There was a lot of stuff I needed to look up," said Lin, adding that it took her about two hours to translate 10 minutes of video. "Sometimes the characters would tell a joke that I couldn't get, and I had to search for it online.""It was difficult because I had to use [Chinese search engine] Baidu within the Great Firewall," she said, referring to the government's sprawling internet censorship apparatus.The work of fansub volunteers has effectively acted as a fourth wave of "translation activity that has had a huge impact on Chinese culture," wrote Yan Feng, a professor of Chinese language and literature at Fudan University in Shanghai, in a widely shared Weibo post on February 3. By comparison, Yan said the other three major waves included thetranslation of Buddhist texts in ancient China, the translation of Western literature and social science works during the late Qing dynasty, and the translation of modern works on humanities and social sciences after the Cultural Revolution.For many Chinese millennials, fansub work is also a way to learn about the world. Many groups don't just do translation work - they also add footnotes explaining background and context for certain dialogue to help Chinese audiences better understand historic, political or cultural references."I think it's a good thing for a child to be exposed to different cultures and different ways of thinking growing up," said Joy Tian, a 23-year-old English teacher in Beijing. She said she was struck by the individualistic values at the center of many Western series and films, having grown up in a culture that emphasizes collectivism."It helps promote diversity of thought," she added.Xu, the Beijing-based lawyer, said it is up to the public to "do some self-reflection" following the crackdown on Renren Yingshi."There's no free lunch in this world, and they shouldn't download or stream pirate films and TV shows anymore,"he said.But Tian stressed that she'd be willing to pay for the shows if they were uncensored. After all, she has paid for licensed American shows on legitimate Chinese streaming sites before - but she couldn't get past all of the editing.Even Xu said that Chinese fans will likely continue to be tempted to watch pirated shows. People who watch such content and don't profit off of it have not, traditionally, been punished in China. And if the government doesn't ease up on its rules on content, the demand won't go away."This is indeed a problem. And as the government steps up its crackdown on copyright infringement, this problem will only become more acute," Xu said. "With pirated access cut off, [the government and companies] should compensate by broadening legal access."                      By Nectar Gan, CNN Business         TM & © 2021 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Beijing slams 'bullying' United States over Trump's order on Chinese appsStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeJanuary 9, 2021 SaturdayUniversity WireCopyright 2021 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: WORLD NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 532 wordsByline: Steven ClarkeBodyPresident Trump's executive ban on several Chinese apps could have big implications for US Companies in China, Macau and Taiwan. The order will have some impact on related Chinese companies, but more important, it will harm the interests of United States consumers and the interests of the United States, she said.A senior administration official said the order and its implementation have not been discussed with the "potential incoming Biden administration".Despite the 45-day timeline specified by the order, the Commerce Department intends to act before the 20 to identify prohibited transactions, a US official told Reuters.Hours after supporters of outgoing United States President Donald Trump ransacked the Capitol building, Global Times, a state-affiliated Chinese daily tabloid recalled a comment made by US Speaker Nancy Pelosi on the attack on Hong Kong's legislature building in 2019.An executive order has accused the Chinese government of using "bulk data collection" to compile information on U.S. citizens. The others named in the order are CamScanner, QQ Wallet, SHAREit, Tencent QQ, VMate and WPS Office.President Trump has issued an Executive Order banning United States transactions with a range of Chinese payment platform apps from February 18, 2021. The ministry alleges the order harms the interest of Chinese companies and their customers. However, the restrictions were blocked by courts on free speech concerns.On New Year's Eve, it was announced NYSE meant to delist China Telecom, China Mobile, and China Unicom Hong Kong in order to comply with the executive order.Sedition charge possible for pro-Trump riotersOne woman was fatally shot inside the Capitol, police say. "Some of them have to be held accountable for the carnage", she said. Capitol was unlike any I have ever experienced in my 30 years in law enforcement here in Washington , D.C.", he added.The U.S. has been trying to block Alipay's presence in the U.S. for months.Apps like WeChat Pay andAlipay have their biggest customer base in greater China and the number of users in the U.S. is relatively small.If the order goes into effect, the US Commerce Department will be responsible for deciding which transactions are prohibited, or Biden could, however, revoke the order on the first day of his presidency. It is 33% owned by Alibaba and controlled by Alibaba founder Jack Ma, but is now unavailable for American users.The latest move by the USA government highlights concerns similar to those raised by the Indian government when it banned 118 Chinese apps back in September, with the biggest name on the list being mobile gaming phenomenon PUBG Mobile and its Lite version.Tuesday's move is the latest in a raft of tough new curbs on Chinese companies.A previous order to the Commerce Department would bar transactions with ByteDance and Tencent - owners of TikTok and Tencent Music, respectively.This week, the New York Stock Exchange announced that it would delist the three Chinese telecom companies - China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom - that have also been included in White House executive orders and listed as having ties to China's military, according to the Wall Street Journal.Load-Date: January 10, 2021End of Document

DIALOGUE WITH MEDIA ABOUT CHINA'S XINJIANG --CONSUL GENERAL LU XU VIRTUALLY TALKED WITH CTV CALGARY FROM CHINESE CONSULATE GENERAL IN CALGARYStates News ServiceMarch 5, 2021 FridayCopyright 2021 States News ServiceLength: 831 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: BEIJING, China BodyThe following information was released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China:On Mar. 3, 2021, Chinese Consul General in Calgary Mme. LU Xu launched a dialogue with CTV Calgary online on Xinjiang- related issues.Here is what she said in her opening remarks:I guess what you saw today must be very different from what you had before. I won't argue here how far most of the western media have gone from the reality of Xinjiang, I would rather address why, and also why it won't work to stop China from doing what it thinks right.In my whole diplomatic career, I have travelled a lot out of China. I saw different countries with different histories and cultures. I have been posted in the US, the UK, Czechoslovakia, and Canada. All these years' experience and knowledge changed my view.In order to draw a right conclusion, we have to collect as much information as possible from different resources and put them together to review comprehensively. I found out sadly it is not the case while it should have been when most of the western media make reports about China.In the era of the internet and social media, it is not so difficult to get information about China from different resources, but unfortunately, they are not willing to take time to search and review other resources including those from China. The principle of listening to the voices from both sides to make a fair and independent decision or judgment or trying to be balanced should have applied to the media when they exercise their freedom of speech as an independent and fair power.Respect and understanding are preconditions for us to treat each other and build relationships upon. There are thousands of constructive ways to help the other to improve rather than labelling him with the appalling term based on conclusions coming from nowhere.Before talking about Xinjiang human rights protection, Mme. LU showed video clips and pictures about the terrorist attacks happened in Xinjiang and other Chinese cities.Mme. LU explained, saving lives from terrorist attacks since then became the top priority of human rights protection of the Chinese Government. The subsequent measures taken in Xinjiang are no more and no less than what Paris and London had taken after the terrorist attacks occurred there and were in line with the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy passed in 2006.From 2010 to 2018, the population of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang rose from 10.17 million to 12.75 million, an increase of 25%, which is higher than the 14% increase of the whole Xinjiang population and much higher than the increase of the Han population, which stood at 2%.Over the past 60 years and more, the average life expectancy of people in Xinjiang has grown from 30 to 72 years, and the GDP has grown 200 times. At the end of 2019, 3 million residents in Xinjiang stepped out of poverty.When people think about the above-mentioned figures, they will hardly draw a conclusion linked with "genocide".About the so-called detention camps", Mme. LU said, poverty nurtures extremism. To get out of poverty, people have to have some working skills and the ability to find a job. These are the main purposes of the Xinjiang educational centers. Better education is the most efficient and peaceful way to save those brainwashed from further obsessed with extremist ideology and violent mindset.About the so-called "forced labor", Mme. LU said, the Chinese Government does not have to "force" them to work. In the fastest-growing economy, if somebody doesn't work, he or she will be left behind. If he or she doesn't have a single skill, he or she will be challenged to get a job and a better and decent life. With such public awareness, why would the Government risk its governance and reputation in front of Chinese public and the rest of the world for things like "forced labor"?About the so-called "mistreatment towards the Uyghur women", Mme. LU said, the family planning policy has been carried out nationwide for several decades. When Han people in big cities could only have one child, the ethnic minorities, including Uyghurs, enjoyed a complete exemption where they could have as many children as they want. It remains the same now when Han people can have two according to the renewed family planning policy. In Western countries, people are reluctant to have kids once the economy is advanced to a certain extent. They even choose not to get married. Similar trends are also seen in China. In Xinjiang, women's status has been greatly improved in recent years. They are absolutely free to make decisions on bearing children. In order to keep the body curve, more and more women, including Uyghur women, choose cesarean section while giving birth.About the Parliament motion of "boycotting Beijing Winter Olympic Games", Mme. LU said, boycotting the Olympics simply because of different political views is opening a Pandora's box where anybody can boycott anything in this world according to this logic.Load-Date: March 8, 2021End of Document

Citigroup Releases Earnings; Mark Penn is Interviewed about the Biden Plan, Social Media, Ian Haworth is Interviewed on the Ongoing China Threat; Bernie's Budget Priorities; December Retail Sales; Alex Rodriguez is Interviewed about His Business VenturesMORNINGS WITH MARIA MORNINGS WITH MARIA 8:00 AM ESTJanuary 15, 2021 FridayCopyright 2021 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved Section: NEWS; InternationalLength: 6794 wordsByline: Maria Bartiromo, Cheryl Casone, Brian Brenberg, Dagen McDowell, Edward LawrenceGuests: Mark Penn, Ian Haworth, Stephanie Pomboy, Alex RodriguezBodyMARIA BARTIROMO, FBN ANCHOR: Welcome back. Good Friday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Friday, January 15th.Your top stories right now, 8:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast.Joe Biden unveiling a nearly $2 trillion pandemic relief plan but progressives still say it is not enough.Big banks driving the action on Wall Street this morning. JP Morgan reported better than expected numbers. However, expenses are higher and Jamie Dimon, the CEO, says consumer spending continues to recover. The bank has lots of room to further invest in its business. The stock nonetheless is lower.Wells Fargo fourth quarter coming in above expectations, but revenue was light. A Citigroup, the last of the major banks to report this morning, the stock this morning lower by a dollar a share ahead of its report.Markets this morning are looking at declines. We are expecting a decline right out of the gate this morning as we also await for retail sales numbers and the Producer Price Index coming up in 30 minutes' time. The Dow Industrials right now at the lows of the morning, down 175 points, the Nasdaq down 3, and the S&P 500 weaker by 16.This on top of declines across the board yesterday. In fact, at the close, 4:00 on Wall Street yesterday, Dow Industrials were down 69, the Nasdaq was down 16 and the S&P lower by 14.Well, the attack on free speech. Jack Dorsey's censorship mission caught on tape. In a leaked video, Dorsey suggests that the ban on President Trump will go way beyond just the president. And it will go way beyond one day.Be sure to tune in at 8:40 a.m. Eastern for my interview this morning with A-rod. Alex Rodriguez is here to discuss his latest investment, whether he's in the market to buy a major sports team and why he is looking at wellness as a growth industry.MORNINGS WITH MARIA is live right now.All right, Citigroup earnings are out. Take a look. The stock is down one and two-thirds percent.Cheryl Casone with the numbers for the fourth quarter.Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, this is the thing, Maria, because they actually had a pretty decent showing as far as earnings per share, again, like we just got from Wells Fargo. The estimate was $1.34. They came in at $2.08. But the revenue coming in a little bit weak here for Citigroup. $16.71 billion was the estimate. They came in at $16.5 billion. They still have about $25 billion they're setting aside for loan losses. Remember, they've got a very strong credit card business. That's one thing to watch.Also the fixed income market revenues, $3.1 billion. That was only about a 7 percent increase. You would have thought that would have come in a little bit stronger considering what the markets did.Also, Michael Corbat, the CEO, he's going to be retiring in a month. So this is his last quarterly report, if you will. And also the company saying that they're going to initiate, in the first quarter of 2021, buybacks. That does need board approval, but I can't imagine the board's going to say no to that. Anyway, we're watching Citigroup as well. That stock moving right now.Back to you.BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl, thank you so much.We are watching this market trade down 157 right now on the Dow Industrials.Now some of the top stories that we are watching this morning.Joe Biden, yesterday, unveiled his COVID relief plan. The nearly $2 trillion proposal includes more stimulus money for Americans and a nationwide vaccination effort. Biden says he wants to increase weekly unemployment benefits by $400 a week and give Americans $1,400 in stimulus. Also, he'd like to raise the minimum federal wage to $15 an hour.A left wing activist who claimed he traveled to Washington to document the siege on Capitol Hill is now facing charges for his involvement. This after new video shows John Sullivan encouraging people to storm the Capitol.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN SULLIVAN: We gotta -- we gotta burn this (EXPLETIVE DELETED). We've gotta to (EXPLETIVE DELETED).Oh, my God, we did (EXPLETIVE DELETED) it. We took this (EXPLETIVE DELETED).UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's our house.SULLIVAN: It's our house (EXPLETIVE DELETED).(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Sullivan posted several videos of the riots on YouTube, but did so under a different name on YouTube.Twitter's CEO, meanwhile, Jack Dorsey caught on tape. The attack on free speech continues. In a video linked by Project Veritas, Dorsey is seen and heard telling the company's 5,400 employees that the recent ban on the president is, quote, bigger than just one account, and that they must think about how the long-term dynamics play out over time. A Twitter spokesperson said that the leaked comments are nearly the same as Dorsey shared in recent tweets.Joe Biden unveiled his $1.9 trillion stimulus package proposal yesterday, including $1,400 direct payments, $400 weekly unemployment aid, $20 billion in a national vaccination program and increasing the federal wage -- the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, already criticizing the relief package saying it's not big enough.Joining me right now is former Clinton senior adviser, the CEO of MDC Partners and Stagwell Group president, managing partner, Mark Penn.Here with me all morning long this morning, Dagen McDowell and Brian Brenberg.Mark, it's great to see you this morning. Let me kick it off with you. Thanks for being here.First, your reaction to this $1.9 trillion proposal, a COVID relief program, which Joe Biden spoke about last night in a press conference, do you think this has any chance of passing a bipartisan Senate?MARK PENN, FORMER CLINTON SENIOR ADVISER, CEO OF MDC PARTNERS, AND PRESIDENT AND MANAGING PARTNER, STAGWELL GROUP: I do think it has a very good chance of passing. Maybe not in its complete entirety. But I think that it shows President elect Biden getting out there, strongly on the issues that people really want dealt with, which is the economy and the virus. And I think people thought that all sorts of other issues were going to be done first. I think he's making the right move here. I don't think it's going to get expand beyond that. But I do think that something will get passed.BARTIROMO: Let me move on to the attack on free speech, Mark. A leaked recording of the CEO of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, posted online suggests that his company policy enforcement will go for beyond just banning President Trump after last week's riots at the Capitol. Dorsey was heard saying that this will go on for much longer than just one day and one week and will go beyond the inauguration.Mark, your reaction to what's taking place with this coordinated effort to remove President Trump from social media and put Parler out of business, frankly?PENN: Well, in general, I think we've seen, you know, TV and print media separate by ideology and I think we had seen the platforms be a place for everyone. And I think what Twitter is doing is separating itself out and saying, no, we're a private company. We're going to really take people over here. And the question is whether there is good competition. I don't know whether Parler is going to qualify or not qualify. They need more moderation according to Apple. But is now -- or are now social media platforms going to divide up by ideology like the lot of the media. That seems to be what's really happening here. I have complete confidence that competitors will come up.I think Twitter, as a business model, compared to Google and FaceBook, has had problems for a long time. And they're making a fundamental change in strategy here in terms of their business and in terms of what kind of platform they're going to be. That's clear.BARTIROMO: If they are the same as media in terms of where they are, shouldn't they be able to get sued and not have this liability protection, which was given to these social media companies under the thought that they were bulletin boards, that anybody can put their ideas on the bulletin board and be heard. In fact, we now know that's not true.PENN: Well, I think we're going to have to take an entirely new look at how we -- we regulate some of these things. Doesn't look like he's going to be a cooperative regulation as there was say in ratings. And it looks like that the 230 protection was, exactly as you said, meant to be for completely open platforms. And that that's likely going to have to be revised in some way. I don't think just eliminated it creates a kind of chaos online, but it's going to have to be arrived so that people who want 230 have to then adhere to certain rules of openness. And if you want to be a publish, then you're going to take the risk of the publisher. I think that should be a choice for these -- for these platforms and we need that revision done as soon as possible.BARTIROMO: Yes, but, Mark, will we see that revision? I mean you've got a Democrat, you know, majority in the House and the Senate. Will they actually do anything about that? Probably Democrats are perfectly fine with social media censoring conservatives.PENN: They may be fine with that, but in the polls, 41 percent of the country thinks liberal speech is being squashed and 60 percent think conservatives are being squashed. So everybody seems to think that there's something wrong here. And President-elect Joe Biden has, in the past, said that he is for 230 revisions. So I think you may find surprising bipartisan agreement here, you know, once they get past the stimulus.BARTIROMO: OK.PENN: I hope we do.BARTIROMO: Interesting.Brian Brenberg, jump in.PROFESSOR BRIAN BRENBERG, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, Mark, you talked about competition as an answer to this problem, but, you know, a lot of people are looking at this situation and saying, well, how does anybody compete when Apple and Google and Amazon and Twitter are seemingly working in lockstep to keep competitors like Parler out of this. This seems to me to be a legitimate antitrust question. Will the Biden administration, will this Congress be willing to address what looks like an antitrust situation?PENN: Well, I -- look, I think Parler is going to court. They're going to have to see whether they get anywhere with their issues. That's probably the fastest route to getting those -- those issues settled. But on the question of, do I think that there will be competition here, will either Parler reform what it needs to reform or will someone else come here, come on -- come online? There are many ways to get to the Internet. The Internet is an -- is amazingly open platform. I think that -- that look -- that this problem will be solved in the coming months and that if Twitter goes the direction of being a publisher of certain, you know, of a more ideological ilk, I think you're going to see competition arise one way or the other here. That is the nature of innovation in this country and the technology system we have.BARTIROMO: I know you worked at Microsoft for so long, Mark. What do you think Parler should do at this point? What -- what are -- what are Parler's options?PENN: Well Parler's biggest option, and I think we heard it from the -- from the policy director I think yesterday, get real moderation on the site, publish a set of rules and say, look, we have these rules, we're going to enforce them, we're go to be state of the art in terms of enforcing this. We're going to allow free speech but we are not going to allow any incitement of violence. And I think -- I think establish that kind of standard, publish it in maybe every newspaper, and say, look, we're -- we're serious about this. We're hired 1,000 people to do this. End of story. And I think that's the best direction for them if they want to get it back -- back online as quickly as possible.BARTIROMO: Yes. Yes, but I -- still, I mean Twitter is supposed to have those rules as well, and Twitter is littered with hate and they, you know, it's violence also. You've got, you know, the Ayatollah Khomeini saying death to U.S. soldiers and it's still up there on Twitter, Mark. So, I mean, you know -- let me bring Dagen McDowell in.Go ahead, Dagen.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: This is not about Twitter and this is not about Parler. This is about Apple, Amazon, and Google working in coordination with one another to shut down a business, and pull the plug on it. Really the only platform -- killing a competitor, by the way. The only platform that made room for not just conservative speech but potentially all speech. It's not about Parler. Are they were blaming Parler for being a root of the organization of the riots. Well, we know at -- based on reporting that much of that was planned on FaceBook.Facebook still exists to this very day. This is troubling. The vast power that these large technology companies have, now working at the direction of the very liberal Democrats whose campaigns they funded. Just three months ago a subcommittee let by Jerry Nadler, the biggest of Democrats on Capitol Hill, wrote this, we believe that the totality of the evidence demonstrates the pressing need for legislative action and reform in terms of the big tech companies, Apple, Amazon, Google, and FaceBook. These firms have too much power and that power must be reined in and subject to appropriate oversight and enforcement. Quote, our economy and democracy are at stake.Where are the Democrats now? These technology companies intentionally are currying favor and shutting down voices that the left disagrees with, hoping and praying that the Democrats running the House, the Senate and the White House now don't regulate them.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: It is appalling, it's disgusting and we should all be afraid of how free speech is no longer free.BARTIROMO: That's right.Mark, your reaction? It's spot-on.PENN: Look, I think I'm trying to give you a little bit more optimistic view here. The competition is going to come along. That -- that Parler is either going to reform itself in the problems to get back on, someone else will come on.BARTIROMO: Yes, but will FaceBook? Will FaceBook reform?PENN: They're doing --BARTIROMO: Will FaceBook reform? You just heard Dagen, it was all planned on FaceBook. Is FaceBook going to reform?PENN: I think FaceBook has over 10,000 people looking for this. I think that it is difficult on any of these platforms to really find and root out this violence or potential violent activity.BARTIROMO: Right.PENN: I think they're all going to be working on this problem.BARTIROMO: All right.PENN: I think have a little confidence that through innovation this will come through and this is a temporary period.BARTIROMO: Yes. Meanwhile, Parler's out of business. Yes.Mark, thank you so much.Mark Penn.We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.The ongoing threat of the Chinese Communist Party. Federal prosecutors report an MIT professor failed to disclose his extensive ties to the Chinese government in grant applications to the Department of Energy. This professor is -- in question is denying the allegations and the school says it is deeply disturbed.Joining me right now "The Daily Wire" editor is Ian Haworth.Ian, it's great to have you this morning. Thanks very much for joining us.And then this is just one of a string of indictments we've seen over the last year where you've seen academics get indicted for failing to disclose that they are actually being paid by the CCP because the Chinese Communist Party is getting them to one way or another to transfer important proprietary data to the Chinese Communist Party. More of their intellectual property theft.Your reaction to this and whether or not we're going to see a change to the very tough stance that Donald Trump took on China.IAN HAWORTH, EDITOR, "THE DAILY WIRE": Yes, I mean, firstly I think isn't important to understand, this isn't just a problem in academia. I published a story in December on "The Daily Wire" were actually one of the few American outlets to cover this, which I think says all you need to know. And the CCP have people basically in organizations all over the world, whether it be government, banking, defense contractors. So this is far broader than just -- like a problem in academia.But in term of academia, through the Thousand Talents Plan, China have had really quite dodgy interactions with institutions over quite a few years. I mean in 2020, early 2020, the FBI arrested someone. This is a constant problem.In terms of whether I see it changing under Biden, I think Biden is going to take a much weaker approach basically because he's been wrong on foreign policy for his entire career. And so I don't see him suddenly changing his mind.BARTIROMO: Yes.HAWORTH: He's also flip-flopped multiple times on China. He said they're both a threat and not a threat. And so I think China will just wait -- wait for Trump to be out of the door and then they'll just keep going. I don't see any real incentive for them to change.BARTIROMO: Yes. And, Ian, you should know that this has been one of our key stories that we cover on this program and on "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES" now for four years, the threat of the Chinese Communist Party. So you're right, the mainstream media is not covering this threat. They continue to cover Russia and the failed attempt at taking Donald Trump down for colluding with Russia and instead they have missed the true threat that is the Chinese Communist Party as the CCP has made it very clear that they want to become the number one superpower in the world, overtaking America.Now, the Trump administration is moving to declassify its plan to contain China's influence. This outline includes working with India to take on China, denying Chinese military influence in Taiwan, negotiating total denuclearization of North Korea. The U.S. is also acting under the assumption that China aims to dissolve American alliances in the Indio Pacific region.So these goals are obviously continuing a tough stance on China.Ian, during the coronavirus, the Chinese Communist Party used that to -- while the world was focusing on keeping its people safe and not sick, China invaded India killing 20 soldiers, militarized the South China Sea and continued to steal intellectual property, not to mention putting a million people in concentration camps, the Uighurs in -- you know, reeducation camps is what they call it.So what kind of a policy would you expect from the Biden administration, which is why, by the way, we focused on Hunter Biden and its -- his ties to Chinese companies that were tied to the CCP?BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Bernie's budget. Bernie Sanders speaking out on spending priorities after being named head of the Senate Budget Committee.Edward Lawrence with more now on his priorities.Edward.EDWARD LAWRENCE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Maria, the Senate Budget Committee is really one of the most powerful in Congress because it controls the money. Senator Bernie Sanders did not make it into the cabinet. So as a consolation, he's been named the head of the Budget Committee. Huge influence over spending priorities.Sanders told Fox News that when it comes to the military budget, for example, generally people do not consider the deficit. When it comes to corporate tax cuts, generally nobody worries about the deficit. So he extends that thought.Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT): The Pentagon can't even do an independent audit. There's an enormous amount of waste and duplication in their budget. But no one worries about that. When it comes to working families, for the mom and dad who are struggling to put food on the table for their kids, oh, my God, we're worried about the deficit.So deficit is an issue, I agree.BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Yes.SANDERS: But I think this -- at this moment we've got to do the right thing for working families.(END VIDEO CLIP)LAWRENCE: So in a tweet Senator Sanders says that he will use budget reconciliation process to boldly address the needs of working families. That process bypasses the need for 60 senators on a budget item. It could be done with a simple majority.Sanders backed some very expensive proposals, like Medicare for all, free child care and the elimination of all student debt which could cost $1.5 trillion. As self-described socialist, Sanders embraces big government, something President-elect Joe Biden might not shy away from either.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT-ELECT FOR THE UNITED STATES: We agree that we'll work closely on our shared agenda of increasing worker power and to protect the dignity of work for all working people.(END VIDEO CLIP)LAWRENCE: So Sanders plan to -- his plans to test the legal limits of the reconciliation process in order to address what he sees as, quote, structural problems in American society. Sanders has no problems being loud and bold.Maria.BARTIROMO: All right, Edward, thanks very much. Edward Lawrence.We've got the December retail sales numbers coming out right after the break.Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.December retail sales are out.Cheryl Casone with the numbers.Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes. So we're looking at a couple of things here. So let's start with the retail sales number for the month over month. This is November to December.We were looking for a flat number. We actually got down 0.7, down 0.7. So that's actually kind of what we're looking at right there.Taking a look if you strip out autos, you get a retail sales number of a loss of 1.4, down 1.4. so that's something else that I'm going through as well.Now I want to look at the year-over-year. We did not get an estimate from Refinative (ph) and it looks like the prior number was 4.1. I don't have that yet for retail sales year over year for December.Let me move down, though, to PPI really quick here because that, of course, is producer prices. The estimate for month over month December for PPI was 0.4, four tenths of a percent. We came in at three-tenths of a percent. So you pass that on to the consumer. That can be good.Year over year for December, PPI the estimate, 0.8. we came in at 0.8, in line.Core, again, stripping out volatile food and energy, it's a little bit better. And 0.2 was the estimate. It came in at 0.1. Again, you hope the producers pass this on. And then year over year for December, 1.2.But, again, the headline number, the big number here was those retail sales. The markets really focused on this because of the lockdowns in California. We saw job losses in December. So maybe not a big surprise, but worse than expected than what analyst had expected, a loss of 0.7 percent. And we thought we were going to get a flat number for retail sales, Maria.There you go. Dow down 150 right now. So, there you have it. Back to you.BARTIROMO: Yes. This is -- this is certainly weaker than we all expected. It looks like we did have a soft spot in the month of December on a number of levels, jobs and now even spending and retail sales.Joining me right now -- Cheryl, thank you so much.Joining me right now to talk more about it is the president of Macromavens, Stephanie Pomboy.Stephanie, good to see you. Your reaction to these numbers.STEPHANIE POMBOY, PRESIDENT, MACROMAVENS: Well, I guess I'm worried that they'll be blindly dismissed as entirely related to the lockdowns, when I think it's pretty clear that the consumer has really been showing real signs of restraint, even when the economy was open, you know we had this massive first round of stimulus, and one trillion of that is still plunked away in savings. So, you know, 10 months later, the consumer hasn't really rushed out to spend the stimulus. And I think this is really important as it relates to the direction of the markets because the markets have been anticipating that once the vaccine gets distributed, we'll see this huge surge in pent-up demand. You even see talk, you know, references to excess savings that will have to be spent. And I think that's really a mistake.John Taylor has an excellent editorial in this morning's "Wall Street Journal" that lays this out in much more erudite terms than I could, but essentially saying, you know, one time stimulus to consumers isn't going to provide long-term support to the economy because, not surprisingly, the fact that we've lost 10 million jobs is a much more important force behind spending going forward. And, frankly, that, I think, is the number one headwind for the economy, coupled with the shift in administration to one that's more antibusiness rather than pro-business and is going to lay on a lot of increased regulation, which in no way is going to improve the employment outlook going forward, in my opinion.BARTIROMO: Stephanie, we also have the Empire State Index out. That's coming in much weaker than expected.POMBOY: Yes.BARTIROMO: The conditions not this low in several years, 3.5 is the number there versus an estimate of 6 points for the Empire Index. You got retail sales down. You've got the Empire State Index down. All while you've got the Producer Price Index up, Stephanie.POMBOY: Yes.BARTIROMO: We have seen a real debate on inflation I've got to get your take on where that is in 2021 and 2022. Do you think that inflation is going to be an issue that perhaps causes the Federal Reserve to take their foot off of the gas in terms of stimulus? That certainly would also be a catalyst to send stocks prices lower.Your thoughts on inflation.POMBOY: Absolutely. Well, clearly, we're going to see -- and already are seeing -- a real increase in import prices as a result of the weaker dollar and commodity prices at the same time, a lot of which has to do with movement that China is making, but that's a big topic for another day.But my concern is because I don't think that consumers are going to rush to spend this pent-up saving that everyone's talking about, or, you know, excess savings, that the wherewithal to pass through these higher input prices is really limited. And I think the markets, again, that's a real danger spot for the markets in that they're anticipating that these input price pressures are going to get passed through and corporate profits will see a real upturn in 2021.And there's no question that mathematically they'll be better than 2020. But I don't think you're going to see this play out anywhere near what the markets expect. I would think that this is going to be real pressure on profit margins because those input prices are going to continue to move higher over the next several months and companies are going to find it very difficult to pass that on to consumers who, frankly, are un -- or under employed and whose stimulus checks are just not going to get them excited about rushing out to spend.BARTIROMO: Stephanie, how do you square that with what we've heard from the banks this morning. Jamie Dimon, in the conference call this morning, telling shareholders that the economy -- he could see the -- a healthy economy hopefully by the summer. He's, obviously, being cautious with his commentary in a quarter that had the -- the numbers up. Even though the FIC (ph) numbers, the financial services wasn't actually as strong as a lot of people expected, investment banking was very strong with all the SPAC activity.POMBOY: Right.BARTIROMO: But he is being somewhat cautious in terms of guidance.What's your take on the banks and what they tell us as far as the economy as well?POMBOY: Well, again, there are two moving parts here, what's the slop of the yield curve and how does that plan into net interest margins and then what's the demand for loans, you know, at these interest rates?So the expectations for the banks mostly is bullish based on this idea that you're going to see a steepening of the yield curve, which would be -- it happened in part because of this upturn in inflation pressures we're talking about.I, however, don't think that's a positive for the banks because we've had, you know, a decade where rates have steadily moved lower and everyone who had an opportunity to borrow has been able to do so, you know, at -- the lowest rates in their lifetimes. Are they going to rush to borrow as rates start to move higher? And I really doubt that that will be the case, particularly given what I see as sort of a slower growth trajectory for the economy.So I think the presumption that a steepening yield curve is going to suddenly result in these splendiferous bank earnings is a little dubious because it relies on the assumption that people will borrow more at higher rates and I don't see the marginal demand for that right here.BARTIROMO: All right, we will leave it there.Stephanie, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks very much.POMBOY: You too.BARTIROMO: Stephanie Pomboy joining us there.POMBOY: Thank you.BARTIROMO: We're taking a quick break.When we come back, the swing of business. Former New York Yankees star Alex Rodriguez is here to talk about his new entrepreneurial moves, when he and JLo will officially tie the knot. It's all coming up.You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Hims and Hers going public. The health and wellness company hitting the market via a merger with the Oaktree Acquisition SPAC in a deal worth $1.6 billion. My next guest is one of the investors in the company.Joining me right now is former 14 time Major League Baseball all-star, philanthropist and businessman, Alex Rodriguez.Alex, it's great to see you this morning. Thanks very much for joining us.ALEX RODRIGUEZ, PHILANTHROPIST AND BUSINESSMAN: Maria, great to see you. Thank you for having me.BARTIROMO: Yes. We've talked a lot about your entrepreneurialism. I know that you have been a big owner of real estate and have gotten interested in a number of companies and investments in the beauty side and the beauty industry, among others. Let's talk about that and Hims and Hers going public through a SPAC. What attracted you to Hims and Hers? Tell me where you see growth in this company.RODRIGUEZ: Yes, what attracted me is a lot. I mean the founder, Andrew Dudum, is one of the best founders, CEO in our portfolio. Telemedicine in someone -- something that's right in the DNA what Jennifer and I like to invest in. His mission and purpose was very much like ours, is to basically search around the world for the best doctors, the best results, the best opportunities and bring it to the masses at an affordable price. And we used to say telemedicine is about the future. Telemedicine for the masses is here now. And Hims and Hers, they're doing a fantastic job of getting into many, many homes.BARTIROMO: So you think that what we've been doing during this pandemic in terms of telehealth, tele-education, we're going to be doing that on the other side of it. you -- we're going to still be doing this and utilizing companies like this when we're out of -- out of this pandemic?RODRIGUEZ: Absolutely. And the pandemic has given us a crystal ball of what life is going to be after the pandemic, right? And as -- you know, when technology and Internet comes first because of necessity, we've done in a year what should have been done probably three or five years. But I think Hims and Hers is so on brand for us. I mean I remember Jennifer always talking about growing up as an 11-year-old, she had pink eye and her mom, you know, David and Lupe said, hey, go to school there in the Bronx. And it wasn't until the administration, the teacher said, wait a minute, you can't be in school, Jennifer, send her home, she walked home and then she went to go see a doctor.But, remember, a visit for doctors today on average is $200 to $300. We, as men, I can tell you personally, we do not like going to the doctors. So Hims and Hers provides an incredible answer to a huge need. And you can do it all for under $50 a month. It's an incredible thing. And from the comfort of your couch at home, which is -- which is great.BARTIROMO: So, Alex, you and Jennifer Lopez have, what, just under 5 percent of this company. How will this play out? Already just the idea that you were investing in this company, I think, sent the stock up of Oaktree. But it will change to Hims and Hers and its own symbol when the deal takes place, right? Are you looking to get a bigger stake or how will your investments play out in Hims and Hers?RODRIGUEZ: Well, we always look to doubt or triple down on our winners. And we think that Hims and Hers is in the very early stages of what could be a lot of white space out there. But if you look at the business model, it's a beautiful business model. And it's what's making Hims and Hers sing already in the market. But if you think about a business, that 91 percent of their recurring income comes from recurring income, with 76 percent marginal last quarter and it's growing 90 percent year over year.The recurring model is one that's really, really beautiful and it's one that Oaktree with Howard Marks, one of the great investors of our generation, there's a lot of things to likeAnd, of course, Andrew, who is the founder, the minute he walked into our house two years ago in Los Angeles, he had Jennifer and I at hello. Here's a guy who grew up with an artist family. His father played the piano. He's a musician. And as a teenager put himself through school, bought his first car and then went to Warren (ph) Business School. So he had left brain, right brain. Andrew has the goods to make this a massive conglomerate.BARTIROMO: Yes, you've been -- you've been astute at allocating your own capital. Besides healthcare and wellness, you're also invested in real estate and hospitality. You've got a new space in Miami working with -- with a number of high profile companies.Tell me about real estate in Miami and what you're seeing real -- in real estate overall, as people are really moving to low tax states. There's an exodus out of New York. What can you tell us about real estate right now, Alex?RODRIGUEZ: Well, I mean, Miami and Austin are the two places that have benefited the most. Miami is absolutely on fire. I have, you know -- I've become a broker on the side. But there's so many great things going on in Miami from the investment and infrastructure, the school systems getting better, new highway being connected. Basically Coral Gables and Miami Beach. And it's on fire. Both the commercial and residential side. Barry Sterlet (ph) and I are building 144,000 square feet across the one hotel. A beautiful office building. The demand has been off the charts. I wish we had 400,000 square feet. And you can't say these metrics are the same in every state, but here in south Florida, across the board, is on fire.BARTIROMO: So are you done with baseball, Alex? I mean you are putting your -- your money in different areas of business, entrepreneurial moves. Is that where you see the future for Alex Rodriguez?RODRIGUEZ: Well, look, baseball will always be a big part of my life. I love it. It was my first love growing up. You know, born in New York, raised in Miami. We had a great run at the Mets. We came in second place. I call it -- we were the second winners.One advice for future hopeful owners, if you want to buy a team, don't go up against one of the richest, smartest guys in New York City. But the Mets are in great hands and now that's opened up incredible opportunities for team ownership, not only in baseball, but in other sports. The fact that Jennifer and I, in the middle of a pandemic, over 420 Zoom calls raised over $2.5 billion, you know, it was a big feat and a great accomplishment. And, unfortunately, we did not win, but we obviously wish, you know, Steve and the Mets great -- best of luck.BARTIROMO: So -- so maybe there's another team out there for you, right? I mean it may -- it maybe -- maybe in the NBA or another area. You still in the market for looking for another team, Alex?RODRIGUEZ: I wouldn't say we're looking. We weren't looking prior to the Mets process. But sometimes an opportunity like the Mets comes up and it sings to you. And the Mets was a team that I came up as a young lad out of New York and Miami growing up watching them. Obviously the '86 Mets were -- was an awesome story. But we're now doing other exciting things. And if something comes up that's in our wheelhouse that's exciting to us, we'll take a look.BARTIROMO: Yes. And one of those exciting things is JLo's new beauty line.We're going to take a quick break and then I want to get your take on that. She is also an entrepreneur in her own right. The big question everybody's asking about you and JLo. We're going to talk about that when we come right back, Alex. Stay with us.We're talking with Alex Rodriguez. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.WE are talking with Alex Rodriguez this morning about he and his -- and Jennifer Lopez's investment in Hims and Hers.Alex, you partnered with Jennifer and she has her brand JLo Beauty hitting Amazon after launching earlier this month on her website. Nearly 1,000 Sephora's across the country. Jennifer moving from, what, a licensing approach to now an ownership approach. Tell me about that business and about your partnership with Jennifer on JLo Beauty.RODRIGUEZ: Yes, you know, it's remarkable to see what Jennifer's built over the last 25 years. She's done over $8 billion in consumer sales, $2 billion alone in fragrance. But what she's invested a lot of her time is VCP, vision capital people, and converting a licensing model to an ownership model. And what most people out there don't know is how brilliant Jennifer is as an entrepreneur, as a hands-on founder and CEO of JLo Beauty. And the fact that this didn't take three months, this took three years because it's not done the fast way, it's done the Jennifer way. And that means the right way. And, you know, the products she sent back 27, 28 times, back to the lab. Until it was perfect, she would not go for it.And we have some wonderful partners in Guthy-Renker. Bill and Greg have been in the business for over 35 years. They're best in class. And what I like about Jennifer, and he's -- I've heard her say this many, many times, is I have access to the best doctors, to the bet product, to the best technology around the products and she wants to bring that to the masses, just like Andrew at Hims and Hers, he wants to bring it to the masses at an affordable price.BARTIROMO: So together you guys are building something of an empire that includes telemedicine, wellness, as well as beauty.What's next in that empire? How do you gain scale and expand it?RODRIGUEZ: Well, I think, you know, for us, at A-Rod Corp and BRX, the theme is the same, is, how do we take our platform as we search the world for opportunities that we can scale, make it a business, and make it more affordable for people? Again, you know, people like us, we -- growing up, we didn't like to go to the doctors. We couldn't afford to go to the doctors. Well, now you can do it. Not for $300. With Hims and Hers, you can do it for under $50 a month and you can do it from the comfort of your couch,BARTIROMO: Right.RODRIGUEZ: JLo Beauty, we wanted to make sure we placed JLo Beauty in a place that it was for everybody and her families can actually enjoy it.BARTIROMO: Yes.RODRIGUEZ: And, by the way, Maria, I'm right here and I'm a male and I steal her stuff all the time. But, Maria, we're going to get you some of this. It's flying right now. It hit yesterday for the first time in Sephora. (INAUDIBLE) one year (INAUDIBLE).BARTIROMO: What is that? SO you're -- you're using -- you're using JLo's stuff? You're using JLo's products?RODRIGUEZ: I mean, I have to. I have to use it. It's -- it's really, really good. And it took her a long time.The one thing that everybody wants to know about Jennifer, besides singing and dancing, is what does she do for her skin.BARTIROMO: Yes.RODRIGUEZ: And what I'm excited about is she's going to dive -- dig -- she's going to dive very closely to the science, into the olive oil. Her mother Lupe used to put olive oil in her hair. She has this whole thing around it.BARTIROMO: Yes.RODRIGUEZ: And I'm excited for the consumers to get this. And it's affordable and you can find it at Sephora today.BARTIROMO: Alex -- Alex, I -- I know she's going to perform at the inauguration. Might that be a time to pop the question? You've postponed your wedding due to the pandemic. Any updates on when you guys are walking down the aisle?RODRIGUEZ: I love it, Maria, you always ask the tough questions. But, you know what, we're thrilled about her performance in D.C. next week and you never know. You never know.But I'll tell you this, we had two cancelled because of this pandemic. Hopeful a third time is a charm.BARTIROMO: Dagen McDowell and Brian Brenberg, thank you. Stuart Varney begins right now and "Varney & Co."Stu, take it away.Load-Date: January 15, 2021End of Document

Jack Ma, the Chinese billionaire, owner of Alibaba, who fell out of favorCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 5, 2021 TuesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 667 wordsBodyThe question about Jack Ma's whereabouts has an impact on every news portal in the world for these hours.The hard tip is that the billionaire, founder and owner of the Alibaba technology conglomerate, has not appeared in public for two months. His last appearance was at an online event broadcast live on October 31.The central hypothesis is that Ma fell out of favor with the Chinese government after giving a Shanghai speech where he made strong criticism of China's regulatory system.Beijing didn't like the harsh words of Ma, who stated that "China does not have a systemic financial risk simply because it does not have a system, and that is the risk."He also accused Chinese banks of operating with "pawn banking mindset," when in reality "good innovation is not afraid of rules, but of outdated rules."Shortly after his presentation, and within days, the government blocked the IPO of its company Ant Group,and launched an antitrust investigation against Alibaba. While it is clear that Xi Jinping's government decided to move forward against Ma and seeks to more ironily control companies that ossan criticize aspects of their politics, the government also seems to have taken advantage of the fact that billionaires like the founder of Alibaba are increasingly squealing at large portions of Chinese society. According to a note in The New York Times, one of the primary reasons for discontent seems to be the sense that the opportunities that allowed Ma to flourish are becoming scarcer, and less accessible to the ordinary citizen. While China has more billionaires than the United States and India combined, it is estimated that around 600 million of its inhabitants earn less than $150 a month. Consumption in the country fell by about 5% during the first 11 months of 2020, but luxury consumption is estimated to have increased by about 50% compared to 2019. For young people, even those who have a university degree and access good jobs, it is increasingly difficult to access their first home in the most important cities.On the other hand, younger generations have had to resort to indebtedness with companies such as Ma's Ant Group, which also generates resentment and anger. Jack Ma knew how to be an admired figure in China. He played a kung fu master in a Chinese-starred film in 2017 and sang with pop star Faye Wong. For the country's ambitious young people, their rise was a glimpse into the success that could be achieved thanks to the country's capitalist explosion.In recent times, however, his prestige has waned. On social media the epithets against him fly in all directions: from "villain" to "evil capitalist" and "bloodsucking ghost". In the journalistic notes dedicated to his figure it is increasingly common to see comments that cite one of Karl Marx's most famous sentences: "workers of the world, uno!"Xi Jinping's government seems more than willing to navigate this wave of discontent. At a Communist Party meeting in December, one of the most discussed economic policies was the need to strengthen antitrust measures to prevent "disorderly capital expansion."For some analysts, Beijing's decision to go against Jack Ma may mark a turning point in the relationship between the government and Chinese entrepreneurs.President Xi Jinping made it very clear what kind of businessman he imagines for China. In December he toured a museum dedicated to Zhang Jian, aindustrial entrepreneur who lived more than a century ago. One of the reasons they made Zhang famous was that, in addition to making money, he helped develop his hometown of Nantong, and opened hundreds of schools.Last July, Xi had already referred to Zhang as a figure worthy of admiring in a meeting with entrepreneurs, a message that some interpreted as a way of saying that patriotism must prey to profit.It is still difficult to predict how far the Chinese government will go in its attempt to regulate businesses, but it is clear that there is a storm front on the horizon.Clarín writingLook too       Load-Date: January 6, 2021End of Document

America's spy-busters out secret-stealing Chinese 'grad students' under the microscopeThe Breeze: James Madison UniversityFebruary 11, 2021 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2021 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 2299 wordsByline: Sarah Silbiger / APBodyThe FBI last month arrested Gang Chen, a well-known MIT nanotechnologist, and charged the China-born naturalized American with concealing close and lucrative connections to China's scientific and technological establishment on his applications for federal research grants.Chen, who has pleaded not guilty and is supported by MIT, is not the only prominent academic figure to be arrested and charged with failing to disclose connections to Chinese research institutes. At least half a dozen have been arrested in the last year or so. They include Charles Lieber, the chair of the Harvard University Chemistry Department, who is accused of concealing his participation in an ambitious, state-sponsored Chinese effort to recruit top scientists and engineers from around the world to work in China.The prosecutions illustrate growing American alarm about Chinese technology theft, an important part of China's effort to supplant the United States both as the dominant military power in Asia and as the world's leader in science and technology. Despite the publicity surrounding the American academics' arrests, U.S. officials and analysts say a particular concern is Chinese graduate school researchers with advanced backgrounds.But this isn't a simple story of a belligerent power's intellectual larceny and espionage. It's a more nuanced problem that the United States largely brought upon itself through its longstanding policy of engagement with China aimed at bringing it into the international fold. One result is a Chinese symbiosis with American universities that includes Chinese financial support for American schools and large subsidies from American taxpayers for both sensitive research and the visiting Chinese nationals who conduct it.According to Elsa Kania, a specialist on China's military affiliated with the liberal Center for a New American Security, the arrests of the academics may deter future violations of disclosure requirements, but "they also can be perceived as the U.S. government being unduly harsh in punishing American scientists for research engagement that not long ago was actively encouraged, with limited enforcement of security measures." She spoke in a Zoom interview.The new focus on academic ties to China is just one part of a larger Department of Justice task force launched by the Trump administration in 2018, called the China Initiative. Under it, FBI field offices and U.S. Attorneys have conducted hundreds of investigations and made dozens of arrests across the country for technology theft, visa fraud, cyber-espionage, and other illicit activities in the United States.These operations have succeeded in exposing "the diversity of the Chinese effort," as John C. Demers, the Justice Department's assistant attorney general for national security, put it in a phone interview. Among its more threatening aspects is a state-directed campaign to send advanced Chinese researchers to the United States while disguising their true identities.Last July, the FBI arrested four Chinese nationals posing as ordinary graduate school researchers; they were actually Chinese army officers. One of them, Xin Wang, was working in a medical lab at the University of California-San Francisco funded by the National Institutes of Health. Wang admitted to being a major in the Chinese People's Liberation Army and employed by a military lab in China. He was deported.Another of the arrested Chinese, Kaikai Zhao, was studying machine learning and artificial intelligence at the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering at Indiana University.What happened after those four arrests was even more revealing about the scope of China's clandestine presence in the United States: An estimated 1,000 Chinese graduate researchers abruptly fled the country and returned to China - apparently, in the view of American officials, because they had concealed their ties to the Chinese military and were afraid of arrest.Still, 1,000 researchers represent a tiny fraction of the 360,000 Chinese nationals enrolled in American colleges and universities, many of whom, perhaps the large majority of whom, are engaged in activities above reproach.U.S. taxpayers subsidize the education of many of the Chinese grad students working in labs and research institutes around the country. At MIT alone, there are generally between 700 and 800 Chinese graduate students at any given time, in addition to more than 100 exchange and visiting scholars. It is standard procedure at most major universities that advanced graduate students in technical fields cover the cost of their studies through salaries from the labs where they work, and the salaries are commonly paid out of grants from such federal agencies as the National Science Foundation, NASA, the Department of Energy, the National Institutes of Health, and others."It's no mystery who pays for research that goes on at top-level research institutions," one senior professor said in a phone interview, asking not to be named. "It comes from domestic grants, not from abroad.""If you have 360,000 undergraduates, that's not much of a risk," Demers said. "If they're graduate students, you look at the fields they're in, and the more sophisticated they are, the more risky it is. The Chinese are trying to get the latest 5% of cutting-edge research, and only the most sophisticated researchers can do this."Many academics and China experts say this investment in Chinese-born students helps the United States. In speeches and articles, for example, MIT's president, L. Rafael Reif, has argued that international exchanges are of inestimable value to the United States and that substantial numbers of the advanced Chinese students choose to remain in America, where they contribute to the progress of American science.One study cited by Reif shows that around 80% of the Chinese getting doctorates in the United States are still in the country 10 years after receiving their degrees. Even if some of them maintain ties to colleagues and research institutes in China, Reif and many others argue, the key to scientific supremacy is not impeding someone else's progress, but increasing America's own investments in research, development and talent.Attracting foreign students to the U.S. can help drain talent from competing countries. China, in part to keep that from happening, has rapidly expanded its own graduate education programs. Between 2000 and 2016, the number of people earning doctoral degrees in all fields inside China increased to 34,000, from about 10,000. China now awards more Ph.D.s in the natural sciences and engineering than does the U.S.Still, a major part of China's modernization push depends on the acquisition of technology from scientifically advanced Western countries, whether through legal, transparent means -- or by espionage and other illicit practices."The PRC and their leadership still do not believe that they're going to succeed in their tech breakout without siphoning off massive amounts of tech from the United States," Matt Pottinger, the departing Trump administration deputy national security adviser, said in a Zoom interview. "You hear that they've already broken out, that they don't need us, and there are pockets where that's true, but they lack confidence that they can achieve and sustain a technology edge without significant access to American labs."The Trump administration took what some former officials call a "targeted approach" to the Chinese effort to send to the U.S. students who are directly under the control of the Chinese government. Last year, for example, it canceled visas for students directly affiliated with the Chinese military, as well for students coming to the country on Chinese government scholarships that required them to share whatever they learned with the Chinese state.An estimated 2,000 students were expelled or barred from coming to the country - not including the thousand who fled on their own - a number still representing less than 1% of Chinese students in the U.S. Nonetheless, cracking down on them, as Pottinger put it, served as "a warning shot, and we had info that these people were there basically to siphon technology.""There are cases where we discovered U.S. government grants where the primary interlocutor would be an American, but most of the work was being done by PRC [People's Republic of China] nationals," Pottinger said. "It was a sign to us of how complacent the screening procedures were for Department of Defense contracts. Sometimes it was really sensitive stuff."Military modernization is one of China's major strategic goals, which include defending its highly contested claim to ownership of virtually the entire South China Sea and prevailing over the United States if war broke out in the Pacific.The Chinese military has developed a network of its own technical and scientific universities, part of a mission to acquire technology from other countries. One in-depth study of the PLA's activities reveals how large and global in scale this effort is. Alex Joske, a China specialist at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, has found that as of 2018, the PLA had sponsored more than 2,500 military scientists and engineers "to travel to universities in technologically advanced countries such as Australia as students or visiting scholars.""This collaboration is ... often unintentionally supported by taxpayer funds," Joske wrote, giving examples of this in Australia and Britain, where some universities, still operating under the West's "engagement" philosophy, purposely developed technical cooperation with Chinese military institutes. "Nearly all PLA scientists sent abroad are Chinese Communist Party members who return to China on time," Joske concludes.Joske noted that Chinese military publications have a name for this: "Picking flowers in foreign lands to make honey in China." Their affiliations in China are often with the National Defense Research University, the major institution promoting the country's efforts in such areas as hypersonic missiles, cryptography, cyberwarfare, and space-based weaponry, but they may also be members of other military-affiliated institutions, like the Northwestern Institute of Nuclear Technology or the Armed Forces Engineering Academy in Beijing.In some cases discovered by Joske, Chinese military officers working abroad claim affiliation with "non-existing institutions with innocuous-sounding names," presumably to avoid calling attention to themselves on their visa applications. At least five scientists from the military's Rocket Force Engineering University have traveled abroad as visiting scholars, giving their home institution as the Xian Research Institute, which, Joske says, "appears to only exist on paper."None of the half dozen or so American academics arrested for concealing their connections to China is accused of aiding China's military modernization or intellectual theft. The technical charge is wire fraud - because the grant applications on which the defendants have allegedly concealed their Chinese connections were sent electronically, making it a matter of interstate commerce. Some of the accused professors have also been charged with failing to disclose bank accounts in China or lying on passport applications.The main charge against Lieber, the former chairman of the Harvard chemistry department, is that he concealed his involvement in the so-called Thousand Talents Program to recruit scientists to China, for which, according to the FBI, he was paid a salary of $50,000 a month by the Wuhan University of Technology, which also gave him a $1.5 million grant to establish a research lab there."The government has this wrong," maintains Lieber's lawyer, Marc Mukasey. "He is the victim in this case, not the perpetrator."In addition to Chen and Lieber, professors from the University of Arkansas, the University of Kansas, West Virginia University, the University of Tennessee, among other schools, have been indicted on similar charges. Their specialties have included biomedical engineering, chemical nanoscience, molecular reactions in coal conversion, and cardio-vascular genetics.One of these cases is against Simon Saw-Teung Ang, a Malaysian-born American citizen who until 2020 was the director of the High Density Electronics Center at the University of Arkansas. Ang, according to the Justice Department announcement of his arrest, concealed that he "received money and benefits from China and was closely associated with various companies based in China during the same time he was receiving grants from various United States Government agencies," including NASA. The government also alleges that he kept his China ties secret because for fear disclosing them might jeopardize his federal grant applications.The crime alleged against American academics is essentially that they sought to defraud the American taxpayer by concealing required information on grant applications and, in some instances, by double-dipping - getting money from the American government to carry out research that was also being financed by China.In the case of MIT's Gang Chen, the government says he concealed a $19 million payment from China's Southern Science and Technology University to help create a new center of science and engineering in Massachusetts. But according to Reif, MIT's president, the money was for MIT, not for Chen individually. "This is not an individual collaboration," he said. "It is a departmental one, supported by the institute."One hundred faculty colleagues of Chen's wrote an open letter of support, saying that the activities claimed by the government to be criminal are actually "routine and even innocuous," and that "the complaint against Gang Chen is a complaint against all of us."Load-Date: February 11, 2021End of Document

Sen. Grassley: Increased Communication Between Our Government Agencies Will Save LivesTargeted News ServiceMarch 16, 2021 Tuesday 7:30 AM  ESTCopyright 2021 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 891 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodySen. Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa, issued the following floor statement on March 15, 2021:* * *I'm going to discuss a very important issue that I started to investigate during the last Congress and one that the Executive Branch must continue to improve upon; Information sharing between the Intelligence Community and the Department of Health and Human Services.The connection between those two entities is a critical information sharing data point and it must last beyond the current pandemic.To state the obvious, the health care landscape has evolved considerably in the past several decades.More specifically, the health care landscape has changed considerably in just the last year with the COVID pandemic.Threats to healthcare now include cyber, intelligence and counterintelligence threats.For example, we know the Chinese government engaged in cyber-attacks to steal American COVID-related research.The communist Chinese government will stop at nothing to steal our hard-earned work product.They know, as does the world, that the best of the best is still right here in America.Last Congress, as Chairman of the Finance Committee, I focused a good deal of my oversight efforts on the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of National Security.For example, in June of 2019, I held a hearing on foreign threats to taxpayer-funded research where the Office of National Security was one of the government witnesses.After the hearing, I held a classified committee briefing with all the government witnesses to further discuss the foreign threats that we face.That office is the Department's connection to the Intelligence Community and, accordingly, it plays a critical part in the Department's overall mission.That mission includes pandemic response and countering national security threats.To fully perform its mission, it needs access to Intelligence Community products and databases. With that access, they'd have information that's vital to mitigating threats to the Department, its funded partners and its interagency colleagues.So, as part of my oversight efforts, and before the pandemic started, I worked to get that done.I noted my concerns to the Trump administration that the Office of National Security hadn't been adequately incorporated into the Intelligence Community.To their credit, the Trump administration rightfully - and quickly - resolved many of those issues.The Trump administration created links and information sharing between the Intelligence Community and the Department of Health and Human Services that hadn't existed before.Those links should've existed many years ago, but prior administrations, like the Obama/Biden administration, failed to see around the corner and get the job done.For example, even with the swine flu and outbreaks across the globe, the Obama/Biden administration failed to plug the Department of Health and Human Services into the Intelligence Community the way that it should've been.The current pandemic exemplifies the need to have a robust intelligence apparatus that includes the Department of Health and Human Services.As pathogenic threats to our homeland and our people increase and become more complex, the federal government must prepare well in advance for a quick response.In order to accomplish that task, the government must focus on the seamless communication between and among various Departments and agencies.The federal government must take a whole of government approach.One serious barrier to that seamless communication is over-classification.In January of 2020, when reports began to circulate about COVID, I instructed my oversight and investigations staff to get a classified briefing from the Office of National Security.After that briefing, I made clear in a public way that over-classification during a public health emergency could have deadly consequences.If certain intelligence work product is classified in a certain way, sometimes other government agencies won't have access.The federal government must guard against over-classification.That's especially important during emergency situations that demand quick action.To the extent that disagreements exist between agencies, which they often do in complex and ever-changing fact patterns, discussions must be had between and among the government.From that, the facts will bear out and the best decisions can be made.That process can't take place if the government puts information in silos that federal health agencies are unable to access.Over-classification is even more of a problem when China's government refuses to share relevant data with researchers.At least this government, our government, can - and should - share information between and among its agencies.This Administration must advance and improve upon the cooperative gains created by the Trump administration and make sure that the left hand continues to talk to the right hand.The last thing that we should do is revert to the lack of cooperation that existed before, especially in light of the current pandemic.The cooperation between federal health agencies and the Intelligence Community will strengthen ties between them for decades to come and the American people will be better served by the increased communication.Simply said, increased communication will save lives.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7419683 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: March 16, 2021End of Document

CSIS: 'Confronting the Challenge of Chinese State Capitalism'Targeted News ServiceJanuary 23, 2021 Saturday 9:40 AM  ESTCopyright 2021 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2635 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Center for Strategic and International Studies issued the following commentary by Jude Blanchette entitled "Confronting the Challenge of Chinese State Capitalism":Jude Blanchette holds the Freeman Chair in China Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C.This commentary is part of CSIS's Global Forecast 2021 essay series.* * *One of the most pressing challenges the Biden administration will face is how to compete with, and push back against, China's increasingly powerful and disruptive state capitalist system, which not only threatens U.S. economic and strategic interests, but also undermines the regulatory and legal architecture that underpins the global economy.The problem is daunting. China now has more companies on the Fortune Global 500 list than does the United States (124 versus 121), with nearly 75 percent of these being state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Three of the world's five largest companies are Chinese (Sinopec Group, State Grid, and China National Petroleum). China's largest SOEs hold dominant market positions in many of the most critical and strategic industries, from energy to shipping to rare earths. According to Freeman Chair calculations, the combined assets for China's 96 largest SOEs total more than $63 trillion, an amount equivalent to nearly 80 percent of global GDP. The size and scale of these entities is partly a function of China's massive domestic market, but more important is the fact that SOEs operating in strategic sectors (e.g., banking, infrastructure, telecommunications, energy) are shielded from domestic and foreign competition and are immune from any antitrust scrutiny by the Chinese government.While SOEs are not unique to China, the level of political control wielded over them is. As Xi Jinping declared in 2016, SOEs should become "stronger, better, and bigger." In 2017, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) amended its constitution to assert that the Party "plays a leadership role" in firm decisionmaking. That same year, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology head Xiao Yaqing, then the head of the central SOE regulator, said: "To give full play of the Party's leadership and its core political role, SOEs should stick to the political principle that all SOEs must be under the Party's leadership."The problem is not limited to SOEs nor to the traditional sectors that comprise the "commanding heights" of the global economy. Backed by a thicket of subsidies and industrial policies, a domestic market that restricts foreign competition in strategic sectors, and aided by generous state lending, China's private firms have been propelled into the global market and now vie with U.S. and European firms for leadership in cutting-edge technologies, including robotics, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and telecommunications.While many of these companies are truly innovative, lose business opportunities to SOE cousins, and in an ideal world prefer to operate in a market free from heavy-handed state involvement, it is also undeniable that they often benefit from a domestic political-economic order that has invested significant sources to ensure that they become major international players. As one senior Chinese official put it bluntly in an interview earlier this year, "Regardless of whether state-owned or private enterprises, they are all Chinese enterprises."Rather than operating as a collection of individual, profit-first firms (as is the case in most developed Western economies), the CCP has created a robust set of formal and informal mechanisms that induce connectivity (of varying intensity) between state-owned and nominally private Chinse firms. Companies competing in non-strategic sectors can largely operate on more or less market terms, but for any sector or industry that Beijing has deemed strategic, foreign companies must expect that the Chinese government has placed its fingers on the scales to benefit domestic firms. Thus, when a U.S. or European firms compete against, say, COSCO Shipping or Huawei, it is the entirety of the Chinese government's balance sheet that it must contend with, not just an individual firm. U.S. companies have long tried to prosper within this system by partnering with local firms and keeping ahead of their local rivals, but as Beijing sets it sights much higher up the value-added chain, the space for foreign companies in China is shrinking.Looking beyond China, what gives this state capitalist system such immense global force are the synergies and interconnectivity between and among Chinese firms, state-owned banks and investors, and the Chinese Party-state. This commercial-strategic ecosystem, which I have dubbed "CCP Inc.," possesses an unrivaled ability to deliver the complete value package when entering overseas investment deals: it can buy, build, and finance on a scale and speed that is unmatched.Yet China's state capitalist system is not without significant weaknesses--some of which are already known; some of which are only beginning to emerge as China's international investment environment faces geopolitical headwinds; and some of which, including the long-recognized demographic and productivity challenges; are beginning to bite. While Beijing can leverage its super-sized and super-scaled SOEs to consolidate dominant market positions in strategic global industries, this comes at a price, not least of which is the squeeze placed on China's more efficient and productive private sector. As the Peterson Institute's Nick Lardy persuasively argues, "The resumption of state-led growth, in which a growing share of resources is flowing into investment by relatively low productivity state firms, and an increasingly omnipresent party are contributing to China's growth slowdown." While the Xi administration has taken recent steps to boost the performance of SOEs, there will inevitably remain a critical tension between the size of the state sector and China's positive growth trajectory.Yet regardless of the long-term viability of Chinese state capitalism, the near-term implications for the United States are significant, from the inherent propensity to unleash waves of industrial and technological overcapacity that undercut U.S. firms, to the crucial role SOEs and state-backed firms play in supporting the Chinese military's modernization and overseas expansion. Waiting for China's political or economic system to grind to a halt is an unwise strategy given Beijing's four-decade long streak of seemingly defying the laws of economic gravity.How, then, should Washington respond?Despite concerted efforts by the outgoing Trump administration to put significant economic pressure on Beijing in the hopes that it would abandon or adjust its statist approach to industrial policy, the Biden administration will confront a China more statist and more determined to ensure its companies occupy dominant positions over key technologies and resources both at home and abroad. Now projected to grow at an astounding 7.9 percent this coming year (per IMF forecasts), and arguably having confronted the pandemic more ably than most other large countries, China also will also likely behave with a confidence the United States has not yet encountered.This means that the United States must first recognize the limits of its ability to shake the Xi administration, and the CCP more generally, from its current techno-statist approach to industrial planning, economic development, and global integration. Indeed, there is a good argument to be made that many of the Trump administration's efforts to cut China off from global supply chains and constrain investment in key companies only further convinced the Xi that state capitalism is the best--and only--viable path forward.Yet Chinese firms--both private and state-owned--do not have an inherent right to market economies if they are not willing to operate transparently and according to the rules of the game. On this, several of the initiatives started under the Trump administration to demand more transparency into the ownership structure and political connections of Chinese firms seeking to invest in the United States should be continued yet refined. New legislation and increased efforts by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board's (PCAOB) to bring Chinese companies listed on U.S. exchanges into auditing compliance is one notable example.Related to this, the Biden administration should task relevant agencies with drafting summaries of existing legal and regulatory tools that might be employed to better protect U.S. interests from market-distorting actions of state-owned or state-backed Chinese firms. The United States already has a robust toolkit for combating behavior that is market distorting and threatens national security, but too often, existing regulations that might pertain to problematic Chinese firms just are not enforced, as in the case of long-ignored flouting of auditing standards.The Biden administration should continue to build and expand the capacity of government agencies and the intelligence community to monitor and track the sprawling network of Chinese firms. This includes both increased funding for developing better tools and technologies to capture open-source information, but equally as important, resources to train and hire subject matter experts to interpret and analyze the incoming data flows. There is a treasure trove of open-source material available, including bond prospectuses, annual reports, ownership and financial databases, niche industry publications, as well as company government websites that can help answer key questions, including:How and where do Chinese firms raise capital?How are they state-supported and subsidized, and how have these types of support evolved to evade international scrutiny?How are they leveraging joint-ventures and other forms of formal partnerships with foreign firms to gain access to technology and talent?How might increased transparency requirements impact their ability to raise funds, engage in mergers and acquisitions, and operate globally?What do procurement documents tell us about the Chinese government's technological and domestic security priorities?One important area of focus should be creating new tools to map ownership structures. Indeed, one of the single biggest factors aiding the expansion of SOEs and private companies globally is their ability to mask ownership through a labyrinthine network of obscured ownership and a proliferating network of subsidiaries. This helps mask their connections to the Chinese government and circumvent competition regulation, commercial and investment law, and sanctions. Consider one astounding statistic: "The average number of firms of the largest 100 [Chinese] conglomerates increased from 500 to more than 15 thousand from 1995 to 2015." This translates into 1.5 million total companies, and that's just for the top 100 business groups.There's also important work to be done to bridge the information divide between corporate America and the U.S government. With obvious exceptions, the majority of U.S. companies do not want to willingly support China's expansionist and illiberal activities, yet individual firms are ill-equipped to track and trace complex ownership structures, investments, and global supply chains that might be problematic. More robust and readily available tools and information must be made available to U.S. and companies from partner countries to help them decrease their knowing exposure to firms linked to the CCP or People's Liberation Army (PLA).Now the hard part.There is no long-term strategy for successfully competing against Chinese state capitalism that does not include significant investments in the United States' own domestic infrastructure, educational system, health care, and governance capacity. Absent a deep and enduring commitment to rebuilding internal competitiveness, as well as creating an economic system that is vastly more inclusive, the United States can only tread water while China continues to march toward the future.Frustration with China's brand of industrial policy stems from its opacity and its deeply mercantilist objectives, not from the mere fact that it the Chinese government seeks to boost the competitiveness of Chinese firms. While still considered a four-letter word to some, the United States should begin a conversation on creating its own market-friendly industrial policy. Indeed, as my colleagues Matt Goodman and Dylan Gerstel have pointed out, the United States has already seen a number of important technological successes as a result of industrial policy initiatives. "Since World War II, Washington has used military procurement and large research and development (R&D) budgets to accelerate the development of cutting-edge technologies that serve as the foundation of the modern economy, ranging from the Internet, satellites, GPS, aircraft, vaccines, supercomputing, and the components of smartphones." Obviously, given the deep political divisions and the long-standing inability to prioritize domestic "nation building," the challenge is immense. Yet there is no other path.Next, it is imperative the United States find overlap and synergies with like-minded countries that share apprehensions about the statist elements of China's economic rise. Adopting a unilateral approach to deterring problematic Chinese investments is unavoidably inadequate, given the highly integrated nature of global technology, human capital, and financial markets. While the European Union's recent agreement to move forward with the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI) with China might feel like a gut punch to the incoming administration, there remains significant underlying concern in many European capitals about the economic and national security risks that China's SOEs and state-backed firms pose to their own national interests.The United States should start by finding ways to accumulate small, ad hoc partnerships where they can be forged. One concrete example: the creation of a coalition of like-minded market economies to share intelligence that tracks the transactions, ownership, and financing of firms (SOE or otherwise) suspected of working to further the interests of CCP and PLA geostrategic goals. To start with, the core of this group should be a "Five Eyes Plus," with the addition of the European Union and Japan. Of course, the grouping can be expanded, assuming applicants can ensure they are capable of protecting sensitive intelligence. Related to this, my colleague Bonnie Glaser has also recently outlined several smart steps the United States can take to work with partners and allies in order to blunt Chinese economic coercion, which is often implemented through Chinese commercial firms.Last, the United States should lead a global conversation about creating new sets of rules and institutions that can facilitate and sustain cross-border trade, investment, and technology given the extraordinary changes in just the past few decades. As others have argued, the existing array of institutions created in the twentieth century that did so much to promote global integration, the World Trade Organization most prominently, were not designed to deal with the size and complexity of China's sui generis "socialist market economy." Building an economic order for this century is, of course, a vast undertaking, but as the recent splintering of ties between the United States and China demonstrates, in the absence of effective mediating institutions, economic and financial frictions can metastasize to become geopolitical tensions.[Category: Political][Category: ThinkTank1]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7361341 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: January 23, 2021End of Document

The richest man in China, "disappeared" after his frictions with the government?CE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 11, 2021 MondayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 771 wordsBodyCHINA.-The founder of E-commerce giant Alibaba and China's richest man thanks to his $65.6 billion fortune, Jack Ma, has not appeared in public since late October 2020, weeks when the relationship between Beijing and the conglomerate he created has deteriorated.In recent weeks, the international press has speculated on Ma's whereabouts - creating the term "disappeared" - while Chinese official media maintain a coordinated mutism that coincides with information on Beijing's alleged orders not to provide media coverage of the recently opened antitrust investigation against Alibaba.However, sources aware of the situation today explained to Efe that Ma is trying to keep a "low profile" and that he is "fine," while calling rumours that he has been arrested or that the authorities have banned him from leaving the country as "unfounded."In November, Ma did not participate in the jury of the television show he founded, "The Heroes of Business in Africa," and was replaced by another Alibaba executive, which raised those alarms given his apparent frictions with the Chinese government in recent times.PERSISTENT SPECULATIONIn recent years, some of the best-known figures in China have "disappeared" after committing crimes or having disputes with the authorities and then reappear months later, such as the popular actress Fan Bingbing, of which nothing was known for several months in 2018 following a tax evasion case.However, Ma seems to be trying not to cause any more stirs in the face of Beijing's heavy hand, which in November forced the suspension of the IPO of Ma's 'fintech', which was to be the largest operation of its kind in history.Either way, Ma, a public figure who doesn't shy away from cameras or microphones - he recorded his own kung fu movie and appeared on stage imitating Michael Jackson during a company event - he didn't want to get through the rumours, and neither have Alibaba or Ant officially.What both firms have done is issue several communiqués in which they ensure that their operations remain normal and that they will cooperate with the authorities.It should be remembered that Ma left the presidency of Alibaba in 2019 - 20 years after its founding - and that he has no executive position in Ant, although he is a majority shareholder of it.Meanwhile, on Chinese social media such as the popular Weibo, equivalent to Twitter, his vast legion of followers ask the entrepreneur, popularly known as "Professor Ma" for his professional past in teaching English, to give some clue to his whereabouts, while his detractors call him an unscrupulous "capitalist" and claim that he will be "punished."And in the Baidu search engine - equivalent to Google - predictions when typing Ma Yun (his name in Chinese) go through "Jack Ma went into exile", "Jack Ma sentenced to prison" or "Jack Ma, missing", which shows that speculation is persistent among the citizens of the Asian country.CRITICISM AND ATTEMPTS TO CALM THE WATERSJust before Ant's failed IMO, Ma raised great controversy in China by delivering a speech in which he harshly criticized China's strategy of minimizing risks in the financial sector, ensuring that "innovation is always accompanied by risks" and that "the greatest risk is when you try to minimize risk to zero."The richest man in China, whohe is also a member of the Communist Party (PCCh), he reserved some bullets then against traditional banks, of which he claimed that they are heading as "pawnshops" to defend the need for alternative funding channels such as those offered by Ant through its Alipay platform.Days later, Chinese regulators called Ma and Ant's executives a chapter and published a much more restrictive new regulation for 'fintech', something that led some experts to speculate that the entrepreneur already knew the content of that new regulation and was trying to force a renegotiation of its terms through public criticism, something not excessively common in such a high-profile figure in China.In recent weeks, both the state press and senior regulatory bodies have criticized these funding pathways, ensuring that financial innovation is a "double-edged sword" and that some of the companies in the sector, without directly targeting Ant, operate "in violation of regulations under the banner of innovation, causing enormous financial and social risks."Faced with the onslells of Beijing, Ant decided to lower credit limits to younger users of his Huabei and Ma virtual card service, according to The Wall Street Journal, and would have offered authorities to take control of any of the company's platforms "as long as the country needs them."Load-Date: January 12, 2021End of Document

Good Friday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Friday, March 26th. Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the east coast, fragile and confused, President Biden speaks at his first official press conference at times talking himself into dead ends. When asked about foreign policy, particularly China, he appeared to read his answer word for word from a card.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're not looking for confrontation. Although we know there will be steep, steep competition. We'll have strong competition, but we'll insist that China play by the international rules, fair competition, fair practices, fair trade.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: He also said that he will not criticize China's goal of becoming the world's leading country. We'll be covering this and all of his other's answers all morning long this morning. We'll talk with Eurasia Group President, Ian Bremmer. He will weigh in coming up. And from the White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany later this hour.Meanwhile, this, China's international erasure new sanctions for U.K. companies who call out China for treatment and abuse of Uighurs in Xinjiang. Companies such as H&M, for example, have vanished from old Chinese maps. How the U.S. should respond coming up.Markets are rallying this morning with the high up in the morning take a look at Futures extending gains of yesterday even as the NASDAQ turns negative. Dow Industrials right now up 147, the S&P is higher by 8, but the NASDAQ goes lower by 50 points.Yesterday a late day, a rebound in cyclical stocks up the major indices and near the session highs, Dow Industrials were up 200 points and NASDAQ was up 15 and the S&P 500 higher by 20 points.European markets also higher this morning. Take a look at the indices in Europe. And we see the FTSE 100 up 49, the CAC cropped up 28, and the DAX index higher by 113. In Asia overnight green across the board all the major indices up better than 1 percent.Mornings with Maria is live right now.Now, some of the top stories that we are watching this morning, President Biden dodging questions about the crisis at the border yesterday during his first official news conference since taking office. He is blaming the surge of migrants on former President Trump again, even though the Biden administration said earlier this month that the U.S. is on track to encounter more migrants than it has in 20 years. But according to President Biden, nothing has changed. Except, oh yes, there's a nice guy in the White House.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: I guess I should be flattered people are coming because I'm the nice guy. That's the reason why it's happening. That I'm a decent man whoever's phrase that, you know, that's why they're coming because Joe Biden's a good guy. The vast majority, the overwhelming majority of people coming to the border and crossing are being sent back.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Overwhelming majority that's just not true. New photos also show the President holding cheat sheets. The cheat cards during the news conference detailing key policy points as well as headshots of -- and names of reporters that he planned to call on that was all planned in advance.Gridlock growing in Egypt Suez Canal. Meanwhile, crews are still working to dislodge a cargo ship that's blocking the waterway in both directions. The canal is a major transit point for many products including oil and shippers are taking alternative routes to get the supplies of oil and gas and other goods to their destination. Oil prices this morning are higher on this news. Take a look, the price of crude now up two and two-thirds percent at $60.09 a barrel.China is hitting back putting sanctions on U.K. lawmakers now and entities after the U.K. teamed up with the United States and other Western countries to do the same against Beijing earlier this week. President Biden spoke out about the future of the West's relationship with China during that news conference watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: I've known Xi Jinping for a long time. I made it clear to him again. When I've told him in person on several occasions that we're not looking for confrontation, although we know there will be steep, steep competition.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is the President of the Eurasia Group and the President of GZERO Media, Ian Bremmer, also with us all morning long this morning is James Freeman from the Wall Street Journal and Brian Brenberg, great to see everybody this morning. Ian thanks very much for joining me. Welcome back to the program.I guess let me get your assessment of where we are in this competition with China and your reaction to how the U.S. is handling this threat. As we know the CCP wants to put China back where they say it rightfully belongs as the number one superpower of the world which would be overtaking the United States.IAN BREMMER, EURASIA GROUP PRESIDENT: You know, as you know, Maria, that meeting we had an anchorage was extremely contentious. The speech that was given at the beginning by Yang Jiechi who runs foreign policy at the Communist Party, probably the most antagonistic speech by senior official directed right at the United States since Vladimir Putin in Munich back in 2007. So it was a really big deal.I think the thing they are angriest about right now, is the fact that the Biden administration is looking to coordinate policies of sanctions that they see as containment oriented policies with other countries around the world. They find that unacceptable. And they're going after the U.K., as you said earlier this week, they also went after the European Union.They're basically saying, look, guys, we are absolutely critical for you economically, and we're going to make you pay, if you think you can get away with telling us what how we're going to run our internal affairs. And from China's perspective, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the Uighur issue are all sovereign Chinese issues, and we have zero business telling them what to do. The Americans have no moral authority, the Chinese say. And the Europeans have no power position to be able to do so. And that's how you're seeing them respond.BARTIROMO: Yes. But I mean, I think the whole world should be worried about this if in fact, the CCP is trying to make the communists be the dominant superpower. Look, you've got the CCP, you know, state media run "Global Times" newspaper calling for boycotts of brands like H&M, Burberry, Nike over the concerns of the forced labor of the Uighur Muslims. "The Journal" reports on this this morning in well, a story in the paper as well as on the editorial board."The Journal" op-ed says Beijing's global canceled culture in writing the Communist Party's strategy is to use China's market power as leverage to shutdown critics anywhere in the world. China will continue these commercial beatings until they no longer work in. And, you know, it was really stunning to me reading the story in "The Journal" this morning about what the CCP has done to H&M.And on Thursday, you couldn't even order a car to an H&M store. It was impossible on DiDi, that's like the Uber of China the country's largest ride hailing app, because it did not recognize the brand as a valid destination, Ian. You search for H&M on multiple Chinese map apps, including Baidu, others, zero results as if the clothing company did not even exist, despite the fact that, Ian, it has 400 stores in China right now.BREMMER: Yes, well, maybe 400 stores not for long, Maria. I mean, look, the fact is that the Chinese --BARTIROMO: Yes, you're right.BREMMER: -- economy, as you know, is the second largest economy in the world. It's on track to being the first within a decade. And the Chinese government is making very clear that they are intending to use that power against countries that behave in ways they don't like.Remember, there's a massive trade war going on with Australia right now. It doesn't get as much news here in the United States.BARTIROMO: That's right.BREMMER: Time zones a bit off. But I mean, you know, they weren't -- they're not selling their wine. They're not selling their spiny lobsters. And there were dozens and dozens of Australian ships loaded up with commodities just sitting there. The Chinese had promised they were going to buy and suddenly because the Australians teamed up with the United States and calling for an investigation into the initial cover of the human transmission of coronavirus, the Chinese government said, we are going to take it to you Australia.No, they wouldn't do that to the United States directly because we're much more powerful. But Australia, the United Kingdom, they're making these direct policies because individually, these countries are much weaker. They're also much more dependent on China. And in many cases, China is going to win.I mean, I've been talking to a lot of South American leaders over the last few months who are telling me that they're not going to align with the United States on 5G, not because they don't want to, they'd much rather be with the Americans than the Chinese. But because the Chinese investment and trade is so important to them, and they can't afford, they don't think they can afford economically to antagonize them. This is our backyard we're talking about Maria.BARTIROMO: Yes. No, this is very dangerous and, you know, look anybody who doesn't understand the issues and the ramifications will be really sorry about this later. Brian Brenberg, jump in here. I've been giving Australia's government a shout out, good for them to be tough enough to stand up to China, stand up to big tech because, you know, somebody's got to stop the CCP with this bullying across the world, Brian.PROFESSOR BRIAN BRENBERG, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: Agree with that totally Maria. But Ian, what's interesting to me is, as you said that CCP wouldn't go directly to the United States like they have with Australia. But they will go directly to U.S. companies. That's where they see their point of leverage. They want U.S. companies to carry their water globally.In my -- to my mind, U.S. companies are not ready for this. The NBA wasn't ready for this. Disney wasn't ready for this. Now Nike is being punished. Do you think America's corporations when push comes to shove, can stand up for American values or do you see them folding in zapped with China's betting on?BREMMER: Well, let's be clear that you -- some of the most important American corporations out there, like Facebook, like Google, like Amazon, actually have no access to the Chinese data market, by far the largest data market in the world. So they're already when they go and they testify in Congress, they're already taking a much tougher line on China because their shareholders aren't making any money in China.Now, it's very interesting, Tesla, one of the most important companies in the United States, massive value right now, Elon Musk, one of the wealthiest in the world. He's been incredibly nice to the Chinese. And he's also been developing a lot of his technology there. He's willing to take an axe to the SEC in the United States, but not to the Chinese government.But on the back of the anchorage meeting, you may have seen the headlines that the Chinese government decided that Tesla's can't be on military bases because they could be spying, you know, the cameras, they have the 360 degree views. You know, the fact as you say, American companies are going to be squeezed hard if the Chinese government thinks that that's a point of leverage to diminish the level of policy, sanctions, tariffs, and the rest that are as well as just calling on the Chinese on human rights and the rest that are coming out of Washington right now.And as you know, one of the only areas of strong bipartisan agreement, you guys can say that Biden did a good or a bad job yesterday, but the Democrats and the Republicans largely agree on U.S. policy towards China right now. There are a lot of U.S. corporations that feel a lot softer, at least when they're on the record, because they're making a lot of money there. And so that is an area of leverage for the Chinese government. They know that.BARTIROMO: That's absolutely right. And Ian I agree, this whole fight and competition between the U.S. and China were really more accurately, China and the free world is going to play out in the corporate sector. That's where this is going to play out because it's companies that can actually take the stand. A lot of them have been letting us down and letting the free world down in this very subject, because of what you said. They're making a lot of money on it.Ian, it's always great to get your insights on all of this. Thanks -- yes, go ahead, final word, Ian, go ahead.BREMMER: Watch the Olympics, Mitt Romney came out last week big op-ed saying that we shouldn't punish our athletes.BARTIROMO: Yes.BREMMER: But the corporate shouldn't sponsor, the tourists shouldn't go, the Chinese government is going to squeeze the corporations to say you better sponsor if you want to continue to work here. This is just coming up early next year. This is going to become very, very contentious, Maria.BARTIROMO: Well, I'll tell you one thing, the Beijing Olympics is not on my calendar. And that is just outrageous. We've been talking about that op-ed for the last week, Ian. And the bottom line is one congressman told us they think, he thinks they're going to be taking the athletes DNA. You have to understand what you're walking into, if you're going to go to Beijing and go to the Olympics, with all of the data and surveillance going on in Communist China. It's important for everybody to understand the risks.Ian, great to see you. Thank you so much. We'll see you soon. Ian Bremmer, joining us there. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Well, welcome back economic optimism on the upswing with an increasing number of Americans getting vaccinated, more stimulus checks hitting bank accounts as we await the February personal income and spending numbers out in about 15 minutes.Joining me right now to discuss where we are is the Co-founder and Chief Economist of Cornerstone Macro, Nancy Lazar. Nancy, it's great to see you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us. Tell us where we are in terms of this recovery. You were among the first to say you are expecting growth in 2021. And then slowly but surely you kept increasing your growth expectations. Now you're up to what, 9 percent GDP in 2021?NANCY LAZAR, CORNERSTONE MACRO CO-FOUNDER: Yes, this is going to be the strongest recovery since 1959. If you want to look at more recent history, just a little bit stronger than what we had in 1983.So most of the investment community has never seen the type of strength we think we're going to feel here as we move into the second quarter of 2021. We actually had a hint of that right in the third quarter a year ago where you have that surge in GDP, 30 percent surge in GDP, 40 percent surge in consumer spending.So we've seen hints of how strong this economy can indeed be. But today, it's going to be sustained. Last year, it was just for several months. This year, as we say, you've got the vaccine. You have the stimulus. We've been highlighting you have huge drivers of growth, which the stimulus is indeed fueling.And so yesterday's unemployment claims number was another good example of potentially what we're going to see going ahead, some really, really strong economic data as we end the first quarter go into the second quarter.BARTIROMO: Yes, you've been so spot on, Nancy. Tell me where the growth is coming from, because initially, you've written about the stimulus checks those $1,400 checks going into people's mailboxes. And that's what you are seeing a pretty good spike in consumer spending.But then this most recent research, you're zeroing in on this upcoming infrastructure plan. President Biden planning to unveil his multitrillion dollar plan next week. It's expected to include tax increases to pay for it. So tell me about the plan stimulus, the $3 trillion infrastructure or climate package and whether or not higher taxes offset that in terms of economic growth.LAZAR: So first, we've already been seen a infrastructure cycle that the private sector capital spending cycle has already helped put in place, state and local spending on infrastructure. Actually during the pandemic, state and local spending on infrastructure actually rose is at a near record high of over 5 percent year over year. That's important, because now you're going to get public sector support for a part of the economy that's already relatively healthy. And that just increases the odds.We're going to have a pretty robust infrastructure backdrop supported by the government. But more importantly, led by the private sector and the capital spending, we're seeing the construction of manufacturing facilities be at onshoring, foreign companies coming into the United States, or domestic companies like Intel, building new production facilities. That's what really drives infrastructure spending. And it's going to be very, very powerful, because now you're going to have the backing of the federal government.Tax increases, I think that's unfortunate, to the extent to which it is the private sector that creates jobs. The administration is very concerned about the U.S. consumer, making sure people get jobs. The way you do that is you incentivize businesses to invest. You don't tax them, which is an incremental disincentive. From what we are understanding is their -- Biden is likely to ask for 28 percent corporate tax rate. Our policy team down in Washington, Andy and Don lean a little bit more towards 25 percent likely being the kind of compromise in Washington, that's not a negative game changer. It keeps us in line with Canada and Mexico.It's not positive to be sure, but it's not a negative game changer. Because as we're seeing, there's a need for domestic capital spending in this country, the supply chains are totally screwed up because of COVID, Brexit, and now this darn ship. And so at the end of the day, we need to bring our supply chain back home. And so we're going to have a capital spending cycle, whether or not they increase taxes, but I sure wish they wouldn't do that.BARTIROMO: And you are expecting a pretty good spike in jobs. You talk about construction jobs and other jobs that are benefiting from this infrastructure package. Any thoughts on that as well as this most recent issue in the Suez Canal, Nancy, I mean, it's blocked, there's a blockage there after that container ship got stuck three days ago.Some people say it's going to take weeks to dislodge this vessel. Has this -- have you put this into your model at all? I know that you're looking for a nice spike in jobs as a result of all the infrastructure conversation and implementation.LAZAR: So first, on jobs, we're really excited about blue collar jobs, with capital spending, what manufacturing activity does increasing broader footprint of people being able to get jobs. And that's really, really exciting. So we think employment rate will be down 3.5 percent by the end of this year. On the Suez Canal, it's problematic. It's unfortunate it's happening at the same time, the world is reopening. It'll create temporary price increases, but we don't think it disrupts the strong growth trajectory.BARTIROMO: Nancy, it's so great to get your insights on all, thank you so much. Nancy Lazar from Cornerstone Macro, we'll be right back.JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: -- if not the letter of the First Amendment pressuring these companies to stifle conservative news and commentary. This is a massive problem. And I don't think you could be encouraged by this week's hearing.BARTIROMO: No, I don't think so either. And, you know, Brian, how do you think these CEOs came off after testifying, I'll just point out that the other day, Jen Psaki was asked about what we know to be true that the former mayor of Moscow's wife, sent $3.5 check to Hunter Biden, he received the check 3.5 million and it was from the wife of the former mayor of Moscow. She said she hadn't heard that story.BRENBERG: Maria, I think the CEOs in this hearing are basically trying to figure out, you know, where the political winds are blowing, who's going to be in charge, and how they can play the game to get on the right side of the party in power right now. That's my concern, and I share it with James. In that hearing, you saw two sides coming down on tech, you saw one side saying you're suppressing speech, you saw the other side the left saying you're not suppressing speech enough. I think the CEOs are trying to figure out which of those two sides is going to have political power, and they're going to position themselves to get on that side. This to me is not good news if you care about free speech.BARTIROMO: No, and not good news if you care about a real media, the real press. It's not there.Quick break and then we're waiting some key economic data February personal income and spending are out right after the break. And we'll have those numbers for you stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Big decline in February personal income. We've got the income and spending numbers right now. Here's Cheryl Casone with the numbers. Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, these numbers are pretty intriguing here, Maria.So, first, I want to -- I want to start with the spending numbers, the consumption spending. This is February. We were looking for a decline of .7 percent. We came in at a decline of 1 percent. So, we actually are a little bit weaker on that number.If you go to the income number, this is interesting. We were looking for a decline of 7.3 percent, we got a little bit better than expected number down 7.1 percent.They also revised the January number. We have had a 10 percent income number for January that revise that to 10.1 percent. So, these numbers are very, very volatile right now.Let's go to core PCE, if we can. PCE, the month over month, we were looking for a gain of .1 percent. We got a gain of 1.4 percent. And then core PC, the year over year expectation was a gain of 1.5 percent. And we got 1.6 percent. So, again, really kind of all over the map.You know, I think as we move into these numbers that will go out over the next four weeks, we'll get those stimulus checks that have been going out after the $1.9 trillion stimulus package that will skew these numbers, again, for March. But this is what we are getting, Maria, for February. Back to you.BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, even though, Cheryl, these numbers are worse than expected both on the spending and the income side, you're not seeing much of a reaction in markets. Dow Industrials up 137 points right now, the NASDAQ was lower going into the number, down 64 right now and the S&P higher by five and a quarter.Cheryl Casone, thank you so much for those numbers.We've been talking all morning about President Biden holding his first official press conference yesterday. The President repeatedly lost his train of thought, watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The best way to get something done if you if you hold near and dear to you that you like to be able to -- anyway, we're ready to get a lot done.When I was United States Senator, I mean, Vice President.Am I giving you too long answer, because if you don't want the detail? No, but I mean, I don't know how much detail you want about immigration.OK. Where am I here? Let me see.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you agree?BIDEN: Yes.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: If not, why not abolish it if it's a relic of the Jim Crow era?BIDEN: And so, I'm convinced that we'll be able to stop this because it is the most pernicious thing. This makes Jim Crow look like Jim Eagle.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Yes, just abolish it now, just ran through all legislation. Don't have any debate about it.Joining me right now is former White House Press Secretary, Fox News Contributor, Kayleigh McEnany.Kayleigh, it's great to have you this morning.KAYLEIGH MCENANY, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Good to join you.BARTIROMO: Wow, you saw that clip of President Biden. It's unfortunate that the world has to view this. It's -- nobody wants to see it. What's your reaction?MCENANY: And this is why he doesn't do events like this. This is why -- Look, he had this in the East Room, notably different than the Brady press briefing room. And I would argue having been in both rooms, that the press briefing room is far more contentious. The heat gets a little hotter there. It's more interactive. You don't have someone holding the microphone for you.And they knew, you know, he couldn't thrive in that environment. So, they did this as controlled as they possibly could with the staffer holding the microphone because they know he does not thrive in these settings. But what is interesting to me Maria is you know they finally did the press conference but what about the joint address. If they're not comfortable with the back and forth of Q&A, at least have him stand up and give a speech for an hour and a half as joint addresses normally are and lay out his vision, but maybe they don't believe he can even do that.BARTIROMO: It's really extraordinary. What did you make of the media, how the media's treatment of President Biden, during his first press conference differs from the treatment of President Trump. And and frankly, the treatment of you when you were at that podium?MCENANY: Yes, that's right. Totally different.I mean, you saw very few interruptions, you saw a myriad of interruptions with President Trump. I just randomly went back and watched one of the first press conferences that came up on YouTube of President Trump, just to remind myself of the temperature in the room.And the very first question from ABC's John Karl, in that briefing I watched, which was from September of 2020 was, why did you lie to the American people? And how can we ever trust you again. I remember another question and another briefing being, do you regret all of your lies?I mean, that kind of assumption embedded in a question so hostile, so negative, such mistreatment of a sitting president of the United States. You can't even envision a question like that being asked of Joe Biden, nor should it. I think there should be a modicum of respect between a president and a press corps.BARTIROMO: Well, I mean, there's also reason to believe that they were falsities told yesterday, and nobody pushed back on him. For example, President Biden said, the overwhelming number of migrants that show up to the border are being sent back. And that's just not true. The overwhelming, the majority of the people showing up at the border are being sent back?MCENANY: Yes, it's not true. And of course, an Axios report this week saying 13 percent of families are being sent back just, 13 percent. But that was one of a number of mistruths. As you noted, you know, him saying they're not coming because of my policies, when we have many migrants on tape, specifically saying I am coming here because of President Biden, while some are wearing Biden t-shirts. We know that that is a fact.And what is so frustrating Maria is where the fact checkers. You know, I woke up this morning to monitor the news, and you had the Associated Press saying Biden skews some figures.I mean, think about that language, with President Trump it was never skews a figure it was. He lied. And it's inexcusable. That's how they covered President Trump.But with Biden, it's just a little skew of the figures. That's the headline. The fact checkers are derelict in their duty.BARTIROMO: It's very discouraging. How should the American people deal with this? I mean, you've got obviously a press corps that wants Biden to win, and wants things like policy of ending the filibuster to get through. That one reporter that we watched earlier, saying, why don't you just abolish it if it's from Jim Crow?I mean, do they understand the ramifications of getting rid of the filibuster, something that both sides of the aisle has said, is needed for real debate on very important legislation that impacts the American people. Get rid of it, then you just have the Democrats ramming through whatever they want to do. And last time I checked, it's not a moderate Democrat. It's the progressives who want to defund the police.MCENANY: That's exactly right, Maria. And I'll never forget President Trump saying to me, and I totally agreed with him at the time. Look, Kayleigh, if we don't get rid of the filibuster, guess who will, Chuck Schumer.And meanwhile, and I know you remember, Maria, the drumbeat of Schumer and Democrats and even Joe Biden years ago saying we can't eliminate the filibuster. It's part of the Senate institution. It's sacred. It's sacrosanct. It's part of history and so important to keeping the whims of an election from changing the makeup of a country.This is what they said just months ago. And yet, here we are, and now all of a sudden, because it's a change in the presidency, it's all of a sudden a relic of Jim Crow. It's so patently dishonest. And so, obviously hypocritical.BARTIROMO: Well, what do you think about the fact that now all the memos have been changed at the White House to call it the Biden-Harris administration? We're not supposed to call it the Biden administration. We're supposed to call it the Biden-Harris administration. Is this a setup to what we could see later on this year? I don't know when, sooner rather than later that Kamala Harris becomes the president.MCENANY: You know, it's so interesting, Maria, because that happened. And it's one thing if it's one mistake, where you know, the Biden-Harris administration, we would just wanted to include our Vice President, but it's not that. We've seen President Biden call Kamala Harris, President Harris, we saw on the campaign where there was some campaign insignia that would basically insinuated the same.So, we've seen this time after time play out. And then him completely abdicating his duty on the border, essentially saying this is just too difficult, I'm going to pass it over to the vice president. It's just one in a series of things that when you add them together, it's really strange and you've got to ask yourself who's calling the shots.By the way, Biden was supposed to be so moderate. This certainly looks more like what a Harris progressive type administration would look like than the so called moderate Biden we were sold on the campaign.BARTIROMO: Yes, you're right. And especially since he's actually saying that he supports ending the filibuster, something that he was against literally for 40 years while in government. He always said, we have to keep the filibuster in there to encourage debate. And now he's saying the opposite. Who's running the show?Is someone telling him, giving him notes? This is what you said on the campaign to say it again. Are the progressives running this country?MCENANY: Exactly. I'd love to know who he's making calls to. Because earlier in the week, we were told by the press secretary that he's in regular communication with President Obama or they consult somewhat. But this is a much different administration than Obama. In the Obama era you had, of course, the filibuster in place you of course had on the border, some notion of compromise with the Gang of Eight immigration bill that had border security in it.Now, what Biden's put forward, has no border security. It is all just an amnesty bill. It's so different. The Green New Deal, HR1 federalizing elections. This is not the Obama administration that was certainly moderate in comparison to what we're seeing.BARTIROMO: Right. But we are pretty much expecting that he's in touch with President Obama and a lot of the people in the White House worked for the Obama administration is sort of like Obama's third term.MCENANY: But it seems like -- it seems like he's --BARTIROMO: The second term was.MCENANY: Yes, I would argue this is the squad administration. I mean, I -- this is the AOC, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib wing of the party. That is a fraction of the Democrat Party that is now taken over and become the whole of the Democrat Party.BARTIROMO: Yes. Somebody wrote to me today, President Biden is PINO, president in name only, because others are obviously at the wheel. It wouldn't be a major mea culpa for him to come out and say, look, we recognize there's a crisis, we're going to put remain in Mexico policy back in place. We're going to put the wall back in place, let the construction continue. We need to send some messages overseas.Would they ever do that? Or is that too much of a mea culpa?MCENANY: I think it's too much of a mea culpa. It's what he should do, though, Maria, to certain points. And, you know, we certainly felt this in the Trump administration when a story was building, and a narrative was setting in. And for us, the scrutiny was under a microscope, because the press is so just, you know, got liberal.Here, though, when you finally have the CNNs and MSNBCs of the world asking about the border, the drumbeat has become too strong, where, yes, you have to have some sort of veering in policy, but it's not going to happen. And this is just going to get worse. And if President Biden thinks these calls for seeing inside these border facilities are going to go away. They are not. And the numbers are going to get worse.We know that in the summer months. So the fact that we're not getting access, that's not going away. Those calls will continue. He should have a change in policy. Yes.BARTIROMO: Yes. Kayleigh, great to talk with you this morning. Thanks very much.We'll keep spotlighting it.MCENANY: Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Kayleigh McEnany, joining us. We'll see you soon, Kayleigh.Coming up, former Culture Club lead singer Boy George in the house talking about the new NFT platform launching exclusive content from musicians. Wait till you hear this one. It's coming up next.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Digital collectibles bringing in millions. NFT's or non-fungible tokens are one of a kind digital assets kept online using the crypto currency to pay for them. Musicians who lost stage time because of the pandemic are using these tokens now to connect with fans. It's a great idea.One of those artists is the legendary singer and lead singer of Culture Club, Boy George. He joins me right now to talk more about it.George, it's great to have you. Congratulations on all your success. We're big fans here. Tell me about the NFT's and what you're selling exactly. And how successful these NFT's have been?BOY GEORGE, SINGER-SONGWRITER: Well, I think it's just a new kind of platform where people are deciding new ways to kind of own things and have relationships with. So, you know, I already make art anywhere. I have my first show last year.One of the greatest things that happened to me this year was selling a piece of art for the NHS here in England, whichever, so for a lot of money. So, that's exciting. You know, making art is really what excites me.So far this year, I've sold stuff, but it's been for charity, which has been amazing. So, you know, that's a nice kind of acknowledgement for being a creative person.I don't think this is a replacement for live shows, because this is just a new emerging sort of world that's happening and people are collecting art in a different way. And also, art is now available to more people.It used to be this thing that was really partial, we weren't allowed near it. You remember?BARTIROMO: Yes. It's hard back.GEORGE: Now is becoming so much a part of what people do. We got the internet. You know, you yourself, you've had a president, you use the internet, social media, everyone's communicating in this new digital way. So, I think it's just something new and exciting.BARTIROMO: Yes.GEORGE: And where it's going to go, I think is what excites me as a creative being, you know.BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, it's nice to see that there are alternatives and there are, you know, it's nice to see that there are alternatives. There are ways to continue generating revenue, even when things have been tough.George, assess where we are for me. I mean, we have been in lockdown. You know, we lost Broadway, we lost concerts. How tough has it been in the music industry? And how do we get out of this?GEORGE: Well, I have to start by saying I've been very lucky because I'm successful and I have a roof over my head, so for that I'm deeply grateful. So, I just kept my head down during this year. But I've been allowed because of the space to make a lot of music.You know, I'm coming up to my 60th birthday. So I've had this luxury of space. My big fear now, is like, I'm going to go back to work and well I forget about what creativity does for my soul. You understand? You know, because working is -- I love working. I'm a workaholic.I love being on tour. Right now I will be in America, not be on tour, I have been for the last four years. So you know, a lot of my work is about being around people. I'm a people person.So, you know, the digital world is just a new way of sort of connecting with people. And I think, as a musician, as an artist, as someone is interested in fashion, all of those things, you just want people to see what you're doing and get a reaction. And that is like looking at a flower or something, you know, looking at a beautiful tree. You know, it just -- you want to do things that make people feel a little bit wonderful and wondrous, I thinkBARTIROMO: Yes. And --GEORGE: I'm trying to -- can I just say that you and I having this kind of conversation on Fox News is just absolutely brilliant and beautiful.BARTIROMO: I'm so happy you feel that way. Oh, I feel the same.GEORGE: Me too. It's such been a nice thing, you know. I love that.BARTIROMO: I love it too, George. We want you know, come back and we want you to be with us more.But let me ask you, do you feel like maybe in the digital world, you can actually reach more people? Right? I mean, because once -- you may not have the energy of the crowds there. But perhaps you can even reach more people globally.GEORGE: Well, of course, already, you know, through the internet, these things like Twitter and Instagram, I can tell a fan in anywhere in Mongolia or in America, happy birthday, I could say Happy Mother's Day.This morning, I sent a message to someone who's posted a message saying he wants to kill himself. And I was like, here's my chance to say something to this kid, to hopefully not keep him going down that road, you know? And social networking is --BARTIROMO: Absolutely.GEORGE: -- a beautiful thing. And it's a hostile thing. A lot of people get hurt on social networking, and a lot of people connect. And you know, there's a lot of love there if you choose it to be about love.BARTIROMO: Yes. Right.GEORGE: There's a massive grain of love there. But you've got to be selective. And if people are nasty, you've got the block button which you don't have in real life.BARTIROMO: Yes, that's right. Block it.George, happy birthday to you. Thank you so much for joining us. Happy that you joined us this morning. Boy George there. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Time for the Morning Buzz. Bunnies chicks and soda pet Peeps flavored Pepsi. Yes Peeps flavored Pepsi. Making it spring entrance. Pepsi teams up with Peeps to bring a smile to people's faces during the pandemic. The limited edition soda will not be available in stores, but you can get one by entering Pepsi's hanging with my Peeps contest.Brian, you can sign up and hang with your PeepsBRENBERG: You know, I would like to sign up. I'm intrigued by this, Maria. At the Brenberg household Friday night is soda pop night for our kids. I know they would love to try this Pepsi out.Little known fact about James Freeman by the way, he eats Peeps for breakfast each morning. So, I know that he's in for this one.BARTIROMO: Come on, James. We didn't know that was your breakfast of choice.FREEMAN: Yes, I didn't either. I love Easter conventions, but I'm not a big Peeps fan. But I think the worst thing about them is the texture. So, I think a soda might be an upgrade here.BARTIROMO: All right guys, Peeps and Pepsi.

BBC correspondent leaves China amid safety concernsAssociated Press InternationalMarch 31, 2021 Wednesday 11:37 AM GMTCopyright 2021 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 482 wordsDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) — A veteran BBC correspondent whose coverage angered China has left the country amid concerns for his safety, the BBC and a journalist organization said.The BBC said Wednesday that John Sudworth had relocated to Taiwan and would continue to be the British public broadcaster's China correspondent.The Foreign Correspondents' Club of China said that Sudworth had left last week “amid concerns for his safety and that of his family.”The organization said Sudworth’s wife, Yvonne Murray, a correspondent for Irish broadcaster RTE, had left with him.“John’s work has exposed truths the Chinese authorities did not want the world to know,” the BBC said in a statement posted on Twitter.The BBC declined further comment.Sudworth has reported from China for nine years. He won a George Polk Award last year for his reporting on internment camps for Muslims in the Xinjiang region. China says the camps were vocational training centers and denies any abuses.China has held a series of news conferences to deny reports by the BBC and other foreign media of human rights violations in Xinjiang.The Foreign Correspondents' Club said Sudworth left after months of attacks including videos posted online by state media that used videos of him obtained from Chinese police cameras.“Over the last few years the pressure and threats from the Chinese authorities as a result of my reporting here have been pretty constant,” Sudworth told BBC radio. “But in recent months they have intensified, the BBC has faced a full-on propaganda attack not just aimed at the organization itself but at me personally, across multiple Communist Party-controlled platforms.”The Global Times, a state-owned newspaper, reported that Sudworth, “who became infamous in China for his many biased stories distorting China’s Xinjiang policies and COVID-19 responses, has left the Chinese mainland and is now believed to be hiding in Taiwan.”State media have reported that residents in Xinjiang are preparing to sue BBC over its reports on the region.“This is an entirely private action, and has nothing to do with the Chinese government,” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Wednesday. “Nor have we heard of any Chinese government department threatening him. If John Sudworth believes that his report is fair and objective, then he should be brave and respond to the lawsuit instead of being afraid.”Sudworth's departure comes amid a chill in relations between China and Western nations including Britain over alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang and Beijing’s restrictions of political freedoms in Hong Kong.Pressure on foreign journalists working in China has increased in the past year. China expelled 18 journalists working for The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post in 2020. Most were in response to U.S. moves to force Chinese state media to reduce their staff in America.Load-Date: March 31, 2021End of Document

CHINA HITS BACK AT FASHION BRANDS OVER XINJIANG COTTON CAMPAIGNStates News ServiceMarch 25, 2021 ThursdayCopyright 2021 States News ServiceLength: 1204 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Chinese social media users are targeting global fashion retailers including HandM, Nike and Adidas for criticism and boycotts over statements they had previously made regarding cotton sourced in northwestern China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), where up to 1.8 million Uyghurs have been incarcerated in internment camps.The United States said in January that the Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities are being targeted by China as part of a state-backed genocide, and the parliaments of Canada and the Netherlands have followed suit.Up to 1.8 million people are believed to have been held in a vast network of internment camps in the XUAR since early 2017.Reports also suggest that Uyghurs being subjected to torture, forced labor, state-enforced birth control including forced sterilizations and abortions, and cultural eradication.Internet users in China also targeted the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI), a campaign group that has said it would remove its seal of approval from cotton sourced from Xinjiang during the 2020-2021 season.Users targeted Spain's Inditex, which owns the Zara clothing chain, and which has vowed to use only BCI-endorsed cotton by 2025.They also took aim at Sweden's HandM, which also announced it would stop using Xinjiang cotton after the BCI withdrew approval.A China-based user of the audio chat app Clubhouse, who gave only a nickname J, said the app's chatrooms were buzzing with calls for boycotts on Thursday ."In the past, we had the [campaign against the] Eight Allied Forces during the Boxer rebellion [1900], and now it's against the Five Eyes countries," J said. "It may not be out-and-out war, but there's a sense that we're fighting against the U.S., Japan, the E.U. and other countries."Nike and Adidas, both of which had said they will end the use of cotton from Xinjiang, also came under fire on Chinese social media platforms.The Chinese government weighed in behind social media campaigners on Thursday , calling on the companies to "correct their mistakes.""Chinese people do not allow some foreigners to eat Chinese food while smashing Chinese bowls," Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular news briefing in Beijing.Meanwhile, commerce ministry spokesman Gao Feng said Beijing opposed external interference in Xinjiang, and that Xinjiang cotton could not be tarnished.Propaganda could backfireNike said in a statement that it "does not source products from the XUAR and we have confirmed with our contract suppliers that they are not using textiles or spun yarn from the region."The Oregon-based U.S. multinational firm added: "We have been conducting ongoing diligence with our suppliers in China to identify and assess potential forced labor risks related to employment of Uyghurs, or other ethnic minorities from XUAR, in other parts of China."Meiirbek Salanbek, a Kazakh citizen journalist exiled in France, said the online criticism and boycotts were likely orchestrated by the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in the first place in response to international sanctions being imposed on officials linked to rights abuses in Xinjiang and Hong Kong.On Monday, Canada, the European Union, the United Kingdom and the U.S. leveled sanctions against Chinese officials and security entities as part of a multilateral approach to hold to account those responsible for abuses in the XUAR."The Chinese government used to restrict any discussion of Xinjiang-related topics in China; they didn't want people talking about it at all," Salanbek said."Now they are setting it as a topic of concern to manipulate public opinion," he said. "But doing that will make people aware that there is indeed a human rights crisis happening in Xinjiang, and they will start to pay more attention to that."Uyghur exile groups who have long pushed for sanctions and measure to draw attention to forced labor in Xinjiang's key cotton industry shared the same view of China's new campaign.China's "retaliatory actions reflect a growing aggression by the Chinese Communist Party to lash out to eliminate perceived threats against it, as the pressure on Beijing increases internationally as they continue their operations of mass oppression and genocide, said Campaign for Uyghurs (CFU) advocacy group in a statement Thursday.The Chinese regime is clearly in a weak spot and is acting irrationally to not only defend their use of forced labor, but to attack anyone who prioritizes due diligence or has concern for human rights. This is in keeping with their consistent defense of their genocidal crimes, said Rushan Abbas, executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based CFU.Pu Lin, a doctoral student in political science at Tulane University, said no criticism of foreign companies would be allowed if the CCP hadn't endorsed it through approved media and social media accounts in the first place."This is all about China's response to pressure from the U.S. and the E.U.," Pu said. "All of the international brands [here] have a China market.""This is a good opportunity for China to engage in some wolf-warrior diplomacy and force companies to buy Xinjiang cotton," Pu said. "The CCP is manipulating the situation to use as leverage, as a bargaining chip."Hong Kongers reject Xinjiang cottonMeanwhile, Japan's Ryohin Keikaku, which owns Muji, has been less than emphatic about removing cotton from Xinjiang from their supply chains.Muji, which operates 275 stores in mainland China, more than a quarter of its global network, won praise on Chinese social media platforms, with commenters saying the company knew how to survive, after Ryohin Keikaku was quoted by the CCP-backed Global Times as saying that it does use cotton from Xinjiang.The company told Reuters it was for its suppliers to correct any "issues" in their Xinjiang operations.Some shoppers in Hong Kong who spoke to RFA on Thursday said they were unwilling to keep buying cotton from Xinjiang."I never thought a Japanese company would use cotton from Xinjiang," a shopper surnamed Man said. "Now we know, we won't buy it."A resident surnamed Ma said she would boycott the company."Neither Uniqlo nor Nike sell [goods made with] Xinjiang cotton, but [Muji] doesn't seem to care so I wouldn't buy from them," she said. "I think we need to pay more attention to human rights and the environment."Parent company Fast Retailing has previously said that no Uniqlo products are manufactured in Xinjiang, and that none of its suppliers is based there.Another shopper surnamed Lau said she would carry on shopping at Muji, however. "I don't know if this news is true or false. It may be propaganda," she said.At the same time, however, Hong Kong pop star Eason Chan said he would withdraw from his partnership with Adidas, which also works with BCI to ensure a more ethical supply chain.Amid pressure on entertainers who serve China's market, Chan said via his Sina Weibo account that he felt compelled to "resist any behavior that stigmatizes China."Reported by Yitong Wu, Chingman, Gigi Lee, Lu Xi and Chan Yun Nam for RFA's Cantonese and Mandarin Services, and Alim Seytoff for the Uyghur Service.

UC San Diego School of Global Policy & Strategy Issues Report Entitled 'Meeting the China Challenge - A New American Strategy for Technology Competition'Targeted News ServiceMarch 1, 2021 Monday 4:37 AM  ESTCopyright 2021 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 6978 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON, March 1 -- The University of California San Diego School of Global Policy and Strategy has issued a 72-page report dated November 2020 entitled: "Meeting the China Challenge - A New American Strategy for Technology Competition".* * *CONTENTSii About the Working Group on Science and Technology in U.S.-China Relationsiii Acknowledgementsiv Members of the Working Groupv Acronyms1 From the Chair2 Preface8 Summary of Policy Recommendations14 Maintaining U.S. Leadership in Fundamental Research26 A 5G Strategy for America: U.S. Options and the China Challenge40 Bolstering U.S. Strength in Artificial Intelligence50 U.S.-China Competition and Collaboration in Biotechnology60 References* * *PREFACEInnovation in science and technology (S&T) is a core American strength. The United States has been the undisputed global technology leader since the end of World War II, but today, our preeminence faces three major interlinked challenges: The United States has allowed the foundations for its technological leadership to erode. It faces formidable competition from the People's Republic of China (PRC)--a country that has deployed full state power, and sometimes used illegal means, to build an innovation system to gain on the United States. And it has overreacted to the competition challenge from China, and in doing so, is poised to damage its own innovation ecosystem, which flourishes in an environment of global openness.To confront these challenges, the United States needs a clear-eyed strategy for S&T innovation that enhances our national competitiveness and protects our national security. We must do two things, now: make needed investments in and policy adjustments for our S&T base at home; and craft a new approach to global cooperation that minimizes the security risks China poses without unduly sacrificing the benefits of openness.The task is urgent. China's behavior under Xi Jinping raises fundamental concerns about the nature of China's global ambitions. Xi Jinping has vowed to modernize China's armed forces by 2035, and to transform China into world-class military power. China is using its growing military might to press its territorial claims against its neighbors and harass foreign vessels in international waters. In its foreign policy, Beijing uses its economic power in attempts to coerce sovereign governments, private companies, and overseas universities, media, and civil society organizations to conform to its political line. It is also constructing a surveillance state that threatens individual liberties in Xinjiang, Tibet, Hong Kong, and the rest of China.In our view, China's pursuit to become a high-tech superpower is inextricably linked to its quest for regional dominance and global deference. Though the desire to develop China through innovation is legitimate, many of the ways in which the PRC government uses technology alarm the United States and other nations that hold liberal views of human rights and fair competition.How China uses its technological prowess is one concern; the way it develops or acquires new technologies is another (White House Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy 2018). China's well-resourced, winner-take-all approach to creating national champions in frontier technology is neo-mercantilist. Through massive subsidies far beyond the scale of other countries, and by shielding domestic firms from international competitors, China has enhanced its standing in global markets and damaged other countries, including the United States. Though China has increased its adherence to intellectual property rights (IPR) laws, it still employs a variety of illicit methods to acquire technological know-how from the U.S. and other countries.China's changing behavior at home and on the world stage, coupled with its deviation from the norms of fair competition in S&T development, create economic and security risks for the United States and other countries and require forceful collective responses.In this report, we make recommendations for a U.S. approach to China in four domains of science and technology. We envision a national strategy that will balance risks and opportunities over the long-term and that achieves three complementary objectives.1. Self-strengthening: Bolster U.S. innovation capacities to stay competitive and secure.2. Preserve Openness: Leverage a globally integrated S&T system to benefit the United States and the world.3. Mitigate Risk: Tighten targeted measures for risk management to address security threats and minimize costs to the United States.THE UNITED STATES IS BETTER POSITIONED THAN YOU THINKSome American politicians have panicked over what they see as a Chinese technological juggernaut that is surpassing the United States. They see the United States as falling dangerously behind China, and believe that China's technological advance was achieved solely through unfair competition and the pilfering of western technologies. They also believe that China's erasure of boundaries between commercial and military innovation, including the absorption of U.S. technology through worldwide business deals, represents an existential threat to U.S. national security.They conclude that the United States must preserve its prosperity and security by decoupling from China. The United States, as the thinking goes, must reduce or eliminate scientific and business collaboration with China in order to block its access to the crown jewels of American technology (The White House 2020a).Our Working Group's assessment differs from the conventional wisdom on several fronts. We find that the United States is in better shape than the pessimists believe, especially when long-term technological trends are taken into account. The United States holds a lead in all the dynamically evolving fields examined in this report. The best way to sustain this leadership is to adopt a strategy that builds on America's asymmetric advantages, including our superior ability to operate and attract talent in an open global knowledge economy.Given the complexity and urgency of the China challenge, it will be necessary to impose smart risk management strategies tailored to specific technologies. Some of the strategies may entail some limits on other countries' access to America's innovation system, but they are a precondition for continuing integration and open cooperation across borders. Moreover, as a necessary complement to risk management, we must pursue a robust strategy for correcting weaknesses that have crept into the U.S. system of basic science and applied technology development. In this report, our Working Group pinpoints priorities for remediation to shore up America's position on the frontiers of science and technology.America must also foster collaboration with allies and friends. Strengthening U.S. domestic regulation of data privacy and security is an essential first step toward establishing global norms that undergird international collaboration with like-minded countries and set guidelines for engagement with China.We recognize that as long as we face a peer competitor that seeks to undercut our comparative advantages and pursue goals we do not share, it will be necessary to impose some limits on openness. We warn, however, that, if not carefully conceived, U.S. barriers to flows of talent, technology, investment, and knowledge will harm American security and competitiveness, and damage the global knowledge economy that enormously benefits the United States and the rest of world./1Permitting the global technology system to bifurcate into hostile camps led by the United States and China would be self-defeating and impracticable. Engaging in a race to the bottom with China by emulating its statist and protectionist policies is a recipe for a weaker and less secure America./2THE NATURE OF THE CHINA CHALLENGE IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGYChina sees S&T capability as key to national power. Although the United States has always competed with other innovative nations, the China challenge of today is fundamentally different from past contests. Japan in the 1980s was a democratic ally whose economy did not match the scale of the United States, while China is an authoritarian country whose economy will soon overtake that of the United States. Economic and social ties between Russia and the United States were limited during the Cold War, while China's economy, universities, and other institutions have been enmeshed with those of the United States for decades.The China S&T challenge has five distinctive features:First, it is financed and directed by the PRC government as a means to achieve regional dominance and global power. In 2009, China surpassed Japan to become the second largest funder of R&D in the world. In 2018, China spent $554.3 billion on R&D, only slightly below the level spent by the United States. That same year, China's share of global R&D (26.3 percent) approached the U.S. share (27.6 percent) (Congressional Research Service 2020). Over the next six years, Beijing plans to invest an additional $1.4 trillion of state and private funds in next-generation technologies (Bloomberg News 2020).The Chinese government and Communist Party also invest substantially in expanding its pool of human talent. They operate more than 200 high-level talent recruitment programs in science and technology, which are run by numerous agencies, including China's National Science Foundation; the ministries of Science and Technology, Education, Human Resources and Social Security; and most prominently, the Party's Organization Department./3Many of these programs encourage scientists working abroad--most, but not all of whom are of Chinese origin--to support efforts to build China's S&T capacity through their research. While these programs are not illegal in the United States, they may serve as channels for the transfer of valuable research to China.Second, China sometimes advances its position through illegal means. While China absorbs foreign technologies legitimately through licensing, foreign investments, and the return of overseas graduates, it also does so through cyber hacking of businesses and research institutes, technological espionage, and other forms of intellectual property (IP) theft. The PRC government committed to stop commercial cyber hacking in 2013, but Chinese intruders resumed operation after a brief hiatus.Third, China is mounting a major effort to dominate the global technology standards of the future. The new "China Standards 2035" plan uses massive subsidies to promote the indigenous development of technologies and then employs economic diplomacy to enhance China's influence over the international bodies that set the crucial standards and norms for emerging technologies. China has already succeeded in placing many officials at international standard-setting bodies, including the current Secretary General of the International Telecommunication Union. China's rapidly growing influence not only provides commercial advantages for Chinese firms, but also gives its autocratic government a strong voice in shaping digital privacy norms and other vital standards that influence global telecom competitiveness and security policies.Fourth, China has moved steadily to erase the boundaries between civilian commerce and national security prerogatives in global technology markets. While all countries cross these lines occasionally, democracies are usually dissuaded from doing so by a thicket of safeguards. In contrast, China has proclaimed in law that all of its citizens and corporations are obligated to assist China's national security agencies in matters related to national security, cybersecurity, and intelligence.Finally, China is pursuing a military-civilian fusion (MCF) development strategy that makes it complicated for American S&T institutions to work with Chinese partners on any project that might have military applications. Xi Jinping personally directs the MCF initiative, and views it as essential to China's rise as a world-class military and technological power.A growing number of emerging technology intensive sectors are designated key areas for MCF investment under national plans (PRC State Council 2016; Nouwens and Legarda 2018). While MCF faces structural obstacles in China, it is important that U.S. policymakers put guardrails in place now to minimize security risks arising from the initiative. Appropriate safeguards will allow S&T interdependence to continue to the benefit of both countries.While recognizing the challenges posed by the People's Republic of China, trying to shut China off from the United States and the global economy ultimately harms the United States.To remain truly competitive, U.S. firms need to operate at scale throughout the world; localize R&D to meet the needs of diverse, fast-growing markets; and hire the best talent wherever it is available. Global operations, including those in China, should support economic activity and job creation in the United States. American policymakers can and should strive to balance these complicated realities to promote the public interest.U.S. openness also ensures a steady flow of badly needed global talent into the United States. America's ability to attract top talent is essential to its strength while broad restrictions on cross-border collaboration and immigration undermine American innovation. The best way to compete with an ever more capable and increasingly ambitious China is to protect as much of this open order as possible, while devising effective ways to contain the risks.OUR APPROACH: SELF-STRENGTHENING, TARGETED RISK MANAGEMENT, AND OPENNESSThis report proposes a vigorous strategy to recalibrate the U.S.-China relationship in science and technology based on three policy goals: (1) Strengthening U.S. innovation capabilities, including increasing funding for fundamental research and upgrading our production system.(2) Tailoring risk management strategies to address security threats and counter illicit behavior. (3) Preserving, to the greatest degree possible, the open, integrated global S&T and commercial system.Self-strengtheningThe scientific and technological leadership capabilities of any country depend on domestic efforts to encourage discovery, innovation, and dynamic markets. Troublingly, the United States has under-invested in fundamental research and the training of domestic scientists and engineers for too many years. U.S. federal R&D support, relative to the size of gross domestic product (GDP), has declined steadily since the early 1960s, according to a 2019 Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) report. The lowest level was reached in 2018 at 0.61 percent of GDP (Atkinson and Foote 2020).Since 1990, year-on-year federal R&D spending declined in 22 of 28 years as a percent of GDP. During roughly the same period, from 1991 to 2016, China increased its R&D expenditure thirtyfold, albeit from a smaller base (China Power team 2020).This shortfall must be addressed. In light of the vanishing gap between American and Chinese R&D budgets, we advocate for increasing the level of U.S. federal R&D funding to at least its post-1976 average of 1 percent of GDP, if not higher./4Such resources are critical to America's fundamental research and early stage discovery. Our goal should be that combined government, industry, and university R&D funding exceed 3 percent of GDP, a target called for but not achieved by President Obama.America must also address longstanding weaknesses in our commercial sector that undercut our competitiveness and national defense capabilities. As our case studies illustrate, policies that support disruptive technology innovators are vital to future American success. Equally important are policies that accelerate the movement of technologies from R&D to application.Regrettably, American policies have often ignored the potential of state-of-the-art manufacturing to complement our leadership in software, services, and cutting-edge science and engineering design. China, meanwhile, is facilitating experiments that integrate new hardware with software and services in every field, from medicine to transportation. This bundling of diverse capabilities into complete systems for complex missions is now a central feature of technology markets. U.S. policy efforts to selectively upgrade the manufacturing base and facilitate the development of new systems solutions are critical.Enhancing our own national security innovation are also urgently needed. While policymakers focus on China's pursuit of military-civil fusion, they overlook the superior potential of America's own dual-use, civil-military innovation system.However, this system is under stress. During the Cold War, the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) was often at the forefront of seeding new technology breakthroughs. Today, leading-edge technologies of military import frequently emerge from the civilian sector before DOD's procurement planning has fully embraced their significance. The loose coupling of the defense and commercial sectors in the United States encourages bold technology experiments, but it also makes for slow absorption by the military.There is a widely acknowledged need to more quickly embrace disruptive innovation from the civilian sector and reduce barriers for innovators outside traditional defense contractors and the Congressional appropriations system.Targeted Risk ManagementAs long as China pursues its current strategy, the United States must address the security risks of S&T integration with China. But we reject the notion that an S&T divorce from China would eliminate most major risks. Policy action cannot reduce risk to zero, and a national security centered strategy aimed at eliminating all risk would be both unrealistic and destructive to our vibrant society, economy, and innovation ecosystem. In the end, America would be weaker--and therefore less secure. Moreover, most other countries, including U.S. allies and partners, would be unwilling to support a U.S. strategy that requires breaking off relations with China.As an alternative to radical decoupling, we propose a highly targeted approach to risk management modeled on our experience with cyber security (Security Agency, n.d.). The cyber security consensus recognizes that, because the benefits of pervasive digital technology networks and applications are enormous, trying to lock down the cyber infrastructure along national borders is ill-advised and likely to prove futile under any cost-benefit analysis.The best way to achieve resiliency and reduce risk is through effective monitoring and risk identification systems, selective buildup of U.S. capabilities, multiple layers of targeted safeguards, and redundancy of certain critical capabilities to allow faster recovery.The risk management strategies we propose in this report tailor the lessons learned from cyber security to particular technology domains. They reflect the need for a sophisticated approach to risk management, informed by an accurate and granular understanding of the threat actors and activities of greatest concern in each technological domain. To be sure, some risks will require strict "lock downs," such as those that exist for the creation of and access to military software systems. But, it is difficult to completely segregate complicated technology ecosystems in this manner and it greatly raises the cost and slows the speed of innovation.Therefore, tight controls of special points of vulnerability should be embedded within broader risk management schemes. Such a strategy will also enable us to share specific measures and coordinate with like-minded nations to keep the risks posed by China to a minimum.Reaping the Benefits of OpennessAmerica's openness and ability to attract top talent from all corners of the world gives us a great advantage over China. In contrast with America's receptivity and global network of allies and friends, China is relatively closed to immigration, has no allies, few collaborators, and a reputation damaged by its authoritarian politics and human rights abuses. If the U.S. government were to close our borders by restricting immigration indiscriminately, we would undermine the dynamic American innovation ecosystem that heavily relies on contributions by foreign talent. The best way to compete with an increasingly capable and ambitious China is to protect as much of this open order as possible while devising methods to contain the risks.Since World War II, the expansion of the global knowledge economy has spurred growth and human well-being, not just in China or the United States, but worldwide. Firms and laboratories in India, Singapore, Brazil, and Vietnam play critical roles in inventing applications for many technologies; and their large numbers of skilled engineers and scientists are indispensable to global innovation.The United States has proved itself particularly capable of drawing from the globally diverse pool of talent, and specifically Chinese S&T talent. American universities awarded 66,690 doctorates to Chinese students in science and engineering fields from 2000-2017; and their five-year and ten-year stay rate is at 83 percent and 90 percent respectively--the highest of all nations (Trapani and Hale 2019)./5Many go on to become leading scientists and entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley, Cambridge, Seattle, and San Diego.In the global knowledge economy, technological advancement--whether intended to tackle the risks associated with climate change or to advance new health technologies--depends on blending specialized capabilities from many sources. Once created, and regardless of where it is created, knowledge usually spreads despite government controls, allowing more countries to build on its foundation. Take biotechnology as an example: Biotech development promises to generate new scientific insights and tools to double the world's food supply and manage health risks stemming from an increasingly urbanized and interconnected world. The creation and application of these tools are both inherently global tasks.The United States cannot meet its technological goals if it isolates itself from the growing innovation capabilities outside its borders. In such a complex environment, the only viable leadership strategy is to race faster by investing in American innovation and welcoming talented individuals from all countries.CONCLUSIONThis report examines the challenge of targeted risk management and competitiveness policy by examining the case of fundamental scientific research, as well as developments in three fields of technological innovation: 5G, artificial intelligence (AI), and biotech. America currently possesses a competitive advantage in all these fields. We aim to sustain that edge.We do not present a complete solution in each case. Instead, we begin each section by briefly referencing some of the major policy arguments circulating in Washington. We analyze the arguments to show where conventional wisdom falters or requires further elaboration. We then suggest measures to mitigate the gravest risks, strengthen U.S. competitiveness, and preserve the benefits of continued interdependence.We recognize that the United States faces real and growing security threats from China. While we hope that radical decoupling will never be necessary, and understand that such a step would have dire consequences for the global and American innovation systems, we would be foolish to ignore the possibility that it may become unavoidable. Unless and until such a decision is made, the role of the scientific and tech community should be to pursue worldwide collaboration in accordance with practices that mitigate the risks from openness. It is the goal of our Working Group and this report to help define those practices and advise to what degree they should be applied in a rapidly changing geo-political environment.* * *SUMMARY OF POLICY RECOMMENDATIONSThis report challenges the conventional wisdom about how best to manage the science and technology contest between the United States and China. The United States is in a much stronger leadership position than many in the policy community assume, but requires new policies to uphold American security and enhance American strengths.To protect against the risks posed by China and safeguard U.S. security and competitiveness, the United States must embrace three complementary policy goals:1. Bolster U.S. innovation capabilities through meaures ranging from increased funding for fundamental research to selective upgrading of our production system.2. Tailor targeted risk management measures to address current and future security threats.3. Preserve as many of the benefits of an open, ethical, and integrated global knowledge system and innovation economy as possible.These three policy goals are complementary to each other --the successful realization of one depends on the implementation of the other two. Preserving openness depends on improving risk management. Risk management is feasible only if it addresses functions within a strong, adequately resourced domestic innovation system. And strengthening the U.S. innovation system will be easier if we preserve an open, interdependent global system of S&T innovation.The policy recommendations presented in this report are most likely to succeed if they are designed and implemented collaboratively with like-minded countries. The four cases in this report-- fundamental research, AI, 5G, and biotechnology--contain detailed policy recommendations. Here we present 16 policy recommendations that unify all four fields, organized under the three goals that guide our analysis.BOLSTER U.S. COMPETITIVENESS1. Putting Our Own House in OrderThe United States must significantly expand investment in its S&T capabilities, and in basic research, in order to sustain its leadership in the face of the challenges from China. American policy errors, not Chinese actions, are responsible for U.S. weaknesses. The U.S. government should raise federal funding for research and development (R&D) to at least the historical average (since 1976) of 1 percent of GDP, and total R&D funding, including from government, university, and private sources, to at least 3 percent of GDP. In addition, an updated approach to Department of Defense (DOD) and NASA investments in dual-use and strategic technologies, such as AI and quantum computing, would benefit innovation.U.S. advancement also requires action beyond traditional R&D funding. As a form of infrastructure investment, for example, the government should provide technical tools that no single company can provide effectively. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) should be charged with developing key evaluation and testing techniques for AI systems and make them available to all researchers and firms. In other cases, such as 5G technology, U.S. innovators would benefit from government procurement incorporating technical requirements that give a boost to new generations of innovators.2. Double Down on the Distinctive U.S. Model of Commercial InnovationChina frequently relies on state-supported national champions, such as Huawei, to advance its global ambitions for leadership. The United States has taken a different approach historically, emphasizing innovation-fueled competition, especially by new market entrants.The United States, for example, revived its sagging technology leadership in the face of an earlier challenge from Japan by betting on disruptive innovation, often dubbed the "Silicon Valley" model. U.S. biotech leadership is similarly sustained by new market entrants. The United States should continue to support technology architectures and standards-setting processes that facilitate the entry of new innovators, as it did with its previous support of the Internet protocols.3. Restore U.S. Leadership in Setting Global Technology Standards Standards are the global roadmaps for applied innovation and related issues such as health, security, and safety. The U.S. technology industry has thrived under an international system of robust, voluntary, and industry led standards setting that has established formulas for intellectual property rights. U.S. trade policy has long supported this approach, and the United States has frequently challenged China at the World Trade Organization (WTO) when its measures threatened this formula. U.S. government policies that prevent active U.S. participation in standards setting are highly destructive. For example, export controls temporarily prevented the United States from participating in 5G standards setting, which reduced U.S. influence in defining the algorithms and technical requirements that will be adopted by all 5G products. The United States must engage in high-level diplomacy in key international institutions. Specifically, the United States should restore active U.S. participation in standards setting, and bolster participation by both U.S. private sector actors, especially smaller innovators, and experts from key U.S. government standards bodies, such as NIST. Confidence in U.S. government support for the protection of IP rights is an important incentive for participation by new entrants.4. No Global Talent, No Global LeadershipAmerica's long-standing fundamental advantage is its ability to attract the world's best talent to its universities and laboratories. Our analysis of basic research, AI, and biotech stresses that while the United States needs to grow a domestic pool of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) talent at all skill levels--and improve the diversity of the pool--U.S. leadership will falter unless it continues to attract large numbers of students, scientists, and engineers from around the world. This openness carries risks, such as the risk of IP theft, but the benefits of being the global talent hub are significant. Some targeted risk mitigation strategies are appropriate, but the United States should avoid making America the "second choice" for top talent.5. Chips are FundamentalDigital innovation is transforming every aspect of basic research and applied technology innovation. Each case we examine is highly sensitive to America's, or its close allies', capacity for rapid progress in semiconductor development, and and dependent on a robust supply of alternatives from trusted sources. To be clear, we are not calling for exclusive reliance on these sources for chips; innovation will benefit from true global competition. Moreover, it is probably fanciful to think that the United States alone will dominate all advanced semiconductors. But the United States should assert overall leadership--or at least shared leadership--on every cutting-edge semiconductor technology, including both design and production capabilities. Appropriate R&D policies for bolstering fundamental innovation and supply chain capabilities (such as advanced manufacturing techniques) that are consistent with competitive market dynamics are essential. Trade and technology licensing policies can also be used appropriately to bolster these measures.The United States should enhance its capabilities by funding R&D in advanced semiconductor capabilities, including manufacturing equipment and by providing incentives for the construction of state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing facilities in the United States (Keller, Goodrich, and Su 2020).In addition, the United States and its allies should impose strict export controls on the sale of semiconductor manufacturing equipment for advanced chips to all Chinese companies, private as well as state-owned, while continuing to allow the sale of finished chips to Chinese companies for civilian uses.TARGET RISK MANAGEMENT6. Define Policy Problems PreciselyEffective policies require a clear definition of the problem to solve, and carefully matching means to ends. For example, sanctioning advanced AI technology exchange with China will not improve China's human rights practices, as China can use pedestrian AI technologies to surveil its minorities and dissidents. Human rights is a values problem, not an AI problem, so AI is the wrong tool to apply.7. Position for the FuturePolicy discussions tend to focus on short-term considerations and immediate problems, which can prevent decisionmakers from taking longer-term trends and dynamics into account. As a result, many policy prescriptions fail to heed Wayne Gretzky's adage--skate to where the puck is going, not to where it is or was. For example, U.S. 5G policy focuses on first generation 5G equipment, despite the fact that 5G networks will evolve dramatically in ways that present new opportunities for American leadership. China's own model of innovation is constantly evolving as well. To succeed over the long term, U.S. policymakers should look ahead to where China is going and target technology options that are the key to American security and competitiveness over time.8. Focus on Multi-Layered Risk Management Strategies, Not Exclusively on ChinaEvolving risks are more global and complex in nature than in the past. Given how globally interconnected data systems and supply chains are, broadly cutting off one "problem" country is virtually impossible. Moreover, global risks arise from diverse sources. Risk management strategies must therefore vigorously address immediate issues concerning China, but also insist on multiple layers of safeguards that apply to all nations.9. Embrace a "Small Yard, High Fence" PhilosophyGovernment barriers that restrict the flow of human capital or foreign direct investment should be as targeted and limited as possible. For example, the United States should distinguish between broad-based commercial investments and a small set of strategic Chinese investments in early stage biotech ventures, and find the right policy tools to reduce risks without unduly driving talent and capital away from the United States. Universities should also protect security related research by either transferring it to national laboratories or to their own separate secure facilities with heightened personnel screening.10. Establish New Technology AlliancesThe United States should reinforce its leadership by collaborating with other technologically advanced countries--most of which are democracies--on research, production, and policy regulation. The United States used to be the largest market for new technologies. In those days, unilateral action by the United States to close off its market could cripple a new technology. But nowadays, major new technologies are being developed and finding markets outside the United States and other wealthy democracies. Collaboration on policies related to China is therefore critical for U.S. security and competitiveness. The necessary work includes licensing critical export technologies; cooperation to diversify supply chains; and assuring the cross-border flow of data used to develop AI. There is an urgent need to set common goals and create new mechanisms to coordinate policy with allies and like-minded countries.11. Diversify Supply ChainsOur case studies reject the idea of the excluding China from all major supply chains. However, we strongly recommend diversifying sources of supply to improve resilience from risks ranging from natural disasters to sabotage or war. In some cases, such as in 5G, diversification will open the way to increased design and production in the United States by new market entrants.12. Pursue Whole-of-Government CoordinationWhole-of-government coordination is essential for effective risk management. Balancing economic and security considerations is complicated, as short-term security measures may hinder long-term competitiveness. Effective risk management requires input from a variety of agencies and experts. Our report on biotechnology, for example, identifies a need for much higher-level coordination of key regulatory and funding policies. The report on fundamental research notes that security guidelines for scientific research issued by different agencies are inconsistent and officials often lack the scientific expertise needed to implement the guidelines sensibly.PRESERVE OPENNESS13. Vary Policies According to Technology Specific Risks and BenefitsInterdependence with China does not pose a uniform set of risks or benefits. Our examination of biotech and fundamental research shows that, in general, the benefits of interdependence vastly outweigh the risks to national security, and the best policy responses involve pairing openness with risk mitigation. AI and 5G present larger risks requiring new safeguards, but wholesale U.S. separation from China will not protect these dynamic technologies. Instead, practical cross-domain policy responses are needed to balance gains from openness with risk management safeguards. For example, U.S. leadership in AI benefits from engagement with diverse data-intensive operations around the world. Yet large amounts of desired data will flow across 5G networks that contain Huawei equipment and are connected to billions of smart devices subject to hacking by states, terrorists, and cyber criminals. This will require the risk management approach highlighted in recommendation eight.14. Negotiate Reciprocity to Stabilize InterdependenceWhen the traditional safeguards of multilateral agreements falter, as they have recently, selectively relying on the principle of reciprocity to manage the United States' competitive and even adversarial relations may help preserve technological interdependence with China and prevent the bifurcation of the world economy and technology standards. Reciprocity guidelines may be desirable for access to biomedical and AI data, as well as patenting in some cases. Rules requiring reciprocity can also be a springboard for negotiated understandings of mutually acceptable terms for exchange and commerce.15. Collaboratively Develop the Ethics of Responsible ScienceU.S. dominance in science and technology in recent decades gave America a large influence over the norms and values of the scientific community. As science research and talent disperses, the United States must reinforce the importance of ethical scientific conduct. This task should begin in our own laboratories with training on ethical scientific conduct (including respect for IP), and should extend to the complicated choices surrounding the use of new technologies such as AI or gene editing tools.Ethics training is an important tool for responding to concerns about security in our labs. Our studies also recommend that these efforts extend to collaborating with the global scientific community to refine these norms. Joint training between American and Chinese universities could help inculcate common standards of research integrity and narrow ethical gaps.16. Revive Rules and Institutions for Promoting International Commerce and Technological CooperationInternational institutions provide opportunities for renewed American leadership and action. For example, the United States can challenge Chinese export subsidies through actions undertaken with alliance partners within the WTO. The United States should also convene a group of like-minded countries to ensure that trade remedies can address the massive domestic subsidization programs undertaken in China that artificially create first mover advantages for Chinese companies. The United States and its partners must reclaim their leadership roles in leading scientific institutions and intergovernmental bodies, such as the International Telecommunication Union and the World Health Organization, so that we can balance the benefits of international interdependence with enhanced security and competitiveness. To shore up existing international institutions, the United States can also help to build new complementary arrangements focused on particular concerns about technology outside the purview of these institutions.* * *Footnotes:1/ That knowledge is the key to economic growth, especially for wealthier economies, is an essential insight of modern economics (David Warsh 2007).

MAGA-land's Favorite NewspaperAtlantic OnlineJanuary 13, 2021 WednesdayCopyright 2021 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 6487 wordsByline: Simon van Zuylen-WoodBodyPhoto illPhoto-illustrations by Kibele Yarman*The rural hamlet of Cuddebackville, New York, is home to a guru named Li Hongzhi, who calls his 427-acre compound Dragon Springs. At the center ofthe compound-a kind of timber frame Shangri-la-stands a massive replica of a Tang Dynasty temple. On March 19, 2020, Li wrote a message to his disciples titled "Rationality." The message was about COVID-19, which was by then crippling New York City, 80 miles to the southeast. "Plagues and pestilence, by their very nature, are arranged by the Gods," Li began. "When humans become corrupt in their hearts, they will generate karma, fall sick, and suffer calamities."Li gradually worked up to his point, referring to the Chinese Communist Party by its initials: The pandemic "has come with a purpose and with a target. It has come to eliminate the followers of the evil Party and those who go along with the evil CCP." As a remedy, Li suggested a kind of social distancing: "At present, the hardest-hit countries are those that associate closely with the evil CCP, and the same goes for individuals. So, what can be done? Stay away from the evil CCP and don't align with the evil Party."A few months later, in July, I was clicking around on YouTube when something predictable happened: An ad popped up for the weirdly ubiquitous Epoch Times. Equally predictably, the ad starred a thin man with a hint of an Eastern European accent. He was enthusiastically leafing through the print edition of the newspaper, pointing at articles. When people stumble upon The Epoch Times, they usually find it through ads like this one, which in 2019 blanketed Facebook and have now migrated largely to YouTube. The pitchman-his name is Roman Balmakov, he's 30, he went to high school in Ohio-is more recognizable than any of the publication's writers.The ad began with a smiling Balmakov peering out from behind the newspaper. "Hey," he said, "I just read an unbelievable article in The Epoch Times." He splayed the paper on a table, showcasing a news story headlined "The Mysterious Origins of the CCP Virus." It suggested that the pathogen could have emerged, maybe purposefully, from a lab in Wuhan. (Nobody knows for sure, but most scientists believe that the virus jumped naturally from animals to humans.) "It's not just that," Balmakov said, turning the page. "Look: an investigation into how the countries that have been most affected are the same ones that have been the most deeply infiltrated by the Chinese Communist Party." According tothe investigation, Washington State's early COVID-19 outbreak can be partly explained by the fact that Seattle was the first U.S. port to welcome Communist Chinese cargo ships, in the 1970s.On the one hand, the paper was underscoring the possibility that China had covered up the true source of the virus, and perhaps even engineered it. This has become a common right-wing claim. On the other hand, it was suggesting that the virus was a divine instrument designed to punish the CCP and its supposed allies. A less common claim. If the assertions are contradictory, Roman Balmakov doesn't seem to mind. They are, after all, coming from a higher power.The Epoch Times is unreservedly pro"Donald Trump, and coverage of the newspaper tends to portray it as either a recent entrant into the Trumpist media stable or a case study of Facebook-enabled misinformation. To an extent, it is both. Following Joe Biden's election as president, the newspaper reconstituted itself into a vehicle for esoteric voter-fraud allegations. In Georgia, heading into the two January special elections  for the U.S. Senate, people affiliated with the newspaper materialized to stick copies under car windshields. Balmakov himself now has his own YouTube channel, Facts Matter, devoted to the notion that the election is not over; in less than two months, the channel has amassed more than 400,000 subscribers.The newspaper, whose revenues have quadrupled in the Trump years, has used every opportunity to call Biden's victory into doubt. It has interviewed promoters of election-related falsehoods ad nauseam and eagerlypublicized the January 6 Trump rally that turned into an insurrection at the Capitol. Even after the violence of January 6, The Epoch Times has continued to publicize doubts about the outcome of the presidential election. One of its columnistspostulated that the riot was a "false flag" operation.But conventional descriptions of The Epoch Times don't adequately capture the singular mix of straight news, religious belief, conspiracy-peddling, Sinophobia, science denialism, legitimate grievance, and political expediency at the heart of the institution-a mix that, despite the paper's mysteries, makes it a strangely fitting poster child for this unsettled moment.The Epoch Times was founded in 2000 by John Tang, an Atlanta-based follower of the Chinese spiritual movement Falun Gong, whose members you might have seen doing meditative exercises in parks, and whose living messiah is Li Hongzhi, a cherubic-faced man generally shown wearing dark suits. The movement, which claims to have millions of adherents, encourages believers to abandon lust, greed, alcohol, and other worldly "attachments." Some of the more unusual characteristics of its outlook include a distrust of medical doctors and a belief in malevolent, Earth-roaming aliens who created impious technology (such as video games). In 1999, the Chinese government concluded that Falun Gong was growing too popular. Beijing labeled the movement a cult and suppressed it. But Falun Gong flourished abroad among the Chinese diaspora, and its teachings took on a fervent anti-Communist bent.The Epoch Times has sought to maintain a certain distance from Falun Gong, and its right-wing politics come across, at first glance, as no more cultish than those of the Reverend Sun Myung Moon's old Washington Times. For  a decade and a half, the paper's affiliation, like its politics, hardly mattered. Even as it established outposts around the world-now in 36 countries-The Epoch Times occupied a position of near irrelevance. Its name, absurdly redundant, managed to sound dull and bogus at once. I've walked by Epoch Times newspaper vending machines on countless occasions, never pausing to grab a copy. Each display was an anti"Pandora's box, stifling any curiosity to open it.Recently, though, Balmakov started showing up in everybody's social-media feeds. The paper had begun supporting Donald Trump, and in 2019 The Epoch Times had launched itself into the higher echelons of conservative media: By the end of that year, according to Facebook, the newspaper, together with a network "linked" to the Epoch Media Group (which publishes The Epoch Times), had spent some $11 million in advertising on the platform. Republican A-listers appeared on its YouTube shows, right-wing pundits in its print pages. Its web traffic spiked. The Epoch Times can currently claim the most popular Apple newspaper app in the country (The New York Times is No. 2).The newspaper was distinguishable from more inflammatory outlets by its staid prose and original reporting, and by offering features such as recipes ("Meet Your New Favorite Pizza Topping: Salad") and a Goop-ish lifestyle section. The affiliated television network, New Tang Dynasty (NTD), with 30 million Facebook followers, has the sterile look of a satellite-news channel you might find on TV in a European hotel. Watching, I'd sometimes zone out to a human-interest story about synthetic hamburgers, or to the weather report.But there was no predicting when the content would get weird. Hyper-suspicious of centralized government, it takes the notion of the "deep state" for granted. It has extensively promoted the false claim that the Obama administration spied on Trump's 2016 campaign, which segues neatly into its refusal to accept the legitimacy of Biden's victory. Doppelg¤nger sites such as Vision Times and America Daily-reportedly launched byor populated with former Epoch Times figures-have leavened far-right content with gentler offerings (about, say, classical Chinese paintings). A series on the occult, Edge of Wonder, became a firehose of content about QAnon, amplifying its foundational proposition that Washington is run by a pedophile cabal. The show-which was produced by NTD but later claimed to be independent-was recently scrubbed from YouTube. (The Epoch Times has denied any involvement with these sites.) Last summer, I became a print subscriber to The Epoch Times-for $16.90 a month, the paper is delivered to my home every Wednesday. I noticed at the back of each issue a deadly new installment in an 18-part series on the far-reaching tentacles of communism. From installment No. 7: "As expounded previously, sexual chaos is an innate feature of communist ideology. Marx is believed to have raped his maid."Beginning in 2020, The Epoch Times gained new resonance. For years, its anti-communism had seemed oddly beside the point. Then a deadly pandemic emerged in China, where the government muzzled whistleblowers and covered up the virus's early spread. "They've been waiting for so long to find some large-scale evidence of the abject villainy of China," one former NTD employee told me. "Now COVID comes along and checks off all the boxes." Suddenly, The Epoch Times' wall-to-wall coverage of the "CCP virus" was being amplified across the American right. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who recently sat for an interview with the paper, pushed the hatched-in-a-lab theory. Trump called the virus "a real bad present" from China.More broadly, ambitious Republicans like Senators Marco Rubio, Josh Hawley, and Tom Cotton are now among the most prominent China hawks in Washington. And while The Epoch Times' editorial product can be absurd, the paper is not exactly wrong to home in on President Xi Jinping's incarceration of ethnic minorities or his crackdown on Hong Kong.While John Tang remains chief executive of The Epoch Times and NTD, little else is known about the management of these organizations, and outside journalists are not granted access to the newsroom. (I reached out to numerous Epoch Times staff members, none of whom replied; the publisher declined to be interviewed, but the newspaper provided answers to some questions via email.) The syndicated columnist Salena Zito, whose writing appears regularly in The Epoch Times, told me she hadn't known that the paper ran her columns at all. "How do you pronounce that place anyways?" she asked. (Balmakov says "epic" but others say "e-pock.")Reporters, poking around, have unearthed intriguing connections: a documentary co-­produced with Steve Bannon; a donor who worked at the secretive hedge fund run by the Breitbart benefactor Robert Mercer. It's probably best, though, to understand the publication through a spiritual lens. Along with Falun Gong's anti-­CCP dance troupe Shen Yun, whose gauzy, beguiling subway advertisements have become an inescapable part of urban life, The Epoch Times is a key component of a soft-power portfolio, one whose product, if you buy in, promises to save your soul.Two years ago, Balmakov addressed a crowd of thousands at Capital One Arena, in Washington, D.C. Falun Gong was holding its annual conference, headlined by Li. Balmakov had been invited to the podium for an "experience sharing." Every day, he told the crowd, he woke up at 3:30 a.m. to deliver a 60-pound haul of The Epoch Times around Manhattan. One day, he had an out-of-body experience, seeming to float 40 miles above the pavement. "I saw good meet with good," he said, "and evil meet evil. I also saw that our newspaper was a shining golden light."Li Hongzhi was born 68 years ago in Jilin, a province in northeastern China. His early years were undistinguished, if intriguingly varied. He is said to have worked as a grain clerk, a hotel attendant, and a trumpet player for a kind of forestry-police band. (Li's biographical details tend to come from his followers or the Chinese government, so it's hard to know what to believe.) In the 1980s, he became deeply invested in the then-booming Chinese exercise practice known as qigong, and he later quit his job at a cereal company to devote himself to it.In 1992, he founded Falun Gong, a mash-up of qigong and his personal philosophy: L. Ron Hubbard by way of Daoism. The movement's motto is "Truthfulness, compassion, forbearance"-innocent enough, although Li's forbearancedoes not extend to homosexuality, premarital sex, or, as noted, modern medicine. The path to salvation involves Li planting karmic "wheels" into the abdomens of his followers; the extra-devout can accrue powers such as telepathy.The Chinese government tolerated Falun Gong for a while, even as state media occasionally published critiques of its anti-medicine dogma. In response to official criticism, Li's disciples staged peaceful protests-culminating in a fateful 1999 sit-in in Beijing, attended by 10,000 disciples.Within months, the party banned Falun Gong outright. It also published anti"Falun Gong comic books, ran bulldozers over the group's instructional videos, and called for the arrest of Li, who was by then living in New York. Reports began to emerge from China about the imprisonment and torture of Falun Gong members, and about the widespread harvesting of their organs for transplantation. In the West, many observers found the persecution baffling, and Falun Gong became a bipartisan cause cl¨bre. So what if Li Hongzhi believed thatDavid Copperfield could truly levitate? His peaceful followers surely didn't deserve to suffer.When The Epoch Times appeared on the scene, in 2000, the newspaper carried more anti-Communist and organ-harvesting content than your typical right-of-center publication. (Human-rights advocates have found some organ-harvesting claims credible, though it's also true that Li has instructed his followers to emphasize their persecution to elicit sympathy.) But in general, Falun Gong's efforts at broader influence were mostly welcomed. Among other things, the group won acclaim for developing two technologies, Ultrasurf and Freegate, designed to help mainland Chinese bust through the Great Firewall.Meanwhile, Li sought to make a mark in the realm of high culture, turning his Dragon Springs compound into a dance academy for the children of Falun Gong followers. (An accredited prep school and college came later.) The dancers would go on to perform with Shen Yun, whose shows offer a pastiche of "traditional" dancing, puritanical tut-tutting, and anti-Communist admonition, along with torture pantomimes-performances strikingly reminiscent of the CCP's own propaganda ballets. A few years ago, Li advised special attention to the rich in its marketing of Shen Yun. As he told one group, "You put up ads in poor communities, and that's like throwing money out the window." When Shen Yun made its Lincoln Center debut, in 2011, the New York Observer was there for the boldfaced names: Salman Rushdie, Donna Karan, Ric Ocasek.In 2016 came a promising new opportunity for Falun Gong, in the form of Donald Trump. For the first time in decades, a major party's presidential nominee was running an overtly protectionist campaign, with China in his crosshairs. Falun Gong came to see Trump as a kind of killer angel, summoned from heaven to smite the Chinese government. The Epoch Times ramped up its spending on Facebook ads and hitched its wagon to the 45th president. In 2018, it hired a Texas-based GOP consultant, Brendan Steinhauser, who helped arrange for appearances at high-profile right-wing conferences and booked otherwise ungettable interviews.In short order, the newspaper lost the liberal goodwill it had accumulated in the post-crackdown period. But it gained a new cohort of conservative readers with a reflexive suspicion of China. The timing couldn't have been better.A significant share of Falun Gong practitioners in the U.S. are Chinese Americans. But the most prominent faces on Epoch-affiliated outlets are young or middle-aged white men. I once wrote an article on the Russian-backed media outlet RT and found it to be populated with naive reporters who didn't realize what they'd signed up for, or who couldn't find jobs elsewhere. Was that the case here?In early July, I called the main phone number listed on The Epoch Times' website. The newspaper had not responded to emails. I got an automated message saying that, because of an increase in subscriptions, the paper was experiencing unusually high call volume, and nobody was available to answer the phone. I biked to West 28th Street in Manhattan, where The Epoch Times and NTD share part of a building. The pandemic-stricken city was ghostly, but I figured workaholic editor types might be coming into the office anyway. The Epoch Times often includes pictures of its editor in chief, Jasper Fakkert, and its publisher, Stephen Gregory, so I knew what they looked like. I parked myself across the street and sat on a curb, watching the door.I didn't see Fakkert or Gregory, but I did see a steady stream of 20- and 30-somethings coming in and out of the building, as if COVID-19 had never happened. I didn't know for sure whether they were Epoch Times employees, so I climbed the stairs to find the office. I arrived at a foyer to see two women gaping at me. Behind them, through a glass partition, was a humming newsroom, like nothing I'd seen since shutdowns began, several months earlier. The two women told me I wasn't allowed to be there. I didn't want to be there myself: Neither woman was wearing a mask. I went back down the stairs.I managed to get in touch with a lapsed Falun Gong member in her mid-20s who had worked for The Epoch Times in pre-Trump days. She requested anonymity because she still has family in Falun Gong. The most important thing to know about the paper, this source told me, was that virtually all of its staffers were Falun Gong adherents. Her mother, who is of Chinese descent, joined Falun Gong more than a decade ago, after seeing Shen Yun, and soon started selling ads for The Epoch Times. My source began interning for the paper in high school. A few years later, she dropped out of an elite liberal-arts college and returned to work there full-time. Commuting from her home in an outer borough, she would arrive at the office around 7:30 a.m. As they would outside the office, staffers were encouraged to close their eyes for 15 minutes every six hours and "send forth righteous thoughts." The Epoch Times' coverage was ecumenical; my source mostly covered apolitical stories. But ultimately the paper's mission was to grow. Promoting Falun Gong was central. I was recently forwarded an email sent in 2016 by an editor named Cindy Drukier, urging her colleagues to promote the paper's exclusive tell-allby a drummer and Falun Gong practitioner named Sterling Campbell, who had played with David Bowie. "This is one of our highest-potential articles ever," Drukier wrote. (Bowie had recently died.) "Perhaps Bowie's entire career and superstardom was all for this moment."I had read that the paper, in its fledgling days, was staffed by volunteers. My source, who worked unpaid for several years, eventually received a salary of about $20,000 a year. (The Epoch Times says all staff are paid.) To save on rent, some staffers worked other jobs, lived with their parents, or shared cramped apartments. Ben Hurley, an ex-believer and a former Epoch Times staffer in Australia, wrote in a Medium post several years ago that he and his colleagues were paid in "virtue," a "white substance in another dimension that you gain when you do good things."For a brief period in 2016, a half-dozen nonpractitioners-a category also referred to as "sentient beings"-were hired as reporters. But for the most part, the newspaper appears to bring in Falun Gong practitioners to do the work. (The Epoch Times disputed this, without elaborating.) "A lot of these guys are kind of hippies," my source said. "They just picked up a pamphlet like anyone else." Once inside either The Epoch Times or NTD, they have tended to shuffle from one to the other and from job to job. Ben Chasteen, a co-host of Edge of Wonder, had studied massage therapy at the American Institute of Alternative Medicine. Before hosting his own show, he was a staff photographer. Jan Jekielek hosts the marquee interview program American Thought Leaders, but I have also seen him identified as the newspaper's PR contact.Because Falun Gong adherents spend countless hours of personal time delivering newspapers or handing out flyers for Shen Yun, working for The Epoch Times or NTD is as much spiritual practice as it is a career choice. I spoke with another lapsed Falun Gong member, in her 20s, whose immigrant East Asian parents joined when she was a toddler (and remain practitioners). This second source, who also requested anonymity because of her family, told me that she spent virtually every weekend of her childhood demonstrating against the CCP or handing out Falun Gong literature. One winter, she was stationed outside a "Bodies" museum exhibit in Philadelphia, which believers suspected was filled with Falun Gong remains. Another time, she helped stage torture scenes in Manhattan's Columbus Circle, using cages and fake blood.In her late teens, she went to work for NTD. She told me she had been taught that nonbelievers' souls were shrouded by an evil aura, which could be lifted when a practitioner "clarified the truth" about the righteousness of Falun Gong or the sins of the Communist Party. (Communists go to hell.) "It's explained like an actual battle," she told me. "Arrows are coming out of your mouth," shooting at the evil inside nonbelievers. The best way to do this, she went on, is at scale-by producing a YouTube segment or bringing friends to see Shen Yun.The paper's roster of op-ed writers appears to be made up of non"Falun Gong and features prominent conservatives, such as the New Criterion editor Roger Kimball. One opinion writer, Mark Hendrickson, a retired economics professor at Grove City College, in Pennsylvania, told me he was under no illusions about the paper's objectives. "They've probably done some research into, well, what do Americans want to read?" he said. "Instead of just being anti-Communist, they're a paper that tries to be well rounded." It seems noteworthy that few of its Asian journalists are given a prominent showcase. For years, the publisher, Stephen Gregory, has insisted that The Epoch Times "doesn't speak for" or "represent" Falun Gong, but merely covers Falun Gong persecution. That seems hard to believe. This summer, I came across a trove of Li's speeches, translated and transcribed on one of Falun Gong's English-language websites. Li speaks at length about the newspaper's role in exposing the "wicked CCP," then fields questions about various Falun Gong-or "Falun Dafa"-activities, including the management of "our media."Which project would be best suited for saving the sentient beings of Africa? Shen Yun? New Tang Dynasty TV? Or Epoch Times? Master: (Laughing) Use whichever one has matured.In some areas, the person in charge of the Dafa Association is in charge of many things at the same time, such as The Epoch Times, NTDTV, the Dafa Association, and truth-clarification project groups. Master: Indeed, that's the way some areas are. If it really is due to lack of manpower, then there is nothing to criticize. With some areas, it is really problematic, though. Even I'm thinking: if someone could take my place, I wouldn't work on Shen Yun.I found another kind of testimonial on Falun Gong websites, to cathartic accounts in which adherents testified to the brutally long hours they put in at The Epoch Times. Presented in the third person, they convey the Job-like doubt and sacrifice of their subjects. One of these accounts reported on the experience of a believer named Ivan Pentchoukov, whose byline I recognized from the print edition of The Epoch Times. Pentchoukov had been working off and on at the paper for eight years, but frequently grew discouraged. "One time he successfully sold many Shen Yun tickets," the article said, which motivated him to return to The Epoch Times. "He decided to give up working on his PhD degree, and, despite his parents' strong opposition, went back to work for" the paper. Later, needing money, he found work as a taxi driver. "Again he realized he couldn't save people effectively that way. ~Many times I couldn't lift my hand and give the passenger a flier.'S" He returned to the paper. After that, "miraculously, all his troubles were resolved."On January 25, 2020, seven months before his indictment for defrauding investors in a private border-wall scheme-to which he has pleaded not guilty-the former Trump adviser Steve Bannon started broadcasting a podcast from his rowhouse on Capitol Hill. Bannon called it War Room: Pandemic. The U.S. had only a couple recorded cases of COVID-19 at that moment, and Europe had hardly any. Nobody in authority was paying much attention, and Bannon recognized that this was a mistake. "You may not have an interest in the pandemic," he warned, "but the pandemic has an interest in you."The first outside reporter Bannon summoned for the podcast was Simone Gao, a writer for The Epoch Times and the host of Zooming In, an NTD show. Gao said she had been watching clip after clip on Chinese social media of doctors and ordinary citizens testifying to the gravity of the situation. Meanwhile, Gao said, state media were running saccharine coverage of Chinese New Year festivities. Two weeks later, Li Wenliang, the Wuhan doctor who issued some of the world's earliest warnings about the pandemic-and whom Chinese authorities forced to confess to "making false comments"-died of the coronavirus.Bannon had an existing relationship with The Epoch Times. In 2019, NTD co-produced and aired his docudrama, Claws of the Red Dragon, loosely based on the Chinese telecom company Huawei, which has been accused of stealing intellectual property (charges that it has denied). While Trump himself, amid trade negotiations, was still praising Xi's COVID-19 response and minimizing the virus, Bannon saw the pandemic through the lens of the Trumpian nationalism he had helped to mold. From his perspective, the same country that was siphoning U.S. jobs and threatening U.S. economic dominance had produced a deadly virus that globalization was inevitably bringing to American shores. The Epoch Times, for reasons of its own, shared Bannon's alarm.Joshua Philipp, a melancholic 30-something with a thatch of thick black hair, is an Epoch Times star. The range of the stodgy print newspaper can be limited; YouTube is another story. Philipp hosts a YouTube show mostly about China called Crossroads. In early April, Philipp hosted a 54-minute documentary, Tracking Down the Origin of the Wuhan Coronavirus, that cast doubt on the narrative that COVID-19 first jumped from animals to humans in a Wuhan wet market. Well-produced, the documentary features moody B-roll video of Philipp researching late into the night and riding the subway around Manhattan.The film is typical of The Epoch Times, which sometimes asks valid questions-are we 100 percent sure about the provenance of the virus?-before derailing. Most of the film's commentators are China hawks, not medical experts. The first half of the documentary explores whether the virus's genome sequence suggests that it leaked out of a lab. By minute 40, it's running footage of gas masks on assembly lines and citing a 2015 study about Beijing's bio­weapons capability. By minute 50, one of its talking heads says, "The real disease here is communism." At the end of the film, Philipp is at the Lincoln Memorial, channeling Falun Gong sentiments: "I believe that viruses can't survive where hearts have compassion." The movie, which has racked up some 9 million views, was the first major entrant in the coronavirus-truther genre that took off last spring.China coverage has been The Epoch Times' most prominent calling card, but under-the-radar measures may have spurred the paper's growth. A few months ago, one of the lapsed Falun Gong women I spoke with sent me a link to a YouTube skin-care channel with more than 2 million subscribers-Beauty Within, hosted by a pair of influencers named Rowena Tsai and Felicia Lee.The channel had nothing to do with politics or China, and bore no outward connection to The Epoch Times. Eventually, though, I discovered an NTD page promoting it, and after wading through a lot of beauty tips, found my way to an episode in which Tsai detailed her commitment to Falun Gong. (Lee, Tsai, and NTD did not respond to requests for comment.)Diversification has become a hallmark of The Epoch Times' promotional strategy. In 2019, after its heavy Facebook spending was revealed, The Epoch Times shifted tactics, spending roughly half a million dollars in a single month on ads from "sock puppet" pages like "Honest Paper" and "Patriots of America." By the end of the summer, numerous accounts associated with the paper had been banned from advertising on Facebook. Meanwhile, the website Snopes had started reporting on an outlet called TheBL.com (BL stands for "Beauty of Life"), which had created hundreds of accounts, groups, and pages to promote pro-Trump, anti-CCP content. TheBL.com was created in 2016 by Trung Vu, then the CEO of the Vietnamese edition of The Epoch Times; its editor is the former editor of the English-language edition of The Epoch Times. In late 2019, Facebook banned the BL for using fake accounts. By then, Facebook said, the group had spent close to $9.5 million promoting itself, accruing 55 million followers worldwide. (The Epoch Times maintains that it only began advertising under different pages after Facebook, without explanation, prevented it from advertising under its own name. It denies any affiliation with the BL.)Although his firm was hired to build the brand and boost print subscriptions, the consultant Brendan Steinhauser says he was not involved in the social-media carpet-bombing that has come to define The Epoch Times, and never got a solid picture of the paper's finances. In 2019, the Epoch Times Association, the nonprofit under which the newspaper is lodged, brought in more than $15 million in revenue (compared with about $4 million in 2016), about half of which came from subscriptions. Whatever The Epoch Times' financial situation, the publication's bottom line pales in comparison to that of the more glamorous Shen Yun. In 2018, the most recent year for which tax forms are available, Shen Yun reported a profit of $26 million and net assets of $122 million.In May 2020, the Daily Beast discovered a benefactor named Huayi Zhang on the IRS form of Universal Communications Network, the nonprofit that operates NTD. Zhang, who for several years in the 2000s served as chair of the network's board, was a principal at Renaissance Technologies, the hedge fund run by Robert Mercer. The link was suggestive, given that Bannon, a onetime Mercer ally, has a connection to NTD. ("I'd give them a number," Bannon told The New York Times in late 2020, about his film budget. "And they'd come back and say, ~We're good for that number.'S") But the existence of a secret pot of Mercer money seems unlikely. According to the IRS document, Zhang and his wife donated $909,500 from 2012 to 2016-almost all of it in the years before Trump ran for president. Zhang also served on the board of another Falun Gong"linked organization, which perhaps points to a spiritual, rather than political, interest.The zealotry of the labor force is also a key component of the business model. Falun Gong followers often donate not only their time but their cash; unsold Shen Yun tickets are bought by followers, who see the performances over and over. Ming Xia, a political scientist at CUNY Graduate Center and the College of Staten Island who studies Falun Gong, compares the group to a multilevel-marketing scheme, in which members recruit other members ad infinitum.Eager for more insight, I tried again to infiltrate The Epoch Times. Falun Gong exercise sessions take place every day all over New York City. Most are outside, so the coronavirus was no real impediment. One day I checked out the 7 p.m. session closest to the newspaper's offices, in Madison Square Park, figuring I might run into some familiar faces. No dice: There were three men and one woman, none of whom I recognized. I sat on a bench and watched the four of them for a while as they stood in place and moved their limbs around slowly. Tranquil music played from a speaker on the ground. Eventually I got up and walked over to grab a pamphlet. The woman, Asian, wearing ripped black jeans and gladiator sandals, was evidently the recruiter of the bunch. She broke off to intercept me. She told me her name and made it her mission to get me to join her. I demurred, asking if I could just watch from the bench. She responded that that would be very boring. I gave in.The woman had me stand opposite her and mirror her motions. At first it was hard to concentrate, because a Black Lives Matter demonstration started marching through the park as soon as we began. I was being told to make a little bubble with my hands as protesters chanted "No justice, no peace, fuck these racist-ass police" behind us. Eventually the protesters passed through, and I spent 10 minutes learning qigong. "Dive into the water," my instructor told me. "Your body should be like a mountain." Placebo effect or real, I don't know, but I did feel some tension lifting. My instructor told me I'd feel even more relaxed if I stopped chewing gum.I was wearing a face mask. Nobody else was. I asked why. "We understand the virus very well," my instructor explained. I wouldn't quite comprehend this, she said, but she was protected by an energy field that activated once she began practicing.I asked if the protective energy field extended to other people, such as me standing nearby. I didn't get an answer. Instead my instructor asked, "Did you know the virus started in China?" I thanked her and returned to my bench.According to Li's central text, Zhuan Falun, ill health is a sign of insufficient "cultivation." For a period of weeks this summer, I had seen news splashed across Falun Gong media about a jeweler in the Hamptons who developed COVID-19 symptoms in March and became very ill. A friend of the jeweler's in Falun Gong urged her to repeat the phrase truthfulness, compassion, forbearance over and over. Miraculously, all her troubles were resolved. This case aside, the internet is full of alarming accounts of Falun Gong refusing medical care and succumbing to illness, and even dying. The ex-NTD source I spoke with told me that she decided to leave Falun Gong two years ago when, after she shunned medical attention, a ruptured ovarian cyst led to internal bleeding.  In late July, at the Trump International Hotel, in Washington, D.C., a rare COVID-19-era indoor political conference took place. It was called the Freedom Summit, and it featured a number of prominent Republicans, including Senators Ted Cruz and Tom Cotton. Steve Bannon broadcast War Room: Pandemic live from the event.One of the few journalists there was The Epoch Times' Jan Jekielek, wearing a navy suit and an orange polka-dotted pocket square. He must have been delighted by what he heard. Despite the bland name, it was really a forum for the China hawkery that has emerged as a staple of the Trump years. For American Thought Leaders, Jekielek sat down with former Representative Dave Brat, now the dean of the business school at Liberty University. Rather than merely repeating "Wuhan virus" talking points, Brat spoke at length about a litany of Chinese transgressions, including the militarization of the South China Sea, TikTok's surveillance capabilities, and, yes, organ harvesting. Brat said that his outrage at China had compelled him to rethink his commitment to free trade.Maybe belonging to one faith-based community makes you predisposed to the magical thinking of another. Listening to the interview, it struck me that while Trump has been of use to The Epoch Times in recent years, it may not need him going forward. The Republican Party has in many ways moved in The Epoch Times' direction. To the fixation on China, add the distrust of medical expertise, the belligerent nationalism, the taste for conspiracy theories, and the hysterical outcry at the specter of socialism. The difference is that the same issues that many in the GOP exploit opportunistically, The Epoch Times embraces earnestly. The newspaper tends to regard its penalization by tech platforms, or critiques of its journalism, as predictable extensions of the actual censorship it faces in China. ("You seem to have decided to assist the CCP," a representative from the paper emailed me.) Flirtations with QAnon by pro"Falun Gong media make a kind of sense, to The group is already receptive to the idea that powerful people in government might target the innocent in order to make use of their bodies.Not long ago, I remembered that I was still paying for The Epoch Times. When I tried to cancel my subscription, the website put me through a gantlet, before presenting me with a last hurdle, like a final boss in a video game, in the person of Roman Balmakov himself. Before I could bail on the paper, there he was, wearing a brown vest and a red tie, in a short video I was urged to watch."Hey, you're here to cancel, and that's A-okay," Balmakov announced. But he had a message for me first. "You've probably looked at the state of our nation, and you might not be feeling that optimistic," he said. "I know the feeling as well." Footage of what looked to be an antifa demonstration flashed on the screen. Balmakov ticked off a lengthening roster of ills-"worst of all, possibly the culprit behind everything else, the increasing dominance of socialist and communist factors within our society. We are a nation that is quickly becoming free in name only That's what pushes me to work harder, every single day."The day after Biden's victory over Trump was announced, a Falun Gong website posted a brief poem by Li Hongzhi, titled "On the General Election." His first public statement in months, it was reprinted on the front page of the next edition of The Epoch Times. "In this majestic universe, the communist devil is making trouble," the poem began. "Fraud and corruption are harming a great nation." Via email, practitioners were urged to help sway the results of the election by sending forth an extra 30 minutes' worth of righteous thoughts a day.*Photo-illustration images: Falun Gong / Miguel Candela / SOPA Images / LightRocket / Samantha Sin / Nicolas Asfouri / AFP / Getty; Eduardo Munoz Alvarez / AP; Flickr; YouTubeLoad-Date: January 14, 2021End of Document

Sen. Menendez: Bipartisan Senators Introduce Legislation to Reassert Democratic Leadership in Technology Strategy & DevelopmentTargeted News ServiceMarch 5, 2021 Friday 8:31 AM  ESTCopyright 2021 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2031 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodySen. Robert Menendez, D-New Jersey, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, issued the following news release on March 4, 2021:U.S. Sens. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, along with Sens. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Todd Young (R-Ind.), today introduced legislation to develop a partnership and strategy among democratic countries to compete against growing technological strength and influence by the Chinese Communist Party and other authoritarian regimes. The Democracy Technology Partnership Act would establish a U.S. interagency office at the State Department, tasked with creating a partnership among democratic countries to help set international standards and norms, conduct joint research, and coordinate export controls and investment screening on emerging and critical technologies."After four years of consistent failure under the Trump administration, one of our most important challenges will be to forge a coherent new national security strategy, particularly on cybersecurity and emerging technology, led by our values, centered on our democratic allies and partners, and implemented with consistency," said Sen. Menendez. "The Democracy Technology Partnership Act is a bipartisan recognition that we have entered a new era of technology and geo-economic strategic competition with Beijing, and an acknowledgement that we will not overcome this challenge without technology partnerships and shared human ingenuity. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to invest in a broad diplomatic and security architecture that restores our nation's position as the world's greatest innovator and allows us to actually outperform China.""The Chinese Communist Party is working to surpass the U.S. technologically and economically and to export their technologies globally. In order to compete and counter the expansion of Chinese dominance in critical technology sectors, we need to create a strategy that leverages the power of American partnerships to protect and advance our technological edge," said Sen. Warner. "This bipartisan legislation will help foster partnerships among the U.S. and like-minded democratic countries to better protect and compete against China in critical emerging technologies while helping set global rules, standards, and protocols for the market.""Both Democrats and Republicans know that competing with China is one of the biggest challenges in the 21st Century," said Majority Leader Schumer. "For years, I have been committed to confronting the Chinese government for cheating and stealing its way to economic growth. That's why I am proud to help champion the bipartisan Democracy Technology Partnership Act, which will give like-minded democracies the edge needed to compete with the Chinese Communist Party. This initiative is an important next step in our mission to boost American competitiveness, leverage our alliances abroad and fight China's predatory practices.""It's no secret the Chinese Communist Party wants to reshape the emerging technology landscape to benefit their authoritarian aims. It is essential that the United States and our like-minded democratic allies around the world work together to set global standards that uphold our universal values," said Sen. Young. "This bipartisan legislation marks a significant step forward for the United States in our ongoing effort to out-compete China and I look forward to working with my colleagues to see this passed into law.""Winning the long-term tech race with the Chinese Communist Party is foundational to our strategic relevance in the world. Chairman Xi has laid out an ambitious plan to displace the United States as the world's preeminent superpower and install his version of techno-authoritarianism in its place. The United States cannot meet this challenge alone and must lead our freedom-loving allies and partners to craft creative solutions to our shared technological challenges. This bill is a good step towards that goal," said Sen. Sasse."It's critical for democracies around the world to collaborate in research and development as well as manufacturing of advanced technologies to compete against China," said Sen. Rubio. "Too many nations fall prey to the trap of incentives associated with Chinese tech that only results in lost privacy, reduced autonomy, and greater dependence on Beijing. The U.S. must lead likeminded countries in establishing and supporting alternatives that are safer and technologically more advanced. I hope this bill will push the Administration to lead in this space.""The Chinese Communist Party is working rapidly and strategically to dominate in technologies that will underpin our economic and national security, and to export its illiberal technology across the globe," said Sen. Bennet. "America's competitiveness and security require an international technology strategy that leads with our values and allies. This bipartisan approach will empower the United States and our democratic partners to compete with China and set the rules of the road for next generation technologies."Leadership and competitiveness in emerging and critical technologies will determine the political, economic, and military strength of countries in the 21st century. Currently, the People's Republic of China (PRC) is using every tool in its arsenal to achieve dominance in key technologies such as 5G, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, semiconductors and more. Its approach to technology includes heavily subsidizing Chinese companies, investing extensively in research and development, incentivizing foreign countries to adopt its technologies, leveraging international standard-setting bodies to advance its vision, imposing unfair restrictions on foreign companies, and accessing technologies through illicit means.Simply put, the U.S. cannot counter these practices or compete with the PRC and other authoritarian governments on its own. To compete against these technological advancements, the Democracy Technology Partnership Act would establish an interagency office at the U.S. Department of State to lead in the creation of a new partnership among the world's tech-leading democracies. The partnership between the democratic countries would ensure that these technologies advance democratic institutions, norms, and values, contributing to global peace and prosperity.Specifically, the interagency office would be responsible for:* Creating a technology-based partnership of democratic countries to develop harmonized technology governance regimes and to fill gaps on specific technologies;* Identifying existing, and when needed, new multilateral mechanisms to advance the objectives of the Technology Partnership;* Coordinating with such countries regarding shared technology strategies; and* Developing strategies to provide alternatives to countries who are at risk of acquiring technologies from authoritarian regimes.The criteria for participation in the global partnership - as laid out by the legislation - requires that the country be a democratic national government with a strong commitment to democratic values, have an economy with advanced technology sectors, and have a demonstrated record of interest or expressed interest in international cooperation and coordination with the U.S. on defense and intelligence issues.In addition, the Democracy Technology Partnership Act creates a $5 billion International Technology Partnership Fund to support joint research projects between government research agencies, universities, technology companies and other businesses from partner countries, as well as to make technology investments in third-country markets. The legislation also creates a Public-Private Board, called the International Technology Partnership Advisory Board, made up of individuals with demonstrated expertise in the fields of emerging technologies and international trade to provide advice and recommendations to the Technology Partnership Office and on the bill's implementation."I commend Senators Warner and Menendez for this bold new legislation, which will help ensure that democratic values and partnerships are at the center of America's strategy to win the global technology competition. The new Technology Partnership they are proposing would be a powerful diplomatic tool to counter authoritarian influence. It would also promote new avenues of cooperation between democratic nations to secure a better future for us all," said Madeline Albright, former U.S. Secretary of State."The Technology Partnership, as proposed by Senators Warner, Menendez, Cornyn, Young, Sasse, and Schumer, is a worthy initiative, rightly identifying the most important challenge facing the United States for the next decade. The legislation wisely creates a multilateral mechanism for the United States to coordinate with like-minded, democratic countries to counter and compete with the People's Republic of China. As the PRC works to dominate critical emerging technologies, essential to U.S. military, political and economic strength, democracies must come together to coordinate technology policy that reflects democratic values," said Stephen J. Hadley, former U.S. National Security Advisor."The Democracy Technology Partnership Act outlines an important vision and strategic plan for how the United States should collaborate with allies and friends on a technology strategy which promotes and protects our common interests. Its placement at the State Department, with interagency representatives and a public-private board, ensures that the effort will be a key part of America's global diplomatic strategy, tapping into the great talent available across the U.S. government and in the private sector. This is an innovative approach to one of the toughest challenges facing the United States and our community of democracies," said Ambassador Marc Grossman, Vice Chairman of the Cohen Group, former Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs."The United States' leadership in technology and innovation is at risk, as the PRC works to surpass the US in technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and data science, quantum information systems, biotechnology, 5G, and semiconductor technologies. The United States needs a national strategy for innovation, and this legislation outlines an essential element in that larger strategy: a coalition of democratic countries to coordinate on defense of technologies, set standards, and develop common policies for emerging technologies," said Admiral William H. McRaven, U.S. Navy (Retired).A copy of the bill section-by-section can be found here (https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/6/f/6f1d16fa-89f4-4836-a535-0c4b54437215/312B681A49F939FDAB28321EC7B2EFD7.democracy-technology-partnership-section-by-section-final.pdf).

Warner, a former telecommunications executive, has been a leading voice on issues related to the national security challenges facing the United States as a result of China's growing power and influence. Last week, Sen. Warner participated in a bipartisan meeting with President Biden on securing U.S. supply chains for critical and essential goods to help counter China's efforts to expand its influence and economic power. Sen. Warner has also successfully pushed for the inclusion of his bipartisan Utilizing Strategic Allied (USA) Telecommunications Act in the FY21 defense bill to encourage and support U.S. innovation in the race for 5G dominance.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7407352 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: March 5, 2021End of Document

Joe Biden Taps China Coronavirus Disinformation Expert for NSCNewsweek.comJanuary 15, 2021 Friday 6:58 AM ESTCopyright © 2021 Newsweek Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1428 wordsByline: David BrennanHighlight: Laura Rosenberger has warned that Beijing is spreading disinformation to try and dodge blame for the pandemic.BodyPresident-Elect Joe Biden has chosen foreign policy veteran Laura Rosenberger to serve as the senior director on China issues in his White House national security team.Rosenberger has a long career of roles in the State Department and White House, and joins the incoming administration having warned over the past year that Beijing is running a disinformation campaign to absolve itself of responsibility for the coronavirus pandemic, which started in the Chinese city of Wuhan before spreading worldwide.Rosenberger will report to Kurt Campbell, who will be Biden's senior coordinator for Indo-Pacific policy at the White House National Security Council.Rosenberger wrote on Twitter Thursday: "Humbled by the enormity of the task and privileged to once again serve the American people alongside an incredible team."Rosenberger has previously served as the NSC director for China and Korea in President Barack Obama's White House. She also worked in a number of other positions in the State Department and at the NSC.This includes serving as chief of staff to then-Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken, whom Biden has nominated to be the next secretary of state. Rosenberger also served as an adviser to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.Rosenberger is currently a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States think tank. Over the past year, she has been writing about China's disinformation campaign to dodge blame for the coronavirus pandemic and malign its rivals' efforts to fight the virus; particularly the U.S.Democrats have generally shied away from President Donald Trump's effort to pin the pandemic squarely on China, though Biden has expressed concern at reports that Beijing was slow to warn the world about the threat the virus posed.Trump allies have also spread conspiracy theories alleging that the virus was released from a research lab in Wuhan, a charge of which there is currently no publicly available evidence.Rosenberger has been among those accusing China of bungling the initial outbreak, enabling the virus to spread worldwide. Almost 2 million people have since died from the virus, with more than 93 million reported infections according to Johns Hopkins University. Of these, nearly 390,000 deaths have been in the U.S., which has become the global epicenter of the pandemic.In April, Rosenberger wrote in Foreign Affairs that China's leaders "focused on control—not only of the coronavirus itself but also of information about it" as soon as the virus appeared. "They suppressed initial reporting and research about the outbreak, thereby slowing efforts to understand the virus and its pandemic potential," she added."They called for 'increased internet control' when the Politburo Standing Committee met in early February. They even sent 'Internet police' to threaten people posting criticism of the Chinese Communist Party and its handling of the virus."The CCP soon launched a global effort to repair any reputational damage that might arise from the spread of the virus. It also began a campaign of so-called "mask diplomacy"; sending medical supplies and even medical workers to affected nations. Some of this backfired, for example huge shipments of equipment to Europe which were sent back as faulty or otherwise unusable."As it began to contain the outbreak within its own borders, Beijing launched an assertive external information campaign aimed at sculpting global discussion of its handling of the virus," Rosenberger wrote. "This campaign has clear goals: to deflect blame from Beijing's own failings and to highlight other governments' missteps."Along with German Marshall Fund colleague and Biden national security alumnus Julie Smith, Rosenberger wrote for Newsweek in May warning of Beijing's mask diplomacy. "China has sought to leverage the crisis for geopolitical advantage," Rosenberger and Smith wrote."To do so, China isn't relying on the traditional forms of statecraft, such as diplomacy. Instead, it is pairing highly publicized aid with public bullying, bombastic rhetoric and outright coercion."Biden has vowed to revitalize America's traditional alliances, relationships damaged by Trump's "American First" multilateralism. European allies, in particular, will be looking forward to the start of Biden's term. Just this week, leaders in Luxembourg and Brussels reportedly snubbed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's visit out of embarrassment following the pro-Trump unrest in Washington, D.C. last week."The glitzy public relations campaigns surrounding the contributions serve three purposes," Rosenberger and Smith wrote of Beijing's European outreach."They portray China as an altruistic partner to the world, changing the story at a time when many are criticizing its initial handling of the virus; double down on Chinese government efforts to divide Europe from within and from the United States, and repair China's image in European countries where it has recently encountered friction.""These developments should worry the United States," they added. "For a country that talks incessantly about competing with China, we are ceding ground in real-time."China's public relations offensive during the pandemic plays into the wider simmering contest between Washington, D.C. and Beijing, Rosenberger has argued. "We are in a competition between democratic systems and autocratic systems of government," she told NBC News in October."China has grown in its geopolitical and economic clout and is trying to portray itself as a system that is equally legitimate to democratic governance. That is fundamentally in opposition to U.S. interests."The China challenge will loom over Biden's presidency, and likely that of subsequent commanders in chief for a generation or more. There is now bipartisan recognition that Beijing poses the greatest strategic threat to American global hegemony, and on the campaign trail Biden worked hard to dispel concerns that he would be soft on China or naive to the threat posed by the CCP.Biden is part of the political establishment that incorrectly calculated Chinese economic liberalization and international engagement would foster more liberal political attitudes. Instead, the CCP has used its wealth and technology to centralize control, suffocating political dissent and expanding its influence worldwide.Biden has said his administration will be "clear, strong, and consistent in pushing back where we have profound economic, security, and human rights concerns about the actions of China's government." The president-elect said he would not seek conflict with China, but would "deter and respond to aggression."Democrats might disagree with the aggressive methods employed by Trump on China, but not the belief that Beijing needs to be confronted. Biden has said he will pursue a more multilateral approach and make sure all American allies are "on the same page."On trade, Biden has vowed to take on "China's abusive practices," such as "stealing intellectual property, dumping products, illegal subsidies to corporations" and forced technology transfers. The president-elect said he will not make "immediate" moves to lift the tariffs imposed by Trump, imposed as part of his trillion-dollar trade war with Beijing.Biden has also vowed to put democracy and human rights at the center of his foreign policy agenda. This likely means more tension with China over its suppression of Muslim minority groups in Xinjiang and pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong.China, which waited more than a week to congratulate Biden on his electoral victory, has urged the incoming administration to pursue dialogue over confrontation. Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in December that U.S.-Chinese conflict would be a "disaster" for both nations and the rest of the world."China stays committed to developing a relationship based on coordination, cooperation and stability with the United States," Wang said, "under the principle of no conflict, no confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation."But Beijing has also warned it will tolerate no outside interference in what it considers domestic affairs. On Thursday, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian condemned the American ban on cotton and tomatoes imported from Xinjiang, which reports suggest are harvested using forced labor of Uyghur and other ethnic minority prisoners."Xinjiang affairs are China's internal affairs that no other country has the right or privilege to interfere with," Zhao told reporters in Beijing. Such rhetoric will no doubt continue into Biden's term.Link to ImageGraphic Chinese police outside trial of COVID journalistLEO RAMIREZ/AFP via Getty Images/GettyPolice attempt to stop journalists from recording footage outside the Shanghai Pudong New District People's Court, where Chinese citizen journalist Zhang Zhan was tried in Shanghai on December 28, 2020.Load-Date: January 15, 2021End of Document

China punishes LinkedIn for not censoring enoughCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 18, 2021 ThursdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 866 wordsBodyLinkedIn is the only major American social network that has been allowed to operate in China. To do this, the service for professionals, owned by Microsoft, censors the publications of its millions of Chinese users. Now, he's in trouble for not censoring enough. China's Internet regulator rebuked LinkedIn executives earlier this month for not controlling political content, according to three people informed about the issue. While it is unclear what material has got the company in trouble, the regulator said it found objectionable publications circulating in the period around an annual meeting of China's lawmakers, these people said, who called for anonymity because the matter is not public. As punishment, these people said, the authorities are demanding LinkedIn conduct a self-assessment and report to china's Cyberspace Administration, the country's Internet regulator. The service was also forced to suspend new user registrations within China for 30 days, one of the people added, although that time period could change depending on the government's judgment. The ACC did not immediately respond to a request for comment by fax. LinkedIn's presence in China has long attracted the interest of all of Silicon Valley as a possible way to access the country's walled Internet, home to the world's largest group of web users. The punishment underscores the deep divisions between the United States and China over the functioning of the Internet. For years, the Chinese government has blocked major U.S. services like Facebook, Twitter, and Google because of their inability to control what's posted on them. In Washington, critics say these barriers are symptomatic of China's unwillingness to follow global standards governing the Internet and technology at large. LinkedIn's service in China, which has more than 50 million members, makes it vulnerable to tensions between the two powers. The meeting with the regulator came just weeks before Thursday's scheduled meeting between Chinese and U.S. officials in Alaska, the first face-to-face meeting of the Biden administration. Competition for technology has been a key point of friction between the two countries. Biden's government has said it will turn to its allies to help it put pressure on China on technology policies it considers unfair. Chinese officials have pushed for new plans for technological self-sufficiency, involving the development of their own versions of all kinds of products, from computer chips to passenger planes. Concerns in Washington have recently increased over a hacking that Microsoft has provisionally linked to China, aimed at companies and government agencies that used the company's email services. On March 9, LinkedIn released a statement saying it had "temporarily" suspended the registration of new usersin China. "We are a global platform with an obligation to abide by the laws that apply to us, including adherence to Chinese government regulations for our localized version of LinkedIn in China," the communiqué added. Local Chinese companies regularly suffer similar reprimands, indicating how difficult it can be to navigate an Internet market characterized by increasingly strict expression controls. On the Chinese network, a censorship agreement does not guarantee a quiet navigation for any company, eitherforeign or local. When he first announced that he would open a site in China nearly seven years ago, LinkedIn aroused the curiosity of a perennially vetoed US Internet sector by the country's Great Firewall, as the Chinese censorship system is nicknamed. To ensure its presence, LinkedIn sold a stake to chinese venture capital partners with good connections and pledged to comply with local laws, including censorship guidelines. The company has used a combination of software algorithms and human reviewers to mark publications that might offend Beijing. Users who violate the expression rules have generally received emails informing them that their publication cannot be viewed by LinkedIn members in China. Their early efforts provoked the wrath of users whose content was blocked even if they had posted from outside the country. However, unlike its competitors, LinkedIn has remained in China and offered a tempting case study on market access. That perseverance has not always resulted in success. LinkedIn has had a hard time competing with WeChat,China's ubiquitous chat and social media service, and remains a relatively small actor. The environment has also become more difficult. Since taking the reins of the Communist Party in late 2012, Xi Jinping,China's leader, has launched a series of drastic measures against the Internet. Xi Jinping's policies have also advocated greater economic self-sufficiency and for avoiding Western culture, a blow to a service whose appeal has been to connect Chinese professionals with the world.Xi Jinping has presided over the increased power of the ACC, the regulator that punished LinkedIn. It has become a de facto censorship ministry, examining memes and complaints across the country's Internet, and calling for content to be removed when business censors overlook something.c.2021 The New York Times CompanyLook too       Load-Date: March 19, 2021End of Document

NASA I.G.: 'NASA's Compliance With Federal Export Control Laws'Targeted News ServiceFebruary 24, 2021 Wednesday 2:47 PM  ESTCopyright 2021 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 3969 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyNASA Inspector General issued the following audit report (No. IG-21-012) on Feb. 10, 2021, entitled "NASA's Compliance with Federal Export Control Laws":To: The Honorable Jeanne Shaheen, Chairwoman, Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies, Committee on Appropriations, United States Senate, Washington, DC 20510; The Honorable Matt Cartwright, Chairman, Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC 20515 Washington, DC 20515; The Honorable Jerry Moran, Ranking Member, Committee on Appropriations, United States Senate, Washington, DC 20510; The Honorable Robert B. Aderholt, Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC 20515 Washington, DC 20515Subject: NASA's Compliance with Federal Export Control Laws (IG-21-012)The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Authorization Act of 2000 directs the NASA Office of Inspector General (OIG) to annually assess the Agency's compliance with federal export control laws and reporting requirements regarding cooperative agreements between NASA and China or any Chinese company./1We last reported to you regarding these issues in February 2020. Since then, NASA has not established any new bilateral agreements with China. That said, the Agency has continued its work with the Chinese Academy of Sciences on bilateral science activities relating to space geodesy and glacier research in the Himalayan Region./2In addition, NASA's cooperative agreement with the Chinese Aeronautical Establishment to collaborate on aeronautics research intended to advance air traffic management and improve safety and efficiency for U.S. and Chinese aviation operations in China remains in force. Lastly, in December 2020 NASA officials informed Congress that they plan to initiate discussions with the China National Space Administration and exchange limited information to ensure the safety of NASA's robotic Mars science missions and our international partners' missions in orbit around Mars. NASA anticipates these discussions will continue through July 2022. For each of these activities, the Agency made the appropriate notifications in accordance with the requirements outlined in Public Law 116-93./3With regard to export control-related oversight work conducted by our office, during the past year we completed five audits that examined NASA's controls over sensitive information and information technology (IT) assets and security systems, many of which contain data subject to export control laws. We also initiated two new audits related to IT security. In addition, our Office of Investigations closed seven investigations related to inappropriate associations with China (we currently have 20 active cases) and unauthorized access to NASA computer systems and export-controlled information. Furthermore, we are an active member of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Export Enforcement Coordination Center (E2C2). The E2C2 coordinates export enforcement efforts and intelligence sharing activities among federal agencies to identify and resolve conflicts involving violations of U.S. export control laws.We summarize our 2020 export control and IT security systems audits and investigations below.AUDIT REPORTS ISSUEDNASA's Management of Distributed Active Archive Centers (IG-20-011, March 3, 2020)Data generated by the Agency's Earth science missions is stored at 12 Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAAC) across the country. Located at NASA Centers, universities, and other federal agencies, DAACs are responsible for processing, archiving, and distributing data. Over the next 6 years, the volume of Earth observation data NASA will need to archive is expected to increase from 32 petabytes to 247 petabytes (1 petabyte of storage is the equivalent of 1.5 million CD-ROM discs) when several high-data-volume missions, such as the NASA-Indian Space Research Organization Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) and the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT), come online./4One of the objectives of this audit was to evaluate the extent to which NASA addressed data integrity risks. We found that while DAAC security plans generally followed NASA and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) requirements, the Agency deviated from the NIST-recommended "moderate" impact level for data integrity. When conducting its security assessment, the Agency assessed a DAAC's impact level based on its ability to reprocess data in the event it was improperly modified or destroyed rather than on the overall value of the DAAC and its underlying data. In addition, managers excluded critical information types when conducting impact determinations. This occurred because responsible individuals misinterpreted NASA and NIST categorization guidance due to a lack of close Office of Chief Information Officer (OCIO) involvement. To help ensure data processed by a DAAC is adequately protected, NIST provides guidance for system categorization, including a library of information types with recommended impact levels to determine whether a system should operate at a low, moderate, or high impact level. Failure to appropriately categorize systems and data can result in inadequate controls for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and/or its data.To address this risk, we recommended that NASA specify in Agency guidance that coordination with OCIO occur early in a mission's life cycle during data management plan development and ensure all applicable information types are considered during DAAC categorization. NASA management concurred with the recommendations and anticipates completing the corrective action in June 2021.To view the full report, visit NASA's Management of Distributed Active Archive Centers.Evaluation of NASA's Information Security Program under the Federal Information Security Modernization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (IG-20-017, June 25, 2020)In fiscal year (FY) 2019, NASA spent approximately $2.3 billion on computer systems, networks, and IT services used to control spacecraft, collect and process scientific data, and provide security for critical Agency infrastructure, among other things. Given NASA's mission and the valuable technical and intellectual capital it produces, the information maintained within the Agency's IT infrastructure presents a high-value target for hackers and criminals.To determine the effectiveness of an agency's information security program, the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA) requires each agency's Inspector General or an independent external auditor to conduct an annual independent evaluation and report the results to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). In October 2019, we reported to OMB that for FY 2019 NASA's information security program was rated at Level 2, "Defined," out of five levels, with Level 5, "Optimized," being the most effective. In this evaluation, we further examined NASA's information security program based on the FISMA guidance and assessed NASA's cybersecurity documentation and practices, analyzed the Agency's inventory of network and information systems, and reviewed six NASA information systems for compliance with FISMA requirements.We found that NASA has not implemented an effective Agency-wide information security program. Documentation for all six information systems we reviewed contained numerous instances of incomplete, inaccurate, or missing information. We also performed a limited review of the NASA system that aggregates and manages common controls across all Agency information systems and found that many controls were classified as "other than satisfied," indicating they had been assessed as less than effective. Moreover, the OCIO has not addressed these deficiencies. These weaknesses occurred because Center Chief Information Security Officers are responsible for managing large portfolios of information systems and do not always have resources available to ensure the data for each system is accurate and complete. Further, NASA information security personnel are not sufficiently aware of Agency information security policies and procedures, and the current oversight process does not ensure that delinquent information security assessments are identified and mitigated. As a result, information systems throughout the Agency face an unnecessarily high level of risk that threatens the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of NASA's information.We made nine recommendations to strengthen the Agency's information security program, all of which Agency management agreed to and anticipates implementing by the end of October 2021.To view the full report, visit Evaluation of NASA's Information Security Program under the Federal Information Security Modernization Act for Fiscal Year 2019.NASA's Policy and Practices Regarding the Use of Non-Agency Information Technology Devices (IG-20-021, August 27, 2020)Smartphones, tablets, and laptops are integral to the work of NASA employees and their contractor, academic, federal, and international partners. However, use of this equipment to connect to NASA non-public networks and systems increases opportunities for individuals and organizations to improperly access Agency data. Although NASA does not generally permit personally-owned mobile devices and laptops to access Agency networks and systems, certain authorized mobile devices and users are allowed to access NASA's enterprise email system if they adhere to specified business rules. Additionally, based on the terms of their respective agreements with NASA, partners may be allowed to use their own computers to access the Agency's enterprise and mission networks and systems with proper authorization.We conducted this audit to assess the Agency's policy and practices regarding the use of non-NASA devices to conduct Agency business. Specifically, we evaluated whether NASA (1) addressed challenges related to non-NASA IT devices gaining unauthorized access to its networks and systems; (2) adequately monitored connection of authorized mobile devices to its enterprise email system; and (3) adequately implemented policy and procedures for non-NASA IT devices accessing NASA networks and systems.We found that NASA is not adequately securing its networks from unauthorized access by IT devices. Although OCIO has deployed technologies to monitor unauthorized IT device connections, it has not fully implemented controls to remove or block these devices from accessing NASA's networks and systems. The initial December 2019 target date for NASA to complete installation of these controls has been delayed due to technological challenges and changes in OCIO mission priorities and requirements.In addition, while OCIO established a process to enable secure email access on personal mobile devices, it is not adequately monitoring and enforcing the business rules necessary for granting such access. For example, NASA does not adequately assess whether users accessing its email system have a business need to use a personal mobile device or if the mobile device is ineligible for participation in the service because it violates supply chain controls--all of which increases the risk of the device being exploited. This is because OCIO did not establish monitoring and enforcement requirements when planning development and implementation of the project.Further, while NASA has improved its overall IT security posture in recent years, we found OCIO's visibility into IT authorization practices at its numerous Centers and facilities around the country remains limited. Although NASA's Chief Information Officer (CIO) is responsible for developing, documenting, and implementing the Agency-wide information security program, OCIO relies on Center-based CIOs and staff to implement and enforce the Agency's information security policies. This practice has allowed Centers to tailor processes to meet their own priorities, which has in turn led to inconsistent implementation of NASA's enterprise-wide IT security management and could also hinder NASA-wide efforts to gauge unauthorized access to Agency networks and systems and render Agency IT assets more vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks. For example, according to a NASA Security Operations Center FY 2019 fourth quarter threat report, 12 NASA Centers and facilities experienced incidents that involved individuals gaining unauthorized access from IT devices to the Agency's nonpublic networks, systems, and data. This was a 36-percent increase in incidents from the previous quarter and resulted in the loss and exposure of personally identifiable information, International Traffic in Arms Regulations data, Export Administration Regulation data, and sensitive but unclassified data, costing NASA $92,737 to mitigate the damages.We made five recommendations to improve NASA's management of non-NASA IT device access to Agency networks and systems, with which the Agency concurred and anticipates implementing by the end of December 2021.To view the full report, visit Audit of NASA's Policy and Practices Regarding the Use of Non-Agency Information Technology Devices.Audit of NASA's Fiscal Year 2020 Financial Statements (IG-21-005, November 16, 2020)The OIG contracted with the independent public accounting firm CliftonLarsonAllen LLP (CLA) to audit NASA's fiscal year 2020 financial statements, which resulted in a "clean" or unmodified opinion meaning the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position and results of NASA's operations in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. However, as it did the past 5 years, CLA also reported a significant deficiency related to the Agency's IT security management.CLA noted that NASA has remediated several prior year findings related to specific vulnerabilities and has incorporated a program aimed at reducing vulnerability totals and meeting vulnerability remediation timelines. However, NASA's vulnerability management program has not matured to the extent that vulnerabilities associated with the financial application and general support systems are remediated consistently and in a timely manner, in accordance with NASA-established risk prioritization and security policies and procedures. Specifically, CLA found that (1) systems, applications, and networks supporting financial applications were not patched in accordance with NASA guidelines; (2) operating systems and applications were inadequately configured; and (3) systems and programs that were no longer fully supported by the associated software vendors remained in place. CLA stated that these weaknesses expose NASA to a significant risk of exploitation.CLA also noted specific deficiencies in NASA's defense-in-depth approach intended to implement security controls at each layer of the IT environment in order to comprehensively address security risks from vulnerabilities. Furthermore, NASA did not follow internal and federal standards in implementing configuration management and access controls as required by its IT security handbook, OMB, and NIST.CLA identified seven key tasks that NASA should focus on to enhance its efforts to analyze and prioritize remediation efforts to address security and control deficiencies. The Agency responded by stating that it continues to improve the vulnerability management program as well as its defense-in-depth approach related to its financial systems' general application controls, and will continue to evaluate the need for additional improvements.To read the full report, see the Financial Section of FY 2020 Agency Financial Report.Fiscal Year 2020 Federal Information Security Modernization Act Evaluation - An Agency Common System (IG-21-010, December 22, 2020)The Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA) requires that we conduct annual independent evaluations of information security programs and practices at NASA. As part of this year's evaluation of NASA's information security program, we examined the security policies, procedures, practices, and controls for an Agency-operated information system known as an Agency Common System (ACS), an information system that is responsible for the administration and management of all NASA information system common controls./5NASA has not taken corrective action to address a longstanding deficiency regarding controls previously assessed as ineffective. We also found that a software error permitted an unauthorized data change in the Agency's information security database affecting the accuracy of the assessment status of a control. Further, we found that NASA faced delays in its plans to authorize the Agency's new hybrid common controls system, which serves as the central repository for the Agency's hybrid common controls.6 Lastly, NASA did not develop cost estimates for the remediation of these control deficiencies. As a result, information systems throughout the Agency face unnecessary risks that may threaten the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of NASA's information.We made five recommendations to improve NASA's management of the ACS. Although Agency management concurred with only three of the recommendations, we assessed the information provided and the proposed actions being taken as responsive to all the recommendations. NASA management anticipates implementing the corrective actions by the end of March 2022.To view the full report, visit Fiscal Year 2020 Federal Information Security Modernization Act Evaluation - An Agency Common System.ONGOING AUDIT WORKEvaluation of NASA's Information Security Program under the Federal Information Security Modernization Act for Fiscal Year 2020In this required annual review, we are evaluating NASA's IT security program against the FY 2020 FISMA metrics. Specifically, we are reviewing a sample of NASA- and contractor-owned information systems to assess the effectiveness of information security policies, procedures, standards, and guidelines. Additionally, we are evaluating whether NASA has addressed the deficiencies identified in our prior FISMA reviews.NASA's Cybersecurity ReadinessNASA's high-profile and advanced technology makes the Agency's computer systems and networks an attractive target for cyber intruders. In this audit, we are assessing whether NASA is adequately prepared to identify and respond to cyberattacks and has the IT infrastructure in place to deal with new and emerging threats while maintaining cyber resiliency in light of the evolving threat landscape.INVESTIGATIONSCompany Found to Engage in Illegal Transfer of International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) MaterialA shell company was used to evade a 2-year government-wide suspension of the owner's legitimate company. Our investigation revealed that the shell company used ghost employees--a type of payroll fraud--and engaged in illegal transfer of ITAR material and associated payments with overseas banks. Although criminal and civil actions against the owners were ultimately declined, information provided to NASA prevented the award of new contracts.Contract Employee Debarred for Concealing Chinese Origin of MaterialsA former employee of a contractor that supplied steel tubing to transport rocket fuel to the Space Launch System and Orion was indicted and found guilty of one count of mail fraud and two counts of false statements and subsequently debarred for 3 years for concealing that the tubing materials was of Chinese origin in violation of contract requirements. NASA tested the suspect tubing and it failed to meet contractual specifications.Senior Scientist Pleads Guilty to Making False Statements Related to Chinese Thousand Talents ProgramThe Chief Scientist, Exploration Technology at the Center for Nanotechnology at Ames Research Center pled guilty to making false statements, a charge that carries a maximum sentence of 5 years in prison and a maximum fine of $250,000. The scientist, who was prevented from conducting further NASA research, participated in China's Thousand Talents Program, which was established by the Chinese government to recruit individuals with access to or knowledge of foreign technology or intellectual property. He also held professorships at universities in China, South Korea, and Japan, and failed to disclose these associations and positions to NASA.Suspect Pleads Guilty to Stealing Laptops that Contained Export Control DataA warehouse employee plead guilty to stealing 43 laptop devices owned by Hewlett-Packard under the NASA Agency Consolidated End-user Services contract. The employee, who was subsequently fired, worked at the subcontractor facility in Brunswick, Ohio, where the laptops were taken for disposition. Our analysis of the recovered laptops found that five of them contained export control, proprietary, personally identifiable information, and other sensitive data. NASA remediated potential security risks to the data owners and offered identity protection to those individuals whose information was exposed.University Researcher Indicted for Concealing Affiliation with a Chinese UniversityA researcher at the University of Tennessee was indicted on three counts of wire fraud and three counts of false statements in an attempt to defraud NASA. He was also fired by the University and suspended from federal government contracting. The researcher allegedly committed these crimes to conceal his affiliation with the Beijing University of Technology. Federal law prohibits the use of appropriated funds on collaborative projects with China or its universities. As a result of the researcher's actions, the University of Tennessee unknowingly falsely certified its compliance with the law.University Researcher Indicted for Concealing Affiliation with China-based CompaniesA University of Arkansas researcher was indicted on 42 counts of wire fraud and 2 counts of passport fraud and suspended from federal government contracting for concealing his affiliation with various companies based in China while simultaneously receiving grants from the U.S. government. The researcher has been fired by the University and suspended from government contracting pending resolution of the criminal case.University Researcher Indicted for Concealing Affiliation with a Chinese UniversityA Texas A&M University researcher was indicted on one count of conspiracy, seven counts of wire fraud, and nine counts of making false statements for concealing his affiliation with a university in China while receiving grants from NASA. The researcher is alleged to have personally benefited from his affiliation with Texas A&M and NASA, gaining increased access to unique NASA resources, such as the International Space Station. This access allegedly allowed him to further his standing in China at Guangdong University of Technology and other universities.If you or your staff have any questions or would like further information on any of the audit reports or investigations discussed in this letter, please contact me or Renee Juhans, OIG Executive Officer, at 202-358-1220 or renee.n.juhans@nasa.govPaul K.

EXCLUSIVE-China plans to create new exchange to attract foreign-listed companies: sourcesCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 31, 2021 WednesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 684 wordsBodyHONG KONG, 31 Mar (Reuters) - China is considering creating a stock exchange to attract foreign-listed companies and strengthen the international positioning of their financial markets on the domestic territory, two people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.The country's State Council has asked the highest securities regulator to lead studies on how to organize a stock exchange that would target Chinese companies listed on foreign markets such as Hong Kong and the United States, the people consulted said.The government hopes the initiative will also attract renowned multinational companies such as Apple Inc and Tesla Inc, which would have the option of spliting local businesses into the new exchange, one of the sources said.The plan arises as Beijing and Washington remain engaged in a rivalry that has led the U.S. securities regulator to expel Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges if they do not meet U.S. audit standards.Some 13 Chinese companies listed in the United States, including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, Baidu Inc and JD.com Inc, have made secondary IDs in Hong Kong for a combined value of $36 billion over the past 16 months, according to Refinitiv data.Since China-US relations do not seem to relax, bankers and investors expect more offers of this kind of "home".Discussions to create the new exchange are at an early stage and the deadline and location has not yet been set, according to these sources, which declined to be identified as confidential conversations.The China Securities and Exchange Regulatory Commission did not respond to a request for comment from Reuters.China has two main exchanges on its territory, located in Shanghai and Shenzhen, whose combined market capitalization amounts to 78.7 trillion yuan (10.2 trillion euros).In the first quarter, the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange topped the world stock market rankings in terms of ID revenue, while Shenzhen's technology-focused ChiNext market and Shanghai's main market ranked eighth and tenth, respectively, according to Refinitiv data.The same rules govern initial public offerings (IPOs, also known as OPV and PAHO in Spain) and secondary IPO outlets, unlike other major exchanges, such as Hong Kong, which offer exemptions for secondary IPO.One of the options under discussion is the improvement of an existing trading platform, such as a smaller exchange based in Beijing, according to the people cited.Beijing's municipal government has been pushing for years to improve its stock exchange for small and medium-sized enterprises, known as the New Third Board, to welcome Chinese companies listed in the US, said one of the people consulted and three other sources.The securities regulator and some government agencies have been studying the viability of the stock exchange for about six months, the likelihood of which is "50-50," said one of the people cited.At a meeting with regulators and institutions in February, Cai Qi, head of the Communist Party of Beijing City, requested that the capital lead financial reform and develop a modern financial industry, the Beijing Daily reported.The Beijing government's media office did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment.It is rare for foreign companies to raise funds through China's stock markets, in part because of the country's strict control over currencies.Moreover, the Chinese government's attempts to open its stock markets to foreign companies and investors through stock connection projects, such as the London-Shanghai Stock Connect, have struggled to take off in a context of geopolitical challenges.China launched a test program in 2018 to attract foreign-traded technology companies with Chinese deposit receipts, or CORs. This effort has also struggled to function, as most of these companies opt for a secondary quote in Hong Kong."The main question is whether the new bag can be attractive enough," one of the people said. "Otherwise, it could become another crazy plan."(1 euro x 7,6851 Chinese yuan) (Hong Kong Newsroom report, Zhang Yan and Julie Zhu.

China's boys are too 'effeminate' and need to channel the ancient spirit of 'yang' to rediscover their masculinity, government saysInsiderMarch 13, 2021 Saturday 09:28 AM GMTCopyright 2021 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 455 wordsByline: Joshua ZitserBody• China's Education Ministry has published plans to counter the "feminization" of young men.• The proposals, designed to target effeminacy, include hiring more gym teachers.• The plans have received widespread criticism from social media users and academics.• Visit Insider's homepage for more stories.China's Education Ministry has published a notice detailing how it plans to counter the "feminization" of young men and boys.The plans, however, have been met with fierce opposition from academics and social media users.Posts criticizing the efforts have gone viral on Chinese social media apps, according to reports.Experts have also expressed their concerns about targeting effeminacy, NBC News reported.The proposals, released earlier this year, outline how the Chinese government intends to "prevent the feminization of male youths."One of the primary policies centers on hiring more gym teachers, The New York Times said.  There are also guidelines on changing physical education classes' curriculum to bolster the "spirit of yang"- traditional Chinese notions of masculinity.The plans were introduced after a senior government official said that the country is experiencing a "masculinity crisis," The Times said.Si Zefu, a top adviser to the Chinese Communist Party, wrote in May that these initiatives were needed to prevent boys from becoming "delicate, timid and effeminate," NBC News said.He stressed that it was a matter of urgency, citing national security and threats to "China's survival and development," the media outlet reported.Experts have criticized the efforts to enforce masculinity."The concept of masculinity and femininity many people have is really nostalgia for a past we can't go back to," Shen Yifei, a sociologist at Fudan University, told Chinese state broadcaster CGTN. "There is nothing wrong with men being caring and emotionally expressive - qualities considered to be feminine, and women can also benefit from being courageous and rational."Fang Gang, a sociology professor at Beijing Forestry University, echoed a similar sentiment. "Men are not necessarily aggressive, competitive, and athletic, while women are not necessarily passive, emotional, and soft," the academic told NBC News. "Good characteristics are unisex, which both girls and boys should learn."The response on social media has been overwhelmingly negative, according to the BBC.One user of the popular Chinese social media platform Weibo asked: "Is feminine now a derogatory term?"The post received more than 220,000 likes and prompted a hashtag that now has over 1.5 billion views, CGTN reported."None of these proposals have come from women," said another Weibo comment that was seen by the BBC.Read the original article on Load-Date: March 13, 2021End of Document

Sen. Schumer Issues Statement on ChinaTargeted News ServiceFebruary 25, 2021 Thursday 2:35 AM  ESTCopyright 2021 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 773 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON, Feb. 25 -- Sen. Charles E. Schumer, D-New York, issued the following floor statement, which was published in the Congressional Record on Feb. 24, 2021:Mr. President, on another matter. Everyone knows our country and our economy face daunting challenges beyond COVID-19. While our two parties don't agree on a whole lot, both Republicans and Democrats know that one of the main challenges of the 21st century will be competing with and confronting China.The roots of this challenge go back decades. When I was first elected to the Senate visiting all corners of New York, I saw entire industries going under as a result of unfair Chinese competition and the manipulation of the currency by China. For decades, China has effectively cheated and stolen its way to economic growth, engaging in brazen theft of American intellectual property via cyber operations, forced technology transfers, the dumping of cheap goods in our economy, and for a while, the pernicious manipulation of its currency. American workers, academics, and businesses of all sizes have paid the price to the tune of millions of jobs and trillions of dollars of wealth.More recently, China has directed its energy and mercantilist policies toward beating the United States and like-minded countries to the pole position on all leading technologies in the 21st century.When I say "China," I mean the Chinese Government and the China Communist Party. The American people have nothing against the Chinese people.I have made no secret of America's failure to hold the Chinese Government accountable, and that has been a failure of both parties both parties in the past. After another bout of tough talk, we are not much closer to reining in China's predatory behavior than we were 4 years ago. That is why yesterday, I asked the chairs and members of our relevant Senate committees to begin work on legislation to enable the United States to out compete China and create American jobs.At the core of this effort will be the Endless Frontier Act. This is a bipartisan legislation that Senator Young and I sponsored and drafted together over a year ago. It would surge resources into the National Science Foundation and the Department of Commerce to advance American innovation in a number of critical technologies.We must also consider significant investments, even through emergency appropriations, to rebuild the capacity of the U.S. semiconductor industry. This, too, is a bipartisan effort that Senators Cotton and Cornyn joined Senator Warner and I, and we placed the original authorizing legislation in the Defense bill.Right now, semiconductor manufacturing is a dangerous weak spot in our economy and in our national security. Our auto industry is facing significant chip shortages. This is a technology the United States created, and we ought to be leading the world in. The same goes for building out 5G, the next-generation telecommunications network. There is bipartisan interest on both these issues.Overall, the new legislation must achieve three goals: one, boost American competitiveness by investing in our economy and our workers; two, leverage our alliances abroad; and, three, stop once and for all China's predatory practices. A number of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have strong bipartisan ideas on these issues, including Senators Menendez and Risch, Brown and Toomey, Cantwell and Wicker. I hope we can all work together to craft a bill that meets that moment.It is my intention to put this legislation on this topic on the Senate floor for a vote this spring. I urge the committees to continue their work in a bipartisan way so we can have strong legislation before us.It so happens that today, at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, significant work will be done on the same issues. President Biden has invited a bipartisan group of lawmakers to the White House to discuss concerns with the U.S. supply chain, particularly the semiconductor shortage, and will sign an Executive order aimed at plugging the holes.I applaud both the meeting and the Executive order. The new administration is taking a strong first step in shoring up America's critical supply chains and putting a spotlight on American competitiveness.TARGETED NEWS SERVICE (founded 2004) features non-partisan 'edited journalism' news briefs and information for news organizations, public policy groups and individuals; as well as 'gathered' public policy information, including news releases, reports, speeches.

Atotech Announces Refinancing of Senior Secured Credit FacilitiesThomson Reuters ONEMarch 18, 2021 Thursday 4:19 PM ESTCopyright 2021 Comtex News Network, Inc.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 GLOBE NEWSWIRE. All rights reserved.This content is provided to LexisNexis by Comtex News Network, Inc.Length: 1538 wordsBodyBERLIN, March 18, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Atotech Limited (NYSE: ATC) ("Atotech" or the "Company"), a leading specialty chemicals technology company and a market leader in advanced electroplating solutions, today announced that it has closed on the refinancing of its senior secured credit facilities. In particular, five of its indirect wholly owned subsidiaries--Alpha 3 B.V., Alpha US BidCo, Inc., Atotech B.V., Atotech Deutschland GmbH and Atotech Asia Pacific Limited (collectively, the "Borrowers") successfully refinanced the Company's existing senior secured credit facilities and entered into a new credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement"). The Credit Agreement provides for a U.S. dollar-denominated senior secured term loan facility in an initial aggregate principal amount of $1.35 billion (the "USD Term Loan"), a Euro-denominated senior secured term loan facility in an initial aggregate principal amount of EUR200.0 million (the "EUR Term Loan"), and a senior secured multi-currency revolving credit facility that provides for revolving loans, letters of credit and ancillary facilities in an aggregate principal amount of up to $250.0 million (the "Revolving Credit Facility").Peter Frauenknecht, Chief Financial Officer of Atotech said, "We are delighted we were able to complete the refinancing so quickly after our IPO last month. We are also very pleased with the pricing and extension of the maturities of this transaction, which we believe reflect our reduced leverage as a result of the IPO, and our strong business outlook. Assuming a stable rate environment, we expect that our new debt structure will result in a meaningful annual interest expense reduction. It also provides continued financial flexibility to invest in our business."The USD Term Loan and EUR Term Loan mature in March 2028 and the net proceeds from borrowings thereunder were used to fund the refinancing in full of the Company's outstanding existing term loan credit facilities, which were set to mature in January 2024, and to repay and replace its existing revolving credit agreement, which was to mature in January 2022. The Revolving Credit Facility matures in March 2026 and borrowings thereunder were used to replace existing letters of credit under the Company's previous revolving credit facility. Future borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are expected to be used to fund working capital and for other general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions and other investments.Borrowings under the USD Term Loan bear interest at a variable rate of 250 basis points above LIBOR, with a minimum interest rate of 50 basis points. Borrowings under the EUR Term Loan bear interest at a variable rate of 275 basis points above EURIBOR, with a minimum interest rate of zero basis points and a potential leverage-based decrease in interest rate to 250 basis points above EURIBOR. The Revolving Credit Facility bears interest at a variable rate of 200 basis points above LIBOR and a commitment fee of 37.5 basis points.Goldman Sachs Bank USA serves as administrative agent and collateral agent under the Credit Agreement and Goldman Sachs Bank USA, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A, Barclays Bank Plc, Credit Suisse International, Credit Suisse Loan Funding LLC, Citibank, N.A., London Branch, Unicredit Bank AG, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., HSBC Trinkaus & Burkhardt AG, Standard Chartered Bank AG, and TCG Senior Funding L.L.C. all serve as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners.Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking StatementsThis communication contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Hong Kong will be left without seeing the Oscars for controls of the Chinese regimeCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 31, 2021 WednesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 535 wordsBodyThe Oscars, which award the most acclaimed films in Hollywood and a few other industries, have been broadcast for 52 years without interruption in Hong Kong, a territory under the mandate of the People's Republic of China. But the stage changed.In early March, the Chinese government had asked local media to minimize award coverage "in order to avoid embarrassment and for the sake of political correctness," the Hong Kong newspaper Apple Daily reported according to an EFE review.As a result, the TVB television station will stop broadcasting them as it used to on open signal. The decision is "purely commercial" according to a spokesperson for the network that spoke to AFP; however, the background arises in analyzing why the decision denotes a new gesture of censorship on the part of the Chinese regime.On par, the station ?? CCTV, which has broadcast previous Oscar ceremonies, has not confirmed whether it will show this year's event.The territory competes in the category of best international film for the film "Better Days" and in best documentary short for "Do Not Split". The latter, lasting 36 minutes, portrays the 2019 anti-government protests. This is where the problem arises.«Do Not Split»The short film, directed and produced by Anders Hammer, shows the protesters' version of what happened during the 2019 protests. Basically the population demanded democracy, since the territory operates under a kind of semi-autonomy. In addition, they called for the withdrawal of an extradition bill to China of alleged suspected criminals.The BBC portal estimated that this would be the largest protest in Hong Kong since the territory returned to China in 1997. For weeks there were strikes, clashes with the police, tear gas throughout the city and consequences that went around the world.This documentary work may have been the Chinese regime's annoyance in applying a new level of censorship, according to international media estimates.Censorship of Chinese directorAnother controversy around this issue is criticism received by Chloé Zhao, a Chinese-American director who is nominated for Best Director. In addition, his film "Nomadland" is nominated in the category of Best Picture.But Zhao is not very well received in China after making a statement in 2013 where he said china is "a place where there are lies everywhere." As punishment, the release date of her new feature film (April 23 of this year) was removed from major movie websites.The SensaCine portal collects that Chinese searches for the 'hashtags' #Nomadland and #NomadlandFechaDeEstreno blocked on the Weibbo platform. Film content was replaced by a message warning of its removal "in accordance with relevant laws, regulations and policies".Although Hong Kong enjoys supposed autonomy, warnings have emerged of how it may be eroding with Xi Jinping's regime. For example, Amnesty International questioned a law passed in June 2020 called the National Security Act, which would serve to subdue citizens.Crimes of "secession," "subversion," "terrorism," and "collusion with foreign forces" are so vaguely defined that they can be used in politically motivated prosecutions with potentially harsh penalties, the organization warns.Load-Date: April 1, 2021End of Document

"Debt Diplomacy": How China Expands Its Influence in the South Pacific and Challenges AustraliaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 17, 2021 WednesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 2219 wordsBody              Relations between Australia and China are going through a very difficult time.            Getty Images Australia-China relations are going through a very difficult time.       Warning: this story contains a photo - and its description - that may be disturbingfor some peopleChina and Australia are engaged in a geopolitical pulse in the South Pacific that has global implications.Over the past year, both countries have publicly ventilated their differences, exposing the rapid deterioration of their relations.But tensions began to emerge much earlier.In 2018, Australia began accusing China of meddling in its internal affairs,after which it passed a law against foreign espionage and interference.In addition, it prohibited its telecommunications companies from acquiring 5G technology equipment from the Chinese company Huawei, citing national security reasons.Following the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, Prime Minister Scott Morrison's government advocated international research into the origin of the disease, which was interpreted in Beijing as an attack against him.The Global Times newspaper, belonging to the Communist Party of China, accused Morrison of adventurer and warned that the damage to bilateral relations could be "irreparable." A relevant threat from Australia's main trading partner.• The dispute between Australia and China over the origin of the coronavirus that threatens to lead to an "economic divorce" between the two countriesFrom then on, Beijing began to hamper bilateral trade, imposing high tariffs on products such as barley and australian wine, hindering imports of beef and prohibiting the purchase of Australian timber and coal, among other measures.In November 2020, days after an Australian government report found "credible evidence" that Australian soldiers killed 39 civilians during the war in Afghanistan, a spokesman for China's foreign ministry posted on Twitter a manipulated image showing an Australian soldier placing a knife around the neck of an Afghan child.               The image published by China is false.            Twitter The image posted by China is false.       Just two hours later, Prime Minister Morrison appeared on television demanding an apology from Chinese President Xi Jinping's government.However, Beijing did not back down. "It is not China that should be ashamed, but Australia,"said a spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry.But what's behind all these clashes?"Political war""Basically, what is happening is that China is waging what is known asa political war against Australia," says Malcolm Davis, senior analyst in strategy and defense capability at the Australian Institute of Strategic Policy in Canberra, to BBC World."Beijing has chosen a number of issues to put pressure on us, including its ability to use trade and financial investment as a form of coertion. It has also had direct interference from China in our internal political and economic affairs to try to control our critical infrastructure. And the more wewe reject this, they increase the pressure more," he adds.               China put barriers to the importation of Australian meat.            WILLIAM WEST/Getty Images China put a barrier to the importation of Australian meat.       Davis notes that Beijing began to annoy when Australia refused to use Huawei products on its 5G telecommunications networks."That would have given the Chinese government control over our communications networks and it bothered them not to bend to their will," he says.Faced with such signals, Huawei has said that the Chinese authorities have never asked it to carry out espionage work and that, if that were to happen, it would refuse to comply "categorically".Taiwan and debt diplomacyBeyond bilateral tensions, China's growing influence in the South Pacific,in the geographical environment closest to Australia, is also of concern to them.Beijing has been lending money for the construction of major infrastructure works in places like Fiji and Vanuatu.In the latter it financed a monumental international convention center that is deprecated and un funded for its maintenance, as well as a huge port valued at US$90 million with capacity to host cruise ships and serve as a way for the export of the country's agricultural products.               Charlot Salwai, when he was Prime Minister of Vanuatu, in a meeting with Xi Jinping in China.            Getty Images Charlot Salwai, when he was Prime Minister of Vanuatu, in a meeting with Xi Jinping in China.       Malcolm Davis sees these loans as part of a Beijing strategy to trap these countries using "debt diplomacy.""Chinais trying to get these countries to accumulate huge amounts of debt so that then, when they can't repay it, they take control of those assets in those territories and put them at their service," he says."They use debt trap diplomacy to coercive these small states and get a point of support there and be able to control critical facilities that they can use in the future to project their power, including military, in the Indo-Pacific region and in the South-West Pacific," he adds.Alicia García Herrero, Chief Economist for Asia Pacific at Natixis Investment Bank and researcher at Think Tank Bruegel, agrees that China's loans in this region are not motivated by purely economic reasons."In the end there are about 13 million people scattered on 12 islands. So, of course, it's not going to be the market that attracts China to this remote place in the world," Garcia tells BBC Mundo, referencing China's interest in both Melanesia and Micronesia.The expert notes that Beijing has a great interest in this area because there is Taiwan's "umbilical cord" in the world, where this island that China considers to be a "rebellious province" still has a diplomatic presence.               Taiwan is regarded by China as a "rebel province."            Getty Images Taiwan is considered by China as a "rebel province".       "On these Pacific islands Taiwan's influence is much more important, geographically and historically, even culturally and racially. So I'd saythere is no doubt: it is the only reason China lends so brutally in this part of the world," he adds.García further recalls that in recent years during the meetings of the National People's Assembly of China, China's highest legislative body, referring to Taiwan and Hong Kong no longer mentions that only peaceful methods will be used to achieve reunification with these territories, leaving open the door to armed conflict.Fear of military threatThat possibility is a cause for alarm in Australia."We are concerned that China has acted against Taiwan in the very near future, between 12 months and the next five years. If it does, obviously the United States will be forced to respond to defend Taiwan and they would expect Australia to support them. That would cause us to enter into a military conflict with China,which would open up all sorts of possibilities including Beijing attacking us militarily or exercising economic coercion against us. From that perspective it's a big threat," Davis says.The expert believes that, beyond the possibility of an armed conflict over Taiwan, China's growing influence in the region may lead to a greater military presence in Taiwan in the area endangering Australia.               In Australia, there is concern that China may have a miltar presence in its environment.            Getty Images In Australia raises concerns that China may have a miltar presence in its environment.       It mentions in particular China's plans to build a large fishing centre - valued at about US$200 million - on Daru Island in Papua New Guinea."These facilities could in the future support the Chinese Navy or its Coast Guard, which would potentially have their vessels just 200 kilometres off the Australian coast," he says."For China to expand its presence in this area is something that would fundamentally change our strategic situation because for the first time since 1942 our east coast would be under threat from a hostile foreign power,"he adds.So far, however, the large infrastructures that China has financed in the southern Pacific are formally civil or commercial in nature.What has happened elsewhere in the world is that China ended up controlling the works it financed.That was the case, for example, of the port of Hambantota in Sri Lanka which was built on a Chinese loan of S$1.1 billion and proved a commercial failure.In 2017, it was left to Beijing with a 99-year lease agreement, after the Srilan government was in trouble to honor its many debts.               After funding and building it, China took over the port of Hambantota in Sri Lanka for 99 years.            Getty Images After funding and building it, China took over the port of Hambantota in Sri Lanka for 99 years.       Since then there has been talk about the possibility that China may want to use it to patrol the Indian Ocean.In Pakistan, China financed the construction of the port of Gwadar, which it has controlled since 2013.It is a work with commercial interest, but also with strategic value because it is located on the sea route that leads to the Hormuz Strait,where much of the oil from the Middle East transits.In recent years, information has circulated on alleged plansChina's military for that facility.These include an article in Forbes magazine in June 2020, according to which Beijing built a high-security complex on the port, which could be a step before the establishment of a naval base.Davis fears this will be the destination of china-built port in Vanuatu, where they can dock cruisers but also destroyers and other powerful warships."The Caribbean Sea of China"Beijing's quest for greater presence and influence in the South Pacific has an ultimate goal for Malcolm Davis: to replace the United States as the reference power in the region."Chinais trying to end america's strategic primacy in the Indo-Pacific and instead create a regional order led by them. If they can divide America's allies and coerce them, that will make it easier for Beijing to achieve that goal," he says.               U.S. and Australian forces participate in numerous joint military exercises.            Getty Images U.S. and Australian forces participate in numerous joint military exercises.       "This is a pulse between China, on the one hand, and the Western alliance that includes Australia and the United States, on the other, to see who emerges as the dominant power in the Indo-Pacific region in the 21st century. And we're at the top of this competition," he adds.Rodger Baker, vice president of strategic analysis at Stratfor/Rane, a geopolitical intelligence platform, agrees with this idea by pointing out that Australia was in the midst of a struggle for regional hegemony between Beijing and Washington."China would like the South China Sea and the East China Sea to be like its Caribbean Sea and to be the dominant power there; and Australia is on the edge of that area," Baker tells BBC Mundo.China asserts that it wants to shape the way it is seen in the region, while at the same time trying to transform the regional environment to create gaps in U.S. alliances and get countries to recognize that going against it can have negative consequences for them.Baker explains that from Beijing's point of view these actions also have a defensive component."The Chinese have seen their international vulnerabilities. They know they are dependent on international maritime trade and see that the United States and its partners have the ability to close China's access to its key markets and suppliers. It's not that the U.S. will necessarily do that, but that it has control of maritime space and, thanks to its alliances, has that capability," he says.               Australia's pimer minister Scott Morrison has maintained a strong pulse with China.            Sam Mooy/Getty Images Australia's pimer minister, Scott Morrison, has maintained a tough pulse with China.       The mere massive presence of U.S. forces in Australia and Micronesia is, for Alicia García Herrera, an incentive for China to want to establish military bases in this area of the world that is strategic to it, among other reasons, on the subject of Taiwan."We must also not see 'evil' in this, for the United States would have done the same," he says.Baker, for his part, claims that China sees itself as an emerging global power, not just a regional power, and that it feels it represents the "global south" that is fighting a series ofinternational standards established by a small group of North Atlantic countries: the United States, Canada and Western Europe."Chinahas seen how the United States identifies it as a competitor and as a strategic threat and acts accordingly. So yes, there's a defensive component in what they're doing by looking for weaknesses in the U.S.-led coalition to try to break their cohesion," he says."The Chinese have been excellent Cold War scholars and want to prevent the United States from being able to build a global coalition to contain or constrain them," he concludes.Now you can receive notifications from BBC World.

Donald Trump ordered banning transactions with Alipay, WeChat Pay and other Chinese appsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 6, 2021 WednesdayCopyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2021 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 524 wordsBodyU.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday ordered a ban on all transactions with Alipay, WeChat Pay, and other linked apps to Chinese companies, arguing that they could send user information to the Chinese government.The executive order will take effect 45 days, weeks after Trump is replaced in the White House by Democrat Joe Biden, winner of the election on November 3.A senior administration official said the order and its implementation has not been discussed with Biden's "possible inbound administration."Trump's move also comes after previous executive orders aimed at banning TikTok, which is owned by China-based ByteDance, were thwarted by court rulings that Trump overstepped his legal authority.The applications referred to in the new ban were chosen due to the very high number of downloads, which meant that tens of millions of users could run the risk of their data being exploited, according to the administration official."We are trying to articulate the world and take steps to stop the invasion of China's great data strategy - photos, text messages, phone calls to parents - to be fed into this massive tool for global oppression," the official said.Trump's order asks the Secretary of Commerce to review and evaluate what other applications should be included in the ban. He specifically named Alipay, CamScanner, QQ Wallet, SHAREit, Tencent QQ, VMate, WeChat Pay and WPS Office."This data collection threatens to provide the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese Communist Party with access to personal and American-owned information, which would allow China to track the location of federal employees and contractors," reads trump's decree.The veto will affect any transaction through those applications with persons or properties subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.China's efforts to steal data from Americans show China's intention to use it "to promote its economic and national security agenda," the text adds.The decree mentions several cyber intrusions attributed to China in recent years that compromised data from millions of Americans, including one from the Chinese army to the Equifax company in 2017, which affected the personal information of nearly half of all Americans."The United States must take aggressive action against those who develop or control connected software applications in China to protect our national security," Trump said in the text of his executive order.This decision escalating tensions with China on the eve of Trump having to hand over the presidency to Democrat Joe Biden, winner of last November's election.The United States has repeatedly accused China of being behind cyberattacks against its companies or institutions, but its response has always been to deny it and claim that it is precisely Washington that promotes espionage against governments, companies, or individuals from other countries. With information from AFP and EFERead on:Donald Trump presses his vice to avoid confirming Joe Biden's victory: what the special session of Congress will look likeElections closed in Georgia in elections where control of the US Senate is playedLoad-Date: January 7, 2021End of Document

Senate Armed Services Committee Issues Testimony From Microsoft President SmithTargeted News ServiceFebruary 24, 2021 Wednesday 7:50 AM  ESTCopyright 2021 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 10873 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Senate Armed Services Committee issued the following testimony by Microsoft President Brad Smith at a hearing entitled "Emerging Technologies and Their Impact on National Security" on Feb. 23, 2021:Thank you for the opportunity to offer some perspectives on issues that are vital to U.S. national security.Digital technology plays an increasingly critical role in the defense of the nation. Emerging technologies are redefining the way we secure the peace, maintain our defense, and when necessary, fight wars.Innovations in cloud and edge services, artificial intelligence, and 5G are already having a direct and practical impact on the nation's defense. As the decade progresses, we should look to the potential importance of quantum computing as well. These technologies will redefine the requirements for military operations at mission speed, based on their ability to harness massive amounts of data and computational power. They will also be interconnected: future computational capabilities will be defined by an ability to accelerate applications across the cloud, using AI and advanced silicon. They will reshape the security needs for the nation's critical infrastructure and affect training requirements for our military personnel. In short, new technology will have a pervasive impact on our national security.Yet one would be hard-pressed to say that the country currently has a comprehensive strategy to harness these technologies for the country's defense. A more cohesive approach is needed.This strategy needs to be grounded in a clear-eyed assessment of where digital technology is going and the nature of global competition in technology markets. Speed matters. The United States must move more quickly to advance broad-based technology innovation and pursue new approaches to use, secure, and adapt commercial advances for military applications. This requires a holistic approach to government-sponsored basic research, commercial technology development, and investments in new military uses. It will require an even closer partnership between the government and the tech sector.An essential starting point is to ask: What are we trying to accomplish? To be sure, the protection of American lives and the peace and prosperity of our country are the primary considerations. But so is the country's unique role in providing global leadership. When we think about the role of technology in the context of the country's defense and national power, our ability to lead the world and to establish and defend the most important connective tissue of the international order - in areas such as finance, cybersecurity, healthcare, and transportation - marks one of the deepest roots of American power and security.For the last 70 years, the United States has provided what we might think of as the global public operating system in every essential area of life. The next 70 years will witness this not as a metaphor, but as real software power. Any successful national security strategy therefore must also find ways for us to continue to offer the best options for nations around the world as they transition every part of their national lives to a digital age. As in the past, there is no substitute for technology the world can trust, based on the United States' commitment to human rights and democratic values.Based on this vision, the country should pursue a digital defense strategy with seven objectives:1. Focus on where digital technology is going and where advantage will lie.2. Strengthen the nation's technology leadership by investing in talent and research.3. Enhance American competitiveness and security by modernizing technology-related trade and investment policy.4. Accelerate the adaptation of commercial digital technology for defense applications.5. Continue to strengthen the defense of the nation's digital infrastructure.6. Pursue a strong and renewed commitment to technology collaboration with our allies.7. Lead with moral authority and not the strength of technology alone.All this is described in greater detail below.1. Focus on where digital technology is going and where advantage will lie.Almost all the digital technology we rely on today was made possible because of Gordon Moore's simple rule: processing speeds of silicon chips double every two years. For more than a half century, this principle has defined the explosive advancement of hardware, software, and connectivity. While Moore's Law is reaching the physical limits of fabricated chips, computing will continue to advance at a rapid rate.Today's focus on algorithms, software, new materials, integration technologies, and even subatomic research will redefine computing. And while the computer revolution took root on American soil, it is now a worldwide endeavor with global powers, including China, competing and sometimes leading the race.The rise of the cloud and the transition to distributed intelligence at the cloud and the edge.Cloud services have become the lifeblood of most modern enterprises. They make large amounts of computational power and storage available without capital investments in hardware by the end user. This is reshaping military technology in the same way it is impacting every other field. DoD has embraced these trends through projects like the Joint Enterprise Defense Initiative ("JEDI").JEDI lays the foundation for DoD to embrace a full array of transformative technologies. For the first time, DoD will be able to fully leverage billions of dollars of annual private sector investment in cloud security, reliability, infrastructure, and governance. It will replace investments in single-purpose systems that are out of date by the time they come into service, using instead a modern compute environment that evolves with changing technology. Investment in hybrid solutions will further enable these core capabilities to extend from the data center to the field with new devices that enable data insights and analysis in rugged environments with poor or no connection to the network.As the cloud extends its reach beyond data centers to what has been coined the "intelligent edge," cloud computing is becoming geographically distributed through an ever-expanding Internet of Things (IoT).Whether in a home, vehicle, or factory, the edge is considered one of the last bastions of Moore's Law as embedded sensors and devices become more efficient and less expensive. By 2030, 50 billion IoT devices will reside on the edge of the world's computing network. Just two years from now, in 2023, International Data Corporation (IDC) projects that more than 50 percent of new enterprise IT infrastructure will be at the intelligent edge rather than corporate data centers, up from less than 10 percent in 2020. By 2024, the number of applications deployed in the cloud and at the edge will increase 800 percent.1 This means the future of computing for everything, including military applications, is about the combination of computing power in the cloud and at the edge, with robust connectivity between them. As Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has noted, the acceleration of this type of "tech intensity" is essential for any institution to thrive going forward. One has to be both world class at adopting the latest digital technology and building its own proprietary digital technology. This is going to be true for our defense institutions as well.2As the world's intelligent edge explodes, so will the amount of data gathered by the tiny sensors and devices located where the digital and physical worlds intersect. Paired with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its use of Machine Learning (ML), edge devices will have the power to see, listen, reason, and predict real-world developments around them. Perhaps more importantly, new intelligent edge applications will be able to interact with their physical environments to perform increasingly complex tasks with increasing degrees of autonomy. And as intelligent devices at the edge proliferate, so too will the surface area for cyberattacks as the vulnerabilities of these soft access points are exploited.This distributed paradigm will bridge the physical and digital worlds by enabling previously difficult or impossible scenarios, like digital twins and rich real-time analytics to support our military on the most remote battlefields. Microsoft and the U.S. Army have already moved forward on this digital frontier by working together on the Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS), based on the HoloLens augmented reality (AR) system. For example, before warfighters seek to rescue hostages in a building, they can plan their mission based on a digital twin of the building and train for the operation using the rapid construction of a physical mock-up of it. The same technology enables warfighters to execute the operation with real-time visual data that integrates everything from the building's digital layout to local thermal images to facial recognition of the hostages and the identification of friendly forces.Connectivity - from broadband to 5G, Low-Earth Orbit Satellites, and beyond.As the computing canvas stretches from the edge to the cloud, reliable connectivity will become essential to provide the bandwidth and speed needed to maximize smart and connected devices. Fifth-generation, or 5G, networks will deliver data flows 10 to 100 times faster than 4G and support many more devices.They will offer the precision and speed needed to realize the power of edge computing with immersive, real-time, and intelligent experiences, much like electricity powers the world today.Countries that rapidly deploy 5G stand to gain in revenue, job creation, and leadership in technology innovation. As we have seen with other technology transformations, software will play an important role in advancing 5G to deliver new solutions that increase speed, reduce costs, and boost security. With 5G more so than previous generations of wireless technology, software - from signal processing to radio area networks to complex traffic management - is at least as critical as spectrum and radio frequency infrastructure.There is a significant opportunity for both traditional leaders and new players across the industry to innovate, collaborate, and create new markets, serving the world's networking and edge computing needs and the coming software ecosystem that will depend on these technologies. As with previous technology ecosystems, global standards and interoperability in our networking and computing infrastructure across the edge and cloud will be critical to unlocking the full creativity and productivity of the scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs, and innovators who will help shape our future.As nations look to overhaul their broadband infrastructure, governments are rightly focusing on the cyber risks associated with 5G's supply chain integrity where they currently rely exclusively on a handful of foreign suppliers. While some nations are breaking this dependency by adopting modularized software defined systems, some are concerned that these systems create a broader and multidimensional vulnerability. 5G's inherently modular nature and use of software-defined networking, however, also create opportunities to increase security and resiliency. This can foster a more diverse supplier ecosystem and enable the application of leading-edge security techniques and technologies, such as AI and containerization to identify, isolate, contain, and protect against malicious attacks on the network.But 5G is not the only connectivity technology that is advancing. Existing solutions like fiber, satellites, Wi-Fi, and short-range technologies continue to progress. For example, we can leverage satellite broadband to connect modular data centers to bring high-intensity, secure cloud computing to some of the most challenging environments, where critical prerequisites like power, connectivity, and building infrastructure are unreliable. And well before we reach the year 2030, we'll be discussing 6G and how to extend the networks' global reach through thousands of Low-Earth Orbiting Satellites.Software combined with the explosion of data and infused with AI.For most of the 179 years since Lady Ada Lovelace wrote the first program for a computing device - Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine - software programming has required a skilled individual to translate a human's understanding of a problem to a program that instructs a machine how to solve it. AI, particularly with the stunning progress computer scientists and engineers have made in ML over the past two decades, has allowed us to think about harnessing computers in a fundamentally different way.ML systems learn from data without being programmed. They can reason about complex phenomena in both the digital and physical world, understand these phenomena, and make predictions or draw inferences that can support human decision making or be employed in automated ways. Using ML techniques, we have built AI systems that can both see and understand what they are seeing. We have built speech recognition systems that can hear and understand what is being said. We have built systems that can seamlessly and in real time translate between spoken human languages. We have even built AI systems that have achieved superhuman performance on tasks we once thought were high watermarks of human cognition, like beating the best human players in the world at games like Chess and Go.The power of machine learning systems is growing rapidly, both in terms of improved performance on existing ML tasks (like speech recognition, computer vision and machine translation), and perhaps more interestingly, on the rapid expansion of new tasks that ML systems can undertake.AI and machine learning workloads that run side by side with more traditional, hand-coded software will continue to grow at an exponential rate, driven by developers utilizing new AI algorithms and customers' ambitions to incorporate AI into new tasks. According to IDC, by 2024, more than 50 percent of user interface interactions will use AI-enabled computer vision, speech, natural language processing (NLP), and augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR).3 And by 2025, at least 90 percent of new enterprise applications will embed artificial intelligence.Recent ML breakthroughs, particularly the family of methods jointly referred to as deep learning, have allowed ML systems to approach or exceed human capabilities on a wide range of tasks. These breakthroughs enable us to teach AI systems to accomplish a very broad range of cognitive tasks by training on unlabeled data, such as Wikipedia texts and YouTube videos. Given the extremely large volumes of unlabeled data available on the internet, as well as data that can be produced in simulation environments and will be coming in growing volumes from sensors on the intelligent edge, we increasingly are bound more by the amount of computing power than the amount of data that we can bring to bear to train ever-larger models. Researchers anticipate that this trend will continue to yield results even as models grow to be 100 to 1,000 times larger than they are today.The need to train models this large has unleashed a new race to create "AI supercomputers," with a primary competitive race unfolding between Google, based in part on its acquisition of DeepMind, and Open AI, which works with a substantial investment from and in partnership with Microsoft. As this race has progressed, Google, Open AI, and Microsoft have achieved new landmark results in natural language processing with AI models that now have hundreds of billions of machine-learning parameters. It has also led to additional breakthroughs in computer vision, speech recognition, content understanding and recommendations, and other areas of machine learning.The implications for defense applications are expanding rapidly. For example, Microsoft is leveraging commercial AI technology to accelerate innovation for DoD through the creation of computer-generated, three-dimensional models of objects and environments. Until recently, Pentagon planning often was constrained by the availability of imagery from the theater of operations. Leveraging technology developed by our Xbox team, we combine gaming and rendering technology developed for consumer markets over the last 20 years to build lifelike models depicting objects in any environment, at any time of day, in any weather condition, and from any angle or perspective. (This technology is also being used in civilian scenarios to train Unmanned Aerial Vehicles to recognize the state of crops to enhance productivity for farming.) DoD can use these models to train personnel and plan operations.Semiconductor Chips - from faster processing speeds to a quantum future.While the first generation of AI supercomputers are being built with today's most powerful semiconductor chips and networks, the building blocks for these systems were not originally designed to support AI at scale. The next generation of AI supercomputers will require a surge in innovation in silicon, computer architecture, memory, and networking technology. Tomorrow's AI supercomputers will need to be orders of magnitude more powerful than the most powerful machines in existence today to meet the nearly unbounded demand for compute from modern AI programs.As our need for compute continues to expand, the physical limitations of silicon are becoming apparent, spurring research and development on materials with enhanced capabilities to support new forms of computation, including quantum computing. Classical computers powered by silicon think in terms of binary bits of ones and zeroes. Quantum computers, by contrast, harness modern physics and the quantum mechanical behavior of nature to perform a computation using quantum bits - or qubits - the quantum version of a classic binary bit that represents multiple values simultaneously.The promise of quantum computers lies in their ability to solve problems requiring "big compute" - challenges in cryptanalysis, chemistry, and materials science - in months, weeks, or days, where current and even the next generations of silicon-based chips and networks would still take billions of years. Once scaled up, quantum computing could lead to rapid advances across society and industry, including identifying an efficient catalyst to reduce carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and materials that could enable lossless power transmission or better battery technologies.Unlocking the full potential of quantum computing will require more than simply building quantum computers, however. Quantum applications will require advanced classical computers working in conjunction with quantum computers. These applications on an industrial scale will require advances in semiconductor chips, cloud infrastructure, network connectivity, and more.It is important to both national security and the American economy to secure a domestic quantum future.The National Quantum Initiative Act signed in 2018 was a critical first step. It bolstered the nation's leadership by investing in quantum research and development by government, industry, and academia.Industrial-scale quantum computing will require even more, including a physical infrastructure to support the quantum supply chain that encompasses manufacturing, materials development, system-level validation and verification, and nanoscale fabrication.Looking to the future, Congress should consider funding a quantum equivalent of Operation Warp Speed.The U.S. government could seek to combine federal resources with private sector capital and expertise.Federal funding could come in the form of milestone-based pre-payments for access to the capabilities that firms are developing, direct funding for scalable quantum solutions, and other means of accelerating and de-risking quantum efforts. Congress should also consider ways to increase cooperation and knowledge sharing between government quantum researchers and their private sector counterparts.The conceptual threads that tie American technology together.The foregoing areas reflect an enormous range of scientific and technological advances. Yet two conceptual threads run throughout all these critical fields. First, advances and adoption of technology at a global level require more than world-class technology itself. They also turn on the ability to persuade other governments and international markets to adopt standards and endorse technology protocols that reflect American inventions. The United States has excelled in these fields through decades of international collaboration and outreach. It will need to continue to do so for decades into the future.Second, and perhaps more important, all these innovative technologies require and run on trust. As digital technology becomes an ever more ubiquitous part of our lives, it has increasingly profound impacts on our privacy, safety, security, and other fundamental freedoms. This too has deep implications for American leadership and values. Global technology competition is not only about the latest technical invention. It is also about products that reflect values the world can trust.2. Strengthen the nation's technology leadership by investing in talent and research.National policy for digital defense technology also needs to be grounded in a clear-eyed assessment of the state of global technology markets and the nature of global technology competition. There are two factors that deserve special attention.American digital defense technology increasingly starts with the development of commercial technology and then moves to military and intelligence adaptations, rather than the other way around.Since the 1800s, military technology has fallen into two categories. The first is illustrated by the jeep, a classic example of commercial technology that the military adapted for use in World War II. Henry Ford debuted the Model T in 1908 as the world's most practical and inexpensive automobile. Ford and other American automakers improved on this design for decades. In 1940, the U.S. Army recognized that the approaching war would require a new and inexpensive four-wheel drive motor vehicle. It turned to the nation's manufacturers, who adapted off-the-shelf automotive parts and designed the first prototype in just two days.The other category is technology that is invented first for military use and subsequently adapted for commercial applications. A good example is the jet aircraft. America's first jet plane was the Bell P-59 Airacomet, also created during World War II. It was designed in secret and its invention wasn't shared with the public until 1943, after it had completed 100 flights. It would take 15 additional years before the jet engine would be attached to civilian aircraft and transform the world of commercial aviation.The Cold War and the race to the moon were won principally by technology developed first for the government and later put to commercial use. But today the sequence often is reversed. Developing digital defense technology is often more like designing jeeps than inventing jets. This phenomenon, in turn, creates a need for American leadership in two areas - world-leading technology research and 7 development capability in both the governmental and private sectors and the ability to quickly adapt civilian technology for military use.The country must continue to refresh its capacity for digital innovation by investing in talent and research.The United States is the world's technology leader today because of decades of investment in education and research. When the nation confronted the Sputnik launch by the Soviet Union in 1957, President Eisenhower and a bipartisan Congress recognized that sustained national progress required not just federal investment in a new generation of rockets, but in stronger math and science education for a new generation of people.4 Just 11 months after Sputnik's launch, Eisenhower signed the National Defense Education Act (NDEA) into law, saying "this emergency program stems from national need, and its fruits will bear directly on national security."5Federal investment in education and basic research created a powerful infrastructure for innovation, but like our roads and bridges, that infrastructure is showing its age. Last month, the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI), chaired by my co-panelist Eric Schmidt, said in its Draft Final Report that "the time is right for a second NDEA, one that mirrors the first legislation, but with important distinctions."6 This frames the issue well and rightly sets a high bar for the bold ambition the country needs to refresh its innovation infrastructure. A new federal initiative should include the following elements, among others:* Expand support for STEM education. Today, less than a third of American high schools offers an advanced placement course in computer science.7 The number of young people taking such a course in 2020 was lower than for eleven other subjects. One challenge is the high cost of training teachers to teach computer science. Philanthropic groups such as code.org and tech companies such as Microsoft, Google, and Amazon have all launched important initiatives to help address this need, but more federal leadership and funding is needed, especially to support teacher training.* Invest in post-secondary education for critical disciplines. Federal support under the NDEA targeted disciplines such as math and science (and especially physics) that Congress believed would be critical to winning the space race. A similar effort is needed today, and it should start by cataloguing the fields where there is a current or expected shortage of skilled personnel in the United States. This should address the need for a compute-savvy workforce skilled in key areas like AI, quantum, and cybersecurity. Like the NDEA itself, this effort should include a focus on career and technical education, leveraging the nation's community colleges and vocational schools as well as four-year colleges and graduate degree programs.* Modernize immigration laws to address technology needs. The country's last major immigration overhaul took place in 1986, when Ronald Reagan was President and Tip O'Neil was Speaker of the House. It was closer in time to Sputnik's launch in 1957 than the technology challenges of 2021. The NSCAI's Draft Final Report captures well the types of immigration changes that are needed to ensure the United States attracts the best and brightest talent needed to advance technology's frontier. These include broadening the visa category for extraordinary talent, enabling better job portability for highly skilled visa holders, and enacting measures to clear the current green card backlog and provide a more stable path to green cards in the future.8 In addition, we should not forget that the Nation's Dreamers include a substantial number of extraordinarily talented individuals with advanced technology skills, something we witness every day among DACA registrants who are Microsoft employees.* Increase federal support for basic research related to critical technologies. The United States retains an unmatched capability for basic research through the country's research universities. Yet U.S. government spending on research and development and our share of global spending have dramatically declined,9 and within the next few years China is expected to surpass us.10 As in the past, the country needs to bolster our research capability for the next generation of technology needs, including AI, quantum computing, and other critical technologies. Here too, the NSCAI gets it right in its Draft Final Report, recommending an increase in AI R&D at compounding levels, doubling annually to reach $32 billion per year by Fiscal Year 2026./11* Support DoD efforts to recruit tech talent and develop digital skills among DoD personnel. Finally, the decade ahead will require that every American employer, including the nation's military, do more to invest in digital skills for its own personnel. While the country's employers increased their investments in digital skilling between 1980 and 2000, these investments have fallen and then stagnated since the year 2000./12Part of what is needed for the future will involve heightened DoD recruiting of tech talent. Virtually every job, including virtually every position in our military, will require more digital skills a decade from now that it does today. And conversely, as servicemembers exit the military, we need to support them to move into technology-enabled roles so their national security experience can help drive private sector applications and innovation. A successful example of a public-private partnership in this area is the Microsoft Software and Services Academy (MSSA).13 It has enabled thousands of service members, veterans, and spouses to secure technology jobs with more than 600 employers across the country.3. Enhance American competitiveness and security by modernizing technology-related trade and investment policy.The United States has been a global leader in digital technology since the field's inception, but this leadership will be more challenging to maintain in the decade ahead. While this conversation often begins by comparing the tech sectors in the United States and China, it is helpful to start by identifying the factors that influence this competition more broadly.American success in the development of commercial technology typically requires success on a broad international scale.This is true for three reasons. First, digital technology often involves high fixed costs and low marginal costs. The fixed costs are for engineering involved in software development and capital costs such as the construction of chip fabrication or data center facilities. To charge low prices and gain market share, companies must spread these high fixed costs across a large customer base that can only come from growth in foreign markets.Two other factors are at work as well. Most technology markets have strong network effects, which enable strong returns to scale once a company has established market leadership. And finally, services that are dependent on large quantities of data for product improvement, including through ML, are likely to gain an additional advantage by being the first to reach a market leading position. All this explains why LinkedIn founder and Microsoft board member Reid Hoffman talks about the critical need in tech markets for blitzscaling, meaning a "lightning-fast path" to develop market leadership on a global scale.14 This has implications for competition between the American and Chinese commercial technology sectors.With a population of 1.4 billion people, China is in a unique position to develop technology markets at an unmatched domestic scale. The rapid growth of ByteDance's TikTok service illustrates this well. As of last year, the company's service inside China, named Douyin, had 600 million daily active users, while its international TikTok counterpart had another 689 million monthly active users, giving it almost 1.3 billion users worldwide.15 This same phenomenon is at work for Chinese companies that are marketing technological platforms to global consumers in areas such as healthcare, finance, and education.At the same time, American technology firms do not have full access to China's domestic technology market. This makes it even more important that American companies succeed quickly not only in the United States, but in many other international markets as well.The United States currently has a patchwork of technology-related trade and investment laws rather than a holistic, cohesive, and strategic regulatory approach.Last summer Microsoft had not just a front row seat but a direct participatory role in some aspects of the TikTok review. One thing we came to appreciate is the difficulty for government officials and private sector participants alike when making decisions about specific technologies in the absence of a clearer overall legal framework to guide technology-related trade and investment activities. The United States' current patchwork of laws in these areas not only lacks strategic coherence but also reduces predictability for everyone it affects.On the export front, Congress in 2018 enacted the Export Control Reform Act (ECRA), the most sweeping piece of export control legislation since the 1970s. While this legislation directed the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) to adopt new regulations, the process for doing this - still ongoing - is creating substantial uncertainty for the tech sector. This is a critical and ongoing issue for almost every large technology company in the United States, as firms seek to balance these compliance obligations with the demands of a global market that wants more American products ever faster - and where missing a single product cycle can make it very difficult to catch up.On the import front, U.S. policy has moved rapidly to restrict technology investments and imports from China. This has its roots in the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), established in the 1970s. Congress expanded CFIUS's jurisdiction in 2018 through the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act (FIRRMA), which authorizes the Committee's review of non-controlling foreign investments. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2019 requires federal contractors to ban certain telecommunications technologies from their supply chains. The last Administration also relied on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to broadly authorize Commerce's review of technology transactions and ban certain mobile applications.In recent years, the government has relied on this complex set of laws to address several technology related concerns. Some of these efforts have focused on specific companies and the technologies they provide. Others have involved broad categories of information and communications technologies. For example, the State Department in recent years encouraged other countries to adopt more restrictive policies in these areas through its "Clean Network" initiative.It is worth recognizing that China's policies in this area reflect a similar desire to manage technology trade. China has long had a restrictive legal regime to manage technology imports and investments. This combines the filtering of foreign content with an array of domestic licensing requirements, joint venture obligations, and informal government signaling regarding the purchase of foreign technology. Last August, the Chinese government adopted new rules to control technology exports as well. These measures substantially broaden controlled categories, now including social media algorithms and other new categories. These changes were followed by a new export control law that went into effect in December, representing China's most significant effort to date to implement a comprehensive "dual-use" export control regime.As we look to the decade ahead, it is apparent that both the United States and China will want to scrutinize and restrict trade in dual use technologies. And with an increasing focus on digital sovereignty, the European Union and some member states are moving in a similar direction.Given the stakes and uncertainty, the urge to err on the side of caution by adopting ever more restrictive policies in this space is understandable. But that approach could weaken national security by undermining American technology leadership. We need a balanced and coherent framework that will protect national security without isolating the United States. And as we consider issues related to China in particular, we should develop an approach to technology-related trade and investment that permits cooperation when it is clearly in the interest of American technology leadership. As modern as China may be today, the country still depends on American technology and standards. To pull away from that position and accelerate China's adoption of its own, competing approaches risks jeopardizing American leadership in critical areas.The country needs to modernize its technology trade and investment policies.* The Commerce Department should identify the commercial technology exports it wants to control and adopt a modern, calibrated approach to control them. A high priority for the Commerce Department should be the adoption of new regulations on "emerging and foundational technologies" under ECRA. As many companies across the tech sector noted last year, applying a traditional, restrictive export control approach based solely on a product's performance criteria not only risks limiting societally beneficial uses, but could hinder the development of new technologies by depriving companies of the scale necessary to compete internationally. Overly restrictive export controls also risk cutting off access to the best talent - not just from the country targeted for control, but also from allies and other like-minded nations.A new and more calibrated approach is needed. Microsoft and Open AI proposed one in comments submitted to Commerce in November. Under this proposal, the Commerce Department would set policies that determine who can access sensitive technologies and for what purpose.16 This would allow for protection against problematic users and uses in a more targeted, effective, and dynamic way - not just at the point of initial access but continuously in a deployed environment. These policies would then be implemented and enforced within the protected technology itself, as well as by hardening the infrastructure around it to prevent circumvention.New technologies make this approach feasible. For example, software features built into sensitive technologies can enable real-time controls against prohibited uses and users. These features would include identity verification systems and information flow controls. "Tagging" can be used to ensure the same controls apply to derivatives of these sensitive technologies.Similarly, "roots of trust" built into sensitive hardware technologies can require authorization to send code or data through the equipment. More robust hardware identity verification through secure coprocessors akin to those used to secure payment in mobile phones or to prohibit in-game cheating in game consoles can further protect hardware against unauthorized access and uses.Technology may not eliminate the need for restrictive export controls in every particularly sensitive scenario. But in many areas, more targeted, technology-enabled solutions could help strike an optimal balance between security and the need for the American technology sector to remain globally competitive.* The government should ensure there exists an independent supply chain for both existing and certain anticipated critical technologies. To address this challenge, at least two key questions await urgent answers.First, the country must decide what technologies should be provided exclusively from domestic sources or from allied nations. The key criteria likely should focus both on the sensitivity of the technology and the danger of supply disruption in the event of international tensions. For example, the United States currently cannot source critical 5G technologies in a cost-effective way either domestically or from allies. It is impossible to imagine our potential adversaries being comfortable relying exclusively on American suppliers for these same technologies. The United States shouldn't think about these issues any differently.Second, the United States must decide how to achieve supply chain independence in the selected technologies in a strategic, effective, and cost-efficient way. Some key tenets should guide this work.First, the government should take stock of market trends and build upon them, providing public financial support only where it is needed and in a manner that will accelerate sustainable development by the market itself. Second, the government should use the full range of its policy tools to accelerate essential market trends, including its procurement practices and the broad role in the economy of agencies such as the DoD. And finally, the government should ensure there is reciprocal trade access to the American market for suppliers from NATO and other allied democratic countries, based on common terms for American access to these other markets.* The United States should modernize its broader technology import and foreign investment policies.This goes beyond the question of where the country wants to have an independent source of supply.Instead, it asks the government to decide where the presence of certain foreign technologies and investment poses a threat to the country's national security.The challenge of managing technology imports is more daunting than for exports, in part because there has been no legislation in recent years akin to ECRA. While IEEPA is a powerful policy tool, it was developed in a different era and for different circumstances from those that exist today. On the investment front, Congress recently updated CFIUS. But the United States still lacks a coherent framework governing the related issues of technology imports and foreign investment in U.S. technology companies. There are several critical questions that require an answer.First, the government must decide which technologies are so sensitive that imports or foreign ownership need to be controlled. It should then adopt consistent policies to manage both imports of and foreign investments in these technologies. The technology horizon will continue to evolve rapidly, and the government therefore will need criteria that stands the test of time. In part this should include digital infrastructure that would be susceptible to penetration or disruption in times of war.Second, once these sensitive technologies have been identified, the government must decide how it wants to control them. While one approach would be to bar sensitive technologies or investment from certain countries entirely, this is not always the best or the only feasible approach. For example, Microsoft has long operated by creating transparency centers that enable appropriate inspection of source code for a product like Windows. Similarly, we developed last year and shared with U.S. officials what we regarded as a sophisticated and effective technology model to manage consumer services from China by addressing five key objectives - security, privacy, authenticity, digital safety, and transparency.It is likely that global trade in key sectors increasingly will rely on these types of technology-enabled solutions. The United States should become an early adopter so that it can lead and shape the development of these solutions internationally.Finally, just as the government must determine where to restrict technology trade, it should also identify certain areas where it is safe for technology to move freely across borders. The good news is that many technologies are not sensitive from a national or economic security perspective. Even more important, in an era of open-source code and broad-based basic research, human knowledge advances daily based on global collaboration. The United States should aspire to lead the world in advancing the frontiers of scientific understanding and spreading appreciation of humanitarian values. We need government policies that protect the country's national security without cutting ourselves off from the global conversations that will shape humanity's future.4. Accelerate the adaptation of commercial digital technology for defense applications.The biggest competitive challenge the United States confronts in competition with China is not in technology research and development. Instead, it is the advantage China has over the United States in faster deployment and adoption of new technologies, particularly in AI. There are multiple reasons for this, including China's centralized government direction, and to some degree, broad adoption of technologies in ways that Americans rightly find objectionable. But one unmistakable result is the need to encourage faster and broader deployment and adoption of emerging technologies in the United States in a manner consistent with democratic principles and American values. This includes more rapid adoption of emerging digital technologies by DoD, most importantly to ensure American military supremacy but also to help accelerate technology adoption more broadly.Our national security will be best served through a three-pronged effort by the government to utilize digital technology. First, the government should use commercially available technology when it is sufficient for the task and as the foundation for additional development when more work is needed. This will both accelerate speed and reduce costs. Second, the government should add security layers to commercial technology when required, such as by protecting secret and top-secret workloads and military operations. Third, the government should adapt commercial products and development methods formilitary uses and applications, including through additional product development of the sort illustrated by the IVAS.All these efforts should be guided by three goals, among others - speed, cost, and innovation. As discussed further below, there is an opportunity to build upon recent procurement reforms with additional, practical steps that advance these goals. As much as anything else, we need to build a foundation for rapid and creative co-development efforts that breaks down barriers between engineers in the private sector and the warfighters whose missions depend on effectively using the world's most advanced technology.This Committee has pursued critical and impactful work in recent decades to reform DoD procurement.Much of this work has focused rightfully on the shift from the hardware-centric weapons systems of the post-World War II and Cold War eras to the digitally enhanced technologies of the 21st century. Despite this progress, there remain important inefficiencies that collectively impede DoD's ability to rapidly adopt digital technology. From incentives that reward process over speed to protests that undervalue the urgency of deploying the newest innovations, the Pentagon is still not where it needs to be. DoD should adopt approaches that will:* Incentivize and train the acquisition workforce. In the private sector, we see risk-taking, failure, and iteration as a natural part of the innovation process. The DoD acquisition workforce, on the other hand, is more heavily incentivized to be risk averse. This should change. DoD should recruit, train, and retain the tech talent needed to develop, test, integrate, and deploy new technologies. It should reward this professional procurement corps for agility, speed, smart risk-taking, and accountability.This Committee was instrumental in passing the Other Transaction and Middle Tier Acquisitions authority and procedures designed to dramatically speed up the adaptation of commercial technologies for defense use. The IVAS program is a case study in this innovation.Nonetheless, we see added opportunity for the Pentagon to take full advantage of the tools this Committee has given it. There are still days when parts of the Pentagon find comfort in the rigidity of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) over the speed and flexibility of these newer tools. Even when new procurement channels are used, the process is sometimes managed in ways that resemble the more restrictive and slower processes the new channels were designed to replace. The future mission-critical capabilities needed for battlefield superiority will require that those responsible for requirements, acquisition, and technology deployment all work together faster, more closely, and seamlessly - and in conjunction with private sector innovators.* Create an Innovation Infrastructure. A recent report by the Center for a New American Security17 found that the Pentagon lacks a robust digital infrastructure to support modern warfighting. Building this infrastructure will require additional investments in cloud computing, data labeling and storage, and the human capital needed to fully utilize and manage these tools.The 2018 DoD cloud strategy18 noted that "the DoD information environment is made up of multiple disjointed and stove-piped systems distributed across modern and legacy infrastructure around the globe." A more unified general purpose cloud environment is a key prerequisite for breaking down these barriers and speeding up the adoption and development of transformative technologies.* Review and reform the government contract protest process. The government contract protest process needs to be reformed to strike a better balance between fairness and open competition, on the one hand, and the urgency of innovation on the other. The existing, outdated process often leads to uncertainty, extended delays, and protracted litigation, hindering the speed of innovation and often maintaining the status quo. When considering acquisition reforms, Congress should look at ways to modernize, streamline, and accelerate protest actions. These should include time limits, not only on the filing of protests but on case resolution and corrective actions. Concluding bid protests more quickly will help provide our warfighters the technology they need when they need it.5. Continue to strengthen the defense of the nation's digital infrastructure.For two centuries, technology has been changing the nature of what is needed to defend a nation. The first two years of the 1940s illustrate this well. In early 1940, the tank rendered worthless two decades of French investment in the Maginot Line, as it was suddenly possible for an Army to go around it. And in late 1941, the United States learned that advances in naval aviation meant that battleships could no longer defend Pearl Harbor. If not defended against effectively, foreign cyberweapons pose a similar threat of comparable severity in our current day.Nature's recent impact in Texas demonstrates the potential devastation that would result if a foreign adversary used cyberweapons to take down a nation's electrical grid. Yet it has been apparent since 2014 that Russian agencies have been targeting the U.S. electrical grid.19 And in 2017 the citizens of Ukraine experienced an even broader cyberattack that was launched by disrupting the software supply chain, in that case through malware implanted in an update for local accounting software. As one author has noted, "in the cyber world, what happens in Kiev almost never stays in Kiev."20 The recent malware attack on SolarWinds demonstrates the truth of at least part of this proposition.These issues also reach our democratic infrastructure, connecting national needs that are as old as our Republic with the most modern technology of the 21st century. As George Washington recognized in his Farewell Address, democratic societies depend on a unique combination of free expression and social cohesion that must be protected from foreign interference.21 Yet recent years have seen Russian successes in turning American social media into a Weapon of Mass Confusion, illustrated by the 2016 success of the Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg in organizing a synchronized protest and counterprotest in Houston.22 The nation's digital defenses today must include stronger measures to protect against disinformation campaigns, the misuse of personal information, and the voting process itself.The DoD and other parts of the U.S. government have made rapid progress in addressing many of these issues in recent years, but there remain several new and additional priorities that should be addressed, including:* Strengthen supply chain security for the private and public sectors for both software and hardware.The public sector at all levels of government should strengthen the protection of their software, including through secure development practices, better software maintenance and vulnerability management, and integrity controls that apply throughout the software development, testing, and delivery processes. The implementation of this year's National Defense Authorization Act provides an opportunity to develop new software acquisition security requirements that may be appropriate across federal agencies.* Broaden use of cybersecurity best practices, including through improved cyber hygiene and a commitment to IT modernization. The public sector in the United States needs to continue to modernize its technology base, in part through cloud migration that can better ensure ongoing state-of-the-art software code and improved threat detection. This should be coupled with the broader adoption of strong security practices such as the establishment of a Zero Trust environment, assessments of the security of cloud providers, and the re-orientation of risk management activities to complement third party services and security automation.* Develop a national strategy to strengthen the sharing of threat intelligence across the entire security community, including through a clear, consistent disclosure obligation on the private sector. Much as radar advances proved indispensable in helping to defend against air attacks in World War II, modern threat intelligence can help defend against cyberattacks today. But only if threat intelligence is shared quickly and effectively. There is a critical need to improve the sharing of threat intelligence across the federal government, with key American allies, and in an appropriate but collaborative way with tech companies that often are cybersecurity first responders. This also requires consideration of new measures to ensure that attacks on private enterprises are reported in an appropriate way to a federal agency, consistent with the protection of personal privacy.6. Pursue a strong and renewed commitment to technology collaboration with our allies.The United States cannot secure its digital defenses by acting alone. One of the country's greatest strategic advantages is its global network of allies and partners. In part this is because of the global nature of technology innovation and markets. Microsoft's quantum computing efforts illustrate this well, with cutting-edge labs in Indiana, California, and Washington, as well as in Denmark, the Netherlands, and Australia.Moreover, as noted above, one of the key drivers of successful development and deployment of technology is scale. The larger the potential market for U.S. technologies, the larger the pool of private and human capital that will be dedicated to the research and development efforts needed to maintain America's competitive edge. Scale plays a major role in AI development, in particular. AI runs on data.That means that China, with a population of 1.4 billion, has a comparative advantage when it comes to mustering sheer quantities of personal data. But the combined populations of the United States, our NATO and Five Eyes allies, Japan, and Korea, total over 1.1 billion. If Mexico, India, and Brazil are added, the combined population of this potential coalition of democracies would be close to 2.9 billion.The United States should work with its global network of alliances and partners to:* Invest in and build coalitions with like-minded partners to develop, adapt, and deploy new technologies. In part this should include selected basic research programs, like those discussed above, to bring together NATO members, the Five Eyes, and other democratic allies. It should also include efforts to align our technology trade policies and laws, as discussed above, with those of our allies.* Address privacy issues that undermine trust across the Atlantic. There is a pressing need to address a short list of high priority privacy concerns, starting with improvements to the U.S.-E.U. Privacy Shield. These efforts should build a foundation for more durable global solutions to address issues around government access to data and should include international agreements under the CLOUD Act with the European Union and other American allies.* Pursue an ambitious digital and technology trade agenda. The United States should build on the landmark digital trade rules in USMCA by upgrading other free trade agreements to include rules on data localization, cross-border data flows, and forced disclosure of proprietary source code and algorithms. At the same time, the country should continue to push for high-standard outcomes in the ongoing WTO digital trade negotiations. It should also explore the possibility of an even more ambitious plurilateral digital trade pact with like-minded countries and seek cooperation on standards for a range of emerging technologies.* Advance strong norms for global cybersecurity protection. The United States should embrace international standards such as the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace, already endorsed by more than 75 governments and more than 1,000 other signatories. It should similarly advance norms for the cybersecurity protection of software supply chains in the United Nations and elsewhere.7. Lead with moral authority and not the strength of technology alone.Finally, while the United States will remain a preeminent economic power for the foreseeable future, we must recognize that the nation no longer retains one of the strategic advantages it enjoyed for much of the 20th century, namely an economy that was orders of magnitude larger than its principal rivals. In addition, the country must grapple with one of the biggest challenges confronting the nation's defense - the need to preserve bipartisan and broad support for our national security policy in an era defined by a polarized public and a divided world.Yet the country retains an enormous strength and strategic advantage. When the United States stands firmly for its historic democratic principles and the protection of human rights, it speaks and acts with a moral authority that none of its adversaries can match. There are few institutions that reflect and embody this strong ethical tradition better than the United States military. It is an asset that provides a strong cornerstone for future national and global leadership, and the country needs to nurture and build on it further.As Microsoft and so many other tech companies experience every day, a new generation of Americans asks not only what will make their country strong but their society great. It is the type of question that should inspire us to be bold in our ambitions. As we've found, it is critical to talk with our employees about the American military's strong ethical traditions. When we do this and share our commitment as a company to provide the U.S. military with the best technology we create and simultaneously use our voice to advance ethics for AI, almost uniformly our employees do not object. They applaud. Literally. It is this type of appreciation that enables a company like Microsoft to recruit top tech talent internally and externally for an "all-volunteer" and "all-star" team for a project like IVAS. This type of understanding also helps to strengthen America's technology leadership through the active engagement and support of this country's technology talent, as well as people who are not American by birth or citizenship.Continued leadership in technology will require that we meet the ongoing challenge to make sure American democratic principles and values are an integral part of developing and deploying the next generation of technology. This should include the following:* Continue to strengthen ethical practices and policies for DoD's use of AI and other new technologies.DoD's adoption last year of ethical principles to govern the use of AI not only represented a critical step forward for the United States but also defined an ethical role model for the world. Building on the recommendations of the Defense Innovation Board, these principles sent a powerful message by stating that military personnel "will exercise appropriate levels of judgment and care, while remaining responsible for the development, deployment, and use of AI capabilities."23 The DoD principles also addressed the importance of reliability, safety, transparency, and bias. The Joint Artificial Intelligence Center is already taking steps to implement these practices broadly. The NSCAI similarly has offered additional and important ideas to implement ethical AI principles throughout DoD and other agencies.The U.S. government should continue this work and discuss it broadly with the American public.* DoD should encourage the adoption of similar ethical principles and practices by its allies. The United States should exercise its moral authority by encouraging NATO and other allied nations to adopt similar ethical principles for their own militaries' use of artificial intelligence. The AI Partnership for Defense (AI PfD) announced last year between the United States and twelve allied nations can serve as a forum for these discussions. The government similarly should advance human rights norms and safeguards for new technologies, including the use of facial recognition and government access to personal information.* DoD should integrate environmental sustainability concerns into its policies and practices. Finally, climate and energy issues are having and will continue to have major consequences on our national security. DoD has significant opportunities to substantially enhance resilience, reduce carbon emissions, and catalyze innovation though its own operations and supply chain. Many of these opportunities are enabled by digital transformation. Cloud computing tools not only can lead to significant operational energy and carbon efficiency gains, but also provide key information for security landscape assessments in countries around the world.The challenges described above are formidable. But with concerted effort, appropriate investment, and strong leadership from members of this Committee and others, the United States can maintain its competitive edge in technology and secure the nation's defenses. I look forward to your questions and welcome the opportunity to discuss how Microsoft and other technology companies can assist in these efforts.Thank you.* * *Footnotes:1 Macy Bayern, "IDC: Top 10 Worldwide IT Predictions for 2020," TechRepublic, October 29, 2019, https://www.techrepublic.com/article/idc-top-10-worldwide-it-predictions-for-2020/.2 Satya Nadella, "The Necessity of Tech Intensity in Today's Digital World," LinkedIn, January 18, 2019, https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/necessity-tech-intensity-todays-digital-world-satya-nadella/; see also Dr. Tianyi (TJ) Jiang, "#TechIntensity Explained: 4 Ways It Shifts Business Strategy Forever," AvePoint Blog, October 10, 2018, https://www.avepoint.com/blog/office-365/tech-intensityexplained/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CTech%20intensity%E2%80%9D%20is%20a%20phrase%20coined%20by%20Microsoft,its%20ability%20to%20build%20its%20own%20digital%20capability.3 International Data Corporation, "IDC FutureScape Outlines the Impact 'Digital Supremacy' Will Have on Enterprise Transformation and the IT Industry," October 29, 2019, https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS45613519.4 Wayne Urban, More than Science and Sputnik: The National Defense Education Act of 1958 (Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 2010); Yanek Mieczowski, Eisenhower's Sputnik Moment: The Race for Space and World Prestige (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2013).5 Dana Adrienne Ponte, The First Line of Defense: Higher Education in Wartime and the Development of National Defense Education, 1939-1959 (Seattle: University of Washington Unpublished PhD Dissertation, 2016), 89.6 National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, Draft Final Report, January, 2021, 82, https://www.nscai.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/NSCAI-Draft-Final-Report-1.19.21.pdf.7 College Board, "AP Program Participation and Performance Data 2020," https://securemedia.collegeboard.org/digitalServices/pdf/research/2020/Program-Summary-Report-2020.pdf.8 National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, Draft Final Report, 82-86.9 Congressional Research Service, The Global Research and Development Landscape and Implications for the Department of Defense, November 8, 2018, https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R45403.10 Paul Scharre and Ainikki Rikkonen, Defense Technology Strategy, Center for a New American Security, Nov. 2020, CNAS - Defense Technology Strategy (s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com)11 NSCAI Draft Final Report, 90.12 Brad Smith, "Microsoft Launches Initiative To Help 25 Million People Worldwide Acquire the Digital Skills Needed in a COVID-19 Economy," Microsoft on the Issues (blog), June 30, 2020, https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/06/30/microsoft-launches-initiative-to-help-25-million-people-worldwideacquirethe-digital-skills-needed-in-a-covid-19-economy/.13 Microsoft Corporation, "Microsoft Software and Services AcaCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7393698 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: February 24, 2021End of Document

H&M and Nike are facing a boycott in China over Xinjiang cotton statementsCNN WireMarch 25, 2021 Thursday 9:32 AM GMTCopyright 2021 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1050 wordsByline: By Ben Westcott and Laura He, CNN BusinessDateline: (CNN) Body             H&M, Nike and other big Western apparel brands are facing a boycott in China because of the stand they've taken against the alleged use of forced labor to produce cotton in the country's western region of Xinjiang.H&M and Nike said months ago they were concerned about allegations forced labor has been used to produce cotton in Xinjiang, but they've now been caught in an escalating firestorm that has erupted on Chinese social media this week.Swedish multinational H&M, the world's second-largest clothing retailer, has been pulled from major e-commerce stores in China and blocked by several major navigation, review and rating apps. Videos are circulating on social media that a shopping mall in Chengdu, Sichuan province has removed H&M's advertising sign outside the mall.Nike and Adidas, among other brands, have also faced heavy criticism. Communist Party mouthpiece People's Daily on Thursday named the two firms along with Burberry, New Balance, and other members of the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI) that have expressed concerns about cotton produced in Xinjiang. The paper then called for broad boycotts of the brands.Dozens of Chinese celebrities have terminated contracts or said they would cut ties with these brands, including Nike, Adidas, Puma, Converse, Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, and Uniqlo - a move lauded by state media. And Honor of Kings, Tencent's smash-hit video game, is ending a partnership with Burberry and removingitstartan design from characters' outfits.Nike shares tumbled more than 3% Thursday on Wall Street, while Adidas sank more than 6%. In London, Burberry lost more than 4%. H&M stock also slid nearly 2% in Sweden.The outrage comes after a group linked to the ruling Communist Party posted a statement from H&M about Xinjiang on Chinese social media site Weibo. In the statement, released in September, H&M said it was "deeply concerned" over reports of forced labor in the production of cotton in Xinjiang.Human rights groups have repeatedly accused Beijing of detaining Uyghurs and other Muslim minority groups in the region in "re-education" camps and using them as forced labor, which they claim is part of global tech and retail supply chains, either directly or indirectly.Recent sanctions from the United States and other Western countries over Xinjiang have sparked a renewed pushback from the Chinese government, which calls the camps "vocational training centers" designed to combat poverty and religious extremism.In a viral social media post about H&M, China's Communist Youth League denounced the company's stance."Spreading rumors to boycott Xinjiang cotton, while trying to make a profit in China? Wishful thinking!" the post said.H&M faced a barrage of criticism from Chinese social media users, while Weibo posts containing the hashtag "I support Xinjiang cotton" racked up more than 4 billion views. "H&M clothes are rags," one of the most-liked Weibo comments said. "They don't deserve our Xinjiang cotton!"Chinese e-commerce giants Alibaba and JD.com even removed all H&M products from sale following the backlash.People's Daily voiced its outrage at H&M, saying on its official Weibo account: "China's Xinjiang cotton is white and flawless." State broadcaster CCTV accused foreign brands of "earning big profits in China but attacking the country with lies at the same time."Actor Huang Xuan and actress Song Qian, brand ambassadors for H&M since last year, said separately they would no longer work with the company.In a statement posted Wednesday on Weibo, H&M said it has always maintained high standards and transparency in its global supply chain."[This] does not represent any political position ... H&M Group always respects Chinese consumers. We are committed to long-term investment and development in China," the statement said. The company added it was working with "more than 350 manufacturers" in China. H&M declined a request from CNN Business for additional comment.Within hours, the criticism had spread to Nike. The company had said nearly a year ago it was "concerned about reports of forced labor in, and connected to, Xinjiang.""Nike does not source products from [Xinjiang] and we have confirmed with our contract suppliers that they are not using textiles or spun yarn from the region," the statement said.Soon after the Nike statement began circulating on Weibo this week, Chinese singer and actor Wang Yibo said he had cut ties with the US company and "firmly opposes any remarks and actions that smear China." Nike did not respond to a request from CNN Business for comment.Over the past year, a number of Western companies have said they will examine their global supply chains to ensure they are free from Xinjiang cotton products after allegations of forced labor involving the region's Muslim Uyghur people.In December, the US government said it would block all imports of cotton from Xinjiang over concerns they "may have been made by slave labor in some of the most egregious human rights violations existing today."In the past week, the US, UK and European Union have all put in place new sanctions on Chinese officials  over their role in alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang. Bejing countered with its own measures, saying its Western critics were "maliciously spreading lies."Meanwhile, as the social media backlash now spreads to other major Western brands, some companies in China have begun to prominently advertise their use of cotton made in Xinjiang. Chinese brand Anta Sports said in a statement it would continue to use cotton from Xinjiang, while Japanese retailer Muji began to advertise products made with "Xinjiang cotton."FILA China, which Anta Sports acquired from Italian brand FILA in 2009, also announced late Thursday it has been using cotton produced in China, including Xinjiang, and had started the procedure to withdraw from BCI.Some Chinese web users even praised California-based footwear brand Skechers for a recent statement on Uyghur workers, which said its internal audits found no evidence its Chinese supplier had used "forced labor."-- CNN's Beijing bureau and Hanna Ziady contributed to this article.                       By Ben Westcott and Laura He, CNN Business         TM & © 2021 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Total organic chemistry revenue growth, a key performance indicator for the company, increased 5% over the fourth quarter of 2019. Organic chemistry revenue growth reflects chemistry revenue growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation ("FX") and palladium pass-through ("palladium").Management CommentaryGeoff Wild, Atotech's Chief Executive Officer said, "We are very pleased with our fourth quarter performance. We leveraged the continued strength of our Electronics end-markets, as well as the ongoing recovery in global automotive markets, to deliver strong organic growth. In particular, demand for our comprehensive solutions addressing the technical requirements related to the 5G smartphone replacement cycle, including next-generation semiconductor packaging, was robust. Other areas of strength include 5G infrastructure, automotive electrification, and growing demand for sustainable solutions in surface-finishing applications.""These secular trends not only provided a constructive backdrop in the fourth quarter, but also present a multi-year opportunity to grow our business, expand share, and deliver strong returns to our shareholders.""Throughout 2020, we continued to invest in our business and made decisions in the long-term best interests of our customers, while carefully managing costs.""We completed a new chemistry manufacturing facility in China, invested in multiple digitalization initiatives, including IoT solutions, and maintained our highly trained customer-facing workforce. As we enter this high-growth period in our industry, we believe these decisions have positioned Atotech to take advantage of the many market opportunities in front of us."Fourth Quarter 2020 ResultsReported total revenue was $365 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of 18% over the prior year period. Organic revenue for both chemistry and equipment, which reflects total revenue excluding the impact of FX and palladium, increased 9%. FX was a 4% tailwind and palladium increased total revenue by 5% in the quarter. These strong quarterly results were driven by organic chemistry revenue growth of 5%, reflecting increases in both the Electronics ("EL") and General Metal Finishing ("GMF") segments.Adjusted EBITDA was $106 million for the fourth quarter, a 5% increase over the prior year period, reflecting strong organic chemistry volume growth, stable pricing, and the benefits of cost containment actions, partially offset by compensation accruals taken in the fourth quarter.Adjusted EBITDA margin was 29.1% in the fourth quarter of 2020, which reflects the impact of palladium pass-through, the product mix of chemistry versus equipment, as well as the impact of compensation accruals. Excluding these items, adjusted EBITDA margin was largely in-line with the fourth quarter of 2019.Strong cash flow generation enabled the company to repay $80 million of its outstanding Holdco notes in the fourth quarter of 2020 and thereby reduce its net leverage to 5.1x full year adjusted EBITDA at year end, and before the proceeds from the company's IPO, which closed in early February. Pro forma for the application of proceeds from the company's IPO, net leverage is 3.9x full year adjusted EBITDA at year end.Fourth Quarter 2020 Segment HighlightsElectronics: Revenue for the fourth quarter in our Electronics segment of $232 million increased 25% over the prior year period. Total organic Electronics revenue increased 14%, consisting of 7% organic chemistry growth and a 56% increase in organic equipment revenue. Palladium and FX were each a 5% tailwind in the quarter.The organic Electronics revenue increase was driven by strong demand for the company's leading IC substrates and advanced semiconductor packaging solutions. This demand is being driven by secular trends in 5G infrastructure and smartphone growth, as well as growth in leading-edge consumer electronics, including wearables. These trends are also driving strong demand for our equipment, as our customers actively upgrade to next-generation packaging standards and increase production capacity.Adjusted EBITDA for our Electronics segment was $70 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 9% over the prior year period, primarily reflecting strong chemistry volume growth.General Metal Finishing: Revenue for the fourth quarter in our GMF segment of $133 million increased 7% over the prior year period. Total organic GMF revenue increased 2%, consisting of 3% organic chemistry revenue growth, partially offset by a decline in organic equipment revenue. Palladium and FX added 3% and 2% to revenue in the quarter, respectively.Organic chemistry revenue growth was primarily driven by the continued global automotive market recovery and solid demand in other industrial end-markets.Adjusted EBITDA for our GMF segment was $36 million, essentially flat with last year.Initial Public OfferingSubsequent to year end 2020, the company closed its initial public offering of 29,268,000 shares of common stock at $17.00 per share on February 8, 2021. The gross proceeds to Atotech from the offering were approximately $498 million, before deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses, and were used to further repay indebtedness and to pay underwriting discounts and offering expenses.Full Year 2021 GuidanceRegarding the company's 2021 outlook, Peter Frauenknecht, Atotech's Chief Financial Officer said, "We expect full year 2021 total organic revenue growth to be in the range of 10% to 12%, including full year organic chemistry revenue growth in the range of 8% to 9%, which excludes the impact of FX and palladium pass-through. This strong outlook is driven by constructive end-markets in both our Electronics and GMF segments. We expect to leverage this organic growth and deliver full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA in the range of $405 million to $425 million, which represents an increase of 14% over 2020, at the mid-point."Conference CallThe company will host a conference call today at 8:00 a.m. Eastern time to discuss these results.

Total organic chemistry revenue growth, a key performance indicator for the company, increased 5% over the fourth quarter of 2019. Organic chemistry revenue growth reflects chemistry revenue growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation ("FX") and palladium pass-through ("palladium").Management CommentaryGeoff Wild, Atotech's Chief Executive Officer said, "We are very pleased with our fourth quarter performance. We leveraged the continued strength of our Electronics end-markets, as well as the ongoing recovery in global automotive markets, to deliver strong organic growth. In particular, demand for our comprehensive solutions addressing the technical requirements related to the 5G smartphone replacement cycle, including next-generation semiconductor packaging, was robust. Other areas of strength include 5G infrastructure, automotive electrification, and growing demand for sustainable solutions in surface-finishing applications.""These secular trends not only provided a constructive backdrop in the fourth quarter, but also present a multi-year opportunity to grow our business, expand share, and deliver strong returns to our shareholders.""Throughout 2020, we continued to invest in our business and made decisions in the long-term best interests of our customers, while carefully managing costs.""We completed a new chemistry manufacturing facility in China, invested in multiple digitalization initiatives, including IoT solutions, and maintained our highly trained customer-facing workforce. As we enter this high-growth period in our industry, we believe these decisions have positioned Atotech to take advantage of the many market opportunities in front of us."Fourth Quarter 2020 ResultsReported total revenue was $365 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of 18% over the prior year period. Organic revenue for both chemistry and equipment, which reflects total revenue excluding the impact of FX and palladium, increased 9%. FX was a 4% tailwind and palladium increased total revenue by 5% in the quarter. These strong quarterly results were driven by organic chemistry revenue growth of 5%, reflecting increases in both the Electronics ("EL") and General Metal Finishing ("GMF") segments.Adjusted EBITDA was $106 million for the fourth quarter, a 5% increase over the prior year period, reflecting strong organic chemistry volume growth, stable pricing, and the benefits of cost containment actions, partially offset by compensation accruals taken in the fourth quarter.Adjusted EBITDA margin was 29.1% in the fourth quarter of 2020, which reflects the impact of palladium pass-through, the product mix of chemistry versus equipment, as well as the impact of compensation accruals. Excluding these items, adjusted EBITDA margin was largely in-line with the fourth quarter of 2019.Strong cash flow generation enabled the company to repay $80 million of its outstanding Holdco notes in the fourth quarter of 2020 and thereby reduce its net leverage to 5.1x full year adjusted EBITDA at year end, and before the proceeds from the company's IPO, which closed in early February. Pro forma for the application of proceeds from the company's IPO, net leverage is 3.9x full year adjusted EBITDA at year end.Fourth Quarter 2020 Segment HighlightsElectronics: Revenue for the fourth quarter in our Electronics segment of $232 million increased 25% over the prior year period. Total organic Electronics revenue increased 14%, consisting of 7% organic chemistry growth and a 56% increase in organic equipment revenue. Palladium and FX were each a 5% tailwind in the quarter.The organic Electronics revenue increase was driven by strong demand for the company's leading IC substrates and advanced semiconductor packaging solutions. This demand is being driven by secular trends in 5G infrastructure and smartphone growth, as well as growth in leading-edge consumer electronics, including wearables. These trends are also driving strong demand for our equipment, as our customers actively upgrade to next-generation packaging standards and increase production capacity.Adjusted EBITDA for our Electronics segment was $70 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 9% over the prior year period, primarily reflecting strong chemistry volume growth.General Metal Finishing: Revenue for the fourth quarter in our GMF segment of $133 million increased 7% over the prior year period. Total organic GMF revenue increased 2%, consisting of 3% organic chemistry revenue growth, partially offset by a decline in organic equipment revenue. Palladium and FX added 3% and 2% to revenue in the quarter, respectively.Organic chemistry revenue growth was primarily driven by the continued global automotive market recovery and solid demand in other industrial end-markets.Adjusted EBITDA for our GMF segment was $36 million, essentially flat with last year.Initial Public OfferingSubsequent to year end 2020, the company closed its initial public offering of 29,268,000 shares of common stock at $17.00 per share on February 8, 2021. The gross proceeds to Atotech from the offering were approximately $498 million, before deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses, and were used to further repay indebtedness and to pay underwriting discounts and offering expenses.Full Year 2021 GuidanceRegarding the company's 2021 outlook, Peter Frauenknecht, Atotech's Chief Financial Officer said, "We expect full year 2021 total organic revenue growth to be in the range of 10% to 12%, including full year organic chemistry revenue growth in the range of 8% to 9%, which excludes the impact of FX and palladium pass-through. This strong outlook is driven by constructive end-markets in both our Electronics and GMF segments. We expect to leverage this organic growth and deliver full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA in the range of $405 million to $425 million, which represents an increase of 14% over 2020, at the mid-point."Conference CallThe company will host a conference call today at 8:00 a.m. Eastern time to discuss these results.

However, our use of these non-IFRS financial measures may vary from that of others in our industry. Our non-IFRS metrics have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as alternatives to consolidated net income (loss) or other performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS as measures of operating performance, operating cash flows or liquidity. The Company believes that these measures are important and supplement discussions and analysis of its results of operations and enhances an understanding of its operating performance. See the Appendix for a reconciliation of the non-IFRS financial measures.About AtotechAtotech is a leading specialty chemicals technology company and a market leader in advanced electroplating solutions.

A reconciliation for adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable IFRS financial measure is provided in the Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Consolidated Net Income (Loss) table. We are not able to forecast Consolidated net income (loss) on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable efforts due to the high variability and difficulty in predicting certain items that affect Consolidated net income (loss), including, but not limited to, Income taxes, Interest expense, net, and Foreign exchange income (loss). Contacts:  Paul Goldberg +1 803 504 4731 paul.goldberg@atotech.com  Susanne Richter +49 30 349 85 418 press@atotech.comLoad-Date: March 4, 2021End of Document| About LexisNexis | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions | Copyright © 2021 LexisNexis Page 35 of 438Human Rights Watch: Submission to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women on China  Page 47 of 438Coalition for a Prosperous America Issues White Paper Entitled 'Reclaiming the U.S. Solar Supply Chain From China'  Page 50 of 438A HUMAN RIGHTS APPROACH TO US-CHINA POLICY  Page 54 of 438CAN CHINA BECOME THE AI SUPERPOWER?  Page 59 of 438Chief Of World-Renowned Medical Journal Has Repeatedly Bashed US, Praised China For Coronavirus Response  Page 63 of 438Center For Strategic & International Studies Issues Public Comment on Department of Commerce Rule  Page 65 of 438More than 92 million young adults in China live alone and have no intention of changing that.
