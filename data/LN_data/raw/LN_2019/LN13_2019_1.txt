Senate Commerce Committee Issues Testimony From U.S.-China Economic &#38; Security Review CommissionTargeted News ServiceFebruary 6, 2019 Wednesday 7:50 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 5589 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee issued the following testimony by Michael Wessel, commissioner on the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, at a hearing entitled "Winning the Race to 5G and the Next Era of Technology Innovation in the United States":"Chairman Wicker, Ranking Member Cantwell, Members of the Committee. I want to thank you for the invitation to appear before you today to discuss the development and deployment of fifth generation--5G--cellular mobile communications. This is a critical issue for U.S. economic and national security interests."My name is Michael Wessel and I am appearing before you today as a Commissioner on the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (Commission), where I have served since its creation in 2001. But, as a disclaimer, I am speaking for myself, although my comments are informed by my service on the Commission and our work on this issue."The Commission was created by Congress in 2001 in conjunction with the debate about the grant of Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) to China, paving the way for its accession to the World Trade Organization. The Commission was tasked with monitoring, investigating and submitting to Congress an annual report on the national security implications of the bilateral trade and economic relationship between the United States and the People's Republic of China, and to provide recommendations, where appropriate, to Congress for legislative and administrative action."The grant of PNTR ended the annual debate about whether to extend most favored nation status to China. But as it passed PNTR, Congress created the Commission because it did not want to forego the annual review of our relationship with China. Since the creation of the Commission, our mandate has been extended and altered as the U.S.-China relationship evolved."The Commission is a somewhat unique body: We report to and support Congress. Each of the four Congressional leaders appoint 3 members to the Commission for 2-year terms. In 8 of the last 11 years, we have issued unanimous reports. In the 3 years where it was not unanimous, there was only one dissenting vote. In many ways, the evolving challenges and opportunities posed by the relationship with China have united us in our analysis."Last year the Commission held a hearing on Next Generation Connectivity looking at both 5th generation (5G) connectivity and the Internet of Things (IoT) and included a chapter in our annual report on these issues. The prepared testimony and transcript of our hearing, as well as our Annual Report, are available online at the Commission's website www.uscc.gov."The Commission has been tracking and analyzing China's high-tech development--and its impacts on the United States--for many years and found remarkable continuity and coordination in Chinese government policy. Indeed, in the Commission's 2004 report, the key findings with regard to high technology were:* The Chinese government has a coordinated, sustainable vision for science and technology development. Many Chinese high-technology developments have been spurred by policies the Chinese government has instituted to accelerate the growth of industries in this sector, which the government believes can help lift the whole economy.* The Chinese government uses foreign investment, tax policies, subsidies, technology standards, and industry regulation to accelerate the nation's technological growth. It uses government procurement and proprietary technology standards to advance its technology growth policies. These policies make it difficult, if not impossible, to achieve a level playing field in this area of U.S.- China trade.* Global production networks dominate China's high-tech export environment. Foreign investment into China has provided capital, management, and technology to Chinese production in various technology sectors. Taiwan firms are key investors and intermediaries in China's high-tech production networks.* U.S. trade and investment with China has played, and continues to play, a key role in China's technological advancement. U.S. advanced technology and technological expertise is transferred to China, through both legal and illegal means, via U.S. invested firms and research centers in China, Chinese investments in the United States, bilateral science and technology (S&#38;T) cooperative programs, and the tens of thousands of Chinese students and researchers at U.S. universities and research institutes who return to China after completing these programs.* Large-scale piracy--at levels of over ninety percent--continues to characterize intellectual property rights (IPR) protection in China and is a major concern for U.S. exporters of high-tech goods and services. While the government has instituted laws to strengthen IPR protection, the enforcement of those laws has suffered from a lack of government coordination and from local protectionism and corruption."In our report the following year, the Commission noted 3G--a precursor to the technology which is the subject of today's hearing--was identified by China's government as a key interest:* China has its own globally approved 3G standard, TD-SCDMA for use in mobile telecommunications. It was developed by the Chinese Academy of Technology and Siemens and is supported by the Chinese companies Huawei and Lenovo. China is developing 4G mobile technology."China's government pursues an aggressive development path to become a high technology leader but its approach emphasizes Chinese technologies, and the companies that develop them, as the core of any future standards. China's approach is the result of long-term planning, policy implementation and funding. In other words, government direction--supported by policy, politics, and generous subsidies--is driving China's tech development."We should not assume that China will adopt "Western ideals" or business practices and take China's government at their word when they promise "reform" or a version of that. We need to determine what our interests are and assess them against what China has actually done over the years and what it says it wants to do."I will leave it to my industry colleagues to discuss the technical issues relating to 5G and some of the implications. But, China has a well-defined and advanced approach to becoming a world-class player in this technology. China is poised to have a significant share of the global market in this and many other technologies."China is now a leading technology power. In 2017, the U.S. ran a trade deficit in Advanced Technology Products (ATP) of $135.4 billion,1 and our deficit for 2018 is expected to beat that when the full year trade statistics are released. For the narrower category of information and communications products, for October 2018 year-to-date figures (the latest available), the U.S. exported $3.365 billion and imported $130.303 billion. China has produced the faster supercomputer on earth. It is advancing quantum computing with rapid gains in cryptography and communications. It is excelling in artificial intelligence (AI) and a variety of other sectors."Our failure to sell more in China is a direct result of their protectionist and predatory practices, including a goal, as identified in numerous policy documents, to develop indigenous capabilities to the exclusion of foreign players. As the Commission's 2018 Report indicated (summarized):* Chinese IP requirements: Since 2007, China's Multi-Level Protection Scheme, which covers around 140,000 information systems,2 requires Chinese IP in core IT technology and components and annual testing, certification, and authentication for the top three of the five tiers of IT users,3 effectively excluding foreign competitors unless there is no domestic equivalent.4 Article 34 of the draft guidelines would expand this scheme to cloud computing platforms, big data systems, industrial control systems and mobile networks, AI, and IoT devices.5* High restrictions on foreign ownership and investment: Under China's 2016 Telecommunications Regulations, foreign firms can own up to 50 percent of Chinese telecommunications and cloud computing providers.6 China's 2016 Telecom Services Catalogue requires foreign telecommunications and cloud computing firms wishing to sell in the Chinese market to form joint ventures with Chinese firms.7* China-specific technical standards: The Mercator Institute for China Studies (MERICS) found "China sometimes formulates national standards in strategic industries that deliberately differ from international standards in order to impede market access for foreign technology and to favor Chinese technology on the domestic market."8* Restrictions on data storage and transfer: Under China's Cybersecurity Law, U.S. firms face significant restrictions on data storage and cross-border transfers--essential services for IoT devices. U.S. firms such as IBM, Apple, and Microsoft are required to form joint ventures with Chinese partners in order to operate.9 In addition, foreign firms must rely on domestic partners and government-approved encryption technology, potentially placing foreign IP and data at risk.10"Huawei and ZTE, deemed "national champions" by the Chinese government, are global players in the communications field--from handsets to routers to switching to full network deployment and operations. And, as is well known, much of the production of telecom and IT products for leading firms is produced in China, or has components produced there."Of course, not everything is a zero-sum game. Should we be concerned about where the products and services supporting and utilized in our 5G networks are produced and which companies produce them? Should we have similar concerns about what other countries around the globe do in this regard?"Does that matter to us? I believe it does, in many ways."The lead front-page article in the New York Times Sunday edition two weeks ago was entitled "U.S. Scrambles to Outrun China in New Arms Race: Seeking to Restrict Beijing's Control Over 'Central Nervous System for Internet'".11 The stakes are, indeed, enormous."5G will be the backbone of tomorrow's economy and infrastructure, including critical infrastructure; our telecommunications, e-commerce, and manufacturing sectors, along with many military and intelligence assets, will all depend on it. Technologies as diverse as the IoT, autonomous vehicles, cellular communications, and battlefield communications, will be built on 5G foundations."The National Intelligence Council (NIC) released a report on the expected impact of 5G, finding it "will change the technological, social, and economic processes for a wide variety of industries by 2020."12 By 2035, the NIC report predicted, $12.3 trillion in global economic output will be enabled by 5G tech, and its value chain will create $3.5 trillion in output and support 22 million jobs by 2035."China's government clearly sees the future economic and security potential of 5G and is poised to invest at least $400 billion into its development. But that's only the tip of the iceberg. The communications and IT sectors are identified for preference and promotion as part of the Made in China 2025 industrial policy program, which means every province, local, and municipal government is marshalling its resources in response to the central government's directives."China is also actively promoting its technological interests through its involvement in international standards-setting organizations, which will write the rules for interoperability and operations. It's part of their official government and Chinese Communist Party plans. China's government has already announced that its principal domestic suppliers--Huawei and ZTE--with each being allocated one-third of the market, leaving foreign competitors to scramble for the remaining third.13"China has aggressively participated in standards-setting bodies such as the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) where they play a significant role, as well as chair several committees.14 For several years, they have sent large delegations to these meetings hoping to drive standards that will advantage their own indigenous firms. This is contrary to the approach taken by many countries and industry delegations at the ITU and other international standard bodies who are seeking, first, to develop the standard that will create the most robust technologies and then seek to identify the best suppliers to meet those standards."China is integrating its 5G plans with its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) strategy. The 2015 Belt and Road Initiative White Paper,15 which was jointly issued by China's National Development and Reform Commission, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Ministry of Commerce, calls for cross-border optical cables and communications trunk line networks, planning transcontinental submarine optical cable projects, and improving spatial and satellite information passageways to expand information exchanges and cooperation. The Chinese government is also actively seeking to loop its BRI partners into its "super-fast broadband network infrastructure" built in line with the Internet Plus plan.16"There is no comparable approach from our federal government. While a document leaked from the National Security Council identified the idea for the development and deployment of a federal 5G Internet, that approach appears to have been quickly abandoned based on industry opposition. Our country's current approach is market-led and market driven."The Administration and Congress have adopted a number of security-related limitations to advance our interests. Just this past summer, Congress, as part of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 adopted strict limitations on the procurement or renewal of contracts that include Huawei and ZTE equipment in government networks.17 In the past, a variety of other measures have been put in place to limit the exposure of critical information and networks to Chinese cyberespionage. For example, the FY 2013 Appropriations bill prohibited Commerce, Justice, NASA and the National Science Foundation from acquiring information technology systems that were produced, manufactured or assembled by entities owned, directed or subsidized by the Chinese government.18"Huawei, as one of China's leading firms in this area, has received substantial attention. Today's hearing, of course, is about 5G, but it would be impossible to discuss that technology, and concerns vis-a-vis China, without commenting on Huawei. But Huawei must not be the only focus of the discussion of China's impact on 5G here in the U.S. and around the globe as there are many other vulnerabilities that must be addressed. Documented problems, such as China Telecom's redirection of Internet traffic through China, have been identified.19"Huawei Technologies is the most well-known Chinese telecommunications equipment company with operations and activities in the U.S. and has been cited as an advanced persistent threat to U.S. interests. In 2012, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence identified strong concerns about Huawei and ZTE. The report concluded that "the risks associated with Huawei and ZTE's provision of equipment to U.S. critical infrastructure could undermine core US national-security interests."20"In early 2015, the FBI circulated a Counterintelligence Strategic Partnership Intelligence Note focused on national security risks associated with Huawei. That memo has been made public and included the following risk overview:"With the expanded use of Huawei Technologies Inc. equipment and services in U.S. telecommunications service provider networks, the Chinese Government's potential access to U.S. business communications is dramatically increasing. Chinese Government-supported telecommunications equipment on U.S. networks may be exploited through Chinese cyber activity, with China's intelligence services operating as an advanced persistent threat to U.S. networks. Huawei has been identified publicly for selling or attempting to sell U.S. intellectual property to export restricted countries (Iran/Cuba), making it a clear threat through its targeting of U.S. economic and proprietary information. China makes no secret that its cyber warfare strategy is predicated on controlling global communications network infrastructure.21"According to press accounts U.S. Tier 1 telecom providers were counseled by officials of the U.S. government that utilization of Huawei equipment could create significant cybersecurity concerns and might jeopardize contracts with the U.S. government. Subsequently, each company reportedly decided not to procure equipment from the company for utilization on their networks.22"In 2018, the heads of the CIA, FBI, NSA, DIA, NGA and the Director of National Intelligence publicly testified as to their concerns about utilizing products or services from Huawei. FBI Director Wray stated,"We're deeply concerned about the risks of allowing any company or entity that is beholden to foreign governments that don't share our values to gain positions of power inside our telecommunications networks....it provides the capacity to exert pressure or control over our telecommunications infrastructure. It provides the capacity to maliciously modify or steal information. And it provides the capacity to conduct undetected espionage.23"China's Huawei has been aggressive in trying to counter claims that it is a security risk. It claims that it is a private, employee-owned company and that we shouldn't worry. But, in recent months, a number of other countries--those who are part of the Five-Eyes relationship and others--have joined in questioning the security of Chinese-company produced equipment and whether it should be utilized in existing or future networks."As William R. Evanina, the director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center was quoted in the New York Times,"It's important to remember that Chinese company relationships with the Chinese government aren't like private sector company relationships with governments in the West...China's 2018 National Intelligence Law requires Chinese companies to support, provide assistance and cooperate in China's national intelligence work, wherever they operate.24"No Chinese commercial entity can refuse to cooperate with China's security services. In 2017, China's government implemented a draconian Cybersecurity Law--despite the outcry from foreign governments and industry that it would raise serious concerns about the impact on the business activities of Chinese companies. The accompanying set of laws--National Intelligence Law of 2017, Counter-Terrorism Law of 2016, National Security Law of 2015 all raise concerns about Chinese entities freedom to act without government interference, coercion and direction."Other countries have come to similar conclusions, based on their own assessments. For example, last July the United Kingdom's Huawei Oversight Board raised its concerns in a report to that country's national security advisor--despite 4 years of work with Huawei:""Due to areas of concern exposed through the proper functioning of the mitigation strategy and associated oversight mechanisms, the Oversight Board can provide only limited assurance that all risks to UK national security from Huawei's involvement in the UK's critical networks have been sufficiently mitigated. We are advising the National Security Adviser on this basis."25"I worry about China's approach, and its implications for us, for several reasons."First, I approach this as someone who has always taken pride in America's technological leadership and do not want to cede it to any other country, especially when that leadership results from state-directed policies and support."Second, I care about the production and jobs that will be created during the development, deployment and servicing of 5G networks. As the National Intelligence Council report indicated, $12.3 trillion in economic value will be created along with 22 million jobs. I want the bulk of that value and the jobs to advantage our economy and our people or at least know that the competition is being waged on a level-playing field."Third, and most fundamental, I worry about our nation's security--economic, critical infrastructure and "traditional" security interests. On the economic side, we have read too many stories about Chinese cyberespionage, some facilitated and allegedly directed by the state, to steal our intellectual property. The fruits of that cyberespionage is estimated to have cost us hundreds of billions of dollars while advancing China's economic development and strength."Financial networks, smart cities, power plants, dams, chemical production facilities, air traffic and so many other sectors are supported by the Internet and will be increasingly dependent on 5G with the dispersion of IoT devices. If Chinese companies provide the equipment, with control over the source code, the updates, and servicing, it creates extreme vulnerabilities."Equally important, our warfighters and our defense sector are increasingly dependent on the electronic spectrum for command and control, logistics and other needs. China's military doctrine relies on "asymmetric warfare" where they have identified the electronic and space domains as critical to their countering any U.S. capabilities in a potential conflict. Access to or control over significant parts of our telecommunications systems and the connectivity that will be an increasingly important component for our defense systems can create substantial and, potentially, unacceptable vulnerabilities."In its 2018 Annual Report, the Commission identified the following key findings, regarding this critical area:* The Chinese government has strengthened its strategic support for the IoT (physical devices embedded with sensors that can collect data and connect to each other and the broader internet) and fifth-generation wireless technology (5G) networks. The government has laid out comprehensive industrial plans to create globally competitive firms and reduce China's dependence on foreign technology through: significant state funding for domestic firms and 5G deployment, limited market access for foreign competitors, China-specific technical standards, increased participation in global standards bodies, localization targets, and alleged cyber espionage and intellectual property theft. This state-directed approach limits market opportunities for foreign firms in China and raises concerns about the ability of U.S. and other foreign firms to compete fairly both in China's domestic market and abroad.* 5G networks are expected to quicken data speeds by 100 times, support up to 100 times more IoT devices, and provide near-instant universal coverage and availability. U.S. and Chinese companies are engaged in a fierce competition to secure first mover advantage and benefit from the trillions in economic benefits 5G and subsequent technologies are expected to create.* IoT devices collect enormous amounts of user information; when aggregated and combined with greater computing power and massive amounts of publicly available information, these data can reveal information the user did not intend to share. U.S. data could be exposed through unsecure IoT devices, or when Chinese IoT products and services transfer U.S. customer data back to China, where the government retains expansive powers to access personal and corporate data.* The Chinese government is leveraging its comparative advantage in manufacturing and state-led industrial policies to secure an edge in the IoT's wide-ranging commercial and military applications. U.S. firms and the U.S. government rely on global supply chains that in many cases are dominated by China. While not all products designed, manufactured, or assembled in China are inherently risky, the U.S. government lacks essential tools to conduct rigorous supply chain risk assessments. Federal procurement laws and regulations are often contradictory and are inconsistently applied.* International 5G standards will be set by 2019, facilitating large-scale commercial deployment expected by 2020. The Chinese government is encouraging its companies to play a greater role in international 5G standards organizations to ensure they set global standards; such leadership may result in higher revenues and exports from internationally accepted intellectual property and technology and more global influence over future wireless technology and standards development.* China's central role in manufacturing global information technology, IoT devices, and network equipment may allow the Chinese government--which exerts strong influence over its firms--opportunities to force Chinese suppliers or manufacturers to modify products to perform below expectations or fail, facilitate state or corporate espionage, or otherwise compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of IoT devices or 5G network equipment. * The lax security protections and universal connectivity of IoT devices create numerous points of vulnerability that hackers or malicious state actors can exploit to hold U.S. critical infrastructure, businesses, and individuals at risk. These types of risks will grow as IoT devices become more complex, more numerous, and embedded within existing physical structures. The size, speed, and impact of malicious cyber attacks against and using IoT devices will intensify with the deployment of 5G."The Commission made two recommendations for Congress to consider:* Congress require the Office of Management and Budget's Federal Chief Information Security Officer Council to prepare an annual report to Congress to ensure supply chain vulnerabilities from China are adequately addressed. This report should collect and assess:* Each agency's plans for supply chain risk management and assessments;* Existing departmental procurement and security policies and guidance on cybersecurity, operations security, physical security, information security, and data security that may affect information and communications technology, 5G networks, and IoT devices; and* Areas where new policies and guidance may be needed--including for specific information and communications technology, 5G networks, and IoT devices, applications, or procedures--and where existing security policies and guidance can be updated to address supply chain, cyber, operations, physical, information, and data security vulnerabilities.* Congress direct the National Telecommunications and Information Administration and Federal Communications Commission to identify (1) steps to ensure the rapid and secure deployment of a 5G network, with a particular focus on the threat posed by equipment and services designed or manufactured in China; and (2) whether any new statutory authorities are required to ensure the security of domestic 5G networks."The impending rollout of 5G here in the U.S. and across the globe requires that we address these vulnerabilities quickly and aggressively. In my view it is better to err on the side of safety, as 5G will be the backbone of communications in the future. We cannot afford to ignore the actions and activities that China has engaged in with regard to predatory and protectionist policies, what their public pronouncements have identified are their plans and what actions they have engaged in in the cyber realm."We also have to be realistic about the global nature of production and what the limits are on our policies and actions. But, the price of inaction is unacceptable. We must protect our interests where we can and manage and mitigate the risks where we must."* * *Footnotes:1 Robert Scott and Zane Mokhiber, The China Toll Deepens, Economic Policy Institute, October 23, 2018, p. 31.2 The ranking is based on technology innovation, brand influence, ecosystem openness, and input from industry experts and end users.

Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, at a hearing entitled "Made in China 2025 and the Future of American Industry":"Good afternoon Chairman Rubio, Ranking Member Cardin and members of the Committee; thank you for inviting me to share the views of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) on the issue of unfair Chinese trade and technology policies and practices and what the federal government should do in response."The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation is a non-partisan think tank whose mission is to formulate and promote public policies to advance technological innovation and productivity internationally, in Washington, and in the states. Recognizing the vital role of technology in ensuring prosperity, ITIF focuses on innovation, productivity, and digital economy issues. ITF has long focused on the issue of not only how unfair foreign policies and practices, particularly Chinese, negatively impact the U.S. economy, but why and how the federal government should establish a robust national competitiveness and innovation policy. I very much appreciate the opportunity to comment on these issues today."In my testimony I first discuss the importance for a new framework for how to think about the economic challenge from China and the key points in this regard raised in the recent report from Chairman Rubio - "Made in China 2025 and the Future of American Industry". Second, I discuss the nature of China economic challenge from "Made in China, 2025." Finally, discuss components for more robust trade, innovation and competitiveness strategies, including components to help small businesses.The Importance of a New Doctrine for Responding to the Economic Challenge From China"Before discussing some of the major issues vis-a-vis China's "Made in China, 2025" program, I would like to first comment on a number of major points made in Chairman Rubio's report. The report makes a number of critical points that are all too often ignored or misunderstand. The development of widespread clarity and agreement on these points is the single most important task facing the Washington economic and trade policy making community today."First, the report highlights the need for a wake-up call when it comes to understanding the nature and extent of the economic threat from China. Until recently, the Washington trade and economic policy establishment largely turned a blind eye to the China challenge, perversely arguing either that China's unfair trade and economic practices helped the U.S. economy by keeping prices low or that the effects were inconsequential.1 Even after China has gained global market share in a number of extremely complex, advanced technology industries like jet aircraft, high-speed rail, solar panels, personal computers, supercomputers, telecommunications equipment, and internet services, many still dismiss China's capabilities and assume China will be incapable of even partial success meeting their aggressive MIC25 goals. While mastery of some particularly complex technologies like semiconductor logic circuits remains a challenge for China, Chinese companies have made significant progress in an array of other technologies, including in some kinds of semiconductors (e.g., chips for internet-of-things devices). Moreover, the fact that nations like Japan in the 1960s and 70s and Taiwan and South Korea in the 1980s and 90s could rapidly progress to become advanced technology economies suggests that there is nothing inherently keeping a nation like China from making similar progress, especially given the massive amount of government support for the effort.2"Second, the report rightly notes that globalization can be harmful not just to some U.S. workers, but to the U.S. economy overall if it is based on unfair, predatory trade practices. Yet, the Washington trade and economics community persists in advancing a narrative that while trade may hurt some workers, regions, firms or industries, overall it is a net positive for the U.S. economy as a whole. Many even argue that one-sided free trade, where America obeys the rules and our competitors do not, is still welfare maximizing. This is wrong. To be sure, two-sided free trade - like trade between Mexico, Canada and the United States - is welfare maximizing for the United States, but trade with nations like China, whose entire trading system is based on "innovation mercantilism," reduces U.S. economic welfare. Foreign mercantilist trade practices, especially those designed to challenge America's core competitive advantage in higher-wage, innovation based industries harm not just a few "losers" from trade, but the entire U.S. economy. Thus, as the Rubio report rightly calls for, it is time to move "beyond the false choices poised about economic growth and trade." For too long, the Washington trade community established set up a Manichean choice: one was either for free trade or protectionism. In fact, one can and should be for free trade and against foreign protectionism."Third, the report rightly notes that it is a mistake to posit only two choices: laissez faire, free-market capitalism vs heavy-handed "industrial policy". This choice was always a false one, but never more so than now. For U.S. governments (local, state or federal) to help companies in the United States, particularly in advanced industries, compete globally, especially against China, does not necessarily imply, as some on the right claim "inappropriate industrial policy" or as some on the left would claim wasteful "corporate welfare". The reality, as every U.S. governor knows, regardless of political party affiliation, is that jurisdictions are now in intense competition for advanced industries, and that governments have to play a supportive role or risk losing those industries and the good jobs that come with them. Therefore prioritization of the high-wage industries of the 21st century, as the report calls for, is not some kind of statist, misallocation of resources, but rather needs to be a core component of 21st century statecraft, one that the Washington economic policy community sorely needs to improve its understanding of and capabilities for."Because this point of the appropriate role for government is so poorly understood and even actively opposed by many in the economic policy community, it's worth elucidating it. Notwithstanding the efforts of rigid free-market economists to blur the differences between smart industrial policy and heavy-handed, distorting industrial policies, there are real differences. To illustrate this, it is useful to envision a continuum of government-market engagement, increasing from left to right in four steps: from (1) a "laissez-faire, leave it to the market" approach; to (2) "supporting factor conditions for innovation;" to (3) "supporting key broad technologies/industries"; to (4) "picking specific technologies/firms" (for example, supporting ABC Widget company as a national champion and picking XYZ kind of battery technology, rather than storage technology generally) (see figure 1). Only the last type of actions qualify as inappropriate "industrial policy." As the Rubio report points out there is a range of activities between these two poles that governments can and should take to spur innovation and competitiveness."Finally, the report rightly notes that the choice should not be between working to roll back Chinese innovation mercantilism and spurring more innovation and productivity at home. Some who resist taking firm steps against Chinese policies and practices argue that only the latter is needed. Others who eschew a stronger federal rule in spurring competitiveness, including support for the public investment that must accompany that policy, argue that getting touch with China is enough. The reality is that the federal government will not restore the promise of the American dream if it does just one or the other. It must do both: roll back Chinese innovation mercantilism and put in place a robust national innovation and competitiveness policy.Figure 1: Continuum of Government Market EngagementFigure 1 omitted, to view click here: https://www.sbc.senate.gov/public/?a=Files.Serve&#38;File_id=79588189-A504-4ED6-B957-B352DC4E667DThe Challenge From "Made in China 2025""Today the United States leads in the fifth industrial revolution (information technology) and hopes to lead in the sixth (artificial intelligence, robotics, biotechnology, etc.), but a major threat to our leadership is from China's unfair and harmful trade and technology policies. China is seeking global technology dominance in an array of advanced technology industries through an unprecedented array of predatory economic and trade policies and practices. The world has never seen a country like China before, with its organized and strategic system of authoritarian state capitalism and massive scale. It is not a market economy where private sector firms largely dictate their own strategy and actions. It is not a country governed by the rule of law. It is not a country constrained by global norms of acceptable economic and trade behavior. It is a country where the government is concerned with one and only one economic goal: winning in advanced technology industries by any means possible."As ITIF has documented across a series of reports--including "False Promises: The Yawning Gap Between China's WTO Commitments and Practices," "Enough is Enough: Confronting Chinese Innovation Mercantilism," and "Stopping China's Mercantilism: A Doctrine of Constructive, Alliance-Backed Confrontation "--China has deployed a vast panoply of innovation mercantilist practices that seek to unfairly advantage Chinese advanced-industry producers over foreign competitors.3 These practices have included forced technology transfer and forced local production as a condition of market access; theft of foreign intellectual property (IP); curtailment and even outright denial of access to Chinese markets in certain sectors; manipulation of technology standards; special benefits for state-owned enterprises; capricious cases to force foreign companies to license technology at a discount; government subsidies of Chinse companies, and government-subsidized acquisitions of foreign enterprises. U.S. and foreign enterprises across virtually every advanced technology sector--from aerospace and biotechnology to information and communications technology (ICT) products, Internet, clean energy, and digital media--have been harmed by China's aggressive use of these types of innovation mercantilist policies and will continue to be harmed if China cannot be pressured to roll back its egregious predatory practices."In the last few years, though, the focus of China's efforts has shifted. In 2015, Chinese President Xi Jinping unabashedly trumpeted a goal of making China the "master of its own technologies."4 China's arrival at that point resulted from the evolution of Chinese economic policy over the past two decades. Up to the mid-2000s, China's economic development strategy sought principally to induce foreign multinationals to shift relatively low- and moderate-value production to China.5 It used an array of unfair tactics, including currency manipulation, massive subsidies, and limits on imports. As ITIF and others such as MITs David Autor have shown, the cost the United States millions of manufacturing jobs.6 However, that strategy changed in 2006 as China moved to a "China Inc." development model of indigenous innovation which focused on helping Chinese firms, especially those in advanced, innovation-based industries, often at the expense of foreign firms. Marking the shift was a seminal document called the "National Medium- and Long-term Program for Science and Technology Development (2006-2020)," which called on China to master 402 core technologies, everything from intelligent automobiles to integrated circuits and high-performance computers."In recent years President Xi has doubled down on this approach, through new promulgations such as the "13th Five-Year Plan for Science and Technology," the "13th Five-Year Plan for National Informatization," "The National Cybersecurity Strategy," and of course, the "Made in China 2025 Strategy," As the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Germany writes, "Made in China 2025 in its current form [means that] China's leadership systematically intervenes in domestic markets so as to benefit and facilitate the economic dominance of Chinese enterprises and to disadvantage foreign competitors."7 For instance, with regard to ICT-enabled manufacturing the strategy calls for 80 percent domestic market share of high-end computer numeric controlled machines by 2025; 70 percent for robots and robot core components; 60 percent for big data; 60 percent for IT for smart manufacturing; and 50 percent for industrial software.8Unfair Policies and Practices Underpin "Made in China 2025""At the heart of China's strategy is foreign technology acquisition. The Chinese leadership knows that if it just relies on market forces few if any foreign technology leaders will provide them with the technology Chinese firms need. And domestic Chinese firms, while making progress, lag behind the global technology leaders. As a result, China has deployed a panoply of tools to unfairly obtain needed foreign technology. Once it obtains technology it relies on an array of tools, including protected markets and massive subsidies, to scale up and gain global market share."Intellectual Property Theft: Intellectual property theft is an important tool in the Chinese arsenal. China has deployed industrial spies to obtain foreign secrets. As the New York Times documented, a leading Chinese computer chip maker allegedly paid employees of a Taiwanese chip company working with the U.S. company Micron to steal valuable chip designs.9"Another vector is cyber theft. Seven percent of U.S. firms operating in China listed cyber theft as a problem, a number that presumably would be higher if every firm that had faced an intrusion was aware of it.10 The IP Commission Report on the Theft of U.S. Intellectual Property found that China accounted for nearly 80 percent of all IP thefts from U.S.-headquartered organizations in 2013, amounting to an estimated $300 billion in lost business annually.11 An updated 2017 Commission report put the figure at $600 billion.12 Then NSA Director Keith Alexander has called Chinese IP theft, "the greatest transfer of wealth in history."13 Even though President Xi made "commitments" to end Chinese cyber-theft, there is little evidence that the Chinese have followed through on this promise. As the China the National Counterintelligence and Security Center stated in its "2018 Foreign Economic Espionage in Cyberspace" report:"China has expansive efforts in place to acquire U.S. technology to include sensitive trade secrets and proprietary information. It continues to use cyber espionage to support its strategic development goals--science and technology advancement, military modernization, and economic policy objectives. China's cyberspace operations are part of a complex, multipronged technology development strategy that uses licit and illicit methods to achieve its goals.14"Meanwhile, China still has one of the highest rates of unlicensed software usage in the world, with 74 percent of the software in use unlicensed and the market value of unlicensed software usage exceeding $8.7 billion in 2013.15 240,000 Internet cafes in China rely on illegal copies of entertainment software.16 Chinese firms even produce and sell technology to allow consumers around the world to circumvent encryption protection so they can pirate video games."Another vector for purloined intellectual property is to trick companies in the United States into thinking that a Chinese firm wants to invest in them. A seemingly independent Chinese investment fund will approach a small to mid-sized U.S. technology company and indicate a willingness to invest needed capital in the company. But before the Chinese company can do this, they must do due diligence and they send in employees, who turn out to work for a state-owned Chinese company, to obtain key information about the company, including trade secrets. The firm never hears back from the investment company again."Another path is through exchange visits and student enrollments in U.S. universities. At least at one time, it was common for Chinese exchange visitors to the United States to use opportunities to visit factories and other facilities to engage in industrial espionage, including measuring equipment, taking photos and writing detailed technical notes to bring back to China. And as Daniel Golden writes in Spy Schools there have been cases where Chinese graduate students enrolled in U.S. universities use their access to valuable scientific and engineering information to bring that back and provide it to Chinese companies.17"Chinese trade secret theft also represents an increasing challenge. A prime example is Boston-based American Superconductor (AMSC), which provides software, design, and hardware solutions for wind manufacturers and energy providers. American Superconductor's top customer, the Chinese-based wind turbine manufacturer Sinovel Wind Group, faced criminal and civil actions for paying an AMSC employee to steal proprietary power-converter and control-system software, which it then used illegally in its wind turbines to meet electricity grid standards.18 The employee, an engineer at one of AMSC's subsidiary's, was recently found guilty of industrial espionage in Austria. In another telling case, the global agriculture firm Monsanto decided to open production and research facilities for advanced corn technology in China and proceeded to develop experimental fields growing genetically enhanced corn. It wasn't long before the advanced corn was systematically stolen, clearly an effort by the Chinese government to gain access to the IP embedded in Monsanto's corn.19"Weak IP Enforcement: Weak enforcement of IP law is another vector. Chinese firms can often copy and reengineer foreign technologies with impunity (what they call introducing, digesting, absorbing and re-innovating), even those technologies protected by patents. As a MIT Sloan Management Review article, "Protecting Intellectual Property in China," noted, "Intellectual property protection is the No. 1 challenge for multinational corporations operating in China."20 According to the U.S. International Trade Commission, in 2009, U.S. IP-intensive enterprises conducting business in China reported losses of approximately $48.2 billion in sales, royalties, or license fees due to Chinese IPR infringement.21 In 2018, according to the American Chamber of Commerce in China, one-quarter of surveyed U.S. companies cited "Insufficient protection offered by text of IP-related laws and regulations," while 24 percent cited, "Difficulty prosecuting IP infringements in court or via administrative measures" as significant challenges.22"China also favors domestic over foreign patent applicants when it comes to strategic industries. As the 2016 report "Technology Protectionism and the Patent System: Strategic Technologies in China," finds, "Foreign applications in technology fields that are of strategic importance to China (as defined by being listed on the MLP) are 4 to 7 percentage points less likely to be approved than local applications, all else equal."23 As it notes, "Given the importance of industrial policy in China and the country's strong focus on indigenous innovation and intellectual property, the empirical results provide a case of technology protectionism by means of the patent system."24"State-Backed Purchases of U.S. Technology Companies: An increasingly important way for Chinese firms to gain access to needed technology is to simply buy up U.S. technology companies or invest in high-tech startups. Indeed, until recently, a not-insignificant share of Chinese foreign direct investment into the United States was in technology industries. According to Select USA, the top four industrial categories in terms of numbers of Chinese FDI projects from 2003 to 2015 were electronics, industrial machinery, software and information technology services, and communications.25 The Rhodium Group reports that over the last 16 years there has been roughly $18 billion of Chinese FDI into ICT and electronics industries deals, with most of that in just the last few years. Of the $4.9 billion invested in electronics, $4.2 billion was invested in 2016, with 99.99 percent of that going to buy U.S. firms.26 Of the $14.2 billion invested in ICT, 74 percent was made from 2014 to 2016, with more than 95 percent going to acquisitions.27 These numbers would have been considerably larger if the federal government had not informally or formally blocked some deals through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). Fortunately, Chinese inward FDI has dramatically fallen in the last two years as it became clear that the U.S. government would take a harder look at their attempts to buy U.S. technology. And of course, the recent enactment of the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act (FIRRMA) will hopefully help even more going forward."The role of Chinese government money in U.S. deals is underreported in part because of the opaque nature of this support. As Wang and Wang note, many Chinese firms lack transparency, making it difficult for host countries to know enough about the investing firm.28 This was evident for example in the attempted purchase of German semiconductor equipment firm Aixtron by a Chinese investor where there were "a web of relations among the customer, the buyer, and the Chinese state."29 Moreover, the Chinese government channels funds to supposedly private investment bodies, making it look as if these deals are commercial."The main purpose of most Chinese technology companies buying U.S. technology companies is not to make a profit, but to take U.S. technology to upgrade their own technology capabilities. The Rhodium Group notes that in the aviation sector, "The dominant player is aviation conglomerate AVIC, which is looking to the US market to upgrade its technology and other capabilities."30 Likewise, in the electronics and electrical equipment sector, "Chinese investors are drawn to the US electronics and electrical equipment sector for building their brands, expanding their sales and distribution channels, and upgrading their innovative capacity and technology portfolios."31 Investments in pharmaceuticals and biotechnology are "often driven by upgrading technology (such as Wuxi's acquisition of AppTec, a laboratory services firm)."32 As one study of Chinese FDI estimated, 30 percent of the private firm deals and 46 percent of the SOE deals are motivated by technology acquisition.33 The authors go on to state that Chinese acquisition of overseas firms "has become the most widely used methods [of investing overseas] for Chinese firms, largely because it provides rapid access to proprietary technology."34"China has also ramped up its efforts to buy into early-stage U.S. technology start-ups. A recent report from DOD's Defense Innovation Unit Experimental (DIUx) finds that "Chinese participation in venture-backed startups is at a record level of 10-16% of all [U.S.] venture deals (2015-2017) and has grown quite rapidly in the past seven years."35 And some of this investment comes from venture firms that are backed by Chinese governments (federal or provincial). For example, the Zhongguancun Development Group, a state-owned enterprise headquartered in Beijing has set up "Danhua capital" to promote the strategy of "Zhongguancun capital going global and bringing in overseas advanced technology and talents."36 Likewise, Shenzen Capital Group, a purportedly private venture capital firm that has invested in at least one advanced U.S. technology company,37 has actually received about 80 percent of its invested capital from the Chinese government,38 and its investments are focused, not surprisingly, to match the central governments key targeted industries. The firm even boasts a chart that compares the technology allocation of its investments and how it compares to the governments priorities.39"FDI acquisition is not the only path to U.S. technology capabilities. For example, China is investing in U.S. research universities to gain access to their research, often with U.S. state government-backing. For example, Maryland is committing nearly $600,000 over three years to build up the Maryland International Incubator, in a bid to attract high-tech companies from China and elsewhere to collaborate with University of Maryland researchers. Of the 18 companies in the incubator, nine are from China, with most of these being biotech companies.40 In addition, Chinese firms have become investors in early stage U.S. technology companies. These include the venture capital arms of Chinese Internet companies such as Alibaba or Tencent. The idea is to invest in start-ups and use that as a way to bring technology and knowledge back to China. Indeed, at least a few Silicon Valley experts report that they are seeing a significant uptick in Chinese venture investment in Silicon Valley. In just the first three months of 2018, Chinese-based venture-capital funds invested $1.4 billion into U.S. biotechnology companies.41 This trend could very well increase in coming years as China sees that its traditional acquisition route becomes more difficult. We see this pattern in other nations as well. 40 percent of venture capital in Israel in 2015 reportedly came from China.42"Forced Technology Transfer: Dwarfing these tools is forced technology transfer. Although China's World Trade Organization (WTO) accession agreement contains rules constraining it from tying foreign direct investment or market access to requirements to transfer technology to the country,43 China routinely requires firms to transfer technology in exchange for being granted the ability to invest, operate, or sell in China.44 As Harvard Business School professors Thomas Hout and Pankaj Ghemawat document in "China vs the World: Whose Technology Is It?," Chinese technology transfer requirements as a condition of market access have affected scores of companies in industries as diverse as aviation, automotive, chemicals, renewable energy, and high-speed rail.45 To be sure, because such conditions usually contravene China's WTO commitments, officials are careful not to put such requirements in writing, usually resorting to oral communications to pressure foreign firms to transfer technology.46 In 2012, 23 percent of the value of all foreign direct investment projects were joint ventures.47 And the U.S.-China Business Council's "2014 China Business Environment Survey" reports that 62 percent of companies had concerns about transferring technology to China, while 20 percent reported that they had been requested to transfer technology to China within the past three years.48"Forced technology transfer is not new. A 1987 Congressional Office of Technology Assessment report states, "Although most U.S. firms approach the China market with the intent to sell products, many find they must include technology transfer if they wish to gain access to the China market."49 But what is new are two things. First, there are more foreign companies seeking to get in the Chinese market, such that the scale of forced technology transfer is much larger than it was two decades ago. In 2015 for example, 6,000 new international joint ventures, amounting to $27.8 billion of FDI inflows, were established in China.50"Second, the sophistication and value of the technology the Chinese government is now demanding is significantly higher than in decades past when U.S. companies could afford to give their Chinese "partners" older generations of technology, confident that the U.S. firms could innovate faster. Now for many foreign advanced industry companies, doing business in China requires transferring ever-more valuable technology to Chinese joint venture partners. In 2013, 35 percent of U.S. business respondents in China said that tech transfer requirements were a concern, and 42 percent in advanced technology industries voiced this concern.51 Fifty-six percent of survey respondents who gave a response thought that tech transfer requirements were increasing.52 And as USTR points out in its 301 report on China, it is likely that these numbers are under-reported.53"The Chinese government has employed the weapon of forced technology transfer to gain technological know-how in a variety of industries. A well-known case in point concerns high-speed rail. Over the past 15 years China built the largest high-speed rail network in the world. That massive purchase of rolling stock, signal systems, and related equipment was something no foreign rail producer could afford to ignore. As such, the Chinese government had enormous leverage to pressure foreign producers to give the Chinese state-owned enterprise competitors key technology and IP. The Chinese term for this is "exchanging market for technology."54 As Chen and Haynes document, in 2004 the State Council of China adopted a new railway development strategy that shifted from just subsidizing domestic producers in order to help them improve their technology to one where they "introduce advanced technology through joint design and manufacturing, [with an ultimate objective to] to build a Chinese brand."55 After that the state Ministry of Railways (MOR) launched three tenders for foreign high-speed electric trains and in each one MOR stipulated that foreign companies had to collaborate with domestic partners in the competition and had to transfer key technologies to achieve localization.16 The tender included two key conditions: to win, the bidder had to transfer technology to China and the final products had to marketed under the Chinese state-owned enterprise rail car brand. This was all in support of the government's "Action Plan for the Independent Innovation of Chinese High-Speed Trains." As a result, multiple foreign train companies were pressured to transfer valuable technology to the Chinese companies (now principally one company due to the central government forcing the two main companies to merge into a powerful national champion, Chinese Railway Construction Corporation, now the largest rail producer in the world.) As Chen and Haynes write, "The result is a new HSR [high speed rail] industry in China has emerged which now serves the new vast HSR network and looks externally to export its new skill in HSR production and its new cutting-edge activity in HSR innovations." Not only are CRCC and related Chinese companies virtually guaranteed all Chinese rail projects, but CRCC is now aggressively exporting trains and train systems containing advanced foreign technology to other nations, backed with generous export subsidies from the central government. For example, the China Export-Import Bank (a state agency) announced in 2017 the equivalent of $30 billion in financing assistance for CRCC exports.56 (Surprisingly, the U.S. Department of Commerce International Trade Administration, in its document promoting U.S. rail export opportunities to China, makes no mention of the fact that the lion's share of these opportunities come with forced technology transfer requirements.57)"The Chinese have employed different tactics to the same end in the biopharmaceutical industry, where various policies enable Chinese firms to get access to U.S. technology. For example, the relatively short six-year term for data exclusivity, coupled with the lack of a formal definition of a "new chemical entity," means the Chinese government can pressure U.S. firms to turn over important data to Chinese generic drug firms. Similarly, the Chinese government requires that any drugs sold in China must go through Chinese clinical trials, even if they are approved in the United States. This extends the time for sales before a company can sell a drug by as much as 8 years, meaning that the company has only 12 years left of patent-protected sales in China before a Chinese generic company can copy the drug. Moreover, in China, unlike the United States and Europe, there is no extension of marketing exclusivity at the back end to take into account long clinical trial delays. Moreover, China also issues compulsory licenses for the intellectual property for particular drugs.58 Finally, it presses foreign biopharmaceutical companies to form joint ventures if they want their drugs more easily put on the government list of drugs to qualify for reimbursement.59"We also see this in cloud computing. China requires companies running cloud-computing operations to be locally controlled. This means that if a company like Amazon Web Services or Microsoft wants to serve the rapidly growing Chinese market it must partner with a Chinese company and sell their services under the Chinese company brand. And as part of this partnership the expectation is that the foreign cloud provider will provide the Chinese firm with technology and know-how.60 Chinese cloud providers, like Aliyun, the cloud services unit of Alibaba, is able to establish its own data centers in the United States without any similar requirements."Subsidies: Once Chinese firms gain access to needed foreign technology, the next step of the Chinese strategy is to ensure that they have the capital needed to scale up. This involves direct and indirect subsidies and also designing markets protected from foreign competition so the Chinese firms can accumulate capital. Once firms have the technology, competencies and scale to go global, the government often subsidizes global market expansion, such as through the China Export-Import Bank (an entity the World Bank has funded) and China's Export and Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure).61 Moreover, by leading to global overcapacity and selling below cost, China uses that overcapacity as a cudgel to disrupt the economics of innovation-based industries (i.e., subsidized competition prevents foreign competitors from earning reasonable profits from one generation of innovation to reinvest in future generations of innovation) and thus weaken foreign competitors, enabling Chinese firms to gain even more global market share."The Chinese government also works to limit foreign competition for its budding national champions. For example, in the high-end equipment manufacturing sector, China maintains a program that conditions the receipt of a subsidy on an enterprise's use of at least 60 percent Chinese-made components when producing intelligent manufacturing equipment.62 And despite the fact that China "clarified and underscored ... that it agreed that enterprises are free to base technology transfer decisions on business and market considerations" at a December 2014 meeting of the United States-China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade (JCCT), USTR notes that China has "announced two measures relating to [local procurement of] information technology equipment used in the banking services sector and in providing Internet- or telecommunications-based services more generally."63"China also lavishes Chinese firms that have obtained foreign technology with massive subsidies. As George and Usha Haley document in their book, Subsidies to Chinese Industry: State Capitalism, Business Strategy, and Trade Policy, China's game plan has long been to "aggressively subsidize targeted industries to dominate global markets." As they document, in the 2000s, China provided almost $100 billion in subsidies to just three industries alone: $33 billion for paper, $28 billion for auto parts, and $27 billion for steel.64 China's share of global solar panel exports grew from just 5 percent in the mid-2000s to 67 percent today, with Chinese solar output turbocharged by at least $42 billion of subsidies from 2010 to 2012 alone.65 China now wants to replicate this strategy in other advanced-technology industries, such as semiconductors and electric batteries.66 For instance, China's National Integrated Circuit (IC) Strategy calls for at least $160 billion in subsidies to create a completely closed-loop semiconductor industry in China, including explicit plans to halve Chinese imports of U.S.-manufactured semiconductors by 2025 and eliminate them entirely by 2035. The "Made in China 2025 Strategy" is supported by some 800 state-guided funds to the tune of more than $350 billion, including advanced-battery manufacturing, wide-body aircraft, and robotics."Moreover, Chinese government-backed investment funds aim to control $1.7 trillion, equal to one-third of the assets in the global private equity market.67 Since the global financial crisis, the Chinese government has moved aggressively to stimulate capital investment that will strengthen its competitive position, both domestically and in global markets. First created in 2008, there are now more than 2,000 of these so-called "government guidance funds," three-quarters of which have been established between 2015 and 2018. Having raised $530 billion so far, the funds already represent a massive vehicle for Chinese governments to subsidize Chinese tech companies and acquire foreign tech companies under the guise of venture capital. And the goal is for them to more than triple in size: The funds have been tasked with leveraging $1.7 trillion, which is 33 percent of the $5.2 trillion that private equity firms now control globally.What is at Stake?"Given China's Made in China 2025 plan, it is no exaggeration to suggest that, without aggressive action, the United States may face a world within two decades where U.S. jobs in industries as diverse as semiconductors, computers, biopharmaceuticals, aerospace, Internet, digital media, and automobiles are significantly reduced due to Chinese policies unabashedly targeting domestic and global market share in those industries."It is important to understand that the challenge to America's leadership in technology-based industries is much different than the process of losing more commodity-based, low-skilled industries to China in the 2000s. If, for example, the value of the dollar was to fall significantly related to the yuan (and other currencies), it is possible that America could regain at least some of the production lost to China in industries like textiles and apparel, furniture, metal parts, and other similar low- and medium-value added products. Companies could simply buy machines, set up factories, and restart production domestically in a cost-effective way. But if America's technology companies were severely weakened or even put out business, no currency decline could bring them back because competitiveness in technology industries is based less on cost and more on a complex array of competencies at the firm- and ecosystem-level. For example, a firm cannot simply buy some semiconductor equipment and start producing chips. To do that would require not just machines but deep and complex tacit knowledge embedded in the firm in workers (from the shop floor to scientists to managers) coupled with an innovation ecosystem (universities training the right talent, a network of suppliers, etc.). Once those capabilities are lost, they are essentially gone, and are very difficult to resurrect absent massive government intervention."There is an additional reason why losing advanced technology industries is problematic. Most technology-based industries have high barriers to entry. In contrast to the t-shirt industry where entry largely requires just capital to buy sewing machines, entry into innovation-based industries requires both physical and intellectual capital. In an industry like semiconductors, for example, firms spend hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars developing technical capabilities to enable production. Producing the first chip of a particular generation is incredibly expensive because of the amount of R&#38;D involved. Producing the second chip is much cheaper because only the material and labor costs are involved. In this sense, fixed costs are extremely high, but marginal costs are low. In these innovation-based industries losing market share to unfairly competing firms supported by their innovation mercantilist governments means two things. First, sales fall. This is true because global sales are largely fixed (there is only so much demand for semiconductors, jet airplanes, and other similar advanced products), and if a mercantilist-supported competitor gains market share, the market-based competitor loses share. Second, because profits decline more than sales, it is now more difficult for the market-based innovator to reinvest revenues in the next generation of products or services, meaning that the mercantilist-supported entrant has an advantage in the next generation of products. This can lead to a death spiral whereby the market-based leader can lose complete market share."A loss of advanced technology industries has two major negative impacts on the U.S. economy. The first is on prosperity, as the average wage in these industries is approximately 75 percent higher than average U.S. wages.68 The second is on national security and the defense industrial base. U.S. defense superiority is based is in large part on technological superiority. Our service men and women go into any conflict with the advantage of fielding technologically superior weapons systems. But maintaining that advantage depends on the U.S. economy maintaining global technological superiority, not just in defense-specific technologies but in a wide array of dual-use technologies. To the extent the United States continues to lose technological capabilities to China, U.S. technological advantage in defense over China will diminish, if not evaporate, as U.S. capabilities whither and Chinese ones strengthen. It is certainly a highly risky proposition to assume that the United States can continue its weapons systems superiority over the Chinese if: 1) the Chinese continue to advance, largely through unfair, predatory practices at the pace they are; and 2) the United States loses a moderate to significant share of its advanced technology innovation and production capabilities. As ITIF wrote in 2014, "The United States defense system is still the most innovative in the world, but that leadership is not assured and is in danger of failing. This decline is not only impacting defense innovation and capabilities, but also overall commercial innovation and U.S. competitiveness."69What the U.S. Government Should Do"To respond to the challenge from MIC25, the federal government needs to do two main things: 1) more aggressively work to constrain and roll back the unfair parts of MIC25 and other Chinese government policies; and 2) institute stronger domestic policies to help firms in advanced industries increase output (and jobs) in the United States.Roll Back Chinese Innovation Mercantilism"There are an array of policies that can be instituted that can limit the harm from Chinese policies on the U.S. economy and also exert pressure on the Chinese government to roll back its unfair policies. While I list several here, the most important is for the Washington policy community to work to identify and implement what an array of possible policy actions in an array of areas (e.g. financial regulation, trade law, intellectual property law, criminal enforcement, customs enforcement, etc.)."One step Congress can take is to instruct USTR to bring a WTO case against China over its ongoing failure to publish thousands of trade-related final measures, including subsidies, in a single official journal as it's required to do under WTO rules. One reason it's been difficult to bring subsidy cases against China at the WTO is that China fails to properly publish its subsidies. Getting the WTO to enforce China's publication requirements would make it possible to bring additional WTO cases for subsidy or other violations, such as forced IP or technology transfer."The United States also needs a new regime to contest China's strict technology-licensing laws. Under Chinese contract law and technology import-export regulations (or TIER), a foreign licensor into China is obligated to offer an indemnity against third-party infringement to the Chinese licensee.70 In other words, a foreign licensor licensing into China has to provide insurance that practicing the licensed technology does not infringe any IP held by a third party. But, under TIER, this legal obligation only attaches to "technology import contracts." That is, this obligation only attaches to a foreigner licensing technologies into China; the Chinese licensor has no such obligation. This discriminates against foreign licensors. The foreign licensor is legally bound to offer something that the Chinese licensee is not, making it difficult for small companies, companies which may experience high litigation risks in China's litigious environment, and companies engaged in collaborative research and development (such as cross-licensing, open-source licensing, and charitable activities) to arrive at mutually beneficial licensing agreements. TIER makes it almost impossible for small companies, such as start-ups, to license their breakthrough technologies in China, because no start-ups (due to their limited resources) would be able to conduct the complex analysis required by China's high-litigation environment and industrial policies that limit the value of foreign IP in order to offer insurance against third-party infringement disputes. While large multinational companies could avoid this issue by licensing technology (e.g., through their China-based subsidiaries), start-up companies cannot do so because they typically do not have subsidiaries in China. Consequently, the impact of the mandatory indemnification requirement on small- and medium-sized companies, and especially start-ups, is particularly acute."Another provision in TIER mandates that in technology-import contracts, improvements belong to the party making the improvements, which typically is the Chinese licensee. Thus, foreign licensors, including U.S. firms, cannot negotiate to own any improvements or to share the improvements with Chinese licensees, even if both licensing parties desire for the improvements to be shared or owned by the foreign licensors. Moreover, TIER prohibits any technology-import contracts to "unreasonably restrict the export channels" of the Chinese licensee, thereby impeding the ability of the two licensing parties to allocate markets as they see mutually beneficial. Put simply, U.S. companies are obligated under TIER to let Chinese firms own the improvements and cannot freely negotiate with Chinese entities."To address this discrimination, Congress should enact a regime whereby if Chinese entities seek licenses in the United States, then the Chinese enterprise must license on the same terms by which foreigners are required to license into China. Such legislation would specifically require the Chinese licensor to offer an indemnity against infringement by the U.S. licensee and to stipulate that the U.S. licensees are entitled to own the improvements they make and receive a reasonable market allocation under the licenses. Another possible approach would be for Congress to pass legislation requiring that the U.S. company whose original technology was improved by the Chinese entity receives an automatic exclusive license to use that improved technology [in the United States], such that the full potential of the original technology owned by the U.S. companies is not encumbered by improvements owned by the Chinese entity. Although technology-licensing law is usually a matter of state contract law, the legislation would be enacted pursuant to Congress's power to legislate international commerce."Congress should strengthen FBI-university partnerships to limit inappropriate IP transfer. The FBI should engage in a stronger partnership with U.S. research universities to help them better understand how to take steps to better identify students here for the purpose of intellectual property transfer and how to limit such access. The point is not to just limit access and transfer of sensitive military technology subject to deemed export controls, but also advanced technology that can help China compete with the United States. At the same time, Congress should support FBI efforts to beef up and better target commercial counterintelligence resources to better help enterprises in the United States stop Chinese commercial espionage.71"Congress should work to establish stronger authorities to prohibit Chinese firms that are stealing IP from accessing the U.S. banking and financial system. For example, it should empower the Treasury Department to deny Chinese-headquartered enterprises access to listing on U.S. stock exchanges if they fail to provide financial statements in line with generally accepted accounting principles."Congress should pass legislation that allows firms to ask the Department of Justice for an exemption to coordinate actions regarding technology transfer and investment to other nations. One of the key levers China has is that it's a monopsonist: its market is so large it can essentially compel foreign companies to hand over technology in order to sell their products in China. But if companies in a similar industry can agree that none of them will transfer technology to China in order to gain market access, then the Chinese government will have less leverage over them. The same would be true if companies agreed that they would not invest in China until China improved its IP protections. Such an amendment to antitrust law would be similar to the 1984 Cooperative R&#38;D Act, which allowed firms to apply to form pre-competitive R&#38;D consortia."Congress should also stand up a new arm of DOJ's antitrust division focused on foreign government-enabled and led antitrust violations. Currently, DOJ can bring actions against foreign firms if they are found to be acting in an anticompetitive manner. DOJ needs to not only be able to but be willing to bring actions against foreign firms if their actions are helped by their state in a way that leads to anticompetitive results. In the case of China, its subsidies, forced technology transfer, IP theft, and other unfair actions give Chinese firms unfair advantages that distort markets in an anticompetitive manner. DOJ should be able to investigate cases and if they found a violation, bring those to an administrative law judge who would adjudicate the case and the damages the U.S. government could impose on the Chinese companies that benefited from the anti-competitive Chinese government policies or practices. The challenge will be that not all Chinese companies likely to have cases brought against them are involved in the U.S. market. But some are, and for the ones that aren't such a ruling would effectively preclude them from entering the U.S. market.Take Stronger Actions to Support U.S. Advanced Industry Competitiveness"While policies and actions to roll back Chinese mercantilist actions are critical, the United States also needs to do much more to boost U.S. competitiveness at home. Congress should take efforts to limit Chinese efforts to manipulate its currency for competitive advantage, as it has done over the last year to suppress the price effects from the Trump administration tariffs on Chinese imports. Congress also need send clear signals to the Treasury Department that the official policy of the U.S. government should not be to maintain a strong dollar (meaning any value of the dollar stronger than what is needed to run balanced trade). A strong dollar hurts American workers, especially in traded sectors, by increasing the pressure on companies in the United States to keep wages low as a way to stay competitive. Rather the policy should be to work to lower the value of the dollar until U.S. trade is in balance, and then after that to let market forces determine currency levels."But a more fairly valued dollar is not enough. Congress needs to consider policies to help U.S. companies boost productivity. As such, America needs its own "Invented and Made in America 2029" program where the federal government identifies the technologies most important to America's national and economic security and allocates at least an additional $25 billion annually to support their development.72 As part of this a key area is to work to improve U.S. manufacturing productivity growth, which in the last decade has been anemic, averaging about one-third of the growth rates of the prior two decades. Lagging productivity growth makes it harder to companies, especially in traded sectors to boost employee compensation. There are host of steps Congress can take to help firms, especially manufacturers boost productivity, including significantly boosting funding of NIST's Manufacturing Extension Partnership program, expanding the number of and funding duration of the Manufacturing USA Institutes, boosting funding for NSF's National Robotics Initiative, and establishing a program to fund community colleges to establish robotic test bed and training facilities that small manufacturers and workers could access."There are other actions to consider, many of which ITIF has detailed in its report "The Competitive Edge: A Policymaker's Guide to Developing a National Strategy."73 These include expanding lending authorities for the Export-Import Bank,74 increased efforts to develop STEM talent, and spurring more technology transfer from universities and federal labs.75 Moreover, the federal government should work to establish a deeper North American supply chain, which would provide U.S. companies with an alternative to the Chinese supply chain. Approving the USMCA trade agreement would facilitate that."Finally, the recent tax reform bill allowed first year expensing of machinery and equipment helped spur more investment including presumably in robots, but it is due to expire at the end of 2022. And in 2022 companies will have to deduct R&#38;D expenditures over five years. Congress should make expensing for capital investment and R&#38;D expenditures permanent, while at the same time increase the Alternative Simplified Credit rate from 14 percent to at least 25 percent.76 (At least 26 nations now field a more generous R&#38;D tax incentive).The Challenge to Small Business and Policy Responses"More robust small business growth and new firm formation, especially in trade sectors, will be critical to restoring robust and vibrant economic growth. For the purpose of thinking about competition from MIC25 there are three kinds of small businesses: 1) suppliers to globally traded original equipment makers (OEMs); 2) companies that themselves sell directly in global markets; and 3) domestic serving, consumer-facing companies (e.g. dry cleaners, barbers, grocery stores, etc.). Unfair competition from China hurts all three kinds, but the biggest impact is on the first two. As large companies close or contract domestic facilities, either because of Chinese competition or because they have moved production to China, most of the supplier contracts move to China. At the same time, why start a small manufacturing company if you know you will face robust and subsidized competitors from China or face a risk of having your IP stolen? Overall, there is less incentive to start a new manufacturing firm when many big U.S. customers are now overseas, or when you know you will face a big, subsidized foreign competitor, which is why efforts to roll back Chinese innovation mercantilism need to be a key part of any small business agenda."But there are also are a host of steps Congress could take to help new and small business, particularly in globally traded sectors. One step would to be encourage the Small Business Administration (SBA) to focus more resources on firms in traded sectors, like agriculture, manufacturing, and software, content and internet services. Currently the SBA treats all industries alike in its funding priorities, but industries serving local markets (e.g., liquor stores) play little role in supporting local or national economic competitiveness, and by and large providing funding to them simply shifts activity from one firm to another. Neither of these things is true for firms in industries that are globally traded, yet only 7.5 percent of loans under the SBA's primary program for assisting small businesses (7A loan program) go to manufacturers. Congress should require the SBA to develop a plan to significantly increase the share of support going to traded-sector firms.77"Congress should also establish a 401(k)-like deferred-investment program that would give small and mid-sized manufacturers greater resources to bootstrap themselves by allowing them to make tax-deferred investments through manufacturing reinvestment accounts. The funds would be available for tax-free withdrawal if used for R&#38;D, workforce training, or capital equipment investments. Connecticut has already put such a program in place.78"Congress should also consider removing obstacles to the tax code to limit the growth of technology startups. Current law prevents passive investors from taking advantage of net operating losses or research tax credits of the companies in which they invest. This makes sense for tax shelters that are never meant to be profitable. But it makes it even harder for small research companies to find investors. Congress should create an exception for companies that devote over half of their expenses to research and development and that have fewer than 250 employees and less than $150 million in assets. Investors could only use that portion of the losses or credit that was devoted to qualifying research activity.79 In addition, firms can normally carry past operating losses forward in order to deduct them from future income, thereby lowering their taxes. Under Section 382 of the tax code, firms lose this ability when they undergo a change in ownership. Since small research-intensive startup firms often engage in successive financing rounds before achieving success, this provision makes it hard for them to ever recover their past losses and artificially inflates their historical income for tax purposes. Congress should exempt that portion of net operating losses that are generated by small firms that conduct qualifying research and development activities.80"Congress should introduce an Open Commercialization Infrastructure Act. One way to increase the use of America's national R&#38;D infrastructure would be to pass an "Open Commercialization Infrastructure Act" that permits private use of bonded facilities--including universities, federal labs, and public libraries--for certain activities related to entrepreneurial education and training as well as for economic development and job creation. This would be useful because buildings that are financed through tax-exempt bonds currently are not permitted to develop private programming. For example, a small business trying to develop a commercial product would be restricted from taking advantage of a 3-D printer in a makerspace at a bonded facility such as a public library. This and many other kinds of private activities that benefit entrepreneurs--such as business incubators, accelerators, and training programs--are important for broader economic development. Congress should ensure more infrastructure is available for such purposes.81"The current federal system for funding research also pays too little attention to commercializing technology and is still based on the linear model that assumes basic research gets easily translated into commercial activity. To address this, the administration should work with Congress to establish an automatic set-aside program that allocates a modest percentage of federal research budgets to technology-commercialization activities. For instance, Congress could allocate 0.15 percent of agency research budgets to fund university, federal laboratory, and state government technology-commercialization and innovation efforts. The funds could be used to provide: 1) "commercialization capacity-building grants" to institutions of higher education pursuing specific initiatives to improve their capacity to commercialize faculty research, and 2) "commercialization-accelerator grants" to support institutions of higher education pursuing initiatives that allow faculty to directly commercialize research in an effort to accelerate research breakthroughs.82"Congress should allow a greater share of SBIR and STTR grant awards to be used for commercialization activities. SBIR's impact could be much greater if some facets of the program were geared significantly more toward commercialization. Awardees currently are prohibited from using grant money to fund critical commercialization activities that would enable them to raise their profiles and accomplish certain key milestones so they can build prototypes of new products or services, acquire commercial customers, attract private capital, or accelerate market entry. These activities cover the gamut from intellectual-property development and prosecution to marketing and staff recruitment. To fill these gaps, SBIR awardees should be permitted to expend at least 5 percent of their SBIR funds on commercialization-oriented activities. For instance, in the lasts Congress, the Support Startup Business Act (S. 2149), co-sponsored by Sens. Chis Coons (D-DE) and Cory Gardner (R-CO), would allow program awardees to allocate up to $50,000 of their awards for commercialization-related activities, including services such as market validation, IP protection, market research, and business model development.83"Finally, Congress should create an "Innovation Voucher" program operated by NIST. As in almost a dozen other countries, these vouchers can spur innovation and stimulate knowledge transfer by allowing small and mid-sized enterprises to "buy" expertise from universities, national labs, and research institutions to conduct studies, analyze the innovation potential of new technologies, etc. A promising example has been the Small Business Voucher Pilot program in the Energy Department's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), which has provided vouchers to 114 small business across 31 states, disbursing more than $22 million since 2015. For example, the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) collaborated to launch "RevV," a $2.5 million manufacturing innovation program that offers vouchers for manufacturers in Tennessee to access the world-class researchers and facilities at ORNL. The administration should work with Congress to extend such vouchers across the entire federal lab system under the auspices of NIST by authorizing $50 million that would be state-matched.84CONCLUSION"In summary, taking firm and strategic action against Chinese predatory, mercantilist practices, while at the same time establishing and implementing a robust national innovation and competitiveness strategy are critically needed if we are to assure future U.S. advanced industry competitiveness. Whether or not such actions can be successful is an open question. But one thing is clear: not taking action will make it much easier for the Chinese government to achieve their goal of dominating advanced technology industries."To view the footnotes, click here: https://www.sbc.senate.gov/public/?a=Files.Serve&#38;File_id=79588189-A504-4ED6-B957-B352DC4E667D[TheHill]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6626069 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: February 28, 2019End of Document

For American Colleges, China Could Be the New Travel Ban - but WorseThe Chronicle of Higher Education January 3, 2019  ThursdayCopyright 2019 The Chronicle of Higher Education All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL; NewsLength: 1937 wordsByline: Karin FischerBodyABSTRACTThe "Trump effect" has fueled worry that international students might be scared off. But amid worsening economic trends and feuding governments, Chinese students might simply go elsewhere.FULL TEXT Anxiety has been rampant about the "Trump effect," the idea that the president's travel ban and anti-foreigner rhetoric could discourage - or prevent - top students and scholars from coming to the United States and damage the standing of American higher education globally.But perhaps American colleges should be bracing for something even more ominous on the horizon - call it the "China effect."Consider this: The Trump administration in recent months has tightened rules for Chinese visa-holders in some STEM fields and reportedly has considered barring all Chinese students. Public officials, including the director of FBI, have warned of universities' vulnerability to Chinese espionage, and Congress has threatened to withhold certain federal grants from colleges with Confucius Institutes, the Chinese-funded language centers. Amid heightening geopolitical tensions, some institutions are reconsidering their research ties in China.And a potential economic slump in China should be raising alarms in American admissions offices, threatening to turn off the spigot of Chinese students who have flooded American campuses and buoyed bottom lines for the past decade.To be sure, the travel ban and a number of Trump-administration changes in visa rules have complicated colleges' efforts to recruit and hire abroad. Since the 2016 election, the number of new international students coming to the United States has fallen.Still, the Trump effect could pale next to a chilling of the relationship between Chinese and American higher education. The connections - student enrollments, joint degree programs, and research partnerships, among others - are deep, numerous, and, often, lucrative. One in three international students in the United States is from China. A recent American Council on Education survey of colleges' global efforts found that China was far and away the top priority."Institutions have gone all in on China," says Kevin Kinser, head of education-policy studies at Pennsylvania State University and an expert in international education. He points to a number of colleges that have been reassessing their ties with Saudi Arabia in the wake of the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a journalist and dissident. But their partnerships with China are too broad and diffuse to be easily severed, he says."It's almost the classic example of too big to fail," Kinser says. "With China, the relationships are existential."Security and NaïvetéBut it will be equally hard for higher education not to get sucked into the showdown between Beijing and Washington, says Robert Daly, director of the Kissinger Institute on China and the United States at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. While the two countries disagree on much, both see innovation and knowledge as central to 21st-century power. "Universities," Daly says, "can't sit this one out."An initial target of the U.S. government has been Confucius Institutes, the language and cultural centers, funded by the Chinese government, on about 100 American campuses. Federal lawmakers have accused the centers of being hubs for espionage and propaganda arms of the Chinese government, and have pressed for them to register as foreign agents. A defense spending bill enacted last summer prohibited colleges with Confucius Institutes from using federal funds for Chinese-language training.In the past year, more than a half dozen universities have announced they will shutter their Confucius Institutes. One of the most recent, the University of Rhode Island, directly linked the decision to close to the potential loss of federal dollars.Not all of the closures, however, have been responses to pressure from public officials. The University of Michigan at Ann Arbor announced it would not renew its Confucius Institute in December, after months of deliberation. The reason was academic freedom, says Mary E. Gallagher, a professor of political science and director of the university's Center for China Studies. The structure of the institutes gives the Chinese government too much control over their programming, Gallagher says.A recent report from the Hoover Institution, written by some of the foremost China experts in the United States, also criticized the Confucius Institutes, calling for more transparency in the contracts establishing them and for adherence to American academic standards.Daly, who was part of the working group that wrote the report, says he expects more institutes to close. While they do fill gaps in language training on many campuses, administrators may decide they are not worth the headache, he says.Meanwhile, Christopher Wray, the FBI director, has said universities are susceptible to Chinese spying - and suggested that higher education is not doing enough about it."The level of naïveté on the part of the academic sector about this creates its own issues," Wray said during a congressional hearing last year. "They're exploiting the very open research and development environment that we have, which we all revere. But they're taking advantage of it."Sarah Spreitzer, director of government and public affairs at the American Council on Education, says college leaders are aware that U.S. intelligence officials have concerns. But in meetings the officials have not gone into specifics, making it difficult for universities to shore up particular vulnerabilities, she says.ACE and other higher-education organizations have called on Kirstjen M. Nielsen, the secretary of homeland security, to convene new meetings of the Homeland Security Academic Advisory Council, a group of college presidents and academic leaders set up during the Obama administration to offer advice on student-visa and other security-related issues. The council had fallen dormant but was re-established last year by Nielsen. It could provide a forum for higher-education and security officials to discuss such issues, Spreitzer says."We want to know how we can proactively address specific concerns without having broad policies mandating" colleges' action imposed by Congress or the Trump administration, she says.Educators are also worried that intelligence agencies' unfamiliarity with college and university operations and complex research could lead to overreach or mistakes, such as when federal prosecutors wrongly charged a Chinese-born Temple University professor with selling scientific secrets to China.But Daly suggests that some of the security officials' and lawmakers' discomfort stems not from Chinese students' and researchers' gaining access to research secrets - foreign nationals have long been prohibited from working on classified projects and other sensitive research - but rather from their acquiring information that could help advance Chinese national and economic interests. Higher education's fundamental openness is at odds with a worldview that sees China as a zero-sum competitor."They think, Why should American universities be training China's top minds in things like AI when they will then just compete with the U.S. globally?" Daly says. "After all, during the Cold War, we weren't training Soviet scientists in nuclear physics."Trump-administration officials could set rules that would bar Chinese students from certain fields deemed important to American interests, Daly says. That step could be disastrous for American universities. China is the largest source of doctoral students from abroad, many of whom are concentrated in critical scientific fields that attract few Americans. And, notes Daly, such a move would do little to prevent China from gaining the restricted knowledge, which is available by reading scientific journals or hiring graduates from other countries.Feuding GovernmentsStill, the threats to Sino-American higher-education partnerships aren't coming from just one side.Under President Xi Jinping, the Chinese government has increased oversight of its universities, mandating a more nationalist curriculum and cracking down on dissident scholars. Some professors who regularly work in China or with Chinese colleagues say they have noticed a more restrictive environment there, and monitoring of foreign researchers may have increased. China also is taking a harder look at overseas collaborations. Last summer the Ministry of Education ended 234, or one-fifth, of its international university partnerships, including more than 25 with American colleges.While the government cited academic standards and quality as the reason for the closures, there's no reason it couldn't shut down such partnerships for ideological reasons or as part of a diplomatic stand-off with the United States.Students, too, could get caught up in broader political disputes. Thus far, the restrictions - or their threat - have come from the American side. In May the Trump administration began limiting the duration of visas for Chinese students and researchers in certain sensitive fields, requiring them to reapply annually. It was later revealed that officials had considered, but ultimately shelved, a blanket ban on Chinese students in the United States.But China could also limit Americans' ability to study there, or restrict its students from going to the United States, a move that could be financially devastating to many colleges. Nafsa: Association of International Educators estimates that Chinese students contribute $12 billion annually to the American economy in tuition, living expenses, and spin-off jobs.There's already some precedent for such a move: After the University of California at San Diego invited the Dalai Lama to speak at commencement, in 2017, China retaliated by banning students and scholars with funding from the Chinese government's China Scholarship Council from attending the university."China can be heavy-handed, or it can find a more sophisticated way to discourage students and scholars from coming to America," says Philip G. Altbach, former director of the Center for International Higher Education at Boston College.In the end, though, the real, looming threat to student flows from China could be economic and personal. This week the tech giant Apple cited "the magnitude of the economic deterioration" in China as the reason for severely reducing its revenue projections.If Chinese families have less money to buy iPhones, they might struggle with an even more expensive purchase - American college degrees. The vast majority of Chinese students in the United States are enrolled in undergraduate or master's programs, for which they pay most costs, and sometimes all of them.For now, there is no sign of a fall-off. The number of Chinese students enrolled at American colleges increased last year, albeit more modestly than in years past.While their governments may be feuding, Chinese and American academics are continuing to collaborate. Indeed, Gallagher, the Michigan professor, says her university has seen an uptick in visits by Chinese delegations interested in setting up partnerships.If anything, the current moment argues for more working with - and more learning about - China, not less, Gallagher says. "It's absolutely critical Americans have some degree of knowledge about China, whether you think they're our next big friend or our next big enemy."Karin Fischer writes about international education, colleges and the economy, and other issues.

Senate Commerce Subcommittee Issues Testimony From Information Technology Industry CouncilTargeted News ServiceMarch 7, 2019 Thursday 7:00 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 3584 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation subcommittee on Security issued the following testimony by Josh Kallmer, executive vice president of policy at the Information Technology Industry Council, at a hearing entitled "China: Challenges for U.S. Commerce":"Members of the Committee, thank you for inviting me to testify today."The Information Technology Industry Council (ITI) represents 64 of the world's leading information and communications technology (ICT) companies. We are the global voice of the tech sector and the premier advocate and thought leader in the United States and around the world for the ICT industry. ITI's member companies are comprised of leading technology and innovation companies from all corners of the ICT sector, including hardware, software, digital services, semiconductor, network equipment, internet companies, and companies using technology to fundamentally evolve their businesses. Trade issues are critical to our members, and China is always a subject of much concern and interest."Today's hearing is particularly timely, as China, trade, and security issues garner significant attention from the administration and Congress. Media attention and the potential for conflating these issues make it even more important to clarify and address these complex subjects. China's blatant disregard for international norms governing free trade and market access has been well-established and must be addressed. China's role and impact on the global economy is as complex as it is important, however, and its relationship with the United States is by nature both competitive and cooperative."China has a well-established record of shifting the playing field in its favor - whether it is creating conditions for technology transfer through forced partnerships with Chinese companies; establishing ambiguous and intrusive security review regimes; or circumventing U.S. export controls laws, these unfair practices not only create an unfair economic advantage but may also, in some cases, pose a national security risk. Numerous policymakers have voiced concern regarding the security implications of China's practices. ITI members take security very seriously, including taking measures to ensure protection of their networks, customer data, IP, and threats to national security. ITI has demonstrated this commitment through our active engagement with policymakers on a number of issues, including the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS) and export controls reform, and we welcome the opportunity to work with policymakers on the issues before us today."While we must address China's problematic policies and practices, that is only half of the equation. The U.S. government must also rebalance its approach to strengthening the U.S. economy and the capacity for innovation in the United States. To that end, we encourage the U.S. government to invest in education and skills training and basic research and development, and to foster the growth of emerging technologies in the United States."Regardless of whether China plays by the rules or not, it will continue to improve in technological development, innovation, and growth. We are no longer in a situation in which China makes technological gains simply by virtue of stealing U.S. technology. Therefore, efforts to wall the U.S. off from competition with China will not solve the problem. The United States must be prepared to compete."In my testimony, I will outline some of the challenges that our companies face as well as what we can do about it, why the Chinese market is so important, and how we can ensure that the United States continues to foster an environment that gives the best and brightest individuals the necessary tools to develop tomorrow's most innovative technology.Key Problems Foreign Tech Companies Face from China"Our companies face real and persistent challenges in the Chinese market, including data localization requirements, cloud services restrictions, and intrusive and undefined security review regimes that may lead to exposure of source code and other intellectual property."Over the last decade, China has made a concerted effort not only to address legitimate cybersecurity and privacy concerns of Chinese citizens and companies but also to foster a protected space for domestic companies to gain an unfair market advantage. As the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) laid out in its comprehensive Section 301 investigation findings report, China has created a tapestry of laws, regulations, standards, and practices that collectively advantage Chinese companies and create conditions for direct and indirect tech transfer."Despite this clearly strategic approach to boost Chinese innovation and indigenous technology, the Chinese government is not a monolith. Infighting, discord, and pressure from Chinese leadership for agencies to issue regulations and demonstrate enforcement has added another layer of uncertainty and unpredictability to the Chinese market. Following passage of China's 2016 Cybersecurity Law, the tech sector has seen an unprecedented onslaught of implementing regulations, notices, measures, and standards drafted by numerous agencies within the Chinese bureaucracy, often contradicting one another. For example, the information technology standards body known as TC 260 released 110 standards for comment between November 2016 and December 2017 alone, followed by another 53 standards in 2018 - accounting for two-thirds of all standards that TC 260 has released for public comment. While these standards are often classified as voluntary, they may become de facto mandatory standards, making the short comment windows even more critical. These hastily enacted regulations also allow enforcement agencies to both interpret obligations unevenly and, potentially, target foreign companies.Broad and Ambiguous Security Review Regimes"While the Chinese government has for the most part been careful not to explicitly outline requirements for transfers of technology, source code, or other IP, the ambiguity and uncertainty surrounding China's numerous "security review regimes" create conditions ripe for coercion of companies to expose valuable intellectual property. For example, the Cybersecurity Law requires that companies subject themselves to intrusive security reviews for products and infrastructure to qualify as "secure and controllable." While the meaning of this term is ambiguous, the provision favors domestic companies and products as inherently more secure and is, in effect, a thinly-veiled attempt to encourage consumers to "buy domestic." Specifically, the Cross-Border Data Transfer Measures outline highly intrusive procedures, including background investigations of network suppliers and inspections of corporate offices.Implicit and Explicit Technology Transfer Requirements"Chinese requirements outlined in various laws and regulations - including those that require firms to locate production or facilities in China and establish a joint venture (JV) with a Chinese partner in order to operate in China - can put their valuable technology and other intellectual property at risk. Disclosure of sensitive information can be forced through a contract (e.g., JV, partnership), direct pressure from local or central governments, or governmental review or certification mechanisms. While there is nothing inherently wrong with voluntary JVs and partnerships, they become problematic when they are forced on foreign parties and when regulations stipulate either that the Chinese partner must maintain majority control of the JV or that only a Chinese company may obtain required product licenses.1"China has made its technology transfer objectives clear through its national strategy to promote indigenous innovation, Made in China 2025. The strategy explicitly promotes the transfer of technology as a means of advancing technological capability, competitiveness, and strategic emerging industries. Further, it outlines a wide-ranging effort to employ funding and the investment of significant government resources in support of key industries. While the Chinese government intended Made in China 2025 as a means of setting aspirational goals for a domestic audience, it has nonetheless fostered an environment that makes forced technology transfer more likely and may yield overcapacity in targeted sectors. These factors create real competitiveness risks for companies and can significantly distort market supply and demand.Restrictions on Foreign Cloud Service Providers"China's restrictions on U.S. cloud services providers (CSPs) exemplify the lack of fairness in the U.S.-China trade relationship. Foreign companies face written and unwritten requirements that do not allow foreign companies to obtain licenses to operate without a Chinese partner; force U.S. CSPs to surrender use of their brand names; and require companies to hand over operation and control of their businesses to Chinese companies in order to do business in the Chinese market. Chinese cloud services providers operating in the United States are subject to none of these restrictions."Data Localization Requirements Cross-border data flows are essential to digital trade. In 2016, over 53 percent of total U.S. service exports relied on cross-border data flows.2 Data flows are also important for purposes of network protection, as companies rely on real-time exchanges of information across borders to identify and "patch" vulnerabilities and receive timely system and software updates. Despite numerous efforts by the U.S. tech sector to explain that data localization does not enhance - and may diminish - data security, China continues to publish new and troubling laws, regulations, and standards that require the storage of data in China. For example, China's Cybersecurity Law and other regulations seriously harm many U.S. exporters by restricting cross-border data flows and requiring firms to store and process data in China. Draft regulations - including the Cross-Border Data Transfer Measures and the Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Regulation (both implementing regulations of the Cybersecurity Law) contain numerous provisions that would force companies to localize certain data in China and create undue and expensive impediments to transferring business information out of China in a timely manner.China's Standards Development"Chinese standards work and implementation of the 2017 revision of the Standardization Law presents a unique set of challenges, as China aims to codify the standards-development process in China."The Law includes problematic elements such as unclear public disclosure requirements that may reveal business-sensitive information. Implementing policies of the Law, such as the Pioneer Standards Program, incentivize public disclosure of standards that companies use in their products. Disclosure is not mandatory, yet companies that do not disclose standards will not be recognized as standards "pioneers," which may influence consumer purchasing preferences and also renders the product ineligible to compete for government procurement contracts."ITI supports industry-led, consensus-based international standards development, which fosters an environment in which standards are market-driven and only adopted if they benefit current technology and consumers. However, China and other nations have utilized "country-unique" standards as a policy tool to establish market access barriers and give domestic companies a competitive advantage. Given the size and influence of China's market, these national standards may influence regional trends and product development. China's exclusion or strict limitations on the participation of foreign companies in standards development bodies means that Chinese standards are developed in way that weakens interoperability and the global standards system. ITI urges Congress and the Administration to promote and strengthen the standards development process worldwide to ensure that development is fully consistent with international norms and the World Trade Organization (WTO)."China's reliance on a top-down model to promote its standards does not mean that the U.S. government should take a similar approach. While China may propose many more standards in international standards organizations, the market should ultimately choose the most appropriate standard for consumers and the current technology. Regardless of quantity, a robust industry-led international standards development process leads to adoption of the most appropriate standard. In this regard, there is no "first mover advantage" that would give China an advantage in the development of 5G or technologies related to AI. The best way to counter China's growing influence in international standards bodies is to work within and support the international standards system. The U.S. government can assist by promoting reliance on international standards and by investing in research and development, which will allow U.S.-based companies to continue to innovate and lead in the market."Why Do Companies Stay in the Chinese Market?"While the Chinese market presents clear risks and impediments for foreign companies, its size and impact on the global supply chain cannot be ignored. In 2018 alone, the U.S. exported nearly $21 billion worth of ICT goods to China3. China is the third largest market for U.S. services exports in Asia and accounts for nearly a quarter of the global consumer market. These customers operate not only in China but also globally - and they demand products and services that operate globally. If U.S. companies leave the Chinese market, they effectively forfeit much more than the Chinese market to Chinese companies. Customers - particularly those that depend on enterprise services such as cloud computing - will seek companies that provide services in all markets in which they operate."From both an economic and technological advantage perspective, it is not in the interest of U.S. companies, consumers, or the government to cede market share to Chinese companies. Put simply, if companies want to compete for global consumers and continue to be at the forefront of emerging technology development they must compete with Chinese companies in China and abroad.What the U.S. Government Can Do"ITI appreciates that the U.S. government recognizes China has instituted problematic tech policies and practices and that the administration has taken steps to address it, including USTR's Section 301 investigation and subsequent report. We routinely hear from policymakers regarding both economic and security concerns related to China, including current and future American economic competitiveness. The tools that the U.S. government uses to address these issues, however, must be tailored and strategic to avoid causing unnecessary harm to U.S. competitiveness and innovation - which are key to the Uniteds States' economic and national security. I'd like to outline a few basic tenets below.Assess Potential Security Problems from Both a Private and Public Sector Perspective"ITI respects and acknowledges national security concerns. We advocate for and work with policymakers to develop thoughtful and tailored policy approaches that consider: the problem or threat from both a public sector and private sector perspective; whether and to what extent a threat can be mitigated; and how to limit adverse or unintended effects on companies' ability to operate, compete, and innovate. It is important to recognize that the public sector often has information and political insights that the private sector does not and vice versa. While the U.S. government has visibility into many security threats, it relies on the private sector to tell it what is happening on its networks and the steps that should be taken to mitigate risks."While policymakers are rightly concerned about safeguarding American companies' innovations in emerging technology fields such as artificial intelligence (AI) and 5G, it is important to ensure that such safeguards do not hamstring companies' ability to develop the very technologies that the U.S. government values for purposes of economic growth and national security. The tech sector can help in this assessment of future impacts."The consequences of security policy to tech companies will have significant ripple effects. ITI encourages Congress and the administration to engage with the private sector on these important issues and work together to develop a strategic and coordinated approach to the potential threats and challenges posed by China and others.Compete with China and Invest in America's Future"Preventing China from stealing technology alone will not help us achieve our goals. The U.S. government must invest in America's future. This means investing in research and development, education, science and technology, artificial intelligence (AI), and digital infrastructure. Strengthening the business environment, the nation's human resources, and incentivizing innovation are all key to generating sustainable economic prosperity."If the U.S. is to preserve its technological edge, it must be prepared to step up and compete with China. Regardless of whether China plays by the rules or not, Chinese inventors, entrepreneurs, and businesses will continue innovating and will close the technological gap between the U.S. and China. While a level playing field is of course important, it is vital that the U.S. government continue to commit to serious investments in technology to ensure American competitiveness and economic growth. China is making a concerted, strategic effort to invest and plan for its economic and technological future. The clock is running out for the U.S. government to take action. Where the private sector in the U.S. is making significant progress in advancing the next generation of technologies and investing heavily in cutting-edge research, the U.S. government can and should do more to support innovation."With the world's largest and increasingly educated population, China had 4.7 million STEM graduates in 2016. To put that in perspective, that means half of China's nearly 8 million graduates are focusing on STEM, while in the U.S. less than a third - roughly 568,000 of America's 2 million graduates - major in STEM. The U.S. has invested less and less in R&#38;D spending, where in 2016 R&#38;D constituted about 2.7 percent of GDP.4 China is catching up quickly with an expenditure of 2 percent of its GDP going to R&#38;D.5 In 2017, China accounted for 48 percent of the total global investment in artificial intelligence startup funding, while the U.S. accounted for 38 percent. In monetary terms, China invested $7.3 billion in artificial intelligence while the U.S. invested $5.77 billion."China is also on track to outpace the United States in other areas. For example, according to a 2018 International Data Corporation report, the U.S. will spend $22 billion on smart city development this year. China is close behind with projected spending at $21 billion. As of 2015, there were 1,000 smart city pilot plans in the works worldwide, 500 of which were located in China. While 66 percent of US cities are adopting smart city technologies, China's test bed for smart cities is the largest in the world."These are just a few examples. The bottom line is that the United States is failing itself by not seriously investing in our country's technological and economic future.Conclusion"China poses serious challenges to the tech sector. We must address these challenges aggressively yet strategically and with an eye to future ramifications for the economy and technological competitiveness. We also can neither ignore nor deny the significant role China plays in the global economy as a key piece of the global supply chain, supplier of products and components, an innovative competitor, and a vital market for U.S. goods and services, and it would be a disservice to downplay the need to invest in U.S. companies' ability to compete with an increasingly innovative and technologically advanced China. With the right approach, we can address these serious challenges in a way that benefits the United States' economic and national security."On behalf of all ITI members, I thank you for having me before the Committee today and commend you for your interest in examining the various challenges that China poses to the tech sector. We stand ready to work with you to address these challenges. I look forward to answering your questions."* * *Footnotes:1 See Law of the People's Republic of China on Chinese-Foreign Joint Ventures; Provisions on Administration of Foreign-Invested Telecommunications Enterprises; The People's Republic of China Foreign Investment Catalogue 20172 "Cross-Border Data Flows, the Internet and What is Means for U.S. and EU Trade and Investment" (Brookings, https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2014/10/21/cross-border-data-flows-the-internet-and-what-it-means-for-u-s-and-eu-trade-and-investment/).3 "U.S. GDP was $20.89 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2018" (Bureau of Economic Analysis,            https://www.bea.gov/news/2019/initial-gross-domestic-product-4th-quarter-and-annual-2018).4 "How much does your country invest in R&#38;D" (UNESCO Institute for Statistics, http://uis.unesco.org/apps/visualisations/research-and-development-spending/).5 Ibid.[TheHill]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6638934 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: March 8, 2019End of Document

House Homeland Security Subcommittees Issues Testimony From Center for Strategic &#38; International StudiesTargeted News ServiceFebruary 26, 2019 Tuesday 7:01 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2914 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe House Homeland Security subcommittee on Transportation and Maritime Security, and the subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Protection and Innovation issued the following testimony by James A. Lewis, senior vice president and the director of the Technology and Public Policy Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, at a joint hearing entitled "Securing U.S. Surface Transportation from Cyber Attacks":"I would like to thank the Committee for the opportunity to testify. My testimony will discuss the risks to homeland security from the use of Chinese technology and equipment."Chinese companies face a serious branding problem in many countries. There is a level of distrust that has been created in good measure by Chinese government policies. The most prominent of these policies are China's aggressive mercantilism, its disregard for international law, its massive espionage campaign and, for the U.S., its announced intention to displace America and become the most powerful country in the world, reshaping international rules and practices to better fit the interest of China's rulers."Espionage has been a part of the of the Sino-American relationship since China's opening to the West in 1979. It is worth remembering that at this time, the U.S. and China shared a common enemy - the Soviet Union. This created incentives for cooperation that have long vanished. Chinese espionage initially focused on repairing the disastrous effects of Maoists policies on China's economic and political development. This meant the illicit or coercive acquisition of western technology. As China's cyber capabilities improved, beginning in the late 1990s, some PLA units turned to hacking as a way to supplement their incomes, moonlighting by stealing western intellectual property and then selling it to Chinese companies."The illicit acquisition of technology is still a hallmark of Chinese espionage activity, but there have been significant changes since President Xi Jinping came to power in 2013. One of the first things Xi did, reportedly, is order an inventory of Chinese cyber espionage activities. He found that many of these had not been ordered by Beijing, that Beijing did not have full control over tasking and assets, and some operations were for private interest and did not meet China's strategic requirements."Xi changed this. The Chinese military has been reorganized as part of a larger effort to modernize the PLA. Xi's anti-corruption campaign greatly reduced the ability of PLA units to "moonlight." Chinese intelligence collection is better organized, more focused on strategic priorities, and, some would say, better in performing its missions. This comes at a time when, according to the U.S. intelligence community, Chinese espionage has reached unprecedent levels. Today, these efforts focus on the acquisition of advanced military and commercial technologies, since China still lags the U.S. in technology, as well as military and government targets."The U.S. and China reached an agreement in 2015 to end commercial cyber espionage, but it is generally believed that this agreement has broken down in the last year. At the risk of sounding overly dramatic, some would describe this situation as an undeclared espionage war between China and the U.S. In fact, this is not a war, but a very intense contest where the U.S. is largely on the defensive. Our allies also face a similar problem with Chinese efforts in Australia, Japan, Germany, the UK, Canada, and other advanced economies."These activities create distrust, and a more specific ground for distrust is China's 2017 National Intelligence Law. For some years, the U.S. had advised China to move away from an informal, ad hoc system of rules and put in place a formal legal structure based on laws. The Chinese took our advice and one result is that long-standing Chinese policies and practices have been codified into the 2017 Intelligence Law. The most important part of that law for today's hearing is that it creates a legal obligation for Chinese companies to cooperate fully with intelligence agencies upon request. There are no grounds for appeal or an ability to refuse such requests."This means that a Chinese company could be completely innocent of any wrongdoing, its products harmless, but a decision by the Chinese government could change that in an instant. In the context of an increasingly aggressive global espionage campaign, often conducted using cyber techniques, there are reasonable grounds for the distrust of Chinese products. The first question to ask is not whether you trust a Chinese company, but whether you trust the Chinese government."Concerns over the Intelligence Law have become so significant, in part because of the implications of using Huawei telecommunications equipment, that China's official news agency felt obliged last week to put out a press release calling for a comprehensive and accurate translation. China's Foreign Ministry pointed out that while Article 7 of the law stipulates the obligation for Chinese companies and individuals to "support, assist and cooperate" with the country's intelligence service, Article 8 stipulates that China's intelligence service should carry out its work according to law, protect human rights, and safeguard the legal rights and interests of individuals and organizations. Unfortunately, this promise is undercut by China's recent behavior in regard to human rights and in the protection (better expressed as the absence of protections) for the intellectual property of foreign companies."We should note that China's government expresses similar concerns over their reliance on western technology, in part because they assume the relationship between western companies and government is the same as the relationship between Chinese companies and the government. This official distrust of western products is one reason why Beijing is spending billions of dollars to develop national sources of supply for many technologies. These subsidies also provide commercial benefit, in building national champions in Chinese industry and in eroding western companies' market position."China also leads the world in building a national system of pervasive domestic surveillance. Communications and social media are monitored, and an array of sensors monitor and record activities in urban areas. This sensor data is correlated with information held by the government on Chinese residents' behavior and communications. This pervasive surveillance is not popular among many Chinese, but it is increasingly difficult to escape. One concern is that China will to some degree extend this pervasive surveillance to countries and persons of interest outside of China, or extend its extensive cyber espionage campaign to include coercive actions, like disrupting critical services. This is not something China would do lightly, but the risk cannot be dismissed"The combination of increased espionage, new legal obligations, pervasive surveillance, and heightened military tensions make for an uncomfortable and potentially dangerous situation, with implications for U.S. security. The U.S. and China share a deeply integrated industrial base, constructed during the time when we assumed that China was moving in the direction of becoming a market economy and a security partner. Disentangling this deeply integrated supply chain would be costly and damaging to both countries, but some in America now talk about a "divorce" while China is spending heavily to reduce its reliance on the U.S."Beyond the espionage risk, there is potential risk for critical infrastructure that is growing. As more devices become connected to the internet and reliant on software, the opportunities for disruption will grow. This is not specifically a China problem, but a change in the technological environment as millions of devices connect to the internet in ways that China (or other malicious actors) could exploit for coercive purposes."As the Committee has heard for many years, the state of cybersecurity remains poor and almost any network or device can be hacked with enough persistence. Cybercrime continues to grow, and cyber tools have become an essential part of state conflict. If it is any consolation, China's cybersecurity is worse than ours, if only because of their frequent use of pirated software. Improving cybersecurity should be a potential area for cooperation between the two countries, but the current state of relations does not permit that."An environment of connected devices, often called the internet of things, is formed by devices that connect to the global internet, usually without human intervention. We all have heard of smart cars but many large systems in infrastructure and transportation also rely on computers and connectivity. This environment will provide real economic opportunities and benefit, but it also comes with an increase in risk. Our task should be to estimate this risk and then develop strategies to mitigate it. Different technologies and different companies create different levels of risk, and there are several ways to assess this."One way to scope risk is to ask how a device connects to the internet, what onboard sensors it has, what information it collects and transmits, and how much transparency, insight, and control an operator has over this data and connection. Many large capital goods - such as power technologies, pipelines, telecommunications and ships, are continuously connected over the internet to their manufacturer, to allow for status reports, maintenance scheduling, and for the updating of software. This continuous connection provides an opportunity to collect information and to disrupt services. Instead of an update, a command could be sent to turn off, or to reduce speed."We have seen several example of Chinese devices that report home, from drones to surveillance cameras, with the concern that under the new intelligence law, the Chinese government could compel the provision of the data collected by these technologies. This kind of monitoring and collection has been a standard practice for intelligence agencies that will certainly extend to the internet of things, and the risks of connected devices is compounded when their home is in a hostile foreign power."We could scope risk by measuring the cybersecurity status of connected devices. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is developing, in partnership with industry, standards for the security of IOT devices. But this is still at a relatively early stage. In general, the internet of things will be no more secure than the existing internet and may be more vulnerable, since many IoT devices will use simple computers with limited functionality."We can also assess risk by using three metrics - the value of the data accessible through or collected by the IOT device, the criticality of a function the connected device provides, and scalability of failure. Devices that create or collect valuable data, perform crucial functions, or that can produce mass effect, need to be held to higher standards and face greater scrutiny."For critical infrastructure, we need to ask the same questions about using Chinese products that we would ask for any critical infrastructure protection policy: how sensitive are the operations and the data associated with or accessible through the infrastructure, what would happen if the infrastructure was disrupted by an opponent, how would we continue to operate and then recover in the event of a malicious incident, and for foreign products, and to what degree is control or access shared with the foreign manufacturer."The type of data collected and transmitted is a crucial element of a risk assessment. Intelligence analysis data is driven by access to large amounts of data and the ability to correlate it with other data. Data analytics provides new intelligence insights. A well-known example is the hack attributed to China of the Office of Personnel Management and the theft of personal information. It is likely that OPM was one of a series of related hacks, of insurance companies, airlines and travel agencies, that provided additional data that could be used to gain insight into America personnel and practices. This means that even seemingly insignificant data, if correlated with other information, may provide influence value. The more "granular" the data, and whether it refers to specific individuals, the greater its value. Less granular data, such as how many people are sitting on a train or at which stop they exit, may not pose much risk."Managing our new competition with China will be difficult given the close interconnection between the U.S. and Chinese economies. This is a 30-year commercial and technological partnership not easily dismantled by either side. Given the deep interconnections that have grown between the Chinese economy and the rest of the world, a bifurcation similar to that seen during the Cold War is not possible, and it is not now in our interest. A greater degree of separation between the two economies is necessary, but must be carefully developed for specific technologies and based on a judgment on the risk that their use could provide China with an intelligence, military or unfair commercial advantage."These risks are manageable, and we have to contrast them to the risk to the America economy from a violent disruption of trade with China. Generally speaking, a complete divorce is not in our interest; and it is certainly not in China's interest. There are specific technologies and circumstances that require greater scrutiny and countermeasures, but this does not apply across the board (at least at this time). Working with our allies, we can modify China's behavior to make this relationship more stable and less risky. We have done so in the past, but this will be a process that will take years to complete, and in the interim, there are steps we must take to reduce the risk of Chinese interference and espionage."The most obvious is continued work to improve network and device security. This will require some measure of regulatory action and close partnership with the affected industries and operators. One size does not fit all when it comes to regulation, so the potential risk of IOT and Chinese technology must be managed using the sector-specific model developed in the previous administration, and partnerships between companies, agencies with oversight, and DHS's new Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) should be the core of this effort."The development of security standards is a necessary complement to any regulation or voluntary action. The NIST Cybersecurity Framework is a good starting point for this, but must be extended and modified for different kinds of transportation systems. CISA's Transportation Systems Sector Cybersecurity Framework Implementation Guide, published in June 2015, provides guidance to owners and operators on how to assess and implement cybersecurity standards."All of these measures -voluntary action, regulation and standards - must be predicated on the knowledge that we cannot keep opponents out of our networks and devices - we can make it harder for them but not impossible. This means that measures to increase resiliency, to allow for some level of continued operation in degraded conditions is essential. This adds expense to critical infrastructure, of course, and one part of any plan is to ask how this additional burden will be funded and whether the increase in risk is outweighed by the potential savings - we should not automatically assume that the mere existence of risk cancels out financial benefits."All of these steps require oversight to assess risk and improvement. This is clearly a task for Congress and this Committee, but also for the responsible agencies, industry bodies, and in particular for CISA. The key question for assessment is whether the use of the Chinese technology increases the risk of disruption or espionage, and the answer to this will depend in good measure on how the Chinese products connect to the internet."Finally, a purely defensive approach will be inadequate. The U.S needs to develop and articulate credible counterthreats to dissuade and deter foreign attackers. This may require more than sanctions and indictments. Although they are useful and have effect over the long term, they may need to be reinforced other punitive measures, part of a larger strategy on how to impose consequences and change opponent thinking. Given the level of vulnerability and the potential increase in risk from both the acquisition of foreign technology and the digitizing of critical services, we must persuade opponents that any interference will come with unacceptable risk or retaliation by the U.S."There are trade issues that I have not touched upon, such as the Chinese practice of building national champions through government subsidies and, in some cases, industrial espionage. China also uses non-tariff barriers and other protectionist mechanism to hobble or block competition from foreign firms in China. These Chinese practices harm our national interests and should be opposed as part of a larger effort to change China's behavior and move it in the direction of reciprocity."I thank the Committees for the opportunity to testify and look forward to any questions."[TheHill]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6625455 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: February 27, 2019End of Document

The Newest Family DifferencesNews Release WireMarch 24, 2019 Sunday Copyright 2019 Broadcast Interview Source, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 2504 wordsBodyI picked up my parents at LAX the day after New Year's. Itd been five years since theyd visited.'California looks the same,." my father commented as we drove the 405.'There are changes if you look carefully,." I replied. 'But its nothing compared to China.."I knew what my father was talking about.I have a two-bedroom condo at the Suzhou Industrial Park in China. The last time I visited, a new shopping mall had suddenly appeared on the other side of the street. It definitely hadnt been there during my last trip there a year ago.The Chinese can build a 650,000 square foot complexin as much time as Americans take to fashion a lean-to.My father first came to North America in 2008. He was impressed with Vancouvers natural beauty, clean air, and the ease with which people conducted their lives. He visited California five years ago in 2013. He was especially impressed with the designs of roadside storm drains. Back in China, his city was paralyzed nearly every time it rained. The countrys urban areas had expanded much faster than its infrastructure could handle. Abandoned cars would float down the street as commuters trudged through knee-deep water. Here in California, city planners had time to think ahead. 'Look at that!." he said excitedly. 'It hardly rains here, but you have drains that big just in case it happens. Amazing.."This time around, my father seemed unimpressed with the American speed of development. LAX had just been renovated but failed to impress him. The landscape along the 405 had stayed the same and the house I lived in had apparently aged. Nothing was acceptable if it hadnt undergone a complete overhaul. Even though California offered all the natural beauty, clean air, and road drainage he could ever want, he felt the Chinese had some lessons to teach the Americans. 'Development is an unyielding principle,." he repeated, quoting a policy proposed by Deng Xiaoping.A couple days after his arrival, we discussed the Huawei incident over dinner. The CFO of Huawei had been arrested in Canada on behalf of the US for Iran fraud. I forget who brought it up, but I remember that our differences were summed up neatly in only a couple of sentences.'The US is only doing this to suppress Chinese development,." my father complained. 'What fraud?."'I dont blame the US,." I said. 'If you want to do business with the US, you have to follow their rules.."'Those rules were made up by Americans and are completely arbitrary. Just because you dont do business with Iran, no one else is allowed to?."I explained that everyone has the right to sell their own products, but Huawei bought stuff from the US and sold it to Iran, circumventing a trade embargo. That was where the fraud accusations were coming from.My father was surprised. Hed never heard the details about the charges. He only read state-approved newspapers and watched state-approved TV. He gave it some thought and conceded that Huawei had made a mistake, but he insisted the US was overreacting. He still believed the real purpose of the charges was to hamper Huaweis ability to compete, and I didnt completely disagree.'The US brags about their free market, but its a lie,." my father claimed. 'Theyre using state power to target a Chinese company. Its not fair.."I pointed out that it was China that didnt play fair in the first place. The Chinese government is pouring resources into companies like Huawei that fit into Chinas 'Made in China 2025." strategy. The plan was issued in 2015, and is aimed at elevating China from being known as a producer of cheap goods to being known as a manufacturer of high-end products.My father denied that Huawei had received assistance from the Chinese government. He admired Ren Zhengfei, the founder of Huawei, and praised his spirit of adventure, his business acumen, and his hardworking nature. I didnt deny Ren had those qualities, but in my opinion he was also connected with the Zhao family.In recent years, Chinese people have used the term 'Zhao family." to refer to those who thrive as a result of Chinas crony capitalism. The phrase first appeared in Lu Xuns novella 'The True Story of Ah Q.." Ah Q is from a poor rural family and wants to curry favor with those in power, who sadly despise him. Ah Qs surname is Zhao, but when he congratulates the powerful Zhao familys son on passing the imperial examination, the Zhao patriarch slaps him and rebukes: 'Do you really think youre worthy of the name Zhao?."My father vehemently denied Ren had anything to do with the Zhao family. He was like a crazed fan whod heard their idol insulted, which I found funny. There are two types of success stories in China: One requires a person to be responsible, hardworking, imaginative and courageous. The other bears more Chinese characteristics and requires aligning yourself with the interests of the Zhao family.Rens story clearly was the latter. My father asked what proof I had, but all I had was common sense. Suppose you were Ren Zhengfei. Would you really risk your chance to do business in the US by violating US law? How much money would you make in Iran to make up for what you were losing in the US? Its clear that Huaweis violation of US sanctions was not made for the sake of business, but had something to do with the Partys diplomatic strategy. If Ren Zhengfei wasnt a member of the Zhao family, he had to be following orders.'So what?." my father tilted his head condescendingly. 'Whats wrong with listening to his government?."Following government orders even once raised red flags for me.One of the reasons I left China was the Partys increasingly tight grip on Chinas internet. Huawei is competing to introduce 5G technology to the US market. I wouldnt want my cyber life here controlled by a company under the thumb of an authoritarian regime.'Whatever,." my father smirked. 'Its too late. Huawei holds tons of 5G technology patents. If the Americans dont pay to use Huaweis patents, theyll never have 5G at all.."'But Huawei stole American intellectual property. What do you have to say about that?." I read him a Bloomberg article about Huawei stealing secrets from a glass manufacturer.'Huawei did the right thing! Otherwise, how will China ever surpass the US? China should lead at all costs.."I was surprised that my father went that far to defend outright theft. Why would he align himself with an authoritarian regime? Hes not even remotely affiliated to the Zhao family.In my opinion, the average Chinese citizen should stand against the one-party system, but my father's case proved otherwise. He was anxious that Huaweis takeover of the US 5G markets would fall through. He hated it when the US stood in the way of Chinese ambitions.I wondered how my father stood to benefit if China controlled the world. It was clear that any economic and political advantages would go to the Zhao family. But if China stopped its crazy expansion, average citizen like my father was clearly headed for disaster.My parents own their homes and live on pensions. Theyre not rich, but comfortable. Compared to the 1970s, their living conditions have vastly improved. Believe it or not, theyre grateful for the Party. Since they'd worked for the State - there weren't private sector around when they entered the workforce, their pension is paid by the state. As long as Chinas development keeps up and trade surplus continues, the nations affordability could be sustainable and the value of their house could keep rising. But after 40 years of rapid development, where does Chinas go next?Thats why my father unwaveringly praised Chinas development. For China, its not a matter of development vs. stagnation, but a matter of continued expansion vs. complete collapse. One-party rule brought about an economic boom driven by corruption, and my parents were well aware of that fact. But that corruption had become so deeply rooted intosociety that it was impossible to picture China without it.Thus, chasm grew between me and my parents. It can be described as the chasm between the Chinese living outside China and the Chinese at home. For me, a middle-aged Chinese writer living in North America, I am pleased to see the US government trying to force structural change in China, because I want my books to be published in my birth country instead of being banned, and I want China to become a trustworthy country that when my children grow up they can to be trusted in the workplace instead of being suspected of stealing secrets based on their ethnicity.But for the Chinese at home, especially for my parents' generation, I'm not sure if the proposed structural changes would disrupt Chinas current economic and social order. Even though I'm confident that the changes would be good for China in the long run, whats the point of discussing a future my parents' generation might not even see?About: A Personal Account of the Tiananmen Square Massacre and the China That Caused It A powerful, honest and unique perspective of the cry for human rights, a fair economy, and freedom. Irvine, CA-- Immigrant and survivor Anna Wang offers a unique glimpse into the Tiananmen square incident and the China surrounding it in her powerful new book Inconvenient Memories: A Personal Account of the Tiananmen Square Incident and the China Before and After. From her childhood account of living in an oppressed government system, to the activities during her college-age years that led to the protests in the Square and beyond, Wangs revealing personal account is both gripping and terrifying. Its a story that will never be allowed to be told in her home country. 'When the protests started, I was sent to the square on a daily basis to take photos for my Japanese boss to analyze for evidence of turning tides in the economy,' says Wang, who worked for Canon. 'Thats why after almost thirty years I can still recall the details graphically.' 'A deeply intimate and revealing portrait of real life inside China before and after the climactic Tiananmen Square Incident. Writer Anna Wang confronts her own country's history with eyes wide open. Breathtaking!" John J. Kelly Detroit Free Press Wang, a writer at heart, yearned for her voice to be heard, and was, at first, excited by the student protests at her university. But she was trapped in a world where it was dangerous to speak your mind, and the China government controlled everything. 'The totalitarian society we lived in...the powers supposedly guiding us toward utopia denied us every individual freedom: of speech, of press, of the right to gather...all the way down to our sexual lives.' Despite that, she bravely changed her major in college unheard of that that time and pursued a career in literature until she found a bit of freedom and financial independence with an international business. Suddenly she looked at the protests with mixed feelings. 'I felt sympathy for the students fight for democracy and freedom, but when I crossed the Tiananmen Square, hearing them sing 'The Internationale will be the human race,' I became wary of them. What if the students succeeded and they took everything I owned and would own in the future? As the very few who worked for foreign enterprises at the time, I cared about the market economy, private property, and anything like that.' Then the massacre occurred and Wang lived through the terrifying time when tanks were in the streets and people were dying. 'I realized my life would be worth hundreds and thousands of words,' says Wang. 'We need to establish that Chinese people are not the same entity as Chinas fascist regime. We need to fight for China to become a country that accepts universal human values. Telling my truth of what happened 30 years ago is part a of this effort.' 'Not only is this book extraordinarily entertaining and well written, it is likely to become a significant source of Chinas history and development as personally witnessed by an insightful participant. Highly Recommended on many levels.' Grady Harp Amazon Top 50 Hall of Fame Reviewer After the massacre, torn between her love for the country of her birth and wanting to live in a place with better human rights, Wang moved to New Zealand to have a second child, then to Canada and America. Despite Chinas now thriving economy, she doubts democracy will ever reach China. 'After the Tiananmen Massacre, no one had the guts to protest anymore. Pressure groups will never emerge.' Wang writes with a personal voice, bringing you into the crowded apartment that houses her and her grandmother, a fearful woman. As a child her grandma had her feet freed halfway through Chinas brutal tradition of foot binding and as a result was partially crippled. 'A remarkable and intense memoir! Wang also raises the question if citizenship in counties such as Canada and the USA further immigrants feeling of belonging to the host nation or will there always be a deep yearning for their motherland?' Norm Goldman Publisher & Editor Wangs story of the massacre stands out from others because of her station in life, and her freedom to write what she knows from a democratic country. 'Living in China as an emerging middle class during the protests gives me a unique perspective,' she says. 'One I havent seen in previous accounts. The Tiananmen Massacre wasn't quite as simple as good vs. evil, democracy vs. dictatorship. It wasnt just about the people standing up to an inhumane regime. The lines that divided the two sides were blurrier than most could or would have even known.' About Anna Wang: Anna Wang was born in China in 1966 just after the 'cultural revolution.' She was raised in Beijing by her grandmother, a woman whose feet had been crippled in the brutal Chinese tradition of foot binding. Wang loved to read novels, which were forbidden in her home, and would sneak them whenever she could. Growing up with a love for stories and literature, she was 'selected' by the Chinese government to study engineering, a career she detested. It wasnt until later in her adult years that she took pen to paper and started publishing her work. She is the author of nine books in Chinese and one in English. Having lived through the Tiananmen Square massacre, Wang desired to tell her story to the world, hoping to answer questions and quiet the nightmares in her own mind as she wrote. When she was pregnant with her second child, she and her husband immigrated to New Zealand, then eventually America and Canada. She lives in Irvine, CA with her husband and two children. She is currently at work on her next novel, a historical fiction story set in China.

Beijing: in the Framework of the 'New Silk Roads' Signed With Artron, Artprice Has Revealed Its New Chinese Brand Specially Adapted to the Chinese Art MarketPR NewswireMarch 26, 2019 Tuesday 8:01 PM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1919 wordsDateline: PARIS, March 26, 2019 BodyPR NewswireAs previously indicated in our March 18 press release (see link below), Artprice has today revealed the Chinese brand name it will use in Artron's launch of its official spring campaign with a new baseline in Chinese.The name is: .[ Follow the link to read the Chinese name:https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2019/03/artprice-chinese-brand.png]Decided after much discussion with art market professionals in China, this name evokes Chinese confidence in art and the "Dao of Art"... i.e. the path of wisdom to which knowledge of the Art Market leads.The Chinese baseline says "Master the Global Art Market".[ Follow the link to read the Chinese baseline:https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2019/03/artprice-maitriser-le-marche-mondial.png]As thierry Ehrmann says, "by becoming a Chinese brand for China taking into account the specific tastes of Chinese art lovers, collectors and professionals Artprice is blending into the history and daily life of China's thousand-year-old culture, thereby boosting its notoriety and its sales turnover more quickly".At the end of this March, this new initiative will allow Artprice to achieve optimal exposure in China's colossal domestic market and to capture its economic potential with a 'permeability' that relates to China's multi-millennial history of art. Again, as Mr Ehrmann puts it "in order to conquer China you have to immerse yourself in a culture that goes back 4,000 year, and you have to approach the country with both humility and constance.In collaboration with Artprice, Artron has strengthened Artprices's road-map by the creation and implementation of a payment structure in order to comply with the new Directives from the Chinese government announced in February 2019. The strategic moves prompted by these Directives have slightly postponed Artprice's initial targets, which otherwise remain unchanged (See Press Release of 18 March 2019).Artprice's strategy is therefore part of the framework for trade and partnerships defined during President Xi Jinping's visit to France and largely commented in Emmanuel Macron's speech on 25 March 2019 marking the 55th anniversary of China's diplomatic relations with France.In his editorial for the 21st Global Art Market Annual Report co-published by Artprice and Artron last week, Mr Wan Jie, Chairman of Artron Group, Artprice's Chinese Institutional partner, stated: "This growth (of the art market) over time, like that of Artron's partnership with Artprice, will continue to accelerate as we integrate our resources, optimize our data, upgrade our Internet technology and diversify our business cooperation models. The result will be a New Silk Road connecting the different art worlds and the markets of the East and the West."We are therefore talking about a 'New Silk Road for the Art Market' in the framework of China's "One Belt, One Road"(OBOR) or "Belt and Road Initiative" (BRI) as presented by President Xi Jinping this week in France.Artprice is now accredited by the Chinese authorities as a major player alongside Artron in the project to construct an Art Market SiIk Road, thereby confirming at the highest level the agreements reached during the official visit of Artprice's management to Beijing in November 2018.The Belt and Road Initiative covers approximately 65 countries in Asia and Europe, for a total estimated cost of 55% of global GDP. It involves 70% of the global population 4.4 billion people and 75% of the world's energy reserves, with the total estimated investment period spanning 30 to 35 years for all the projects to be completed.The estimated value of the initial projects is around 900 billion dollars and China is apparently considering making loans for the completion of future infrastructures in the different countries along the new Silk Road that could amount to 8 trillion dollars.Moreover, as the country's population gets richer a phenomenon that is progressing at an astonishing pace China's Art Market is expected to enjoy phenomenal growth. By 2020, Asia should account for roughly 70% of the global Art Market.According to a study published by Bain & Company on 20 March 2019, China alone consumed 33% of the world's Luxury Goods in 2018. As the Art Market has very strong correlations with the Luxury Goods market, this figure corroborates Artprice's and Artron's forecasts for China's Art Market. In fact, according to the same study, China's consumption of Luxury Goods is already greater than that of Europe and the USA combined.To build stronger institutional relations with China, Artprice has become a member of the New Franco-Chinese Institute of Lyons because the French city is one of the historical final destinations of Silk Roads since the Renaissance.Lyons is in fact the most visited French city by Chinese leaders.Created at the initiative of the City of Lyons, the Lyons Chamber of Commerce and the ADERLY, the New Franco-Chinese Institute of Lyons has already brought together many institutional and private partners like Groupe SEB, Institut Mrieux, Huawei, Sanofi, EDF, Bank of China and Veolia. It defines itself, among other things, as a networking facilitator for contacts at the highest levels in France and China for over 80 years.The Institute's mission is the international promotion of France and of the economic attractiveness of the Lyons region by advertising the economic advantages of Lyons in China and encouraging Chinese investment in the Rhne-Alpes region.Moreover, after launching, in 2013, the project for an "Economic corridor traversing countries crossed by the old Silk Road", in 2014, President Xi Jinping made an official visit to the New Franco-Chinese Institute of Lyons in the framework of the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations with France.Indeed, the New Franco-Chinese Institute of Lyons was revived precisely in this context, and it intends with its historical connections (since 1921) to give new impetus to the future of relations between Lyons and China.On 25 March 2019, the New Franco-Chinese Institute of Lyons was the subject of a long article in the Figaro. Apparently China's President Xi Jinping is at the origin of the initiative to revive the New Franco-Chinese Institute of Lyons because a large section of China's historical elite has been educated in Lyon since 1921. No other place in Europe can boast this kind of historical link to the Middle Kingdom.To boost its visibility in China, Artprice will be present (for the first time ever) at Asia's largest Contemporary Art fair... the 7th edition of Art Basel Hong Kong. Alongside Artron, the two groups will occupy a prestigious stand and will promote their exclusive Decision Support Tools. Likewise, Artprice will also be present with Artron at Art Beijing from 26 to 29 April 2019.Lastly, Artprice's Facebook page has just reached 4 million followers worldwide. This represents an exceptional success on the world's leading social network, with a growing level of uptake at each publication, thereby spreading Artprice's databanks and services to new potential clients all over the world.On 30 June 2017, Artprice informed its AGM that it had 345,000 followers worldwide and it promised to reach 1 million by end-2018. That promise has now been largely superseded with an additional 3,655,000 followers, equivalent to a 1,061% increase in less than two years.With its unequalled audience on social media, Artprice is now giving Artron Western exposure just as Artron, at the beginning of April, will open its numerous networks with several tens of millions of members for Artprice (with its new Chinese name) including notably WeChat, but alsoTencent, QQ, Sina Weibo, Baidu and Tieba, among others.March 18 press release:https://www.actusnews.com/fr/ARTPRICE/cp/2019/03/18/artprice-and-artron-are-adapting-their-2019-strategy-to-the-art-market-dimension-of-china_s-belt-and-road-initiative-bri-thatCopyright 2019 thierry Ehrmannhttp://www.artprice.comTry our services (free demo):https://www.artprice.com/artist/23640/baishi-qiSubscribe to our services:https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artprice:Artprice is listed on the Eurolist by Euronext Paris, SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Founded by thierry Ehrmann (see Who's who certified Biography ) (c)https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2019/03/2019-bio-whoswho-thierry-ehrmann.pdf).Dicover Artprice in video:https://www.artprice.com/videoArtprice is the global leader in art price and art index databanks.

Stories from Slate; The country is increasingly protecting consumers from tech companies even as government surveillance intensifies.Slate MagazineFebruary 7, 2019 Thursday 1:00 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Washingtonpost.Newsweek Interactive Company, LLC. All Rights ReservedSection: FUTURE TENSE; TechnologyLength: 1793 wordsHighlight: China Is Having an Unexpected Privacy AwakeningBodyWhen Mark Zuckerberg testified before Congress last spring, he argued that regulating Facebook's use of personal data would cause the United States to fall behind Chinese companies when it comes data-intensive innovation like artificial intelligence. The implication was that Chinese companies are not constrained by privacy norms and will have an edge if U.S. companies like Facebook are hamstrung by data protection regulation.But China may not provide Zuckerberg with a convenient counterargument against privacy rules for much longer. Contrary to Zuckerberg's characterization, China is in the early stages of setting up a data protection regulatory system to police Facebook's Chinese counterparts. Chinese companies are increasingly finding that the days of collecting data without public scrutiny are over-and Chinese consumers are vocally standing up for their own privacy in ways not seen before. For this reason, a number of            scholars hailed 2018 as the year when the Chinese            public awakened to privacy.These developments are in striking contrast with the widespread perception of China as a surveillance state. That perception isn't wrong: The government is using facial recognition and big data to control and monitor its citizens. Under recent legislation, authorities have enshrined the right to law enforcement access to data without due process. But what's been easy to miss is that China's embrace of high-tech government surveillance coincides with increased privacy protections for consumers. This strange dynamic means that, given federal inaction in the United States on consumer data protection, on paper, at least, Chinese consumers might soon have greater privacy from tech companies that American consumers, even as they are exposed to increasingly intrusive government surveillance.China is no stranger to tidal shifts in public opinion leading to changes in government policy. In 2009, few people in China were worried about air pollution or much less aware of the public health risks. For a time, the U.S. Embassy was one of the few organizations that bothered publicly posting the daily air quality index in cities like Beijing. Fast forward 10 years: Air pollution is among Chinese people's foremost concerns, and officials in major cities are in a frenzy to meet people's demand for clean skies.Something similar is happening with online privacy today. After years of Chinese internet companies building business models around Chinese people's lack of awareness about privacy, users are getting angry about companies abusing their personal information. This growing privacy awareness emanates from people's concern over data leaks, which often help scammers and criminals take advantage of unwitting Chinese individuals.The Financial Times reported that in a survey by the China Consumer Association, 85 percent of respondents said that their data had been leaked, including phone numbers sold illegally or bank account information hacked.In a sign of changing attitudes, Robin Li, the once-revered founder of Baidu, China's largest search engine, found himself on the defensive in March after he suggested in an interview that Chinese people would trade privacy for convenience. The remark inflamed simmering discontent among internet users upset with the Chinese search giant's invasive data collection practices. Chinese state media reported on the outrage users expressed online, citing comments like, "Who told you we are willing to give up our data?"The government is also in the early stages of building out a framework with rules for consent; personal data collection, use, and sharing; and user-requested deletion of data. The first milestone in China's data protection system,            a standard called the Personal Information Security Specification, took effect in May. Although the specification is not legally binding, government regulators have begun using various tools to persuade companies to comply. In early January, an auditor linked with the powerful Ministry of Industry and Information Technology published a list of            14 mobile apps that had "excessively collected sensitive personal data" without user consent. Inspectors put these companies (including the popular Chinese travel company Ctrip and the Tencent-owned music streaming service QQ Music) on a blacklist. These companies now face public pressure to change the way they handle user data. Then, less than three weeks later, the four top internet regulators issued a            joint announcement stating that they would evaluate 100 mobile apps from online payment to food delivery services to assess how they collect personal data. Those with unsatisfactory results will have their business licenses revoked.These actions on privacy issues have turned China into "a surprise leader in Asia on data privacy rules," according to the Financial Times, showing an acute disjuncture between privacy from commercial surveillance and privacy from government surveillance. While Chinese citizens will soon have broad protections from commercial data collection, they'll likely continue to experiencegrowing, perhaps total government surveillance. Indeed, even as the Chinese government grows increasingly willing to scold tech companies for overstepping the bounds of reasonable data collection, it has indicated no willingness to curb its own surveillance capabilities for the sake of individual privacy.The split identity of China's privacy push was on display at a recent gathering in Beijing hosted by a mainstream state-owned media outlet called Southern Metropolis Daily that honored pioneers in the field of data privacy. "Privacy is engraved deeply in our genes," one of the award recipients, Yang Geng, said in his speech. Previously the chief security officer at Amazon China and Xiaomi (a top Chinese consumer electronics company), Geng is passionate about building technology to protect privacy and recently founded a startup that has developed privacy tools. Only a few years ago, the prospect that such an event would take place would have been nearly unthinkable. Geng described the situation frankly: "Many Chinese friends [said], 'Chinese people don't care about privacy. Your products won't be demanded by the market. ... And what Chinese person in their right mind would fucking dare use privacy protection tools made by a Chinese company?' "He persisted and developed a search engine called LeakZero that does not track users. LeakZero even has an encryption tool that can be used inside apps like WeChat (China's "super app," which offers group texts, payments, games, news, and dozens of other embedded services to about 1 billion monthly users). However, the primary hurdle Geng faces is not consumer trends but the disposition of the Chinese government. Unlike in other countries, no major app in China, with the exception of Apple's iMessage, offers encryption. It is not clear, however, whether Geng will be permitted to offer these tools in China since they could hinder the government's surveillance capabilities. In the end, he may have to shut down his app or provide a backdoor giving the government access.But the Chinese government isn't letting the lack of resolution on these questions stand in the way of its big plans for consumer privacy. Just six months after the Personal Information Security Specification took force, the standard's drafters are discussing revising it to close loopholes that allow companies to comply while continuing excessive collection of personal data.The hope is to build a Chinese data protection regime that is uniquely suited to China: one that builds consumer trust in a thriving digital economy but does not undermine the government's ability to maintain control. The drafters of the specification drew on concepts from the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation but sought to make it fit China's system. The idea of China looking to the strictest privacy legislation in the world seems counterintuitive, if not downright strange. But with U.S. inaction on federal data privacy and consumer rights, China and Europe now stand as the only two models out there offering guardrails against invasive data collection.China is not the only country with a split personality when it comes to privacy: In the United States, the Supreme Court provides fairly strong privacy protections against government data collection, but the country still lacks a comprehensive consumer privacy law. In Europe, the focus is flipped, with strong controls on businesses and relatively high trust in government data collection practices. The seeming contradiction in China is actually consistent with its internet governance model over the past decade: build consumer confidence and internet usage while also maintaining government control.The main hurdle to Beijing's ambitions to shape global privacy standards may be the unresolved contradiction in how the new rules play out in practice. This manifests in the conflicting guidance within Chinese law. For example, China's e-commerce law requires companies to delete user data but also mandates that companies retain data to assist with government investigations for national security. China's cybersecurity law requires consent to collect personal information, but it also grants the government new powers to demand that companies turn over more information on users through random inspections of internet service providers, making it increasingly difficult for users to be anonymous online.Enforcement is also an open question. In China, there are many rules on the books that are ignored in practice, except when officials choose to make an example of someone. However, cyberspace is one area in which the government does often flex its muscles, as evident in the recent sweeping crackdowns on Chinese internet platforms for content violations.Chinese tech companies are sometimes caught in the middle. Didi, the country's main ride-sharing company, resisted turning over data to law enforcement authorities after two users of the app were recently murdered; the company cited privacy as a justification. Didi had not been in compliance with a requirement to connect its online service database (which included information about users, drivers, vehicles, routes, etc.) with a government supervisory platform. The spat stirred up debate among Chinese scholars about whether real-time data access violated consent requirements in China's cybersecurity law.Yang Geng is breaking new ground by giving Chinese users a way to encrypt texts on their mobile apps. But he is clear-eyed about the challenges ahead. Geng noted to his WeChat followers: "Nothing is absolute. [It is] true there is more surveillance [in China], but that does not mean there is no privacy."Load-Date: February 7, 2019End of Document

Senate Small Business Committee Issues Testimony From Center for Strategic &#38; International StudiesTargeted News ServiceFebruary 27, 2019 Wednesday 7:20 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 3938 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee issued the following testimony by Bonnie S. Glaser, director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, at a hearing entitled "Made in China 2025 and the Future of American Industry":"Thank you, Chairman Rubio, Ranking Member Cardin, and members of the committee for inviting me to testify today on the important topic "Made in China 2025 and the Future of American Industry.""The Made in China 2025 Plan (MIC 2025) is a ten-year, comprehensive industrial policy designed to transform China into an advanced global manufacturing leader. Like the concurrent 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020) and related state-led programs, MIC 2025 seeks to leverage the power of the Chinese state to promote indigenous innovation, advance technological self-sufficiency, and create comparative advantage in key strategic sectors on a global scale.1"The Chinese State Council document launching MIC 2025 issued in May 2015 clearly revealed Beijing's aim of comprehensively upgrading Chinese industry. The plan set the target of raising domestic content of core components and materials to 40 percent by 2020 and 70 percent by 2025. A substantial role for the state was highlighted, including through the utilization of financial and fiscal tools, support for the creation of manufacturing innovation centers (15 by 2020 and 40 by 2025), as well as assistance to Chinese firms to participate in international standards setting."Although the goal of MIC 2025 is to upgrade industry writ large, the plan targets ten strategic industries in which China intends to foster the development of not only national champions but global champions. These ten priority sectors are: 1) advanced information technology; 2) automated machine tools and robotics; 3) aircraft and aeronautical equipment; 4) maritime vessels and marine engineering equipment; 5) advanced rail equipment; 6) new energy vehicles; 7) electrical generation and transmission equipment; 8) agricultural machinery and equipment; 9) new materials; and 10) pharmaceuticals and advanced medical devices.China's Strategic Goals"MIC 2025 is part of Chinese President Xi Jinping's ambitious plan to achieve the "great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation" and restore China to what Xi believes is the country's rightful place as a great power by 2049 -- the centennial of the PRC's founding. At the 19th Party Congress in October 2017, Xi laid out a multi-stage plan with specific goals for 2020, 2035, and 2050. By 2035, he said China would be a top ranked innovative nation and by the middle of the century would be transformed into a leading global power."Xi called for mobilizing the Communist Party to lead the development of high-tech industries and make China a "country of innovators." He set out goals to strengthen basic research in applied sciences, accelerate implementation of major national science and technology projects, and prioritize innovation in key technologies, while promoting cooperation among universities, government research institutes, state companies and small enterprises.2"In subsequent speeches, Xi Jinping has underscored the urgency to develop strategic emerging industries and make China into a leading high-end manufacturing superpower as well as a center for science and innovation. For example, in an address to top Chinese engineers and academics in May 2018, Xi called for the "fundamental transformation of business models of the manufacturing sector" and the "integration of the internet, big data and artificial intelligence with the real economy" so as to "move China's industries up to the middle and high-end in the global value chain."3"China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) has laid out a three-step strategy for China to become a world leader in advanced manufacturing. The first step, which is to be achieved by 2025, requires China to "approach the level of manufacturing powers Germany and Japan during the period when they realized industrialization." The second step envisions China "entering the front ranks of second tier manufacturing powers" by 2035. In the third step, China will have become a member of the "first tier of global manufacturing powers" by 2045, and will have acquired "innovation-driving capabilities," "clear competitive advantages," and "world-leading technology systems and industrial systems."4"It is undeniable that Chinese leaders view economic policy as a means to achieve the goal of national rejuvenation, which is deemed essential to keep the Chinese Communist Party in power. Recognizing that the development strategy of reliance on low-cost labor to produce low-end manufactured exports for the world has run its course, MIC 2025 is part of Beijing's strategy to preserve its position as a manufacturing and export superpower, even in the face of rising wages and a declining workforce due to demographic challenges. To succeed, China must effectively compete with advanced industrialized economies.What's the Problem with MIC 2025?"As the U.S. Chamber of Commerce noted in a report on MIC 2025 published in 2017, "As the Chinese economy matures . . . it is natural for China to pursue a more innovative economy through significant investments in research and development as well as policies aimed at improving innovation capacity and economic efficiency."5"Moreover, the pursuit of an industrial plan by another country does not necessarily pose a threat to American industry. Germany's "Industry 4.0" plan, from which MIC 2025 drew inspiration, similarly aims to establish Germany as a lead market and provider of advanced manufacturing solutions.6 The differences between MIC 2025 and Industry 4.0 are substantial, however. A few notable differences are that China's state subsidies are much larger and are used for many purposes, not just basic research as in Germany's plan. China also has specific targets for replacing imports with indigenous production, which is not a feature of Industry 4.0. In addition, Germany's economy is far more open to foreign participation and competition than China's economy.7 Finally, in contrast to Germany's plan, the amount of support that the Chinese state will provide for MIC 2025 industries through state funding, low interest loans, tax breaks and other subsidies is not public. Some estimates put the likely number in the hundreds of billions of dollars.8"There are numerous reasons that MIC 2025 has rightly raised concerns in the United States and other countries with advanced economies. Below are a few of the most widely cited concerns:1. MIC 2025 will advance China's goal of integrating its defense and commercial economies, which is aimed at strengthening the country's innovation capability for dual-use technologies in key strategic industries, including aviation, robotics, and information technology. Military-civil fusion was established as a national strategy by Xi Jinping in 2014 and is a pillar of China's military modernization drive that is aimed at making the People's Liberation Army a 21st century fighting force.9 The Pentagon warned in 2017 that state-led Chinese investment in U.S. firms working on facial-recognition software, 3-D printing, virtual reality systems, and autonomous vehicles is a threat because such products have "blurred the lines" between civilian and military technologies.102. China's ambition to control entire supply chains, some of which have potential application to military manufacturing, poses a risk that entire industries could come under Chinese control. For example, only four companies today are comprehensive providers of telecommunications equipment infrastructure: Huawei, ZTE, Ericsson, and Nokia. Two of those four are Chinese companies. Many other U.S. and European companies that were producing telecom equipment folded in the last few decades, including the American company Motorola. As the report Made in China 2025 and the Future of American Industry by this committee states: "If MIC2025 is successful . . . what the 'China shock' did to domestic U.S. production of electronics, furniture, plastics, metals, and vehicle parts could threaten to repeat itself in capital goods like machinery, automobiles, high-end computers, rail, and aerospace products."113. Chinese government subsidies distort markets, undercut U.S. and other foreign manufacturers, and result in overcapacity and the dumping of cheap products in the global market. Other Chinese state-led technology related plans have produced these negative outcomes. One example is the case of solar panels, where government support in the form of fiscal subsidies and tax incentives to the production of Chinese solar cells and panels combined with government-backed theft of intellectual property drove nearly 30 U.S. manufacturing firms out of the business.124. The plan suggests that China's intention is not just limited to joining the ranks of high-tech economies, but rather envisages displacing them. The plan foresees the targeted industries developing in three phases. First, localize and indigenize R&#38;D and control segments of global supply chains. Second, after dependence on foreign technology has been reduced, proceed with substitution. Third, after Chinese technology and brands are developed, capture global market share. This three-step process could enable China to capture both domestic and international market share in many, if not all, MIC 2025 industries and technologies.5. Establishing quotas violates WTO rules against technology substitution. In addition to the targets set by MIC 2025 for achieving 70 percent self-sufficiency in core components and critical materials by 2025 in a wide range of strategic industries, semi-official documents suggest that there are more specific local content quotas for Chinese enterprises, but these are not being highlighted publicly to avoid charges of violations of WTO rules.136. MIC 2025 puts a premium on the acquisition of advanced technology. Since China still lags behind in critical high-tech sectors, it is likely that there will be a strong push for foreign acquisitions through various means, including buy-outs of foreign companies as well as forced technology transfer agreements and use of cyber espionage to procure cutting-edge technologies.7. Together with the Plan to Enhance Standardization and Quality of Equipment Manufacturing, MIC 2025 will help China to spread Chinese standards abroad and undermine Western standards. Among the targets will be countries linked to the "One Belt, One Road" project which seeks to tie Eurasian economies more closely to China through infrastructure, trade, and investment.MIC 2025 Under Review?"After the United States imposed tariffs on China, which are in part aimed at punishing China's unfair practices and neutralizing the advantages enjoyed by Chinese companies, Beijing dropped references to MIC 2025 in official documents and authoritative media. Chinese officials have apparently said they are drafting a replacement for MIC 2025 that would play down the goal of making China the dominant global manufacturer and attempt to assuage U.S. concerns by opening up the Chinese plan to participation by foreign companies. Last December, media reports suggested that the new policy would be rolled out in early 2019, but so far, no new policy has been announced.14"Given the close linkages between MIC 2025 and Xi Jinping's staged plan for national rejuvenation, it is unlikely that substantial changes will be made, however. Rather, explicit parts of MIC 2025, such as the numerical targets for market share by Chinese companies, are likely to be removed from the public version of the program. Chinese advocates of upgrading the manufacturing sector through competition with world-class foreign companies are unlikely to prevail.Recommendations1. Protect Intellectual Property: China steals more intellectual property than any other country. According to the Department of Justice, China was involved in 90 percent of all economic espionage cases the Department handled from 2011 to 2018.15 In addition, more than two-thirds of the Department's theft of trade secrets cases have been linked to China. A report by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies found that Chinese cyberespionage costs U.S. companies an estimated $300 billion annually and poses the "single greatest threat to U.S. technology."16 Increased focus on enforcement actions in cases of suspected Chinese economic espionage is essential. The U.S. government should also seek to sanction Chinese companies that benefit from cyber espionage. In addition, counter-intelligence outreach should be expanded to U.S. startups and small companies in artificial intelligence, semiconductors, telecommunications, quantum, and other sectors central to Chinese technology strategies."Legislation recently introduced by U.S. Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA) to combat economic espionage would increase damages available for companies that are victims of trade theft, extend the statute of limitations for such crimes, and expand the scope of the Economic Espionage Act to cover cybercrime and hacking taking place outside the United States so that civil suits could be brought against perpetrators working abroad. Measures such as these will help American companies that are victims of Chinese espionage to fight back. By increasing the reputational costs to China and the real costs to Chinese companies, such actions may deter some Chinese hacking.2. Use the World Trade Organization: U.S.-China trade negotiations are ongoing, but so far U.S. tariffs on more than $250 billion of imports from China in response to its trade policy abuses have not compelled the Chinese to alter their policies and practices related to technology transfer, intellectual property and innovation. In the meantime, U.S. tariffs have imposed high costs on American families and businesses. I am skeptical that tariffs will force China to fundamentally change aspects of its economic structure that are tied to Xi Jinping's plan to make the country into first-tier technological power by 2035."The United States should consider using the WTO's dispute settlement mechanism to hold China accountable for its trade practices, including its persistent theft of intellectual property, cyber-enabled economic espionage, and widespread use of subsidies. A recommendation made by the United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission is worth noting in this regard. In its 2018 report, the USCC proposed that the USTR investigate whether to bring a "non-violation nullification or impairment" case against China at the WTO under Article 23(b) of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.17 A non-violation claim allows WTO members to challenge measures that "nullify or impair" expected benefits, even if they do not explicitly violate WTO agreements. There are also WTO provisions that have not yet been explored that could provide the basis upon which to challenge China's trade policy practices. The United States has won more WTO cases than any other country and such cases provide a means to protect the interests of American workers and intellectual property owners. Since joining the WTO, China has complied partly or fully in all but one of the 22 completed WTO cases that have been brought against it."Working with allies and partners should be at the core of a U.S. strategy to effectively compete with a rising China. Where possible, the U.S. should collaborate with international partners to bring trade cases against China at the WTO. One potential WTO case could target China's continuing practice of forcing foreign firms to transfer technology and intellectual property. When China joined the WTO in 2001, it agreed that foreign companies could not be pressured by government entities to transfer critical technology to a Chinese partner as the price for approvals of joint venture licenses or other permits to do business in China. Despite Chinese government claims to the contrary, the disclosure of technology and IP as a condition of market access undeniably continues with Chinese government knowledge, if not encouragement.3. Consider Rejoining the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP): The TPP (now the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership or CPTPP) provides one of the best options for the United States to counter China's MIC 2025 plan and to compete more effectively with China. Membership in CPTPP, which is a high-standard trade and investment regime, will provide U.S. and other foreign companies with incentives to diversify their supply chains away from China, thereby reducing their reliance on and vulnerability to China. Joining such a multilateral trade agreement with eleven other partners would also be an important step in restoring confidence in the United States and countering Beijing's narrative that the U.S. is an unreliable partner."Staying outside the CPTPP will prove harmful to American businesses. Beyond lowering trade barriers between the member countries, the deal includes greater protection of intellectual property rights and provisions to increase minimum labor standers for workers. The Peterson International Institute for Economics estimates that the U.S. income would have increased by $131 billion dollars annually, or 0.5 percent of GDP, if it had joined and is now set to lose about $2 billion dollars in income because U.S. exports will be less competitive in CPTPP nations.18 Strengthening commercial ties with countries in Asia, Europe and the Americas can further pressure China to give up its unfair trade practices.4. Consider Adopting a U.S. Industrial Policy: I agree with the findings of this Committee's report that the U.S. "cannot escape or avoid decisions about industrial policy."19 As the U.S. strategizes about how to compete more effectively with China, we should consider the pros and cons of industrial policy making. The state has long been an important engine of innovation, providing early-stage federal funding to companies such as Apple and Tesla, and investment in technology and research that helped U.S. companies pioneer the shale gas revolution. Rather than imposing tariffs that effectively tax the U.S. companies they are supposed to defend, the U.S. should support innovation at home by providing more funding for basic research and development, higher investment in talent development, trade assistance, and federal support for a series of "moonshot" programs in areas like biodefense systems, threat detection networks, and a distributed electric grid.20"* * *Footnotes:1 "Made in China 2025: Global Ambitions Built on Local Protections," U.S. Chamber of Commerce, 2017, https://www.uschamber.com/sites/default/files/final_made_in_china_2025_report_full.pdf.2 Xi Jinping, "Secure a Decisive Victory in Building a Moderately Prosperous Society in All Respects and Strive for the Great Success of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era," delivered at the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, October 18, 2017, http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/special/2017-11/03/c_136725942.htm.3 Speech by Xi Jinping to the opening of the 19th meeting of the Academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the 14th meeting of the Academicians of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, May 28, 2018.

Chinese EV startup XPeng is at the center of major trade secret disputes with Apple and TeslaiCrowdNewswire (English)March 27, 2019 Wednesday 12:50 PM GMTCopyright 2019 iCrowdNewswire, LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1723 wordsBody                   Last summer, a former Apple employee was charged by the FBI for allegedly stealing trade secrets related to the company s secretive self-driving car project.

Continue reading Chinese EV startup XPeng is at the center of major trade secret disputes with Apple and TeslaLast summer, a former Apple employee was charged by the FBI for allegedly stealing trade secrets related to the company s secretive self-driving car project. This week, Tesla sued a former employee for allegedly stealing trade secrets related to Autopilot. While they happened many months apart, both sets of allegations have something in common: the employees were each allegedly trying to get information to a Chinese electric car startup called Xiaopeng Motors.Xiaopeng Motors, or XPeng, isn t well-known in the West, but has rapidly grown its profile in China despite an overly crowded field in the EV startup space. Now it finds itself close to the heart of these two major trade secret dustups. So it s worth taking a step back and getting a better understanding of just exactly what the company is all about.What is XPeng?China spent the last few decades relying mostly on state-owned automakers to build up its car industry, according to Michael Dunne, who runs automotive consulting firm ZoZo Go. But that all changed two or three years ago when the Chinese government started encouraging major tech investors to enter the automotive space, he says, which added  a new and fresh dimension to China s auto industry.  Well-funded tech giants like Tencent and Alibaba were seen as a potential answer to China s ambitions to build world-class vehicles, he says.XPeng is backed by Chinese tech giant AlibabaIt was out of this shift that XPeng was born. The company was founded in 2014 as Guangzhou Xiaopeng Motors Technology by Henry Xia and Tao He, and financed (and now run by) mobile internet entrepreneur He Xiaopeng. It goes by a number of different names, like Xiaopeng Motors (the Chinese holding company), or XMotors (the US subsidiary), but is most commonly referred to in the industry by its marketing brand, XPeng.He Xiaopeng is known for having sold a mobile browser company called UCWeb to Chinese e-commerce behemoth Alibaba in what was, at the time, the biggest internet merger in China s history. Alibaba then led a $350 million funding round (which also included Foxconn) for He s next project, XPeng.XPeng debuted its first electric car at CES 2018   an all-electric SUV called the G3 that looks an awful lot like Tesla s Model X, both inside and out. It s shaped like the Model X, and it also features a very similar cockpit layout, with a giant portrait-oriented touchscreen tablet embedded in the dashboard. The car recently started shipping to the first owners.The connection to TeslaThose similarities are not accidental.  Tesla has created a huge impact on me,  He said in a 2018 interview with Quartz. In fact, He said that one of the reasons he founded XPeng was because Tesla open-sourced its patents in 2014. The company has reportedly gone as far as tearing apart Tesla s cars to get a better understanding of how they re built.Tesla has noticed. In the lawsuit Tesla filed against its former employee this week, it acknowledged that XPeng has  reportedly designed its vehicles around Tesla s open-source patents and has transparently imitated Tesla s design, technology, and even its business model,  including the fact that the Chinese startup is building out a network of fast chargers and selling directly to consumers.The company s founder has often talked about Tesla s inspirationTesla also pointed out in the lawsuit that XPeng introduced  Autopilot-like  software, which the company calls  X-Pilot,  and that the Chinese startup employs  at least five  former Autopilot employees (including the one being sued).While Tesla encouraged other companies to use its patented EV technology, Autopilot was never really part of the deal. Acquiring and using the confidential source code that powers Autopilot would  give a competitor an enormous advantage in attempting to replicate Tesla s current self-driving technology, and in anticipating future developments,  the company wrote in this week s lawsuit.The connection to AppleThere s less of a direct connection to Apple beyond the employee who was charged last summer. But Chinese startups taking on talent from Silicon Valley   Chinese nationals or not   has been a common theme over the last few years, according to James Andrew Lewis, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a bipartisan nonprofit policy research organization. And sometimes, he says, they bring more than just their polished skills with them. It is a common practice for Chinese employees to learn some useful skills, and whether they want to go back home, or maybe they want to retire, take some sort of commercial or technological secret and bring it back to China,  Lewis says.  This has been happening for a couple decades. It s par for the course.  It s par for the course. Last summer, federal prosecutors arrested and charged former Apple employee Xiaolang Zhang with stealing circuit boards and more than 40GB of data related to the company s secretive self-driving car project. Zhang had told Apple and federal investigators that he was trying get a job at XPeng, but it was initially unclear if he ever did before he was arrested. When XPeng eventually responded to the charges, though, it admitted that Zhang had started a job with the company.Is XPeng being directly accused of stealing trade secrets?No. The former Apple and Tesla employees are the ones accused in the respective charges and lawsuit, not the company itself.There are a few important distinctions between the two cases, too. Zhang, who worked for Apple in California from December 2015 until May 2018, was charged in federal court by the FBI last summer for alleged trade secret theft. Guangzhi Cao worked for Tesla in California from April 2017 to January 2019, and was sued in California civil court this week. He has not been criminally charged with trade secret theft.XPeng isn t named as a defendant in Tesla s lawsuit, and it wasn t charged by the FBIA key difference with Cao s case is that he is, as of this writing, still employed by XPeng. Tesla alleges that he stole hundreds of thousands of files and directories containing Autopilot source code while he was still a Tesla employee, and that XPeng could benefit from that theft   but only Cao is named as a defendant.For its part XPeng said in a statement to The Verge it  fully respects any third-party s intellectual property rights and confidential information,  and that it has started an internal investigation into Cao s alleged theft. XPeng said it  has by no means caused or attempted to cause Mr. Cao to misappropriate trade secrets, confidential and proprietary information of Tesla,  and that it was  not aware of any alleged misconduct by Mr. Cao. It offered a similar statement after Zhang s arrest last year. XPeng  attaches great importance to protecting intellectual property rights and has always regarded compliance as the basic principle for all employees,  the company wrote in a statement.  Zhang signed the intellectual property compliance documents on his first day at the company in early May. Records show that he hasn t reported any sensitive or violating information to XPeng. The EV startup denied any involvement and says now that it assisted in the investigation. The criminal case against Zhang is still progressing in court.Do these cases have anything to do with numerous accusationsof Chinese government-sponsored attacks on US tech companies?Not directly, according to Dunne. It s likely more a result of the conditions and pressure of the booming (and highly competitive) Chinese automotive market.Three years ago, Dunne says, it was  cool and very advanced to build an electric vehicle like Tesla.  But founders like He quickly realized that electrification is not a unique enough technology to differentiate from the dozens, or even hundreds of automotive companies sprouting in China, Dunne says.Advanced technologies like autonomy could help distinguish a player like XPeng from the rest.  So they find themselves in the hunt for technologies they haven t been working on, and ones they d have to either acquire or develop quickly,  Dunne says.  There s an urgency  that could explain why some companies take shortcuts, including stealing intellectual property, he says.The urgency to differentiate in a crowded field puts pressure on startups to take shortcutsLewis agrees.  When Beijing says  everybody should start making electric cars,  you see a lot of companies eager to gain favor. One of the ways to do that is to leap ahead, and one way to leap ahead is to recruit people from American companies who bring skills or knowledge that they can use,  he says.Dunne also says that, while XPeng and its competition are, on paper,  independent actors scrambling to compete in an intensely competitive and increasingly crowded arena,  it s important to remember that it s hard to truly operate fully removed from the Chinese government.  China being China, in order for them to secure funding and loans, ultimately there s a trail back to the government,  he says.  Local government or provincial government would direct state banks to make loans to these types of companies. Knowing what we know about the Chinese government, which has sponsored decades-spanning  economic espionage  attacks that lifted crucial intellectual property and confidential information from major tech companies, government entities and contractors, it s not hard to imagine Beijing encouraging this behavior, or at least turning a blind eye.  The Chinese government isn t always eager to arrest people who bring valuable technology back to the motherland,  Lewis says.Tags: See Website:https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/24/18277168/xpeng-china-tesla-apple-trade-secret-theft-electricContact Information:Sean O'KaneTags:           Wire,            Artificial Intelligence Newswire,            United States,            EnglishLoad-Date: March 27, 2019End of Document

China Became Second Largest Venture Capital Market by Total Capital Invested in 2018, According to PitchBook Report; Chinese Entrepreneurial Ecosystem Secured Nearly One-Third of Total Global VC Investment in 2018 as a Result of BAT, Government-Led Programs and Accelerated Pace of Technology InnovationPR NewswireMarch 19, 2019 Tuesday 6:00 AM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 635 wordsDateline: SEATTLE, March 19, 2019 BodyPR Newswire PitchBook, the premier data provider for the private and public equity markets, released a new report entitled,Venture Capital in China, which provides an overview and analysis of trends shaping Chinese VC activity. According to the analysis, China is now the second largest country in terms of venture deal value, primarily due to a variety of programs intended to develop Chinese economic and technology infrastructures like Torch, Innofund, state-sponsored VC funding and foreign RMB funds. Also aiding the growth and maturity of the Chinese VC ecosystem are the set of internet giants known as BAT (Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent) that command significant sway in Chinese VC and the economy with their expansive platform-based strategies. At least 19 of the 71 Chinese unicorns are backed or controlled by BAT companies. While these market drivers, along with other macroeconomic factors are attracting VC investment, there are several risks to China's burgeoning VC ecosystem, including regulations and government oversight, lack of regulatory transparency, evolving contracts, overestimation of market size, investment sector limitations and exit market considerations."China has seen a meteoric rise in tech startups and VC activity in recent years and we expect the country's growing proportion of VC investment will only increase as the ecosystem continues to mature, and as both domestic and foreign investors look to China for its increasing rate of technological innovation," said Alex Frederick, VC analyst at PitchBook. "One significant challenge that could interfere with continued growth is Chinese government oversight. With both local and central governments administering regulations that limit investment and exit options, it creates an opaque and selective environment that puts foreign investment at risk."Key Takeaways:Global investors are pouring increasing amounts of capital into China's startup ecosystem, with 29.4% of global VC directed into Chinese startups in 2018. China has undertaken major entrepreneurial initiatives including a massive national technology incubator, seed funding, and a series of funds-of-funds (FoFs) to develop the entrepreneurial and technological ecosystem in China. China's largest tech firms (including Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent) are using expansive platform strategies to saturate every moment of Chinese consumers' digital lives, acting as one-stop shops for all entertainment, shopping, finance, and other needs. Although exit paths for Chinese startups are limited, evolving regulations, investor strategies, and new high-tech boards leave us with an optimistic outlook.Additional coverage in this report includes:History of VC in China Chinese Tech Giants Factors Driving Chinese VC Trends Risk Regulation and Exit ConsiderationsDownload the full reporthere.About PitchBookPitchBook is a financial data and software company that provides transparency into the capital markets to help professionals discover and execute opportunities with confidence and efficiency.

CHINA'S WAR OF FINANCIAL INVESTMENTSStates News ServiceJanuary 29, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1418 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Center for the National Interest (former the Nixon Center):China is in the process of beating the West at its own game by identifying what it sees as the West's "weakness" on the grand chessboard and filling in the gaps.by Daniel WagnerConsistent with so much about China's thrust onto the global stage over the past decade, its outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) has grown far faster than OFDI from most other transitional economies. Chinese OFDI is largely politically driven, aimed at achieving specific nationalistic objectives, such as securing natural resources, acquiring strategic assets in key technologies and service industries, and creating national champion companies. China's approach to OFDI, which is often aggressive and brusque in nature, is increasingly coloring its relationship with recipient nations at all levels of development and income.Until the year 2000, OFDI from China was negligible. Since then, China has tailored its approach to OFDI based on the relative economic and political strength of the recipient country, in exchange for specific benefits. So, in heavily indebted poor countries (HIPCs), China tends to offer to build infrastructure in exchange for the right to access to raw materials. In developing countries, China may offer to help develop an indigenous industry; in emerging markets, it may grant greater access to the Chinese market. In developed countries, it may offer to expand reciprocal agreements related to cross-border investment. In each case, China weighs the relative costs and benefits associated with expanding its relationship with a given country vis- -vis what it will receive in return.China's overall strategy for state-owned-enterprises (SOEs) is to "grasp the large and let go of the small," aiming to create national champions from large SOEs through extensive government support while giving small and medium-sized SOEs greater exposure to the market. SOE's receive direct financial support from the government in the form of below-market rate loans, direct payments, and other subsidies associated with official aid programs. The China Development Bank, China Export and Import Bank, and Sinosure (China's national political risk insurer) are the primary government organs that provide such support, although other state-owned banks and specially created funds also provide backing.Chinese SOEs pursue OFDI in the primary sector, where investments are dominated by a few giant firms. A second strategic objective is to spur investment that acquires sophisticated, proprietary technology, technical skills, industry best practices, and established brand names and distribution networks. Some governments remain wary that such investment will lead to the "development trap": a flood of cash that results in heightened corruption and largesse without building indigenous capacity, knowledge, management skills, or that allows movement up the global economic value chain.The vast majority of Chinese OFDI is made in developing countries, with a significant percentage in countries with weak governance and rule of law. Many of these countries subsequently experienced the classic "resource curse" in which valuable reserves of minerals or fossil fuels enhanced corruption and conflict rather than promoting economic development. Chinese SOEs have typically stepped into this environment with the advantages of political backing and government subsidized and insured investment, and China has typically used significant sweeteners to win contracts.To secure investment deals, the Chinese government typically offers infrastructure projects, soft loans, and grant programs as a package deal with a proposed natural resource investment. With government financing and political support, Chinese SOEs avoid risks that often plague investments in resource-rich, economically poor countries. Political and reputational risks are therefore usually minimized while financing uncertainty is eliminated. Such risks hinder Western multinational enterprises from making similar investments in these countries, but they tend to be of little concern to Chinese SOEs.China's relationship with other emerging markets can be more complex. Subsidized Chinese OFDI may crowd out less substantial or unsubsidized OFDI, or investment from other emerging market countries. At the same time, many emerging markets view Chinese investment into their countriesparticularly in infrastructure and industrial projectsas a valuable resource for economic development, especially since it comes with few strings attached. China's strategy has been to negotiate such investment through diplomatic channels, with investments taking the form of partnerships and quid pro quo loans, as opposed to being exclusively under Chinese control.Using such sweeteners as diplomacy, ideology, and camaraderie tends not to work in developed countries, where China finds it is playing on a more even field. When placed in a competitive environment with a formidable opposite number, China tends to use a sledgehammer to get what it wantscrossing a line, retreating, then doing so again, until a new line of been established and Beijing gets what it wants (this is a strategy Beijing had deployed in a number of contexts, whether in economic negotiations or in a military context such as the South China Sea).The blowback China has received from some African countries objecting to its one-size-fits-all approach to OFDI has prompted China to reconsider its approach. An increasing number of countries are no longer simply rolling out the red carpet. Natural resource export earnings must now be deposited into off-shore escrow accounts, with the value of the exports determined at the time of export, rather than in advance, for example.Points of conflict with developed countries tend to occur in three areas. First, OFDI by Chinese SOEs is seen as unfairly competitive vis-a-vis private sector companies. By virtue of government ownership and backing, Chinese SOEs often operate investments in risky environments where Western multinationals may prefer not to operate, and at reduced cost, thereby outmaneuvering Western firms. As Western multinationals generally operate based on market conditions, albeit with advantages from established reputations, technology and industry best practices, they and their home countries come to believe that the playing field is no longer level. China's growing noncommercially motivated OFDI has the potential to distort global markets, leading to long-term loss of productivity and efficiency.Second, Chinese official aid to unsavory governments in order to lubricate OFDI contracts raises governance and humanitarian concerns and, therefore, hackles among developed country governments. China's general willingness to befriend rogue or unsavory governmentsfunding projects in countries such as Sudan, Iran, and Venezuelacreates tension with the developed world. Some of this tension may actually stem from the fact that the exercise of realpolitik by China puts it on top and outwits Western firms that have had their activities circumscribed in such countries due to sanctions, reputational, or political risk. And third, Chinese SOEs' attempts to acquire ownership interest in, or assets of, large developed country MNEs operating under market conditions have unnerved some developed country governments, which fear losing market access to strategic resources, as well as their technological and advanced practices edge.Yet, if it were not for the West's preoccupation with achieving a higher moral standard and adherence to international standards of acceptable behavior, China would not have been as successful as it has been in fostering OFDI in the developing world. China is in the process of beating the West at its own game by identifying what it sees as the West's "weakness" on the grand chessboard and filling in the gaps. If the West played the game the same way, then China's investment ambitions would be more restricted, or at least more expensive.In some ways, China is better at achieving capitalist nirvana than the countries that invented it. Since Beijing will not be changing its stripes any time soon, it will be incumbent upon the developing world to set higher standards for what constitutes an acceptable approach to Chinese OFDIone that enables both sides to win. Developed countries will need to find a way to beat China at its own game, instead of the other way around.Load-Date: January 30, 2019End of Document

Following Stanford physics professor's passing, rumors of ties to Chinese government emergeeval(ez_write_tag([[728,90],'stanforddaily_com-box-3','ezslot_1']));The Stanford Daily: Stanford UniversityJanuary 1, 2019 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 908 wordsBodyDistinguished Stanford physics professor Shoucheng Zhang passed away on Dec. 1, 2018 at age 55. According to his family, Zhang's death - an apparent suicide - follows a long "battle with depression." However, some on Chinese media speculate that Zhang's death may be related to rising U.S.-China tensions and Zhang's involvement with Chinese business and government."We are saddened to learn of the passing of Shoucheng Zhang, a distinguished physicist who has made tremendous scientific contributions," said University Provost Persis Drell, who is also a physics professor. "His passing is a loss for his family, his colleagues at the University and for his field."A pioneer in physics, Zhang explored everything from novel materials and quantum gravity to artificial intelligence. Most notably, his research in a topological insulator - which led to the discovery of a new state of matter - led to predictions that his team would win the 2014 Nobel Prize in physics. Though Zhang didn't win, his research was seen as critical for the development of improved semiconductor chips, a technology highly valued by the Chinese Communist Party for economic and national security purposes.Zhang was originally recruited in 2008 under the Thousand Talents program - a CCP effort to attract top scientists from overseas to work in China - to conduct research at Tsinghua University in Beijing. Zhang was active in helping U.S.-trained Chinese researchers return home, and expressed his desire to help "bring back the front-lines of research to China" in a recent interview with Chinese news portal Sina.Zhang's venture capital firm Digital Horizon Capital , formerly known as Danhua Capital, was recently linked to China's "Made in China 2025" technology dominance program in a Nov. 30 U.S. Trade Representative report. According to the report, venture capital firms like DHVC are ultimately aimed at allowing China to access vital technology from U.S. startups. Zhang's firm lists 113 U.S. companies in its portfolio, most falling within emerging sectors that the Chinese government has identified as strategic priorities.The "Made in China 2025" program combines economic espionage and aggressive business acquisitions to aid China's quest to become a tech manufacturing superpower, the USTR report continues. The program was launched in 2015 and has been cited by the Trump administration as evidence that the Chinese government is engaged in a strategic effort to steal American technological expertise.A Hoover Institution document called "Chinese Influence & American Interests: Promoting Constructive Vigilance," released just one day before the USTR report, echoes its sentiments. The 192-page investigation argues that China "captures much valuable new technology through its investments in US high-tech companies," and is more generally attempting to manipulate state and local governments, universities, think tanks, media, corporations and the Chinese American community.The close timing of Zhang's death with the USTR report's release - as well as the same-day arrest of the CFO of Huawei, a Chinese telecommunications company now under fire for sanctions fraud - has fueled doubt within Chinese media that the scientist's death occurred of his own accord.According to The Washington Times, Guo Wengui, an exiled Chinese businessman who in the past had close contact with Chinese intelligence, suspected foul play in Zhang's death because the physicist knew secrets about China's technology expert program. Zhang also refused to return to China as requested by senior party leaders, said Guo."I knew this guy very well," Guo said. "The guy worked with the [Chinese Communist Party]."Zhang's family maintains that the events were unrelated to his death."There is no police investigation, and the authorities have no suspicions about Professor Zhang's death," a representative for the family told the South China Morning Post. "You will read that he committed suicide, and this is true. But you will also read in the family statement that he had periodic bouts with depression."Zhang's distinguished career includes winning the Dirac Medal of the International Centre for Theoretical Physics in 2012 and a spot on the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2015. His recent classes include the popular introductory seminar, "PHYSICS 81N: Science on the Back of the Envelope" and "PHYSICS 171: Thermodynamics, Kinetic Theory, and Statistical Mechanics II."He is survived by his wife, Barbara; his children, Stephanie and Brian; and his daugher-in-law, Ruth Fong.The Daily has reached out to the University for comment.Contact Berber Jin at fjin16 'at' stanford.edu.Editor's note: If you are experiencing trauma or thoughts of self harm, there are available resources both on and beyond campus that are reachable 24 hours a day, seven days a week:National Suicide Prevention Hotline: +1(800)-273-8255Stanford Counseling and Psychological Services: +1(650)-723-3785Stanford Confidential Support Team: +1(650)-725-9955While you're here...We're a student-run organization committed to providing hands-on experience in journalism, digital media and business for the next generation of reporters.

Good morning, and thank you so much. Good morning, everyone, I'm Maria Bartiromo. Happy Tuesday, it is Tuesday, March 12th, your top stories right now just before 6:00 a.m. on the east coast. The groundings of Boeing 737, the Max 8 jet expanding around the world, this morning. Nearly half of all of the jets that have been delivered since May of 2017 have been parked, half of them. The fallout, coming up.Carlos Ghosn replaced, the Renault, Nissan, Mitsubishi alliance unveiling a new board structure as the automakers chart their path forward. And sports starts versus sports fans, Russell Westbrook threatening a couple during last night's game. Meanwhile, UFC star Connor McGregor arrested, accused of smashing a fan's phone. The details in sports, coming up. A record sky high view. It is not for the faint of heart. How you can get a new look at New York City later this hour. MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Markets this morning look like this, mixed story so far, Dow Industrials down 20 points -- 23 points, fractional move with the S&P 500, and the NASDAQ are higher this morning. Futures indicating a gain of about three points on the S&P and 12 points higher on the NASDAQ. Boeing is still set to weigh on the market this morning, certainly on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Take a look at the stock, down another two percent, as more countries and airlines across the world get set to ground their 737 Max 8 aircraft over safety concerns, following that deadly Ethiopian Airlines crash on Sunday. The second crash for this type of plane in five months. The two American carriers that fly the plane, Southwest and American Airlines continue to operate that 737.Now, shortly after the Lion Air crash last year, I spoke with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg, and asked him about the safety of that 737 Max 8.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DENNIS MUILENBURG, CEO, BOEING: The real bottom line here -- the key is that the 737 Max is very safe, and we're very confident in that. Safety is a core value for our industry and for our company, always has been, it always will be.BARTIROMO: But was there a change in terms of this model, the 737 that wasn't articulated to the pilots at the airlines, that they did not know how to respond in the event of a change. That's what the charges are.MUILENBURG: Yes, the 737 Max has some new capabilities that are embedded in it, and that's included in the training process that we go through. You know, the airplane has gone through thousands and thousands of hours of testing and simulation, working with our pilots, ensuring that they have all the information they need to safely operate the airplane. And in some cases those new systems are designed to take advantage of the capabilities of the airline. And we've already issued a couple of follow-up bulletins coming out of the ongoing investigation, pointing pilots to existing flight procedures to handle the kind of scenarios that we're talking about in this incident. So, we're going to continue to do that. It's very important that we provide all of the information needed to safely operate these airplanes.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is Kreindler & Kreindler Partner and licensed pilot Daniel Rose. Daniel, it's nice to have you on the program this morning.DANIEL ROSE, PARTNER, KREINDLER & KREINDLER: My pleasure.BARTIROMO: What do you know about the 737 Max 8 jet?ROSE: Well, we know that there's a lot of focus on it right now because of two crashes within five months on a brand new aircraft which is really unprecedented. We know that there's a system on board that is suspected of causing the first crash, which basically renders the aircraft uncontrollable and the pilots can't do anything about it. We were told that it's -- you can do something about it, it's going to be fixed, and five months later, we see what appears to be the same thing, which is a real problem, and it kind of explains why so many countries are grounding the aircraft.BARTIROMO: And you heard Dennis Muilenburg right there, the CEO of Boeing, talk to me after the Lion Air crash, basically saying, yes, we need the Boeing mechanics to explain to the pilots the change here. Do you think that could have been the failure that the pilots are unclear in terms of how to operate the new changes in this model? Your firm specializes in aerospace litigation, right? Tell us what you think is the issue?ROSE: Right. Well, there should never be a situation like this where a brand-new plane requires special emergency procedures in order to prevent a failure from happening shortly after takeoff. You know, the training is essentially what -- Boeing was saying was put a band aid on a problem that is really a design defect, and it needs to be fixed. In fact, the system itself, this MCAS system, I would say, is a band aid on top of a bigger problem which is the aerodynamics of the plane.Boeing tries to get the most, understandably, out of their plane, bigger engines, they mount them in a certain way, and all of a sudden the aircraft flies in a very different way and sometimes in an unsafe way, so they build this system, the MCAS system to compensate for that. Don't tell anybody about it. And it kicks on automatically without anybody knowing about it, and when it does it in the wrong situation, which is done now twice, it's not a safety system, it's actually causing crashes.BARTIROMO: These are all the issues obviously that you would be putting into a complaint. How significant are the lawsuits coming, or have they begun for Boeing?ROSE: They're -- well, they're certainly coming. You know, unfortunately, aside from everybody that was on the plane, there were also Americans on the plane, given that American passengers and Boeing is an American company, one of the main legal hurdles involved in a case like this is whether the case would stay here or get litigated somewhere in like Ethiopia. But with the Americans on board, certainly those passengers will have claims here in the United States, and they'll be significant, likely given the history here of second crash within two -- within five months, which probably a good argument for even the foreigners to be able to stay here and say whatever was relevant to this crash and this investigation, this lawsuit, took place in the United States because Boeing still hasn't fixed the problem.BARTIROMO: So, characterize this problem now that Boeing is facing because not only do you have a situation where country after country are grounding the planes, I mean, a third of these planes that Boeing makes go to China, and China has grounded all of them, a third of the production. And now, you've got the litigation issue.ROSE: Yes, honestly, probably litigation is the tail on the dog. I mean, there's thousands of these on order, and that's the real significant issue, I think, for Boeing because if they have to redesign the system or even the plane to a significant extent, which I think has to be seriously considered given the scope of the problem, that's a huge problem. You know, China, the plane is essentially built to fly in China and for their -- for their market, so it's not surprising that, you know, they're saying, hey, if this thing isn't safe, we don't want it, but the bottom line is Boeing is going to have to fix it.BARTIROMO: What kind of a cost are we -- are we looking at for Boeing, or is it anybody's guess at this point?ROSE: Yes, the latter because this is a 60-year-old plane and with 1960s technology, essentially it's gone through four iterations, generations, many iterations, and each one kind of adds a little bit more onto it, bigger engines, bigger space, more passengers. And it really has gotten to the point where the plane as it is, to me, is nothing like it was when it first came out. And fundamentally, the way the plane flies and how stable it is, has been affected by all of these changes. So, this system, this MCAS system was designed to try to correct this problem without changing anything fundamentally in the aircraft, but I think they're going to have to change things more fundamentally on the aircraft either -- a complete new design or a complete new system, and that could be very expensive.BARTIROMO: I see. I see. And real quick, before we go, what's your reaction to these American jetliners that are not grounding the 737 like American and Southwest?ROSE: Yes. I'm concerned because right now we know of two incidents and they didn't work out, they're 0 for 2. I think American airlines, based on what Boeing and the FAA are saying, are saying if this happens, our pilots can take control and can save the plane. I hope that's right, certainly, but we haven't seen whether that's been tested, whether there's been an incident where somebody has actually recovered. Right now, we're over two and that's not comforting.BARTIROMO: All right, we'll leave it there. Daniel, thank you very much for your insights.ROSE: My pleasure.BARTIROMO: Great to see you. Daniel Rose joining us there on Boeing. Meanwhile, there's this, Tesla CEO Elon Musk is pushing back this morning against the Securities and Exchange Commission again in a new court filing. Dagen McDowell, what's your take? Good morning to you, Dagen.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria. So, Tesla's CEO Elon Musk as you pointed is saying -- telling a federal judge that he did not violate a fraud settlement that restricted his social media communications, even suggesting that the government is trying to put a muzzle on him. In a filing -- this was made late Monday, Elon Musk lawyers said the Securities and Exchange Commission has not shown that his tweet on February the 19th was material.This is -- I'm quoting from The Wall Street Journal, while the federal agency is overreaching by suggesting he needs prior approval for any statement that relates to Tesla. Here's a quote from Musk attorneys, undeterred and perhaps embarrassed by Musk criticism of it, the SEC urges the court to read and apply the order in an unconstitutional manner. The tweet in question was sent, as I said, on February 19th. It was about Tesla's anticipated production levels for 2019. Musk's original message on Twitter said, "Tesla made zero cars in 2011 but will make around 500,000 in 2019."Sometime later, hours later, an in-house lawyer helped him clarify that message, saying I meant to say that annualize production at the end of 2019 was probably around 500,000, i.e. 10,000 cars a week. Deliveries for the year is still estimated to be around 400,000. The issue at hand is Tesla and its CEO, his attorney say did comply with the oversight policy by reviewing his tweet, providing context and clarity. The lawyer has also told the court his tweet simplify repeated information that Musk had already made on the earnings call, that Tesla and self-included in the 2018 annual report.The judge has to decide whether he is in contempt but I'm sure that the lawyers at the company have told Elon Musk stop calling the SEC, the (AUDIO GAP) or Short-Seller Enrichment Commission. And he hammered the SEC in that interview with "60 Minutes" at the end of the year. So, again, this is like a petty little fight between Musk and the SEC, maybe cooler heads will prevail.BARTIROMO: Yes, it sounds like that advice that you're bringing up there is probably the advice that the lawyers are giving him.MCDOWELL: How about shut up, shut up. Talk about -- worry about selling that Model 3 and like not closing stores and managing your company, rather than picking on the SEC.BARTIROMO: Unbelievable. All right. Thank you. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan, he's on the hot seat again on Capitol Hill today. Cheryl Casone with that story and headlines now. Cheryl, good morning to you.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria. And Tim Sloan is going to testify before the House Financial Services Committee today. He's going to focus on the fallout from the bank's fake account scandal. This is the first time a bank CEO is going to appear before the committee now that it is led by the Democrats. But Sloan's future may be in question, as regulators are seeking answers on whether he can repair the bank's image. Over the last year, Wells Fargo's stock down nearly 15 percent.Well, there are new details in the sexual harassment cases that happened over at Google. The tech giant paid $135 million to two top executives who left the company. They left over those allegations of sexual harassment, the price tag was revealed in a shareholder lawsuit at the time the reasons for the departures, Maria, were covered up. Now, we know what those two executives were paid off by Google.And then, automakers: Renault, Nissan, and Mitsubishi have created a new board of directors that excludes former Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn. The new board is going to oversee the French-Japanese partnership meeting every month in Tokyo or Paris. Ghosn still is one of eight members of Nissan's board, but his recent request to attend a Nissan board meeting, Maria, rejected by a judge. Ghosn was released last week from a Tokyo jail in $9 million bail after spending more than 100 days behind bars, he's accused still of underreporting his salary at Nissan which he denies. Now, we're just waiting for that trial to begin, Maria.BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl, thank you. We're going to take a short break. When we come back, the White House 2020 budget proposal is out, including billions of dollars for the military and funding for the border wall. We've got the breakdown next and the pushback. Plus, double trouble with fans, NBA star Russell Westbrook has some choice words for a couple of mid-game, while UFC Champ Connor McGregor allegedly smashes a fan's phone, and is later arrested. Sports is coming up.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, big show ahead -- conversation this morning. Joining the conversation is CFRA Investment Strategists Lindsey Bell, along with American Enterprise Institute President, Arthur C. Brooks is here. And Arthur, great to have you here, good to see you.ARTHUR BROOKS, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE: Thank you. Great to be with you.BARTIROMO: Lindsey, always a pleasure to see you. You're out with a new book called "Love Your Enemies: How Decent People Can Save America From the Culture of Contempt." Perfect timing to write such a book with all of the polarizing going on in this country.BROOKS: Yes, for sure. I mean, I was -- over the past couple of years, I've seen kind of this freight train coming down the tracks is pulling the country apart. And I was just blown away to see this data that one in six Americans have actually stopped talking to a family member or a close friend because of politics since the 2016 election. And it's wonderful stuff that shows that we're actually more polarized than the Israelis and Palestinians, that's how much we actually don't understand each other. I wrote a book on how we can actually get more -- we can actually be more persuasive, make our arguments better, at the same time become happier. So, this is really a guidebook on how to do that.BARTIROMO: And is this about Trump derangement syndrome?BROOKS: It's about everybody's derangement syndrome. What you find is that the Democrats are deranged about the Republicans. Republicans are deranged about the Democrats. And point in fact, 93 percent of us don't want to hate our neighbors. We hate how polarized we become as a country. So, we got to -- we actually can disagree, we should disagree, but we can do so and be happier, and actually win more arguments if we do it right.BARTIROMO: Dagen, please.MCDOWELL: Stay off social media.BROOKS: Yes, for sure.MCDOWELL: Isn't that part of the problem because I -- like, even over the weekend, it's the language that people use for attention. I was looking at Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's little speech or whatever you want to call it, at South By Southwest, and she was talking about automation and the use of -- the rise of robots in the workplace. And she said, we should not be haunted by the specter of being automated out of work. We should be excited by that, but the reason we're not excited by it is because we live in a society where if you don't have a job, you are left to die, and that is at its core, our problem. It's that kind of language that, again, people say these incendiary things for attention. And we let them get away with it, and then I just quote it or some part of the problem.BROOKS: Well, I mean, the big problem is that we -- a lot of people in social media, particularly anonymous, and so they say things that they wouldn't ever say in person. And just in general, you're not a human when you're not in person with somebody else looking into somebody else's eyes. And there's a (INAUDIBLE) of that. We don't see another person who simply has a different point of view. So, I do recommend to take people, like, a lot more time off social media. I recommend that people when they're on social media, they take responsibility for what they say, and that they mute the seven percent of Americans that are actually trying to fire us up and make us angry with each other, because they're getting rich and powerful and famous on the basis of this, including a lot of politicians that we all know.BARTIROMO: Yes, that's certainly the issue of the day, for sure. We're going to be talking about it this morning. We've got a big program ahead. We've got the Undersecretary of the U.S. Army here, Ryan McCarthy joining us, lots to talk about with him. Along with California Congressman and House Armed Services Committee member John Garamendi; The New Voice CEO and former presidential candidate Herman Cain is here, and Fox News Senior Strategic Analyst, four-star General Jack Keane joining us as well. Don't miss a moment of it. We got a big program ahead. We are also taking a look at earnings and economic data.Coming up, Facebook's mea culpa, the social media giant reversing course after removing ads from Senator Elizabeth Warren's presidential campaign that calls for a break-up of major tech companies. Then, the edge of the Big Apple, the world's highest outdoor viewing area set to open right here in Manhattan. We'll tell you more about that, coming up. Back in a moment.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Headlines across America now. The Detroit Free Press this morning writing about "What to do if your identity was stolen in the latest mass identity breach." This, after a malware attack at Wolverine Solutions Group, potentially exposed personal information of hundreds of thousands of patients. People who are affected will get a letter and are recommend to put a credit freeze and fraud alert on their account. The Salt Lake Tribune reporting this morning that the Utah House passes a bill to add an 86 percent tax on e-cigarettes. The tax is supposed to deter youth vaping, and generate more than $23 million in revenue. That money would be distributed to local health departments and provide increases for Medicaid expansion.The New York Time says, state lawmakers want to allow teenagers to get vaccines even if their parents say no. A new bill would let any kid, 14 or older, be vaccinated or given booster shots for a range of diseases including mumps, tetanus shots, and the flu and measles. This comes just days after a Congressional testimony from an Ohio teenager who got vaccinated against his mother's wishes, then appeared here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA to discuss the decision. Interesting stories this morning. What do you think about this e-cigarettes tax?LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA RESEARCH: I mean, 86 percent is pretty high, but it comes nowhere near to what the tax is on regular cigarettes. And here in New York State it's very high. So, I mean, I think it will deter teenage usage, but you know, I don't know about the tax revenue they're expecting.BARTIROMO: The tax revenue seems small.BELL: Yes.BROOKS: Yes. That's not the point. You tax things for two reasons, either to raise money or to discourage the behavior. Clearly, they're trying to discourage the behavior, and you find that taxes on that stuff actually disproportionately works with teenagers. So, that's why they're doing it, it's worked in the past, it's going to work again.BARTIROMO: You think it will work? All right.BROOKS: Yes, I think it will. I think it will discourage people from vaping and from e-cigarettes.MCDOWELL: But they'll tax anything for revenue. Remember tanning? They tax the tanning booth, the tanning tax and the Obamacare.(LAUGHTER)MCDOWELL: It was like a double-digit tax, too, it's like a 10-12 percent excess tax on tanning.BROOKS: Yes. But that was to discourage that, too. That was to discourage (INAUDIBLE)MCDOWELL: But it's what -- really?BROOKS: Yes.MCDOWELL: I really need the Democrats wringing their hands about me going and laying in a tanning bed.BROOKS: That's a different issue.BARTIROMO: That is wild.BROOKS: That's a different issue.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: Coming up, the White House's 2020 budget military spending will get a huge boost. We will tell you what programs will see a cut. That's after this, and then a recall alert to tell you about, Honda is recalling a million vehicles over faulty airbags. It is not the first time this has been done, we've got all the details after this. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, March 12th, your top stories right now 6:30 on the east coast on the button.Mixed performances, this morning, for the markets, Dow Industrials down again because of another decline in Boeing, but the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Futures are higher, NASDAQ up 10-1/2 points this morning.On top of gains across the board yesterday on Wall Street, stocks late-day rally yesterday driven by technology stocks. Pretty good rally at the close, Dow Industrials were up 200 points, 3 quarters of 1 percent, S&P 500 was up 1-1/2 percent and the NASDAQ up better than 2 percent.Global markets this morning, look like this, across Europe, we've got gains even though it's just fractional, FT-100 up 8-1/2 points, CAC Quarante in Paris, up 4 points, and the DAX Index in Germany up about 6 points.In Asia overnight, gains across the region, as you see, best performer there was Hong Kong and Japan, Japan up one and three quarters percent, Hang Seng and Hong Kong up 1-1/2 percent.Facebook under fire over ads, the social media giant has pulled Elizabeth Warren's political ads from the site. Now, it's apologizing, those ads had to do with breaking up technology.Recall alert, Honda takes roughly 1 million cars off the road in two separate recalls, some could catch fire. We've got all the details on what models we're talking about.And sports stars versus sports fans, Russell Westbrook threatened a couple during last night's game. Meanwhile, over at the UFC, star Conor McGregor was arrested, accused of smashing a fan's phone, the details in sports, right here, coming up.And a record sky-high view, it is not for the faint of heart, how you can get a look at New York City, coming up. Wait until you see that.All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning, but first, our top story this half an hour, President Trump unveiled his budget proposal for the fiscal year 2020. It includes boosting defense dollars to $750 billion and $8.6 billion for a southern border wall. It would also cut $818 billion in projected Medicare spending over 10 years.Joining me right now, Retired Four-Star General and FOX News Senior Strategic Analyst, General Jack Keane, General, good to see you this morning, thanks so much for being here.GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST: Yes, good to see you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Your reaction to the President's budget?KEANE: Well, his part of the down payment, we've got to make, to get the military out of the deep hole it's been in, why is it in such a big hole? Almost 17 years of fighting 9/11 wars and then, the Budget Control Act of sequestration, one of the most irresponsible reckless budget ever approved, kneecapped the military for the last four or five years.So, what President Trump has done, similar to what President Reagan did in the -- in the 1980s, is attempt to recover the military, this is the third budget. And we need about five or six years of this, steady state to be able to dig ourselves out of this hole.BARTIROMO: So, analyze why this is so important and compare the U.S.' budget and the expansion that you'd like to see in terms of military spending with the threats out there, General?KEANE: Yes, well, the major threats we are facing or return to big power competition with Russia and China, what's happening to us, Maria, well, United States military remains primary in the world. Russia and China have closed the technology gap advantage that we have, so much so, that even in some special areas, their capabilities exceed ours.And I spent a year on the commission of looking at the National Defense Strategy and we agree with what (INAUDIBLE) has been putting out recently in the last week or so, that if the United States fought a war with Russia or China, we would have casualty rates on personnel and high-capital assets not seen since World War II.And more than that and, indeed, quite alarming is the fact that we would struggle to win and could even lose and our generals are saying much the same thing, so this Trump budget is absolutely crucial to get us back to the kind of military dominance that we've had in the world.Not that we are looking for a fight, but what we have -- what we have found through the Cold War that when we have adequate military capabilities, it acts as a deterrence, and it worked very successfully with the Soviet Union.BARTIROMO: Yes.KEANE: We want to deter China and Russia, we don't want to fight them, and the way to do that is you have got to have the capabilities, they have to see it's real and they have to know that you're wanting to use it.BARTIROMO: You know, it's extraordinary when you look at the companies involved because in China, you've got companies that are doing what the Chinese government tell them to do, right? And Huawei is one of those companies that we talk about a lot and now there's a big threat around Huawei.In the U.S., you've got this really -- the leading technology companies in the world, working on the leading things from A.I. to robotics, et cetera, and they are saying we're not going to work with the U.S. government, some of them, anyway.I mean, that's the difference. Whereas the Chinese companies are ramping up doing what the Chinese government tells them to do and in America, some of the leading technology companies refuse to work with the U.S. government and the Pentagon.So, in February, we had Secretary of State Mike Pompeo here, talking about Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant, increasingly viewed as a spy tool of the Chinese government by the United States. This morning, the Wall Street Journal has their top story talking about this.And they report on a letter by Rick Grenell, in Berlin, rather, to the company -- the country's economics minister, and they're talking about something we knew already after Mike Pompeo broke the news, in an interview with me, here, in February. Listen to this, got to get your reaction.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: What we heard after your trip from Europe, there's a lot to talk about your trip to Poland because it was so important.But what we read in the Journal yesterday and a lot of the reports was that Europe is pushing back on this idea that President Trump and your administration wants to ban or potentially stop, slow down the use of Huawei technology. Is that what -- is that what you found in Europe?MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: So, we have spent time not just (INAUDIBLE) last week where we had some real successes, but over the past months, we've been out around the world just making sure everybody had the same information that countries understand the risk of putting this Huawei technology into their I.T. systems.We can't forget the systems were designed by -- with the express work alongside the Chinese PLI, their military in China. They are creating a real risk for these countries and their systems, the security of their people, Europeans care deeply about their privacy.The risk of privacy from this technology is very, very real and we're out sharing this information, the knowledge that America has gained through its vast network and making sure countries understand the risk. That's important. We think they'll make good decisions when they understand that risk.BARTIROMO: It's not even just the risks for them, it's the risks for the world, I mean, if you are in high-level talks about National Security, with Poland, with Five Eyes. I mean, Americans' information is out there too because China has tapped into their network?POMPEO: There's a second piece that we've shared with them as well, which is, if a country adopts this and puts it in some of their critical information systems, we won't be able to share information with them. We won't be able to work alongside them. In some cases, there's risk, we won't even be able to co-locate American resources, an American embassy, an American military outposts.There's real risk and we want to make sure they know, not only the rest of their own people, but their risk of being able to work alongside the United States in keeping the world safe.(END VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: You know, General, when he said that to me, I was really struck, because that was, in fact, the first time that the U.S. made it official that they would share less information with European countries that use Huawei, your reaction?KEANE: Yes. We really don't have much choice. What's happening here, is that Trump administration is playing catch-up because the Obama administration just summarily ignored the threat of Huawei and its development of the 5G and Artificial Intelligence technology. And we were -- we were seeding the ground to them, as a matter of fact.So, we really appreciate what Secretary Pompeo is doing to General Scaparrotti who's the Supreme Allied Commander in NATO in testimony last week, mentioned the danger of Huawei, he could envision a time in the future if Europe goes by the way of Huawei and the Communist Chinese government, because that's really who they are.That we wouldn't be able to work side by side with NATO military countries and that is absolutely alarming, given the reality of what we are facing here.BARTIROMO: Yes, it really is, but these systems were cheap, I mean, that's how the Chinese got so many countries throughout Europe, throughout Africa, to adopt their Huawei systems because it was very cheap. They said to African countries too, don't worry, we've got your back, we'll do your infrastructure set-up and they need the access to this -- to the technology, so they did it.KEANE: Yes. And let's be factual here, the Communist Chinese Party, running China, is the number one prolific theft cyber offensive capability in the world.BARTIROMO: Right.KEANE: Nobody comes even close to them. They steal data by the billions, on a regular basis. What am I talking about? Intellectual property, we know about that, intelligence, and also personal data, and they are --What they are seeking here is to have access to any data that would be of vital interest to them throughout Europe, Europe is their second customer beyond China itself, and they are in a full court press to get the 5G network wireless system and to own that system inside of Europe.And what that would mean to them, give them incredible geopolitical leverage and influence over Europe. I'm stunned that the Europeans can actually entertain this thought, because while it may be, in fact, be cheaper to do that, the net loss in the long run is staggering for those countries involved.BARTIROMO: Does it hurt the U.S. as well, though, not to be able to share the information it needs to with European partners?KEANE: Oh, yes, absolutely, and vice versa. Listen, standing up against the threats that we have in the world, is the allies working together that enable us to provide adequate deterrence.BARTIROMO: Yes.KEANE: And it's absolutely crucial that we do this not just in Europe, but also in emerging countries around the world as well.BARTIROMO: General, great insights as always, thanks so much.KEANE: Good talking to you, Maria.BARTIROMO: We'll see you soon, sir, General Jack Keane, joining us.Meanwhile, there's this, Facebook this morning is backtracking, after removing Senator Elizabeth Warren's ads, Cheryl Casone with the details here, this is a -- this is a biggie, Cheryl.CASONE: It's really interesting what Facebook did here, Maria. So, they've now restored Senator Warren's ads, following the reports that they were taken down.These ads posted by Warren's presidential campaign called for the break-up of technology giants, including Facebook, Amazon, Google, the Facebook claims it removed them because they've violated its policies against the use of its corporate logo.After restoring the ads, Facebook now says it wants to allow a robust debate, kind of a head scratcher here. Anyway, move on.Now, let's talk about these recalls at Honda this morning, about a million older vehicles in the U.S. and Canada need air bag inflators replaced. The Takata inflators installed during previous recalls, they could be dangerous. The models affected, go back as far as 2001.Then, there's this, Maria, as a New Yorker, you are going to love this one, we are now building the world's highest outdoor observation deck in this city, to better enjoy the Big Apple's famous skyline. The sky scraper is being built at 30 Hudson Yards. It's going to feature an open air viewing area that jets out on the 100th floor.They're going to call the New York edge, the nine-foot tall angled glass surrounding the deck allows visitors to lean over and look down on Manhattan, like lean over on the glass, from 1,100 feet in the air. I know. I know. It's expected to open in early 2020.BARTIROMO: I don't know about that.CASONE: Would you? I mean, would you -- would you go up there?BARTIROMO: I would, but I'm not leaning on anything, but yes, I would. I'm not afraid to go up.CASONE: Not sure. I will salute you as you're up there. It freaks me out.BARTIROMO: It is. It definitely is. Thanks Cheryl. Coming up, double trouble, get this, NBA star Russell Westbrook has a row with fans, middle of the game, while UFC champ Conor McGregor is arrested for allegedly smashing somebody else's phone. Wild sports this morning.Then, quarterback, Nick Foles, joining the new team, the Lululemon team, we will tell you all about his ambassadorship with the brand, next up, right here, in sports.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Oklahoma City star, Russell Westbrook, in a heated exchange with a fan in Utah. Jared Max is here with sports, and what a sports report today, Jared.JARED MAX, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SPORTS REPORTER: A lot of fighting, Maria. Westbrook said that he was heckled by two fans that were seated together at the game -- a couple who NBA star accused of making a comment toward that was racial and inappropriate. Westbrook was caught on video making threats of violence to the pair saying he would mess them up, but he didn't say mess. After the game, Westbrook said he's not a violent person.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RUSSELL WESTBROOK, PROFESSIONAL BASKETBALL PLAYER: To say being disrespectful about me and my family to many years -- I've done all good things; I've never done anything to hurt or harm anybody. I've never been in trouble. I've never fought a fan, been in the league 11 years, clean slate.(END VIDEO CLIP)MAX: Shane Keisel and Jennifer Huff say, they did not do anything wrong, told Westbrook to put ice on the knee.Conor McGregor in trouble with the law, again. And it's just around a year ago, he threw that hand dolly into the bus in Brooklyn. Well, this time Miami Beach Police say that the 30-year-old fighter was leaving the Fountain Blue Hotel early Monday morning when a fan tried to take his photograph. McGregor allegedly slapped the phone from the fan's hand and then stomped on it repeatedly and walked away with it. He's charged with felony, strong-armed robbery and criminal mischief. Just a couple of hours ago, McGregor posted this on Instagram. The shirt he's wearing says: McGregor is back. He writes: "Patience in this world is a virtue. I continue to work on. I love my fans, dearly. Love you all."Former Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl MVP, Nick Foles, will officially become a member of the Jacksonville Jaguars tomorrow. His deal, four years, $88 million -- with $50 million of that guarantied. Meanwhile, Foles, also yesterday, announced that he would become a brand ambassador for Lululemon. He says, it's all about, like him, community mindfulness and the sweat life. He's the first mainstream sports endorsers for Lululemon, which makes technical athletic clothes for those who sweat. And Nick Foles knows how to sweat. They say, "We just landed the sought-after free agent in football. Welcome to the team Nick Foles." New start.BARTIROMO: Do we know what they're paying him, at Lululemon?MAX: We don't know yet what they're paying. And he's getting a lot of money, though, to play for Jacksonville Jaguars, and now it'll be put up or shut up time, because he's got to kind of play as the understudy in Philadelphia -- not as much expected and he just performed one time after another.MCDOWELL: McGregor might want to shut up and stay at home. What do you make 100 million on the Mayweather fight? There's no quicker way to lose money all that money than basically being a steaming jerk.MAX: Is this good for the sport? Is this good for UFC? I don't --BARTIROMO: I don't think so. No way.BROOKS: Yes, it's going to be more mainstream. As it is, it looks too violent, it looks too fringe, and if you want to make it in mainstream sport, you have to make it mover civilized.MCDOWELL: It's very mainstream already, number one. But I want to see another fight with Nurmagomedov --MAX: Khabib.MCDOWELL: Khabib Nurmagomedov, yes.BELL: Well, I think it's kind of good marketing, because it will people want to come out and see the underdog beat this bad guy now, right?MAX: Yes, I agree. I think for the mainstream, this guy is the face of a sport, a little bit more class.BARTIROMO: Read Arthur's book, "Love Your Enemies."BARTIROMO: That's exactly right.MCDOWELL: I would just say that sport is already main -- it's extremely mainstream now.MAX: And look at all the violence, we need to tone it down.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: You can't get mad about that, and I get mad about football.BARTIROMO: True. Jared, thanks.MAX: Thanks, Maria.BARTIROMO: Catch Jared's sports reports on Fox News Headlines 24/7 or in radio SiriusXM 115. Quick break and then eye on trade. Investors are watching and waiting for a firm deal between U.S. and China, as no date has been set for a summit between Xi Jinping and President Trump. More on that right after this.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. U.S.-China trade now, markets were higher overnight in Asia. As you see, investors are watching the future of a deal as top officials from both countries held a phone conversation overnight. It comes amid uncertainty over meeting between President Trump and Xi Jinping. Right now, no date is on the calendar. We were expecting the end of March in Mar-a-Lago. Joining us now is Larrea Wealth Management CEO, Aquiles Larrea. Great to see you, Aquiles. Thanks for being here. How much is a deal with China important for investors right now?AQUILES LARREA, CEO, LARREA WEALTH MANAGEMENT: Well, it's important from the sense that it's kind of already figured into this market that we're seeing. However, there are lots of nuances, we're seeing that China, which owns Volvo is looking to take that car maker electric. We're also looking to see are they going to be able to -- with the soybeans, are they going to fulfill that obligation to the United States and with the current talks with Mnuchin and their counterparts, are we going to really see a difference in the trade talks or is it already priced in and is it a nonfactor?BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, the tariffs are obviously a big issue, Dagen, you've been talking about the impact of tariffs for a long-time. It's actually weakened China's economy.MCDOWELL: It's weakened China's economy, it's putting pressure on a bunch of different industries here in the United States as well, particularly in any industry that uses steel and aluminum. But I know Lindsey wanted to get in.BELL: Yes. No, I mean, the industrial sector is one area that's really benefited from the China expectation for a China deal to get done, up 18- 1/2 percent year to date versus the market up like 9-1/2 percent. But you like that are, why? And how far do you see it going?LARREA: I tend to like areas that get beat up. I mean, we're seeing with Boeing right now, even before all of this has happened, Boeing was up year to date 12 percent, and the year before it was up 24 percent.BARTIROMO: Huge. Had a huge '18.LARREA: Yes. I mean, huge take away of 30 plus percent even before all of this thing started.BARTIROMO: And that was based on commercial traffic and how well the economy was going.LARREA: Correct, and there are a lot of related industries in the industrials that could benefit from this short-term down trend, and of course long-term uptrend.BARTIROMO: So, what are you saying about Boeing? You want to buy it or sell it? What do you say?LARREA: We're doing white boats from drills right now. In other words, we're selling off a portion, and we're keeping little bit for a rainy day, but we're definitely taking a little bit of profits in there.BROOKS: What do you see, actually, as the business cycle going forward? Are you one of the guys that's expecting in the next 12 months to start going into a real recession?LARREA: Well, you know, I'm not going to disagree with people that are much smarter than I. You know, they tend to say, hey, we're looking at 2020, 2021 for recession, and I believe that is -- although it's possible, how severe will the recession be and I don't think it's going to be as severe as they are predicting.BARTIROMO: But you've got to allocate capital based on the backdrop, what kind of backdrop are you expecting from the U.S. economy?LARREA: Well, you know, we're hoping that the U.S. economy is going to keep growing and with all the moves that we're making in place, that it's going to keep growing and we're going to keep benefiting from that.BARTIROMO: All right. Aquiles, good to see you. Thanks so much.LARREA: Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: Aquiles Larrea. We'll be right back. We've got a story on Apple revealing the date for a big event, stay with us.Load-Date: March 12, 2019End of Document

CHINA SENDS AIR NZ FLIGHT HOME OVER MENTION OF 'TAIWAN': LOCAL MEDIAStates News ServiceFebruary 12, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1306 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:An Air New Zealand flight has been denied permission to land in Shanghai after the Chinese authorities discovered a reference to Taiwan in its documentation, supposedly an indication of the country's support for independence for the democratic island."Multiple sources say paperwork for the Air NZ flight 289, which returned to Auckland after several hours in the air included reference to Taiwan which China took to be an acknowledgement that the island was independent," New Zealand's Stuff.co.nz news website reported.While the People's Republic of China's ruling Communist Party has refused diplomatic ties with any country that recognizes Taiwan, this is the first time that another country's flag carrying airline has been sent home in mid-air over the issue.According to passenger Eric Hundman, Air NZ hadn't disclosed a detailed explanation for the flight's Monday turnaround."The aircraft operating your flight did not have regulatory approval to land in China and was required to return to Auckland," the airline said in a screenshot of a text message sent to passengers posted to Hundman's Twitter account.Chen Weijian, the New Zealand-based editor-in-chief of the political magazine Beijing Spring, said the emerging reports appeared to contradict an earlier statement from New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern, who said the plane's forced U-turn had nothing to do with politics.Chen said the incident is likely an escalation from earlier objections from Beijing to international airlines that listed Taiwan as a separate destination, rather than as a city within China.China last year issued a number of complaints about companies' use of the word "Taiwan," especially where its usage implied a territory that is distinct and separate from its own.In April 2018 , Beijing's Civil Aviation Administration requested that foreign airlines take "Taiwan," "Hong Kong" and "Macau" out of their lists of countries, or standalone destinations.However, Hong Kong and Macau are former colonies that have returned to Chinese rule, while Taiwan has never been ruled by the Chinese Communist Party. The requests were rejected at the time by the U.S. government as "Orwellian nonsense.""I think the main problem here is that Taiwan was given an independent listing," Chen said. "I think that [Ardern] was, quite frankly, just trying to play down the incident ... They wanted to deal with the matter privately, by accepting China's demand that Taiwan not be given separate status as an independent country or region."Long-term influence campaignHe said the New Zealand government had been the target of a long-term influence campaign by the Chinese Communist Party."Communist Party infiltration in New Zealand is actually very serious," Chen said. "New Zealand has typically followed Australia's lead in the past, but now they are distancing themselves from Australia and cozying up to China."Yang Sen-hong, president of the Taiwan Association for China Human Rights, said Beijing has no right to make such claims about the island, which it has never governed."Taiwan has never been a part of [the People's Republic of] China," Yang told RFA. "This insistence that people list Taiwan as part of Chinese territory is a lie.""They try it on and then when it doesn't work, they fly into a rage," he said. "That's not how an major country should behave. I think that if they carry on like this, it's going to cause more and more of a backlash among other countries."He said Taiwan needs to stick to its point of view. "We need to keep on hitting back strongly whenever the Chinese Communist Party does such things," Yang said.Last month, Taiwan president Tsai Ing-wen rejected calls from Chinese President Xi Jinping for the democratic island to "unify" with the People's Republic, saying its people have no wish to give up their sovereignty.In a Jan. 2 "Letter to our Taiwan compatriots," Xi swapped the Chinese Communist Party's previous insistence on the idea that Taiwan is part of a divided "One China" for a new theme: "unification.""It has been a historical and unavoidable duty of the Chinese Communist Party, Chinese government and the Chinese people to resolve the matter of Taiwan and unify the motherland ever since 1949," Xi said in the statement.But he made scant reference to public opinion among the 23 million inhabitants of Taiwan, which his party has never ruled, and warned: "We make no promise to renounce the use of military force, and reserve the right to take all necessary measures to deal with hostile foreign forces and a tiny minority of separatists and their splittist activities."Xi urged Taiwan to work towards "unification" under the "one country, two systems" model that was promised to Hong Kong after its 1997 handover to China, rather than the direct imposition of Communist Party rule. However, that city's autonomy has been eroded in recent years by a series of high-profile interventions from Beijing, according to U.S. and U.K. officials, Hong Kong's Bar Association, and international rights groups.Taiwan rejects 'one country, two systems'Tsai Ing-wen responded by asserting the right of Taiwan's 23 million inhabitants to decide their own fate."I want to reiterate that Taiwan absolutely will not accept 'one country, two systems,'" Tsai said. "The vast majority of public opinion in Taiwan is also resolutely opposed to 'one country, two systems.'"Beijing has never accepted the status of Taiwan as a sovereign power, although the Republic of China government established by the nationalist Kuomintang (KMT) fled to the island in 1949 after losing a civil war to Mao Zedong's communists.Officially, Taiwan is still known as the Republic of China, which controls the four islands of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu. Beijing has refused diplomatic ties with any country that also recognizes the Republic of China, and actively encourages Taiwan's partners to switch recognition.Instead, China insists that Taiwan is a breakaway province of the People's Republic of China, and refuses to engage in government-to-government talks, while Tsai has called on Beijing to handle negotiations on an equal basis.Taiwan was ruled as a Japanese colony in the 50 years prior to the end of World War II, but was handed back to the 1911 Republic of China under the nationalist Kuomintang government as part of Tokyo's post-war reparation deal.When the Kuomintang regime fled to Taiwan in 1947 after losing a civil war to Mao Zedong's communist troops, the Republic of China government ceased to control most of China, though it continues to be the official name of the Taiwan government.The island began a transition to democracy following the death of Chiang's son, President Chiang Ching-kuo, in January 1988 , starting with direct elections to the legislature in the early 1990s and culminating in the first direct election of a president, Lee Teng-hui, in 1996.Recent opinion polls indicate that there is broad political support for continued self-rule in Taiwan, where the majority of voters identify as Taiwanese rather than Chinese.In September, the state-backed Global Times newspaper hit out at Apple over its listing of Taiwan, Hong Kong, and mainland China as separate entities, claiming that the democratic island of Taiwan is "an inalienable part" of China's territory.Hong Kong and Taiwan were listed "on par" with China on a slide showing markets for the new iPhone XS, the Global Times newspaper, sister paper to ruling Chinese Communist Party mouthpiece the People's Daily, said. China has also complained about a similar listing for the island on the website of furniture giant Ikea.Reported by Ng Yik-tung and Sing Man for RFA's Cantonese Service, and by Hsia Hsia-hwa for the Mandarin Service.

Differences Between Chinese and US Debt Collection System Explored; Dean Kaplan Educates Chinese Government Officials on US Debt Collection PracticesPR NewswireJanuary 16, 2019 Wednesday 4:00 AM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 443 wordsDateline: SAN LUIS OBISPO, Calif., Jan. 16, 2019 BodyPR NewswireSAN LUIS OBISPO, Calif., Jan. 16, 2019 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Dean Kaplan, CEO of The Kaplan Group, a highly successful commercial collection agency, was recently invited by the United States-China Exchange Council (USCEC) to meet with a delegation of Chinese government officials and discuss the US commercial collection system.The meeting, which was scheduled to last for 90 minutes, lasted over three hours as the Chinese delegation questioned Kaplan about details of the US system and Kaplan's business, including The Kaplan Group's ability to collect on debt without engaging in shaming practices or taking companies to court."Obviously, my main business goal is to help my clients," says Kaplan "but I do consider it part of my personal mission to educate the public about debt collection. I was honored to be asked to present to this group. The Chinese business community is working to establish a uniform system, similar to our own Uniform Commercial Code. Given that it took the US ten years to develop the code, I think this is a long-term process."Kaplan says the Chinese delegation was most interested in learning how his company has an 85% success rate on large viable claims without engaging in practices such as harassment, embarrassment or litigation in over 97% of successful collections. They were also very interested in the role that Internet research plays in evaluating a company's reputation as a credit risk, US laws regulating the rates of interest that can be charged, and how corporations and LLCs shield owners from personal liability. Kaplan was interested to learn that personal liability for business owners is much more prevalent in China than it is in the US."All in all, it was a great meeting," says Kaplan. "There was a lot of laughter, a lot of questions, and a lot of information sharing. I always appreciate the chance to share best practices and ideas, and to learn new information about international trade."Kaplan's website has information about the debt collection industry and several of the free resources that Kaplan shared with the delegation.About The Kaplan Group:The Kaplan Group, Inc. is a commercial collections agency founded in 1991. Known in the industry as "The Large Claim Experts", the company provides B2B debt collection services on a contingency basis throughout the USA for domestic and international clients. Dean Kaplan has completed over $500 million in transactions during his career and personally handles all large claims.

Senate Commerce Subcommittee Issues Testimony From Harvard Kennedy SchoolTargeted News ServiceMarch 7, 2019 Thursday 7:00 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 3180 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation subcommittee on Security issued the following testimony by Eric Rosenbach, co-director of the Harvard Kennedy School's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, at a hearing entitled "China: Challenges for U.S. Commerce":"Chairman Sullivan, Ranking Member Markey, other distinguished members of the sub-committee on security, thank you for calling this important hearing on "China's Challenges to US Commerce" and for the invitation to testify today."This hearing is important: China is moving very quickly into the Information Age with a strategic approach that bolsters their national interests. The United States, on the other hand, seems to be standing by, beholden to large technology companies focused primarily on connecting more people to generate more data to further bolster their profits. In the absence of a national strategy to protect Americans' data, promote the competitiveness of American firms, and secure our information and technology infrastructure assets, the U.S. risks ceding its leadership role in the future economic, military, and political landscapes.The Information Age"This is the Information Age. And information is now the world's most consequential and contested geopolitical resource. The world's most profitable businesses have understood for years that data is the "new oil." Political operatives - and, unfortunately, foreign intelligence operatives as well - have shown over the past two presidential elections that data-driven social media is the key to influencing public opinion. Leading researchers in the area of artificial intelligence know that good data, not just algorithms, will allow companies, and nations, to gain a competitive edge."Data-driven innovation is not only disrupting economies and societies; it is reshaping relations between nations, and there is no better example than the US-China relationship. The pursuit of information power - involving states' ability to acquire, refine, protect, and use information to advance their interests - is changing strategic priorities. In the current US-China trade negotiations, for example, IP theft and state-support for tech companies is on the table next to soybean and automobile tariffs. American policymakers are questioning a long-standing tenet of the US economic system: openness to foreign investment. In short, the pursuit of information power is altering strategic and economic relations between nations."In the 1990s, America's supremacy in information technologies and the internet seemed unassailable. Unfortunately, as the importance of information as a geopolitical resource has waxed, US dominance has waned. States with authoritarian forms of government - and China in particular - first recognized the strategic importance of information, and have adapted their national laws and policies accordingly. America's economic competitors believe they are locked in a zero-sum competition to create, collect, buy or steal data, and to develop the talent and technology to convert it into strategic advantage."Data held by both corporate and government entities has more strategic value than ever before because of its importance in developing artificial intelligence. A technical wunderkind is no longer as critical to writing a good AI learning algorithm; instead, what developers most require are troves of high-quality data to train and optimize algorithms over time. As a result, states have a strong interest in developing, accessing or stealing commercial, private and government data necessary to train and optimize AI algorithms."Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, for example, believes that "whoever acquires and controls" data will attain "hegemony." In his recent book AI Superpower s, venture capitalist Kai-Fu Lee predicts that China's widening lead in artificial intelligence will not only ensure the "economic balance of power tilts in China's favor," but will tilt "political influence and 'soft power,' towards China," and cement its "cultural and ideological footprint around the globe.""Most developed economies now have national "artificial intelligence"strategies. None are more mercantilist than China's "Development Plan for a New Generation of Artificial Intelligence," which aims through a combination of government subsidies and incentives to push China into leading the world in AI by 2030.The Competitive Threat from China"Over the past decade, China has pursued a national strategy to challenge the United States' global leadership in the Information Age through a conscious strategy of state-backed investment, loose consumer data privacy protections, a centralized AI and technology deployment strategy, and intelligence operations to steal crucial data and intellectual property."The Chinese government has invested heavily in the research and development of technology that underpins supercomputing, artificial intelligence, broadband networks and big data. Those investments have resulted in genuine achievements. In 2016, for example, China unveiled the world's fastest supercomputer - and announced that it owned more of the top 500 supercomputers than any other nation in the world. Chinese firms and research institutions, nearly always supported with state funds, have made advances in artificial intelligence that some corporate leaders believe will make China the world leader in hardware-based AI."President Xi has also advanced his nation's strategic plans by developing and supporting firms in key areas of economic power with state-sponsored loans, contracts and research and development. One of the best known of these Chinese "national champions" is Huawei, now the largest telecommunications equipment maker in the world. The significant resources Huawei derives from the backing of the Chinese government puts American and European telecommunications equipment providers at a clear disadvantage, particularly when it comes to developing and deploying some of the technology necessary for next generation broadband networks."The Chinese government has also devoted significant military intelligence capabilities to steal the data and intellectual property needed to fulfill the ambitious goals established for President Xi's "Made in China 2025 Plan." Over the past decade, Chinese intelligence officers from the People's Liberation Army (PLA) have conducted thousands of cyberattacks against both private sector and government targets. The Chinese, for example, were almost certainly responsible for the hacks and the theft of hundreds of millions of Americans' data from the Office of Personnel Management, Marriot, Anthem Health and Equifax. Although the PLA undoubtedly used this for intelligence purposes, it's highly likely that this high-quality data was also used to help the government-sponsored development of AI capabilities."Over the past decade, Chinese intelligence operatives have been equally aggressive in systematically stealing intellectual property and trade secrets from American organizations essential to national competitiveness. "More than 90 percent of the department's cases alleging economic espionage over the past seven years involve China," deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein said after an indictment unsealed in December 2018."The Obama Administration's response to these attacks was slow and initially weak, but by 2015 the Administration finally recognized the need to confront Chinese leadership with explicit attribution, sanctions and improved cyber defenses. These actions resulted in a short-term drop in Chinese cyberattacks against the US. Over the past 18 months, however, Chinese cyber operations have resumed. In the most recent annual national threat assessment, for example, Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats said that, "China will continue to use cyber-espionage and bolster cyberattack capabilities to support [its] national security priorities." This past December, the FBI's top counterintelligence official asserted that, "Our prosperity and place in the world are at risk."What Congress Must Do"As the Information Age advances, the United States needs to recognize that data collection and technology deployment are critical both from the perspective of economic competitiveness and national security. Looking over the horizon, adversaries will greatly increase operations to steal sensitive and valuable information in order to advance their strategic and economic advantage over the United States. Given the richness of data held by the largest companies and research centers in the tech, financial and healthcare sectors, it is highly likely that adversary intelligence services will expand their traditional targets to include corporate datasets that could be used to train AI systems and to hone information operations."US policy responses to these threats should be centered around a few guiding principles:1. The Information Age demands a data-centric security and economic strategy: America needs to develop a data-focused strategy for competitiveness. From a security perspective, a network-centric approach to national security is failing. Focus on the threat of a low probability catastrophic attack on critical infrastructure networks, for example, has distracted leaders from the reality that we are not defending the nation's most precious resource: information. Likewise, the government has done very little to prioritize the centers of gravity for an economy powered for the Information Age.2. The privacy of personal information is a national security and economic priority. Policies aimed at bolstering US national security and promoting US economic competitiveness must go hand-in-hand with consumer protection. Authoritarian governments may ignore consumer rights in pursuit of acquiring information power, but democracies cannot. Bolstering the global competitiveness of American companies should remain a top priority, but not at the expense of allowing these companies to collect, use, and sell information without user consent or under-invest in cybersecurity measures.3. America needs a whole-of-government strategy to improve national competitiveness in the Information Age. Information geopolitics cuts across all aspects of the economy, society and state security apparatus. Authoritarian governments have adopted a highly centralized, mercantilist approach to protecting, acquiring and using information. Centralization will not be the answer for democracies, but coordination must be. Unprecedented cooperation is required, across economic, social, defense, intelligence, state department and homeland security portfolios. For example, the American government can no silo regulatory decisions about information-related companies separate from foreign policy decisions on cyberspace.4. Even further, America needs a whole-of-nation strategy that includes coordination with the private sector. The US intelligence community needs to share threat information about foreign intelligence organizations with the social media platforms that so directly influence Americans' economic and political decision. Policymakers must be willing to work with private actors to ensure regulatory red tape does not stand in the way of innovation, and that public-private partnerships continue to create incentives to accelerate technology development. At the same time, American technology firms need to understand, and be held accountable for, their role in protecting national security interests."These principles should be combined with forward-leaning policy action. Specifically:* Pass national data security and privacy legislation. Information is and will be the nation's most import strategic resource for the next century. Yet, even in the face of inadequate data protection practices and damaging data breaches, the US continues to muddle along with a complex web of state-based and industry-specific requirements."American consumers are worse off because their data is unprotected and, in the event of a personally costly data breach, their rights and access to legal recourse are unclear. American companies are left to deal with competing and possibly contradictory requirements, in particular impacting early innovators and small businesses without the resources to navigate this complex environment."US policymakers urgently need to pass a national law that will protect user data, reduce regulatory complexity, and spur innovation by reconciling differences in state and federal requirements. W hile Europe's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is by no means a perfect model and in some respects is inconsistent with other US values, it has been effective at driving corporate investment in data protection. Data protection legislation passed in California in June 2018 will need fine-tuning before taking effect in 2020, but it establishes important principles that could serve as the foundation for national legislation.* Promote competitiveness of American firms: China undeniably has an advantage in data collection, by virtue of its large population and weak data privacy protection policies. While data is an important input, it is not the only determinant of competitiveness in the information age. China's authoritarian system also gives it a deployment advantage, but the US can do a lot more to reduce regulatory red tape, attract top talent, and create other incentives to spur innovation.- Ensure regulation supports competitiveness of American firms in critical sectors. A key driver of the information age has been the exponential growth of high-speed wireless broadband infrastructure around the world. American firms are currently locked in a tight competition with Chinese powerhouses to determine who will dominate this important area. The US government - and the FTC in particular - should make sure that regulations designed to protect consumers and competition don't inadvertently undermine the competitiveness of American firms relative to Chinese national champions like Huawei.- Reduce regulatory red tape to expedite deployment of next-generation broadband infrastructure. Nationwide 5G deployment is a massive effort requiring equipment installation and associated permits and approval processes across thousands of localities. Yet without this foundation, the US risks falling behind in the next generation of wireless-enabled technologies. Policymakers must drive toward regulation that standardizes and fast-tracks local approvals, while giving local authorities the opportunity to provide implementation guidance.- Continue public-private partnerships that support advanced technology development. Within the framework of robust national data privacy and security laws, the US government should promote more partnerships with civilian companies and academic institutions to make progress on high-priority AI initiatives. For example, the Defense Innovation Unit - Experimental (DIUx), established by DoD for this purpose, provides a model for incentivizing the private sector to develop technologies with direct national security applications.- Win the race for talent. The US has a history of prizing and nurturing openness, creativity, and innovation. Our university system is a springboard for raw talent; our legal and government institutions allow new businesses to thrive; and our sophisticated financial system enable the best ideas to be successful. To maintain a competitive edge, the US needs a foundation of policies and practices that continue to attract top talent, like the heads of AI at Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, and Google's cloud computing division, who were all born outside the US. The visa program is a good place to start -- at minimum, Congress should ensure that more highly skilled workers are able to obtain H-1B visas. Policymakers should further consider special programs for students and experts in the AI and broader set of STEM fields.* Protect American information and infrastructure assets: Good offense that promotes US economic competitiveness must be coupled with good defense that bolsters the US system against foreign attacks and takeovers.- Incentivize use of strong encryption. Making America the world leader in encryption technology could advance both economic and national security interests. Protecting the nation's most important resource will require a significant expansion in the use of encryption. The nation's defense and security agencies have relied on encryption to protect its most precious secrets for many decades - DoD, in fact, is the largest user of encryption in the world. The US must both clarify the legal questions around encryption and develop real incentives to promote the use and growth of encryption products and platforms that allow individuals and organizations to protect their data.- Limit foreign ownership and provide resources to support firms in key information sectors. Over the past decade China has systematically targeted investment in and ownership of firms developing technology, such as AI, that will drive strategic advantage in the Information Age. Congress took encouraging action by reforming and passing legislation that increased limitations and oversight of foreign ownership and involvement in data-rich sectors. This was important, but should be supplemented with new sources of incentives to sustain American tech firms whose technology does not have an immediate commercial application.* Deter Chinese actions to steal our national resources by defending America's interests in cyberspace: Our response to Chinese cyber-attacks that steal personal data and intellectual property has been weak, resulting in the perception by China that an attack on the American economy will not incur costs. The US needs a strong national response to demonstrate that interference with American information and infrastructure assets in any manner is unacceptable. We have to raise the cost of attacks and decrease the benefits that our adversaries seek.- Publicly attribute attacks to raise costs to adversaries. The increased willingness of the Intelligence Community, DHS, and FBI publically to attribute Chinese cyber attacks through indictments is crucial and positive first step.- Develop precise and legal offensive cyber operations that change the current dynamic of America simply sitting back and absorbing the blows of adversarial actions . Good defenses are important, but defense will not alone mitigate the threat of foreign attacks. To complement defensive measures, the U.S. government, led by the Department of Defense, needs to bolster its capabilities to disrupt and degrade Chinese cyber operations before they succeed.- Improve intelligence sharing with the private sector. The Intelligence Community should also strive to share as much intelligence information as possible about Chinese cyber operations. In the past, the government has too often watched important intellectual property or data flow out of the country without warning impacted organizations."[TheHill]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6638912 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: March 8, 2019End of Document

MCHENRY EXAMINES CHINESE ATTEMPT TO USE COMPLEX FINANCING SCHEME TO OBTAIN RESTRICTED SATELLITE TECHNOLOGYStates News ServiceFebruary 1, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1166 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Financial Services, Republican:Congressman Patrick McHenry (NC-10), Republican leader of the House Financial Services Committee, sent a letter requesting information from Boeing Co. to shed light on a potential attempt by the Chinese government to skirt U.S. laws to obtain restricted satellite technology. In the letter, Ranking Member McHenry detailed the intended 2016 sale of a Boeing satellite to Los Angeles start-up, Global IP, and the "red flags" that should have been raised when a reported "$200 million in funding was channeled from a state-owned Chinese company through several shell companies, to Global IP" to finance the project. Due to the serious economic and national security threats posed by China, there are several U.S. laws that have "effectively barred" U.S. companies from exporting satellite technology to the Chinese. However, an aggressive China continues to steal sensitive intellectual property and hack U.S. firms, posing a systemic risk Ranking Member McHenry has previously urged the Committee to examine. The Congressman states that Boeing can assist the Committee's investigation to determine whether "a firm with connections to the Chinese government may have used a complex financing arrangement in an attempt to skirt U.S. export controls related to national security." Read the full text of the letter below. Mr. Dennis A. Muilenburg Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer The Boeing Company 100 North Riverside Chicago, Illinois 60606 Dear Mr. Muilenburg: In 2016, Boeing entered into negotiations for the manufacture and sale of a satellite to Los Angeles-based start-up Global IP. Global IP intended to use the satellite to improve internet access in Africa. Global IP needed to raise capital for the project and, according to reports, about $200 million in funding was channeled from a state-owned Chinese company through several shell companies, to Global IP. The original source of the financing, however, should have raised red flags. Under several U.S. laws, U.S. companies are "effectively barred" from exporting satellite technology to China in the interest of national security. National security experts are concerned satellites such as the one Boeing proposed to sell to Global IP, which relies on restricted technology, could be repurposed by the Chinese government for military activities. Indeed, a source close to the project stated "once it's up there, whoever is the owner can choose whichever customers and whichever uses he wants." Global IP co-founders Emil Youssefzadeh and Umar Javed (the Founders) first conceived of the satellite in 2008 and began seeking financial backing. State-owned Chinese company China Orient Asset Management Co. (China Orient) contacted the Founders in 2015. The Founders flew to Beijing to meet with Geng Zhiyuan, the son of a personal friend of Chinese President Xi Jinping, and within days, China Orient pledged to fund the project. However, because U.S. laws prohibited China Orient from taking a large share of equity, Global IP and China Orient agreed to use a shell company, Bronzelink Holdings Ltd. (Bronzelink), to funnel money from China Orient through a subsidiary to Bronzelink and then to Global IP. Bronzelink was not encumbered by the rules that prevented China Orient and other Chinese companies from controlling the satellite technology because the company was set up in the British Virgin Islands, by a businessman who held a passport from Hong Kong. Bronzelink took a 75 percent stake in the company. According to the Founders' counsel, the deal was legal so long as Bronzelink was independent from the Chinese Government. After a number of interventions on the part of China Orient and its subsidiaries, including attempts to see "hundreds of [restricted] pages of exhibits detailing how Boeing's technology worked," Global IP determined it could not certify its independence from the Chinese government, and thus would be ineligible to purchase the satellite. The attempts to view restricted information came from several new members of the Global IP board, who arrived in Los Angeles from China led by a lawyer who represented China Orient. Subsequently, the Founders resigned and wrote to Boeing to express their concerns that Global IP was under control of the Chinese government. Boeing, however, decided to proceed with the project after Bronzelink's own lawyers conducted a compliance review of the deal. Global IP's co-founders claim they disclosed the Chinese financing to Boeing at the outset of the project. The Department of Commerce issued Boeing an export license for the project, but subsequently revoked the license. Boeing canceled the contract to build the satellite in December 2018, citing Global IP's inability to pay. The Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Commerce, and the Department of the Treasury have each opened investigations into the transaction. Additionally, the Founders filed suit against China Orient alleging the company fraudulently took control of the satellite project. If those allegations are true, a firm with connections to the Chinese government may have used a complex financing arrangement in an attempt to skirt U.S. export controls related to national security. To help the Committee understand this matter, please provide the following documents and information: 1. Documents sufficient to show when and how Boeing became aware of the financing arrangement between Global IP, Bronzelink, and China Orient, including, but not limited to, all documents and communications referring or relating to the financial backing of Global IP. 2. Documents referring or relating to Boeing's application to the Department of Commerce for an export license, including, but not limited to, documents that disclose or describe the financing arrangement. 3. Documents and communications referring or relating to any discussion about whether the transaction should be referred to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) or whether CFIUS had reviewed, or was otherwise aware of, an investment in Global IP by China Orient or any other foreign investor. 4. Documents and communications referring or relating to the decision to abandon or cancel the contract with Global IP. 5. Documents and communications referring or relating to concerns about Global IP's independence from and/or relationship with the Chinese government. 6. All documents and communications referring or relating to the compliance review by Bronzelink. Please respond as soon as possible but no later than 5:00 p.m. on February 6, 2019. Produce the materials requested herein to the Minority staff in Room 4340 of the O'Neill House Office Building and to the Majority staff in Room 2129 of the Rayburn House Office Building. The Committee prefers, if possible, to receive all documents in electronic format.Sincerely,Patrick McHenry Ranking MemberLoad-Date: February 2, 2019End of Document

China's Huawei launches court challenge to US security lawAssociated Press State & LocalMarch 7, 2019 Thursday 3:57 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 955 wordsByline: By JOE McDONALD, AP Business WriterDateline: SHENZHEN, China BodySHENZHEN, China (AP) - Chinese tech giant Huawei has filed a lawsuit in Plano, Texas, challenging a law that labels the company a security risk and would limit its access to the American market for telecom equipment.Huawei Technologies Ltd.'s announcement Thursday comes as the biggest global maker of network equipment for phone and internet companies fights U.S. efforts to persuade allies to exclude the company from next-generation telecom systems.Huawei said its complaint asks a federal court in Plano to throw out a portion of this year's U.S. military appropriations act that bars the government and its contractors from using Huawei equipment.Huawei, China's first global tech brand, is at the center of U.S.-Chinese tensions over technology competition and cyber-spying. The company has spent years trying to put to rest accusations it facilitates Chinese spying or is controlled by the ruling Communist Party.Increasingly, both sides appear to be resorting to courts to try to press their cases."We are compelled to take this legal action as a proper and last resort," the company's rotating chairman, Guo Ping, said at a news conference. Guo said the ban would limit competition, slowing the rollout of fifth-generation communications and raising consumer prices.Huawei has pleaded not guilty to U.S. trade-theft charges after a federal court in Seattle unsealed a 10-count indictment in January against two of its units, Huawei Device Co. and Huawei Device USA. The charges include conspiracy to steal trade secrets, attempted theft of trade secrets, wire fraud and obstruction of justice.The company's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, is fighting extradition to the U.S. after she was arrested in Vancouver, Canada on Dec. 1. U.S. prosecutors have filed charges accusing Meng, who is the daughter of Huawei's founder, of lying to banks about dealings with Iran.Huawei denies any wrongdoing.The company has about 40 percent of the global market for network gear but its U.S. sales evaporated after a congressional panel in 2012 cited the company and a Chinese competitor, ZTE Corp., as security risks and told phone carriers to avoid dealing with them.U.S. authorities "have hacked our servers and stolen our emails" but have presented no evidence to support their security claims, Guo said. He complained Washington was "sparing no effort to smear" the company.The U.S. campaign to persuade allies to shun Huawei threatens to block access to major markets as phone carriers prepare to invest billions of dollars in 5G systems.Huawei says the new law would shrink its potential U.S. market further by prohibiting the government from buying the Chinese vendor's technology and from buying goods or services from or giving grants or loans to companies or other third parties that do. The United States accounts for 20 to 25 percent of the global market for computer and telecom technology.The company is challenging the U.S. law as an unconstitutional "bill of attainder," or a measure that targets a specific individual for penalties without a trial. The company says that infringes its due process rights and improperly has Congress play the role of a court.The ban is "based on numerous false, unproven and untested propositions," said Song Liuping, the company's chief legal officer, at the news conference. "Huawei has an excellent security record and program. No contrary evidence has been offered."The Chinese government says Washington fabricates or exaggerates security concerns to block competition.Huawei, based in Shenzhen, near Hong Kong, is a leading developer of 5G along with rivals Nokia Corp. of Finland and Sweden's LM Ericsson. Industry analysts say excluding the Chinese vendor from markets for 5G equipment would reduce competition and might lead to higher prices.Founded in 1987 by a former military engineer, Huawei overtook Ericsson in 2017 as the biggest global supplier of network gear. It says it supplies 45 of the world's top 50 phone companies and has contracts with 30 carriers to test 5G wireless technology.European governments are balking at U.S. pressure to ban Huawei. The company has announced contracts with customers including the United Arab Emirates in the Middle East for network technology.China's government arrested two Canadians, a former diplomat and a businessman, on Dec. 10 in what was widely seen as an attempt to pressure Canada to release Meng, the company's CFO.On Monday, Beijing accused the two men of acting together to steal state secrets. That followed the Canadian government's announcement Friday that the extradition proceeding for Meng would be allowed to continue.Huawei executives say American security warnings have yet to affect sales outside the United States. The company's 2018 revenue forecast is $100 billion and its founder, Ren Zhengfei, said last month this year's target is $125 billion.Some European officials and others cite a Chinese security law requiring companies to cooperate with intelligence agencies. They say Huawei and other tech companies might be required to install "backdoors" in equipment to allow eavesdropping.Huawei denies altering its equipment to facilitate spying and has set up testing centers in Britain, Canada and continental Europe to allow governments to examine its technology."Huawei has not and will never implant 'backdoors,' " said Guo, the chairman.The company also has launched a public relations campaign abroad.Its typically press-shy founder, Ren, gave a two-hour interview to foreign reporters in January in which he said Huawei would reject Chinese government demands to disclose confidential information about its customers. Since then, Ren also has talked at length with foreign TV broadcasters.Load-Date: March 7, 2019End of Document

Since then, Ren also has talked at length with foreign TV broadcasters.Load-Date: March 7, 2019End of Document

China's Huawei sues to challenge US security lawAssociated Press InternationalMarch 7, 2019 Thursday 5:50 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 1123 wordsByline: By JOE McDONALD, AP Business WriterDateline: SHENZHEN, China BodySHENZHEN, China (AP) - Chinese tech giant Huawei is challenging a U.S. law that limits its sales of telecom equipment in the U.S. on security grounds as the company steps up efforts to preserve its access to global markets for next-generation communications.Huawei Technologies Ltd.'s lawsuit, announced Thursday, asks a U.S. court to reject as unconstitutional a military-spending provision that bars the U.S. government and its contractors from using Huawei equipment.It comes as the biggest global maker of network equipment fights a U.S. campaign to persuade allies to shun Huawei. That threatens to block access to major markets as phone carriers prepare to invest billions of dollars in next-generation cellular networks, known as 5G.The complaint filed in Plano, Texas, the headquarters of Huawei's U.S. operations, says the law is an unconstitutional "bill of attainder," or a measure that singles out a specific entity for punishment. It says that denies the company due process and amounts to a "death penalty."The American Embassy in Beijing said it had no comment on pending litigation.Steven Schwinn, a professor at the John Marshall Law School in Chicago, said the lawsuit is likely to be dismissed by a judge. He said the "bill of attainder" claim, or punishment without due process, would be hard to prove.But Schwinn said the lawsuit is one of Huawei's only remaining options, short of trying to get Congress to reverse the ban."This strikes me as a last-ditch effort to do something," he said.Franklin Turner, a partner at law firm McCarter & English, said there are parallels to a lawsuit filed by Kaspersky Labs in 2017 that was eventually thrown out as well. The U.S. government had barred federal agencies from using Kaspersky's anti-virus products because of concerns about its ties to the Kremlin and Russian spy operations.Turner said Huawei will likely keep fighting, but "to keep it going, is the legal equivalent of scaling Mount Everest without a rope."Huawei, China's first global tech brand, is at the center of U.S.-Chinese tensions over technology competition and cyberspying. The company has spent years trying to put to rest accusations it facilitates Chinese spying or is controlled by the ruling Communist Party."We are compelled to take this legal action as a proper and last resort," the company's rotating chairman, Guo Ping, said at a news conference. Guo said the ban would limit competition, slowing the rollout of fifth-generation communications and raising consumer prices.Huawei has pleaded not guilty to U.S. trade-theft charges unsealed by a federal court in Seattle in January.The company's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, was arrested Dec. 1 in Canada on U.S. charges of lying to banks about dealings with Iran. She is fighting extradition to the United States.Huawei denies wrongdoing.A foreign ministry spokesman said the Chinese government also objects to the law but he had no information on whether it would join Huawei's lawsuit."We believe that it is perfectly proper and fully understandable for companies to defend their legitimate rights and interests through legal means," Lu Kang said.Huawei has about 40 percent of the global market for network gear. Its U.S. sales evaporated after a congressional panel in 2012 cited the company and a Chinese competitor, ZTE Corp., as security risks and told phone carriers to avoid dealing with them.Huawei says the new law would shrink its potential U.S. market further by prohibiting the government from buying the Chinese vendor's technology and from buying goods or services from or giving grants or loans to companies or other third parties that do. The United States accounts for 20 to 25 percent of the global market for computer and telecom technology.The ban is "based on numerous false, unproven and untested propositions," the company's chief legal officer, Song Liuping, said at the news conference. "Huawei has an excellent security record and program. No contrary evidence has been offered."Australia, Japan, Taiwan and some other governments also have imposed curbs on use of Huawei technology.Guo complained Washington was "sparing no effort to smear" the company but has released no evidence.Huawei wants to negotiate with Washington to resolve its security concerns but the law blocks President Donald Trump from restoring market access, Guo said. He noted Trump has said he opposes using "artificial security reasons" to exclude Huawei.Lifting the ban "will give the U.S. government the flexibility it needs to work with Huawei and solve real security issues," Guo said.Huawei, based in Shenzhen, near Hong Kong, is a leading developer of 5G, along with rivals Nokia Corp. of Finland and Sweden's LM Ericsson.

The Trump administration has pressured allies to shun networks supplied by Huawei Technologies Ltd., threatening the company's access to 5G markets.Huawei, the biggest global maker of switching gear for phone and internet companies, denies accusations it facilitates Chinese spying. Its founder said last month it would reject government demands to disclose confidential information about foreign customers.The U.S. government is trying to "fabricate an excuse for suppressing the legitimate development" of Chinese enterprises, said a foreign ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang.He accused the United States of using "political means" to interfere in economic activity, "which is hypocritical, immoral and unfair bullying."Mike Pence, speaking Saturday in Germany, urged European allies to take seriously "the threat" he said was posed by Huawei as they look for partners to build 5G networks.The 5G technology is meant to vastly expand the reach of networks to support internet-linked medical equipment, factory machines, self-driving cars and other devices. That makes it more politically sensitive and raises the potential cost of security failures.Pence said Huawei and other Chinese telecom equipment makers provide Beijing with "access to any data that touches their network or equipment." He appealed to European governments to "reject any enterprise that would compromise the integrity of our communications technology or our national security systems."In what could amount to a turning point for the U.S. effort to isolate Huawei, Britain's National Cyber Security Centre has found that the risk of using its networks is manageable, according to the Financial Times and other British media outlets.The reports, citing anonymous sources, said there are ways to limit cybersecurity risks. They said the U.K.'s decision would carry weight with European allies who are also evaluating the safety of their networks.The British government is due to finish a review of its policies on the safety of 5G in March or April. The office of British Prime Minister Theresa May said Monday that "no decisions have been taken."If eventually confirmed, "such a decision by the U.K. would be a strong message and could be influential in the medium term," said Lukasz Olejnik, a research associate at Oxford University's Center for Technology and Global Affairs.The British review "could inevitably serve as an input or a reference point in other countries' risk assessments," he said.Officials including a vice president of the European Union have expressed concern about Chinese regulations issued last year that require companies to cooperate with intelligence agencies. No country in Europe, however, has issued a blanket veto on using Huawei technology in the way the U.S. has urged.The U.S. Justice Department last month unsealed charges against Huawei, its chief financial officer - who had been arrested in Canada - and several of its subsidiaries, alleging not only violation of trade sanctions but also the theft of trade secrets.The United States has not, however, released evidence to support its accusations that Huawei and other Chinese tech companies allow the Chinese government to spy through their systems. That has prompted some industry analysts to suggest Washington is trying to use security concerns to handicap Chinese competitors."China has not and will not require companies or individuals to collect or provide foreign countries' information for the Chinese government by installing backdoors or other actions that violate local laws," said Geng.Britain's National Cyber Security Centre acknowledged last summer that it had concerns about the engineering and security of Huawei's networks. While not commenting Monday on the media reports, it added: "We have set out the improvements we expect the company to make."Huawei said in a statement Monday it is open to dialogue and that "cybersecurity is an issue which needs to be addressed across the whole industry."___Associated Press writer Kelvin Chan in London contributed to this report.Load-Date: February 19, 2019End of Document

RUBIO RECEIVES "AMERICAN TRADE HERO" AWARD FOR WORK ON CHINA, TRADEStates News ServiceMarch 12, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1989 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, D.C. BodyThe following information was released by Florida Senator Marco Rubio:This evening, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) delivered remarks and accepted the "American Trade Hero" award at the Coalition for a Prosperous America's (CPA) Annual Trade Conference Banquet for his work on trade and the U.S.-China relationship. Through his roles on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and as Chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, Rubio has worked tirelessly to make the American people aware of the threats the Chinese Government and Communist Party, including state-directed telecom companies like Huawei and ZTE, pose to our national and economic security. Rubio has also long been a leader in advocating for human rights in China. Recently, Rubio released a report on Made in China 2025's implications for small-and medium-sized American businesses and held a hearing on countering the Chinese threat. U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer received the "American Trade Hero" award as well. Rubio and Baldwin introduced the Fair Trade with China Enforcement Act (S. 2), which would safeguard American assets from Chinese influence and possession, and serve to blunt China's tools of economic aggression. Rubio's full remarks as prepared are below and a Facebook live can be viewed here. Thank you all for being here and representing America's manufacturers. What makes us strong as a nation is not just what we can buy, but what we can make. What we can build. What we can produce. Our ability to create is what you, and all the working men and women that are the backbone of these industries, and you embody that here this evening. You embody the strength of the American economy. And you represent a direct threat to the Chinese government's ambition to reduce us to a nation of consumers instead of producers, a nation that can only purchase the products of the 21st century's high-end industries, instead of making them. So I thank each of you for what you do and for the critical part you play in creating dignified work, which is the bedrock of our family and community life, and the part you play in securing the future of our prosperity. I would like to take a few moments to discuss the threat posed by the Chinese Government and Communist Party to America's national and economic security, and how it is instructive of our broader challenge in creating dignified work for all Americans. Trade normalization with China occurred with the optimistic promise of fair-market access, economic liberalization, and an improvement in Chinese political and human rights. That didn't happen. China took advantage by playing fast and loose with international trade rules and global norms, to the detriment of American productive capabilities. After China's accession to the World Trade Organization, we saw what is now called the "China Shock," which was a devastation to American small- and medium-sized manufacturers in concentrated areas throughout the country. And now we're facing an unprecedented threat to American competitiveness from China's whole-of-society efforts to capture the high-value manufacturing industries of the 21st century. We have not encountered anything like this, and it is critical we understand the seriousness of the moment. This challenge is ultimately one of national security, and more fundamentally about whether or not the future of the world will be defined by authoritarianism or by democracy. If we get this wrong, we will have to explain to the next generation why they didn't get to grow up in the America that we did, the America that led the world in innovation, that created the greatest prosperity in history, and that was a beacon of freedom and opportunity for millions around the world. We'll have to explain why we have become a second-tier power while the Communist Chinese governmenta regime that has no respect for human rights, no respect for free speech or other basic freedoms, no respect for political and religious libertydominates everything that matters. A world whose most powerful nation is a one-party authoritarian state instead of a democracy is not a better world. But more immediately, Chinese economic ambition presents a serious threat to American industry. Through its whole-of-society strategy, the Chinese government is attempting to steal and subsidize and ultimately compete its way to the top of the global production value chain. They want to supplant American industrial leadership by any means necessary, including illegal means. China's "Made in China 2025" plan outlines a coordinated effort to achieve dominance in critical technological sectors, some of which the U.S. currently leads globally, and all of which will profoundly shape and drive the 21st century economy. And make no mistake: Whoever controls these technologies not only will control the upper end of the value chain, but also will be able to set the standards and terms of engagement for the rest of the world. And it's clear the Chinese government wants to dictate the terms and conditions of the future of global trade and global technological engagement, and to do so for their own benefit. This threat to American competitiveness and capacity is a threat to working Americans all across the country, who rely on innovation and investment in our real economywho rely on our national capacity to make thingsin order to find decent and well-paying jobs. It's a threat to the wages of American workers, and the well-being of American families, and the stability of American communities. It's our job as lawmakers to ensure that U.S. economic policy aligns with our national interests. And nothing is more critical to our national interest than ensuring that the American people can find dignified work. That's the other question we're going to have to answer for our children: Will they inherit an America where stable, well-paying work is available only to the few, or to the many? Will our country look like the land of shared opportunity that my parents found when they arrived here, or will we become a stagnant nation fighting over how to divide up what little opportunity is left? I believe our best and brightest days are still ahead. But for that to happen, we must meet the challenge honestly and creatively. We must choose to prioritize national development, economic dynamism, and small business competitiveness. We must invest in our own innovative capacity, and ensure we're fighting for high-wage industries, to the benefit of American businesses, workers, and their families. And we must directly confront China's unfair trade practices. Ambassador Lighthizer is here this evening. I'm grateful that we have someone serving as U.S. Trade Representative that is standing up for American industry as we negotiate with the Chinese government. Bringing balance to America's relationship with China is the geopolitical challenge of this century. The fact that we are in a position today to face that challenge so directly is impressive. The President has done what many thought the U.S. would be unable or unwilling to do: actually stand up to China and force them to the table. The pressure is starting to work. America's new assertiveness has created powerful leverage that could be used to change the behavior of China's government. This is a massive accomplishment. And it is critical that we make the most of the moment we've created. American negotiators must not waste their leverage by prematurely agreeing to a bad deal. We must not focus on a handful of individual trade matters at the expense of addressing structural imbalances. To take just one example: China's theft of American IP costs the U.S. almost $600 billion every year. That more than the profits of the top 50 companies on last year's Fortune 500 list. An improved U.S. trade surplus in soybeans would not be enough. A quick deal to satisfy financial markets would not be enough. China wants to displace the United States in the 21st century we must hold strong against the political pressures of the short-term. There is some news emerging recently that Chinese officials are dropping the use of the term "Made in China 2025" in official statements and are considering ending required technology transfers from companies investing in China. We cannot afford to accept more empty promises. Until the Chinese Communist government fundamentally alters its goals and methods, the U.S. must stay focused on the critical issues of economic theft and competition. If we accept a deal that does not bring fundamental structural changes to the U.S.-China economic relationship, we risk losing this century's most important strategic, economic, and geopolitical competition. This challenge is also why I introduced the Fair Trade with China Enforcement Act (S. 2). This legislation would take a number of steps to ensure that our trade with China is in our own long-term best interests starting by imposing duties on Chinese capital goods in the sectors targeted by the "Made in China 2025" plan, to ensure that American buyers do not inadvertently finance the long-term displacement of their own country's manufacturing. It would also impose a tax on Chinese entities that earn investment and dividend income in the U.S., in order to discourage Chinese attempts to price out American exports. Trade is not the only question in front of us. We need to confront China directly. But ultimately China will not determine the future of American manufacturing for us. We will determine our future for ourselves. As I said earlier, we need to embrace a policy agenda of national development and economic dynamism that places working Americans and their families at the center. In today's global economy, high wages for American workers are not inevitable. We know this. Free markets are an unparalleled force for the creation of prosperity and wealth, but they also produce in response to the policy terms they are given. They produce in response to what we prioritize. And we have too often failed to make the well-being of working Americans the terms for market success. We like to talk about the status quo as if it's neutral, as if it's simply the result of a natural process. But, for example, prioritizing the growth of financial services instead of advanced manufacturing, like we've been doing for the last few decades, is a decision. It's result of policy choices that we've made. And I think we can make better ones. For example I think we should stop giving stock buybacks a tax preference. That's the incentive that exists now the policy choice that exists now. If we're going to give tax preference to certain behavior, I think it should be for practices that create more jobs with better wages and benefits for American workers. We can do that. I also think we can find a common-sense, common-ground way to provide paid family leave to working parents. All of this is within our ability. We can put dignified work and healthy families at the center of our policy decisions. We need to stand up to the Communist Chinese government, in the face of their economic aggression and ambition to capture the 21st century's high-value industries at our expense. We need to ensure they back down and back off trying to win at our expense. But our economic future is ultimately ours to choose. And I believe we can choose a future that prioritizes American innovation and production, our ability to make quality instead of just buy cheap. And I believe if we get it right, we'll be doing right by our fellow Americans who rely on industry for decent work, and who rely on policymakers to make them and their families our national priority. That's why I'm here, and that's why this award is so meaningful to me. I'll continue to fight for you. You continue to make the things that America needs. Thank you.Load-Date: March 13, 2019End of Document

US calls Huawei and CFO Meng Wanzhou national-security threats, indicts company and exec on fraud and IP theft chargesBusiness Insider USJanuary 28, 2019 Monday 06:11 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 843 wordsByline: alockie@businessinsider.com,  (Alex Lockie)Highlight: The Justice Department said Huawei tricked a global bank into doing sanctions-violating business with Iran and stole trade secrets from T-Mobile.BodyREUTERS/Joshua Roberts• The US on Monday charged Chinese tech giant Huawei, its chief financial officer, and two affiliates with bank and wire fraud in a crackdown on the company, which is legally required to assist China's Communist Party at the government's request.• The Justice Department said Huawei tricked a global bank into doing sanctions-violating business with Iran and stole trade secrets from T-Mobile.• Huawei has long stood accused of trying to hack into governments, and US companies in China accused the smartphone giant of forced technology transfer.• Experts say China's Communist Party uses companies such as Huawei to steal tech secrets in the hopes of displacing the US as the world's superpower.The US on Monday charged Chinese tech giant Huawei, its chief financial officer, and two affiliates with bank and wire fraud in a crackdown on the company, which is legally required to assist China's Communist Party at the government's request.The Justice Department said Huawei sidestepped US sanctions on Iran by telling a global bank it had no relationship with Skycom, which the US said is controlled by Huawei. Skycom sold more than $100 million in banned technologies to Iran, the US said.In another case, the Justice Department charged Huawei with wire fraud, stealing trade secrets, and obstructing justice, accusing the company of stealing robotics technology from carrier T-Mobile to test smartphones' durability.Read more: China sentenced a Canadian man to death in the latest escalation of the countries' feud over HuaweiT-Mobile had accused Huawei of stealing the technology, called "Tappy," which mimicked human fingers and was used to test smartphones. Huawei has said that the two companies settled their disputes in 2017."Both sets of charges expose Huawei's brazen and persistent actions to exploit American companies and financial institutions and to threaten the free and fair global marketplace," FBI Director Christopher Wray said at a press briefing announcing the charges.REUTERS/Joshua Roberts"As you can tell from the number and magnitude of the charges, Huawei and its senior executives repeatedly refused to respect US law and standard international business practices," he continued.Wray said Huawei stole T-Mobile's technology to "circumvent hard-earned, time-consuming research and gain an unfair market advantage."Wray's comments mirror the concerns of US businesses that operate in China and say the Chinese government forces technology transfer through a number of mechanisms.Huawei has insisted it does not share data with the Chinese government and said it would refuse any requests from the government for data, but Chinese law demands all companies and citizens cooperate with the government when asked."There is ample evidence to suggest that no major Chinese company is independent of the Chinese government and Communist Party - and Huawei, which China's government and military tout as a 'national champion,' is no exception," said Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia in an emailed statement to INSIDER. Warner is the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee."It has been clear for some time that Huawei poses a threat to our national security, and I applaud the Trump Administration for taking steps to finally hold the company accountable," Warner said.John Hemmings, director of the Asia Studies Centre at the Henry Jackson Society told INSIDER: "The US is convinced that whoever dominates AI, Quantum computing, 5G, the internet of things, militarily and economically important technologies, will be like whoever has the jet engine, whoever has the dreadnoughts" Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press via APIndia accused Huawei of trying to hack into its telecom equipment in 2014, and the            African Union accused Huawei of similar behavior in 2018.Wray has previously said China is "not just a whole-of-government threat, but a whole-of-society threat," because of China's efforts to rival the US as a superpower and become the technological world leader.China has accused the US of trumping up the charges against Huawei and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, as part of a protectionist mindset looking to thwart China's rise.Read more: Canada fired its Chinese ambassador after his 'mind-boggling' remarks on the arrest of Huawei's CFOAfter Canada detained Meng pending the indictments, China detained two Canadian citizens in the country in a move that experts saw as transparent retribution.Acting Attorney General Matthew Whittaker said while announcing the indictments that he was "deeply grateful to Canada" for detaining Meng so that she could be tried.Reuters contributed to this report.NOW WATCH: The US Air Force refuels combat jets in midair with a 'flying boom system' - watch it in actionSee Also:• Chinese troops have been training for nuclear war in simulated ICBM strike missions in underground bunkers, Chinese media reveals• China admits that its army had no idea what to do with its fancy new tanks• A Chinese icebreaker ship crashed into an iceberg at the South PoleLoad-Date: February 11, 2019End of Document

Andy Barr (R) Kentucky, Mark WeinbergerBodyMARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Welcome back.Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Tuesday, March 5th.Your top stories right now, 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.Retail earnings in focus this morning. Target reporting better than expected results for the holiday quarter. The earnings guidance coming in above forecast. The comp store sales better than expected. And the stock is up better than 5 percent right now on Target.We are waiting on Kohl's. We will bring you those numbers as soon as they hit the wires. And we are expecting Kohl's to report earnings of $2.18 a share on revenue of $6.58 billion for the quarter.Broader markets this morning are higher. Take a look, the indices are adding on today to what was a really volatile session yesterday, although the markets ended lower yesterday -- wild session.But this morning the Dow Industrials up 51 points, quarter of a percent. S&P 500 up 4 points. And the Nasdaq up 10.75.Take a look at the reversal yesterday. The market was up strongly for much of the day and then midday, complete reversal. Dow Industrials finishing down 207 points, three quarters of 1 percent. The S&P was down 10. And the Nasdaq yesterday down 17 points.In Europe this morning markets are mixed. Take a look. FT 100 is up. It's up 18 points, a quarter of a percent. But the CAC 40 in Paris and the DAX index in Germany both lower by a fraction.The breaking news is hitting right now. Kohl's coming up better than expected on earnings, $2.24 a share versus $2.18 a share.Let's get back to Ashley Webster. He is looking at these numbers because revenue is actually a miss. Ashley Webster -- what are you --(CROSSTALKING)ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Yes. You're absolutely right -- Maria.As you mentioned on the earnings, a beat by 6 cents but on the Revenue just a little shy, coming in at $6.54 billion. The expectation was $6.58. The comp numbers for the fourth quarter, up 1 percent -- not exactly going gangbusters. And the outlook for 2019 comp sales, zero to 2 percent.Now, Kohl's of course, is really trying to strengthen its relationship with Amazon, using it as a pick-up center, driving traffic into the stores. That has helped a little bit. But they've been trying also to expand their fulfillment centers on the e-commerce side.But again, a beat on the earnings, but a miss on the revenue. And, again, the comp store outlook for 2019 -- the comparable sales outlook -- zero to 2 percent. So interesting to see how this plays out.The debt reduction expected to increase the annual interest. A big problem for Kohl's has been the increasing costs. Their selling, general and admin expenses has been growing each quarter which has really hurt their profitability as they try to adapt to this new retail landscape.But again, a miss on revenue is not going to help.BARTIROMO: All right. Ashley -- thank you.Meanwhile, the stock is surging. Stock is up 4 percent on these numbers even though we've got a revenue miss. Lindsey Bell, your reaction?LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA: I think this was one of those things where it was better than bad expectations. This is a stock that was flat going into the report.BARTIROMO: Better than lowered estimates, right.BELL: Right, exactly. And for the outlook especially. The retail index was up over 10 percent on a year-to-date basis. This was a stock that was flat.They've struggled with the online presence. They're making investments. They're dealing with higher wages, increased shipping costs. So there's a lot that is going on for Kohl's. And you know, they haven't benefited like a Target that we talked about earlier and some of the other discount retailers that have really done well.BARTIROMO: So the comp store sales here, up 1.7 percent, is that the way you're reading it? Fourth quarter comp sales increased 1 percent.Let's be clear on what the comp store sales are versus the same store sales, because that was two different numbers for Target. You said earlier --BELL: Right. Yes. So the comp store sales include digital sales, whereas the same store sales is for the physical stores. So that's a big difference.BARTIROMO: That's just brick and mortar.BELL: Brick and mortar.BRIAN BRENBERG, KING'S COLLEGE CHAIR OF BUSINESS AND FINANCE: Yes. Kohl's is an interesting story because for the past several years they've been trying some very new things to try to break out of the dying retail rut.And so I think it's interesting here that the projected comp sales, you know, little bit lower than you'd expect but they've got a lot of new initiatives going on including expansions into the grocery business. So they're taking a lot of their footprint, reducing it, bringing grocery in there.I think investors might be excited about that because it creates a more holistic shopping environment which a lot of consumers are really into.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Is that really -- is that a fight you want to take on in this environment, though, thinking that grocery is going to be the key to success? Given -- I'm just curious.BRENBERG: But look, can I add on to that? Because --BARTIROMO: Yes.BRENBERG: -- who is Kohl's big partner right now? Amazon. Who is interested in getting into groceries? Amazon. I don't think it's a coincidence.BARTIROMO: That's what it is.BRENBERG: I think you're going to see a lot of Kohl's and Amazon grocery stores going forward. And I think Kohl's -- I think investors get really excited about Kohl's.(CROSSTALKING)BARTIROMO: The stock, it is up 6 percent right now. It has been surging in the last five minutes.BELL: This has been a trend across retailers though. You've seen pretty good earnings actually, meeting really low estimates. And guidance has been decent, better than feared is what you're seeing. And so better than feared will get you a 5 percent pop in your stock, especially when your stock is flat. It's trading at deep discounts -- 5-year average deep discount to its peers.The department store sector has been pretty weak. We saw similar reaction from Macy's when they reported earnings last week, you know,. They announced cost cutting initiatives, restructuring that helped them.MCDOWELL: It looks literally like investors were just excited that they had any comp sales.BARTIROMO: Yes, that wasn't negative.MCDOWELL: Right.BRENBERG: Right.MCDOWELL: That it was, I think, 1.7 percent for the year in comp sales growth -- 1.7 compared to other ones, but again, it's expectations.BARTIROMO: And you had a miss on revenue and yet the stock is up 5 percent. Look, obviously we had a very good retail environment. We've been seeing better and better numbers. The economy doing well.Ashley Webster, thank you so much for those numbers. We'll come back to you as news develops.But one of the reasons that we saw this better tone to the economy is the tax cut plan last year. But will that change? Because we are talking about new proposals to tax the wealthy once again.House Democrat Peter Defazio pioneering a financial services tax to discourage high frequency trading he says. He's got a new co-sponsor and yes, it is Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. This bill is titled "The Wall Street Tax Act of 2019". They say it could bring in $777 billion in revenue over the next 10 years according to a joint committee on taxation.And joining us right now is Kentucky Congressman and House Financial Services Committee member Andy Barr. Congressman -- it's good to see you this morning.REP. ANDY BARR (R-KY), HOUSE FINANCIAL SERVICES COMMITTEE: Good to see you.BARTIROMO: Tell us about this Wall Street tax.BARR: Well, you know, a lot of people attribute the volatility in the markets in December to uncertainty around trade, maybe monetary normalization, other factors. But really if you think about it, this new socialist mindset with the new House majority may be one of the reasons why you saw so much market volatility in December.Now, fortunately we're seeing good growth numbers, strong growth, capital expenditures, business investment continues to move forward, predominantly because of tax cuts, because of corporate tax reductions, because of the expensing provisions. And don't underestimate the impact of the financial sector deregulation, the legislation that is encouraging more capital formation, encouraging more businesses to access affordable capital and invest in their businesses.What you're seeing here with this proposal to impose a new tax on financial transactions is exactly in step with the Democrats' new lurch towards socialism. You can't have capitalism without capital and this is a direct punishment of capital formation.BARTIROMO: That's incredible. What are you doing about all of these new programs on the left? Your colleagues want to change a lot of what your colleagues on the right have put in place.BARR: Well, part of this also, part of what's animating these tax increase proposals, the reversals of the progress that we've made over the last couple of years is that they're proposing huge new spending.I know Dagen is concerned, you're concerned, we're all concerned about the national debt. And you're talking about the Green New Deal which would add $93 trillion in new spending, new costs to the federal government. A government takeover of healthcare system, $30 trillion over 10 years.And so they're trying to figure out a way to pay for it and the way they think they can pay for it is to punish success with a new tax --(CROSSTALKING)MCDOWELL: But Republicans don't have a leg to stand on on this though because President Bush never met a spending bill that he didn't like. The debt has continued to soar. It's now north of $22 trillion as we've talked about on the show, as Maria just pointed out.So you don't have any legs to stand on so now you really quite frankly opened the door to these people on the left and say, well, if the Republicans are going to spend on this, then we're going to spend on that and everybody's going to benefit from our socialist ideas.BARR: Well, it's a fair criticism and certainly both parties share blame on this.But remember, when the last time Nancy Pelosi was Speaker of the House, domestic discretionary spending was around 9 percent as a percent of GDP. Domestic discretionary spending when Nancy Pelosi took the gavel back was down to 6 percent.So Republicans when we were in charge actually did a pretty good job on discretionary spending. The reason why the deficit continues to be at a trillion dollars a year, right now, is because of unreformed mandatory spending. And don't forget what Republicans did in the last Congress, we voted for the most significant historic entitlement reform in American history that failed by one vote in the Senate.BARTIROMO: Whose idea was it to do this dollar for dollar? You do a dollar increase in Defense spending, you get a dollar increase in discretionary spending. That's one of the issues.BARR: Yes. That is one of the issues. And we do need to disconnect those two. And we're fighting to preserve the disconnect between Defense spending which frankly we're spending less as a percentage of the economy on Defense now than we did 10 years ago. And the threats are continuing to grow.MCDOWELL: In a couple of years you're going to be spending -- we as a nation are going to be spending more on the interest --BARR: Right.MCDOWELL: -- on the debt than we spend on our national defense which is appalling.BARTIROMO: And we'll probably see the Wall Street tax materialize.BARR: That's why the debt is a national security issue.BRENBERG: But this Wall Street tax -- again, we started the show talking about AOC's mob moving from New York City --BARTIROMO: That's right.BRENBERG: -- from New York to Florida because of high taxes.BARTIROMO: It's $600.BRENBERG: But there's a similar -- there's a similar dynamic with these financial transaction taxes. First of all, we have very little evidence it does anything about high frequency trading.Secondly --BARTIROMO: Right.BRENBERG: -- we know in places where it's been implemented it's moved capital transactions out of that country, right.BARR: Correct.BRENBERG: Same thing.(CROSSTALKING)BELL: And it hurts the consumer, too at the end of the day as well. You're aiming for the high frequency traders but the consumer, we don't have that many lower income people invested in the stock market but this also makes it much more difficult for them to get involved in the stock market and see their capital gains grow.BARR: I agree.BARTIROMO: But I also like what you said, Brian. It doesn't do anything for high frequency trading.BRENBERG: There's no evidence to suggest it solves that problem. So what are we doing?BARR: I agree. And remember, in the United States we enjoy the deepest, most liquid competitive capital markets on the planet. That helps everyday consumers.This punishes liquidity. This impairs liquidity. This makes U.S. capital markets less competitive and that hurts growth, that hurts jobs.BARTIROMO: What about -- what about Ilhan Omar? We've got to talk about this for a second because the House is voting tomorrow on a resolution which condemns anti-Semitism.Congresswoman Omar suggested that pro-Israel groups are pushing quote, "allegiance to a foreign country". Now Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is defending her this morning in a response on Twitter. In a tweet from California Congressman Juan Vargas who slammed Omar over her comments.Ocasio-Cortez writes, "I'm curious if Representative Vargas will further explain his stance here that it's unacceptable to even question U.S. foreign policy. Plenty of Dem members asserted that discussion and debate on this issue is fair and merited. Is this stance a departure from that?"Eleven Jewish groups are now calling on Nancy Pelosi to remove Omar from the Foreign Affairs Committee.Congressman -- tell us what this resolution means. Just because they're coming up with a resolution condemning it, that doesn't change anything. She's still on Foreign Affairs.BARR: Correct. This is an attempt for Democrats to cover up what's really going on which is a rise of anti-Semitism, not just in the world generally, but in the Democratic Party here in the United States.BARTIROMO: In the Congress.BARR: And in the Congress. And absolutely Representative Omar should be removed from the Foreign Affairs Committee.And I'll tell you, I just returned from Israel. I was in Israel week before last and the Israelis, our number one strategic ally in the Middle East, imagine the Middle East, that dark part of the world without an ally, a strategic ally like Israel.They're questioning -- what's going on in the United States, what's going on with anti-Semitism in the Democratic Party. And we need to stand firm. There is bipartisan support for removing Representative Omar from the Foreign Affairs Committee.And it shouldn't be a partisan issue. Anti-Semitism has no place in our country, no place in the world, and certainly no place in the Congress.BARTIROMO: Again you're colleagues when Steve King said something stupid he was relieved of all of his committee assignments.BARR: That's right. That's right. And so we need to hold all of our members to a high standard, particularly in the Foreign Affairs Committee where we are dealing with important issues. We need to stand with Israel. Israel is an important counterweight to Iran and other terrorist proxies in the Middle East.MCDOWELL: Meantime Nancy Pelosi is on the cover of "Rolling Stone with Congresswoman Omar along with Ocasio-Cortez and another female congresswoman.BARTIROMO: Yes, I know.BARR: Yes. It is shameful.BARTIROMO: Congressman -- thanks for joining us.BARR: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Really appreciate it. Andy Barr.We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Papa John's has reached a settlement with the founder.Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now -- Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: A long, drawn-out story here -- Maria.Under the settlement, Papa John's' founder and former chairman John Schnatter says he will resign from the company's board after an independent director is appointed. Now Schnatter who owns about 30 percent of the company shares has also agreed to dismiss two lawsuits against Papa John's. Then he stepped down as chairman last year after reports that he had used a racial slur on a conference call surfaced.Shares of the company are down about 30 percent from a year ago. Stock to watch today -- Papa John's.Well, the food and drug administration is calling out 40 retailers for allegedly selling tobacco products to minors. Walgreens, Walmart, 7- Eleven, among the chains accused of making illegal sales. Walgreens alone is charged with over 1,800 violations. The FDA wants to meet with the leadership teams from the retailers to start combating the problem.Then there is this. The fastest road car in the world has been revealed. And talk about guilt-free. It's an all-electric car. The Battista can go zero to 62 miles per hour in less than two seconds, reaches a top speed of 250-miles-per-hour. It's got those butterfly doors, by the way, on it. It's the most powerful street legal car ever. And it can even rival other super cars that aren't even allowed on the road. This one is yours for 2 million euros.Back to you.BARTIROMO: Yes, a bargain. Thank you -- Cheryl.CASONE: You bet.BARTIROMO: Coming up, trade weighing on the markets. Investors are awaiting a potential U.S./China trade deal. Where does that stand? The financial implications coming up.And markets are losing some of the momentum this morning.And we're looking at the business of gaming, Apex Legends reached a major milestone in its battle against rival Fortnite. The staggering numbers, incredible growth here.Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.We're expecting mixed opening this morning from markets. Take a look. Dow Industrials having given up a much higher indication earlier. We're looking at a gain of 6 points on the Dow right now. The S&P is barely in positive territory. It's up just 1 point. And the Nasdaq has turned negative. It is down 2 points right now.We are waiting on a trade deal with China. The U.S. and China expected to do a deal on trade soon. Overnight, China announced measures to boost its economy. It cut its growth forecast this year to between 6 and 6.5 percent.In an attempt to boost the economy, the country is also planning stimulus, planning to cut taxes and increase lending.Joining us right now is EY Global chairman and CEO Mark Weinberger. And Mark -- it's always a pleasure to see you.MARK WEINBERGER, GLOBAL CHAIRMAN AND CEO, EY: Great to see you -- Maria.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us.I know you're on your way to Beijing in a couple weeks. What's your take on how the economy's doing there right now and its impact on the U.S.?WEINBERGER: So we've been really bullish on China. We continue to grow double digits for the last several years in China. In the long-term it's going to be a great market.But it is definitely hitting some slowness due to a lot of the reforms they put in place. Now, we're seeing more consumption led growth as opposed to investment led growth and that's not as stable.Certainly the party is more front and center now. State-owned enterprises have come back to be a major portion of the economy as opposed to the private sector which continues to do well. So it is slowing.(CROSSTALKING)BRENBERG: The point you make about the consumption versus production driven economy is really important because the Communist Party wants to have their hands on the lever of the economy. You can't do that when it's a consumer driven economy. It's much harder to control than a production- driven economy.WEINBERGER: It's a great point. And it's not as directly straight-up. You can't control it.And the other element is really China is part of the issue here because they did some positive things. They came in to control some of the debt and they tightened up some of the lending that was going on. Now they're saying maybe too much, we're going to see that open up again.And I think you're going to see they have a lot of levers that they can pull to get their economy going again by freeing that up through the state- owned enterprises. You may see some reforms reverse which would be not so good.BELL: If you bring it back to here in the U.S., you're seeing, you know, some mixed economic data points. But really the picture is the same when we think about the global slowdown picture.Brexit is still on the table. We don't know what's going to happen with the China trade deal. We're going to probably get some noise on that over the next month or so. What are you telling your customers right now, how to operate in this type of uncertain environment?BARTIROMO: By the way, Mohammed El-Arian was here yesterday. He said that the Eurozone will be lucky to get 1 percent economic growth this year. Lucky to get 1 percent.WEINBERGER: Yes. Even with all these though, it's a great question. You know, we're seeing the U.S. grew 2.9 percent last year, 3.1 percent if you look at fourth quarter to fourth quarter.BARTIROMO: Year over year.WEINBERGER: It's projected 2.5 percent this year. For the last 10 years, that's the strongest growth we've seen. The global economy was reduced down 3.7 to 3.5. so we're still seeing India growing over 7 percent, maybe China now closer to 6 percent.You know, I think we were overly optimistic last year when we saw the G-20 all growing synchronized growth across the world. We're overly pessimistic now.You look at U.S. investment, to your point, since tax reform we've had $3 trillion of investment last year -- the fastest growth in 11 years. 3.2 percent earnings increase which is putting more money in people's pockets and creating 2.6 million jobs over the last year.We're seeing inflation tame. We're seeing a very strong U.S. economy right now with a lot of opportunity.BARTIROMO: And I'm glad you looked at the 10-year period because this is actually a historic day for the markets today. This is the 10 years from the market bottom that took place on March 9 of 2009. It's been 10 years. Markets up 300 percent in this last 10 years. And you talked about what's going on in this 10 years. It's been real growth spurt from the bottom.WEINBERGER: It has been. And especially I think with the deregulation and the tax reform. Now, I've always said this. I don't look at tax reform, never did as a stimulus. I'm not saying that it should be used to grow the economy in a particular quarter. We have not seen the major benefits from tax reform yet.BARTIROMO: Really.(CROSSTALKING)BARTIROMO: So it's that long of a runway you think.WEINBERGER: Well, the share buybacks have come first, right. And that's what everyone points to when people are concerned about obviously -- you can argue good or bad share buybacks.But it's easy to do, it's quick. You've got the money, you send it out.To change your supply chains which is what the tax reform was aimed at, to put more marginal dollars back investment the United States, to invest in long-term cap ex -- that takes longer. That takes quarters to put that together. You need a business plan.We're working with businesses all over the world that are modeling on increased investment in the United States. That has resulted in higher wages, higher capital expenditures and then eventually increase productivity. That's going to take another year or two to even feel that.MCDOWELL: Are you saying though then that we don't have a recession on the horizon because of that very thing, because if you've got a year or two of a long runway from this corporate tax reform, that the U.S. economy's in this incredibly solid position from here for the next couple of years.WEINBERGER: It's a great point. I am someone who believes that the stimulus from tax reform is going to run off. It should never have been viewed in my view as a stimulus bill.The change in the dynamic of where foreign and U.S. investors will put their marginal dollar, in intangible assets has changed for the next several years. That is a positive.There's a lot of other factors that could lead to a recession. So that's a harder question to answer.(CROSSTALKING)MCDOWELL: People are looking at the calendar going you know what, we're due for a recession which seems a little ridiculous.BARTIROMO: I don't like looking at it that way.MCDOWELL: A lot of people do.BARTIROMO: I know. You're right.Because they're saying this is long in the tooth, it's 10 years.MCDOWELL: Right.BELL: Yes, but corporations are putting money to work. Wages are increasing the last four months over 3 percent. We're just starting to see that.To your point cap ex just starting to increase in the latter stages of 2018. So this could be -- maybe there are legs.WEINBERGER: Well, in the fourth quarter GDP growth as we saw, 0.7, 0.69 percent of the GDP growth was attributable to business cap ex investment. That's a huge component of growth.BARTIROMO: Yes, we've been seeing that.WEINBERGER: We won't see the returns on that until productivity goes up. and that's going to take another several quarters.So I think your point is spot-on. I do not believe we're going to see a recession at least not for the U.S. standpoint. Europe is a tougher situation with Brexit, you've got the German situation with the change in control, you've got the Italy situation.BARTIROMO: Yes.WEINBERGER: A whole lot of issues there.BARTIROMO: But can things change, I mean to Dagen's point, can things change that quickly that here we are in 2019, expecting 3 percent. Kevin Hassett was on the other day, he said 3.2 percent growth for 2019. Are we going to see two quarters of negative growth in 2020?WEINBERGER: We saw five quarters in a row of double digit earnings growth for businesses.BARTIROMO: Right. It doesn't make sense, a recession --WEINBERGER: We've never had a recession when we have had growth in earnings for businesses. I don't know. A lot of things can happen. Certainly if the trade war continues to escalate -- we hope it's going to deescalate with what's going on we're hearing today. That will help a lot.BARTIROMO: By the way, Mark -- before you go. Congratulations, you're looking at now the end of an incredible run at EY come July.WEINBERGER: Yes. It's been a great run. It's really --BARTIROMO: What -- 13, 15 years?WEINBERGER: Well, on the global board for 15 years, the CEO for the last six and-a-half. It's amazing, just to see, you know, 100,000 more people in the last six years we've added.BARTIROMO: And you've been able to talk to so many companies across the world and really get insights into what's going on from the front lines being at EY.WEINBERGER: Yes. I just -- listen. You just want to leave a business stronger, more stable than when you got there. It's a great organization. Our business is in great shape. I feel terrific. Thank you for saying that. It's been a great run.BARTIROMO: Mark -- great to have you.WEINBERGER: Thanks.BARTIROMO: Thanks so much. Mark Weinberger joining us from EY.Coming up, keeping an eye on Huawei, the Chinese technology giant trying to ease fears over spying. What the company is doing now.We're going to talk to you about the very latest after my exclusive interview with Andy Purdy from Huawei last week.Then this, Kiley Jenner making history, find out where the social media star and model ranks on the Forbes World's Billionaires list and how she built her empire. Wait until you see this list.Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, March 5th, your top stories right now, 7:33 a.m. on the East Coast.Retail stocks on the rise this morning. Check this out, Target and Kohl's both surging this morning, ahead of the open. Kohl's up almost five percent, Target up almost six percent. Their earnings guidance beating expectations, earnings and comp store sales also, looking good.Broader markets, this morning, look like this. And here too, we have seen some volatility. We're looking at a higher opening for the broader averages, but this is off of the best levels of the morning, Dow Industrials up 15, S&P up 2 points, and the NASDAQ up just a half of a point, right now.This after a wild session yesterday with real volatility, the Dow reversed early gains and finished down better than 200 points on the session. The NASDAQ was down 17 at the close.In Europe this morning, markets are mixed. Take a look, FT-100 up 14 points, but the CAC Quarante in Paris, down 11, and the DAX Index in Germany, down 22.In Asia overnight, mixed performances there, as well, as you see, best performer was Shanghai, in China, up about one percent. The country coming out with new stimulus moves overnight, and taking their growth rate for the economy down.Volvo, hitting the brakes this morning, the automaker is setting a speed limit on its own vehicles. We will tell you why.And then, Kylie Jenner has made history on the Forbes World's Billionaire list. We are taking a look at how she built her empire and where she is on that list. We've got the list here.Gaming Battle Royale, Apex Legends taking on Fortnite, in a big way, adding a legendary amount of users in its first month, the big business in video games, coming up.But first, our top story this half an hour, the fight with Huawei, the Chinese telecom and technology company is looking to win over government leaders and fight back against U.S. allegations that its equipment poses a national security risk. Today, the company is launching a cybersecurity lab in Brussels, which will allow Huawei's customers to review the source code, running its network gear.Here's what Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told me about the risk from hot Huawei, just a week ago.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Europe is pushing back on this idea that President Trump and your administration wants to ban or potentially stop, slow down the use of Huawei technology. Is that what -- is that what you found in Europe?MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE, UNITED STATES: We've been out around the world just making sure everybody had the same information, that countries understand the risk of putting this Huawei technology into their I.T. systems.We can't forget these systems were designed by -- with the express work alongside the Chinese PLA, their military in China. They are creating a real risk for these countries and their systems, the security of their people. If a country adopts this and puts it in some of their critical information systems, we won't be able to share information with them. We won't be able to work alongside them.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Big news from Secretary Pompeo on that. Joining me right now is FOX News Senior Strategic Analyst, General Jack Keane. And General, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thank you so much for joining us.GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST: Yes, delighted to be here, Maria.BARTIROMO: So, what do you make of all of this, General? I mean, the company, Huawei, is opening this cybersecurity lab in Brussels, the heart of the European Union. But Europe is, you know, Europe is with Huawei, they're using their telecom equipment. How do you see this story?KEANE: Yes. Well, what's at stake here, obviously, is the 5G global wireless network system, you know, that's going to replace 4G. Europe is China's second largest market other than China itself, which is their number one market. And they're going after this because nobody has really ever pushed back on them before.The United States has got the goods on China. China is the most prolific cyber hacker in the world and what they're doing is acquiring data and data for what? Data for military technology, intelligence, and personal data, why do they do that?Because they want to be able to advance their own geopolitical goals and they want influence and control. And they recognize what 5G will give them, is a dominant position, in terms of information gathering from one country to another.And the United States, clearly, its national security interests are at stake because these are our allies and we want to, obviously, share information and do business with them, but they're tied to a system that's providing information to the Chinese government. That's going to tie our hands.And, of course, Huawei stands right in front of us, they roll out their CEO at the Mobile World Congress and he stands up there and just like they've done time and time again, they lie right to a world audience.BARTIROMO: We had Andy Purdy on last week and he was basically saying, look, there have been no cyber intrusions, no cyber issues with Huawei, and I thought, what? I just looked at a list of companies that have sued you and you've settled with and we know that the Senate has come out with a report about these Confucius centers. We're going to talk about that later in the show.But this morning, the news, is that Chinese hackers have targeted more than two dozen universities in the United States and around the globe, as a scheme to steal research about maritime technology, being developed by the military.Meanwhile, the founder of Huawei, this is Ren Zhengfei, he said the company has never and will never share information with the Chinese government. So, how does that work? I mean, this is a Chinese-state company.Andy Purdy, the company's chief security officer, was with me last week, and he says that Huawei needs to be more transparent to address technology risks. Watch this, got to get your reaction, General.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIANNA GOLODRYGA, CONTRIBUTOR, CNN NEWS: Have you ever given any information to the Chinese government in any way, shape or form?REN ZHENGFEI, FOUNDER, HUAWEI (through translator): For the past 30 years, we have never done that, and the next 30 years to come, we will never do that.ANDY PURDY, CHIEF SECURITY OFFICER, HUAWEI: There are at least five nations in the world that can virtually implant malicious functionality in products. We, as a nation, we and our allies, need to do a better job of coming up with objective and transparent mechanisms to address those risks.We support addressing those risks and look forward to working with the U.S. government and with other governments we've been working with, the U.K., Germany and others, believe there are ways despite what the warnings from the U.S., and they're among our closest allies. They believe the risk can, in fact, be addressed. I think the major carriers in the world know that.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Yes, I don't think -- I've got an issue with him saying major carriers trust us. I don't know that that's true, major carriers trusting Huawei. But also, how do you have this separation with the Chinese government when you've got -- you've got the Communist Party on your board of directors, General?KEANE: There is no separation. The company answers to the Chinese government, and they clearly provide data to assist the China government and it is the Communist Chinese Party, to be clear, in terms of what we're -- what we're talking about here. And that's -- these statements on the surface are an absurdity. They are the most prolific hackers in the world, and it's undeniable.BARTIROMO: Yes.KEANE: And most countries certainly understand. I applaud this administration. The previous administration was asleep at the switch, so- to-speak, as China is advancing to compete and dominate the 5G, Global Mobile Network System. This administration is recognizing the danger and the threat --BARTIROMO: Yes.KEANE: -- that that presents to us and that's why they're out there educating nations about it, so they clearly understand what the risks are here.BARTIROMO: So General, this is like economic warfare, but there's also military issues. I mean, they're, you know, they're setting up islands in the South China Sea. They're putting military bases on those islands, they're putting military bases as far out as Djibouti, I mean, across the world.So give us, in your sense, what the military risk is, the national security risk is, as a result of what China has been doing.KEANE: Well, China clearly wants to dominate and control the Asia Pacific Region, militarizing the South China Sea, is certainly about that, intimidating and coercion of all of our allies in the region, is part of that -- the fabric of that story. They are the fastest growing military in the world, as we speak, today.They have more combat ships in the Chinese Navy than the United States Navy has. They have dominance in offensive missiles and other specialty areas which make our ships and also our bases in the pacific very vulnerable.And they're expanding globally, as you just mentioned, a base in the Middle East, in Djibouti, why? Because 62 percent of their oil comes out of the Middle East and they don't want that tied up by the United States in the event there was a conflict. They're also interested in Pakistan, they're sort of running the port --BARTIROMO: Yes.KEANE: -- at Panama. They are expanding, globally, because of geopolitical influence and control that they want.BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, I know that the U.S. military and the U.S. is the largest and strongest military across the world, but is it only a matter of time before China overtakes? I mean, they've got 1.4 billion people. We've got 300 million people. Is this just slowing them down, real quick, General?KEANE: Well, we have to work against them, comprehensively, with our allies. When we're pooled together with our allies --BARTIROMO: Yes.KEANE: -- standing against the economic giant and the growing menace of its military capacity, we can be OK.BARTIROMO: Yes.KEANE: But we've got to stitch that together and really tie it up, much tighter than what we're doing right now. I think Secretary Pompeo is trying to do Yowman work here.BARTIROMO: General, it's good to see you this morning, thanks so much.KEANE: Yes. Good talking to you, Maria.BARTIROMO: General Jack Keane, joining us there. Coming up, a major change for Volvo, we will tell you why the company is limiting its cars' top speeds. Yes, they're instituting a speed limit. Then, gaming milestone, millions signing up for Apex Legends. The incredible number, right here, back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Volvo is imposing a speed limit on its cars, Cheryl Casone with the details now, Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes. So, Maria, Volvo says it wants to bring attention to the dangers of speeding, so all of its new cars are going to be limited to 112 miles per hour. They're also considering technology that could put stricter speed limits on cars driving near schools and hospitals.Safety advocates say one of the quickest ways to reduce fatality rates on the roads is to lower speed. They say speeding is blamed for a quarter of all crash deaths.Well, an Ohio teen's battle over vaccination is heading to Capitol Hill. Ethan Lindenberger is set to testify before a Senate committee after he defied his mother's wishes and he got vaccinated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ETHAN LINDENBERGER, HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR, OHIO: My message is very clear and simple, which is that misinformation which spreads lies and evidence that is not scientific or true is dangerous, because when people don't vaccinate, you have a higher risk for preventable disease outbreaks.And so, for my family, it's such is the case where -- because of myself or my family not getting vaccines, we were at a higher risk and the people around us are at high risk.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Yes. So, he's 18 years old. And in Ohio, he is old enough to get shots without his parents' permission.Well, new video game, Apex Legends, has exploded. It has gained 50 million players in the first month. Game developer, Respawn, announced the staggering numbers. But, it's got a long way to go to catch up to rival, Fortnite, which has -- had more than 200 million players of its Battle Royale mode, since the launch.Apex Legends can be downloaded for free on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Windows P.C., shares of Apex publisher, Electronic Arts, down in the premarket, down a little more than a quarter percent, Maria, back to you.BARTIROMO: Wow, 200 million, that's incredible, what numbers. Thank you so much, Cheryl. Coming up, Kylie Jenner, making history on Forbes' World Billionaire list. We're taking a look at how she built her empire, plus revealing the top five on the list, right after this.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Forbes' magazine releasing its annual world billionaires list, in a FOX Business exclusive this morning, the top five are, Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, Bernard Arnault and Carlos Slim. Joining us right now is Assistant Managing Editor of Wealth at Forbes, Luisa Kroll, Luisa, great to see you.LUISA KROLL, ASSISTANT MANAGING EDITOR OF WEALTH, FORBES MAGAZINE: Great to see you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Great issue, anything takeaways from the issue before we get into specifics?KROLL: Well, the big take-away is what a down year it was. Everybody's talking about wealth in this country. And you know, even billionaires are not immune to market forces, particularly around the world. Earlier in your show, you were talking about China, huge drop.There were 102 billionaires from last year's list who fell out of the ranks in China. All-together, there are 49 down, because there actually were a lot of newcomers. Europe took hits, as well. The U.S. was actually one of the only places that was steady and had more billionaires than a year ago.BARTIROMO: That's interesting. And then, a lot of the billionaires in China are women.KROLL: A lot of them are women. They do -- and there are a lot that are self-made, which is pretty impressive.BARTIROMO: We have the youngest billionaire to ever join your list, is Kylie Jenner.KROLL: It's crazy.BARTIROMO: I had no idea she was this successful. Tell us about --DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: She's richer than all of her sisters.BARTIROMO: Yes, exactly.KROLL: She certainly is. And, you know, when we did a story earlier in the year, when she wasn't quite a billionaire, the headline was Money For Nothing, And Clicks For Free. This is definitely, I mean, she is the first selfie billionaire. It's extraordinary how successful she's been.Up until November, all of the sales were online, and then in November, she went into Ulta, the beauty retailer, and in six weeks, she sold $55 million worth of products. So, it's actually a money-making business.MCDOWELL: Who -- does she own the --KROLL: She does.MCDOWELL: -- company outright?KROLL: Yes.MCDOWELL: Did she ever -- is it self-funded? Do you --KROLL: Self-funded because she barely had to spend anything. She got a contract manufacture to make the products, she went on Instagram. She already had a huge following. There's a big debate about is she really self-made. Clearly, she used her fame, but she didn't use -- I mean, she had money from modeling gigs, which was all she needed to start this business.MCDOWELL: Well, she rose to fame on the coat tails of her sister, Kim, Kim being the most famous, and her mother, her mother the momager or how will you say it?KROLL: And her mother actually gets a cut of profits from all of her kids' businesses, so she's doing well.LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA RESEARCH: But there's no -- how many women are on the list overall, the top five are all men, we saw?KROLL: Yes.

No matter what trade deal is struck, the US and China are worlds apart. Huawei is the proofCNN WireMarch 28, 2019 Thursday 3:59 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1192 wordsByline: Analysis by Ben Westcott, CNNDateline: HONG KONG (CNN) BodyHONG KONG (CNN) --  Top negotiators from the US and China will meet yet again in Beijing on Thursday and Friday, in the latest attempt by the world's two largest economies to hammer out a trade deal.Since early 2018, the two governments have been locked in an escalating trade war, which has seen tariffs slapped on hundreds of billions of dollars of American and Chinese goods.Hopes of an imminent -- and long-awaited -- trade agreement were bolstered recently with reports of a possible April summit between US President Donald Trump and China's Xi Jinping. But regardless of the success of the talks, the two countries are likely to remain unreconciled on certain key political and economic fronts. Chinese tech giant Huawei -- which on Friday will announce its annual results -- is the clearest illustration of that. Over the past 12 months, the Trump administration has been exerting pressure on countries around the world to not to use Huawei equipment in the development of next-generation 5G networks, maintaining that products produced by the Chinese company present a security risk.In a bid to push back against Washington, this month Huawei filed a lawsuit against the US government, alleging unconstitutional discrimination. The lawsuit serves as a reminder of the reasons the trade war was launched: The apparent disparity between the access and legal rights granted to Chinese companies operating in the West, compared to the tough trading conditions US companies face in China -- where some companies are required to enter into joint ventures with domestic companies in certain key sectors. Moreover, in China, US companies have little legal recourse against government policy."There's been many cases where you see foreign courts in multiple countries all agreeing with the Western company," said Robert Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. Often, when that same case arrives in a Chinese court, the foreign company loses."That just appears to be political bias," Atkinson added.Point of prideFrom a tiny company founded by a former Chinese soldier in 1988, Huawei has become one of the world's top technology providers and a leader in equipment for super-fast 5G networks.In China, the firm is a symbol of the country's economic rise and a point of pride as its technology becomes equal to, or surpasses Western rivals.But for Washington, the tech giant is a private company in name only. In August, the Trump administration passed the National Defense Authorization Act, which forbids US government agencies from using technology made by Huawei or its smaller Chinese rival ZTE over concerns that the company has close ties to the Chinese government, and the use of its technology could leave agencies open to Chinese surveillance. Huawei has repeatedly denied that any of its products pose a national security risk.Months later, in December, Beijing was outraged after Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou was detained in Canada -- facing extradition to the US on charges of breaching sanctions on Iran.In 2019, Huawei began pushing back. Founder Ren Zhengfei came forward to assure customers of his company's independence."We chose to have our voice heard at this moment because the US government considers us a threat to national security ... Why is Huawei being singled out?" asked Ren.The lawsuit, announced in early March, is the latest step in taking the fight back to the US. But Atkinson pointed out that US companies have been regularly barred in China on national security grounds and left with little legal recourse -- unlike Huawei.Zhang Lin, an independent Chinese economist and columnist, said he'd never heard of a US company taking the Chinese government to court."It's hard for a (Chinese) company to bring such an administrative lawsuit, even harder for a foreign company. It could be blocked in the first place when it tries to open a case," he said.'Rule of law'When asked at the press conference announcing the lawsuit about the potential disparity between the two country's systems, Song Liuping, Huawei's chief legal officer, said China was "governed under the rule of law." "There are specific courts offering trials across China's society and government. I think if other multinational corporations, or even Chinese companies, face unlawful actions from the government, they can stand up for their rights," he said. "Just like how we are standing up for our rights in the United States."But Beijing hasn't been shy in the past about sidelining American companies from securing contracts with Chinese government agencies, in a way that the US government has seen as protectionist.In 2014, Reuters reported that numerous foreign technology brands had been removed from an "approved state purchase lists," effectively barring Chinese government agencies from using their products and services.This isn't the only reported example of foreign technology being blocked by Beijing. In 2014, Microsoft operating system Windows 8 was banned from all government computers in China. No explanation was given.Both situations were similar to the one facing Huawei. In neither case is there a public record of any lawsuit being filed against the Chinese government.One of the regular complaints from foreign businesses in China, according to the American Chamber of Commerce in Beijing, is the inconsistent interpretation of regulations by Chinese authorities and the unclear enforcement of laws.Shortly after imposing his first tariffs on Chinese goods, Trump said such "unfair" barriers must come down."Action must be taken to encourage China to change its unfair practices, open its market to United States goods, and accept a more balanced trade relationship with the United States," Trump said on his official Twitter account in June 2018.EntrenchedThere has, however, been some progress in the opening up of China's economy to American and global interests.China's finance industry, for example, was finally opened to international companies in November 2017, though many other sectors still have strict restrictions on the size of foreign investment. "If you just look at the market access that Chinese law firms have to the US and compare that with the market access -- or lack thereof -- that US law firms have in China, this is definitely an area that we've been advocating for repeatedly," said Alan Beebe, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Beijing.The uneven playing field between US and Chinese firms remains one of the biggest hurdles in ongoing trade negotiations, along with the trade deficit and alleged forced technology transfer.But Atkinson said that, even in the best-case scenario, any trade deal was unlikely to resolve the broad differences between the US and China, their political systems and their economies."I don't think you're ever going to level it ... the distorted playing field is just so entrenched, in all that China does. It would be a long, long time before it would be completely level," he said.CNN's Serenitie Wang contributed to this article.TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

House Homeland Security Subcommittees Issues Testimony From Rail Security AllianceTargeted News ServiceFebruary 26, 2019 Tuesday 7:01 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 3045 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe House Homeland Security subcommittee on Transportation and Maritime Security, and the subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Protection and Innovation issued the following testimony by Erik Olson, vice president of the Rail Security Alliance, at a joint hearing entitled "Securing U.S. Surface Transportation from Cyber Attacks":"Chairman Correa, Chairman Richmond, Ranking Member Lesko, Ranking Member Katko, and members of the Subcommittees, my name is Erik Olson and I am the Vice President of the Rail Security Alliance. The Rail Security Alliance is a coalition of North American freight railcar manufacturers, suppliers, unions, and steel interests committed to ensuring the economic and national security of our passenger and freight rail systems. On behalf of our coalition, thank you for the opportunity to testify on the critical topic of securing our surface transportation systems against cyber and privacy threats."Rail in the United States is an integral component of our critical infrastructure and our way of life. With nearly 140,000 miles of railroad covering the United States, freight rail regularly transports key commodities, sensitive U.S. military equipment, hazardous waste, potentially toxic and hazardous chemicals, and flammable liquids across the country every day. On the passenger side, millions of Americans rely on commuter rail systems every day. The U.S. rail system is also highly sophisticated, relying on a constantly expanding network of technology and digitization that dramatically increases its risk to cyber-attack and hacking."Today, I want to draw the Committee's attention to a particular threat arising from foreign investment in this industry that jeopardizes the future of America's passenger and freight rail systems. China is strategically targeting the U.S. rail manufacturing sector, with aggressive, strategic and anticompetitive actions. Thus far they have secured four U.S. metropolitan transit contracts, largely by utilizing anticompetitive under-bidding practices. With China's government picking up U.S. transit rail manufacturing contracts, the Chinese are now using their rail manufacturing capabilities to assail the U.S. freight manufacturing sector in a move that is reminiscent of what has already occurred in third country markets such as Australia. This activity is a pattern for China's state-owned rail sector and raises grave national security concerns. Without action, America's industrial, military, and other government interests could be forced to rely significantly or wholly on rail cars made by the Chinese Government, thus creating massive cyber vulnerabilities that threaten our military and industrial security.China's State-Owned Enterprises Target U.S. Rail Manufacturing"The "Made in China 2025" initiative, a key component of China's 13th Five-Year plan,1 identifies the rail manufacturing sector as a top target for Chinese expansion. This initiative has systematically and deliberately driven strategic investment and financing activities of the state-owned China Railway Rolling Stock Corporation (CRRC) in third-country markets and the United States. CRRC is wholly owned by the Government of China and it has 90 percent of China's domestic market for production of rail locomotives, bullet trains, passenger trains and metro vehicles.2 In 2015, CRRC reported revenues of more than $37 billion3 -- significantly outpacing the entire U.S. railcar market, which had $22 billion of output during the same year.4 According to Chinese state media, CRRC plans to increase overseas sales to $15 billion by next year alone. This represents about double the level of export orders from just four years ago5 and according to CRRC's own presentation materials the U.S. market remains a prime target to, as they put it, "conquer."6"Using state-backed financing, subsidies, and an array of other government resources, CRRC has strategically targeted and sought to capture the U.S. railcar manufacturing sector. In just the last 5 years the United States has witnessed CRRC establish rail assembly operations for transit railcars in three states, along with additional research and bidding operations in several others. By beginning with a business strategy to take market share in the U.S. transit rail manufacturing sector and deploying near-limitless financing from its home government to help lower the well below-market bids for new U.S. metropolitan transit projects, CRRC has quickly established itself as a formidable force in U.S. transit rail competition."Several recent cases involving CRRC bids for new transit rail projects serve as compelling examples of the strategy being employed by China to capture our rail systems:- CRRC bid $567 million to win a contract with the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority (MBTA) in Boston in 2014, coming in roughly50 percent below other bidders.7- In 2016, CRRC won a contract to provide transit rail for the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA), bidding $226 million less than the next-highest bidder.8- In early 2017, CRRC bid $137.5 million for a contract with Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in Philadelphia, underbidding the next-lowest bidder--which had a robust local manufacturing presence--by $34 million.9- In March 2017, CRRC finalized a contract with the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority for its transit rail system worth up to $647 million.10 Again, China did this by leveraging below-market financing, which in turn undercut other bidders."Emboldened with these contract wins, CRRC continues to target other U.S. cities, including our nation's capital. In September, the Washington Metropolitan Transit Authority (WMATA), which is the second largest mass transit system in the country, issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the new 8000-series metro car. This RFP includes video surveillance, monitoring and diagnostics, data interface with WMATA, and automatic train control systems that are susceptible to cyber-attacks. In response to concerns expressed by a number of lawmakers, including the Vice Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, WMATA re-issued its RFP to include additional cybersecurity protections.11"But the Rail Security Alliance's concerns do not end there. Whomever is selected to supply railcars for WMATA will become a partner in the day-to-day operations of a Metro system whose stops include the Pentagon and the Capitol, as well as unfettered access to our Nation's tunnels and underground infrastructure."We couple this reality with two additional critical facts. First, a classified report written by WMATA's Inspector General recently concluded that there were significant shortcomings in WMATA's enterprise level cybersecurity posture.12 Second, just last week the New York Times noted that "businesses and government agencies in the United States have been targeted in aggressive attacks by...Chinese hackers... ."13 So, in light of China's pervasive history of cyber espionage and hacking, it is the position of the Rail Security Alliance that we cannot trust a Chinese state-owned enterprise to build, own, or operate in U.S. critical infrastructure."These developments are even more alarming because they provide CRRC the opportunity to pivot into freight rail assembly, a subsector of rail not protected by the same Buy America requirements as transit rail, and one that represents a troubling vulnerability if overtaken by the Government of China. Even so, CRRC is making steady and deliberate headway into this sector with the launch of Vertex Rail Corporation and American Railcar Services. Vertex Rail Corporation is now, a defunct freight rail assembly facility that was based in Wilmington, North Carolina. On the other hand, American Railcar Services is a separate assembly facility headquartered in Miami, FL that maintains assembly operations in Moncton, New Brunswick."Concerns about CRRC's transition into freight rail manufacturing are best illustrated by the recent experiences of third-country markets like Australia, whose freight rail manufacturing sector CRRC entered in 2008. In less than 10 years, CRRC effectively decimated the sector, forcing the four domestic suppliers out of business and out of the rail market which left only CRRC standing. Today, almost no meaningful Australian passenger or freight rolling stock manufacturing exists - CRRC's Australia footprint is almost exclusively that of an assembler of Chinese-made parts and a financier of purchases from CRRC. We cannot let that happen here.Implications for National Security"Unlike the U.S. maritime shipping industry, whose security is protected by the Jones Act, a measure that requires vessels transporting goods between U.S. ports to be U.S.-built and majority U.S.-owned, freight rail in America has been left comparatively unprotected. Yet, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) deems the U.S. rail sector as part of the nation's critical infrastructure,14 noting that 140,000 rail miles enable U.S. freight rail to run through every major American city and every military base in the nation. The Department of Defense (DoD), which itself maintains a fleet of more than 1,300 rail cars, has also designated nearly 40,000 miles of freight rail as part of the Strategic Rail Corridor Network (STRACNET), a comprehensive rail network that connects military bases and maritime ports across the country.15 We have had extensive discussions with representatives from the Department of Defense, and based on those discussions I am confident that the Secretary of Defense would express his concerns on this matter as well."Because freight rail transports not only military freight and industrial products, but also nuclear material and hazardous chemicals that can be safely and effectively transported only by rail, there is a serious risk that the technologies in these systems could be compromised by a malicious actor. As noted by Brig. Gen. John Adams (USA, Ret.) in a 2018 report on the vulnerabilities of freight rail16, our rail system's rapidly expanding Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities presents an array of national security challenges that include:* A digitized railroad network/the Internet of Things: Integrated teams of data scientists, software developers, and engineers develop and apply technology across every aspect of the nationwide freight rail network, effectively increasing the vulnerability of industrial control systems, train operations, and perhaps even the industry's metadata warehousing centers to cyber threats.* Rail Signaling: Congress has mandated the installation of positive train control (PTC) systems on much of the nation's rail systems as a means of preventing specific accidents. A malicious cyber breach of PTC or underlying existing rail signaling systems could wreak havoc and cause accidents or derailments on the highly interdependent freight railway network.* Locomotives: Rail locomotives rely upon hundreds of sensors to monitor asset health and performance of train systems.* Onboard Freight Car Location &#38; Asset Health Monitoring: Thousands of freight cars are equipped with telematics or remote monitoring equipment, many of which are carrying hazardous materials like chlorine, anhydrous ammonia, ethylene oxide, and flammable liquids. This tracking technology includes a wireless communication management unit to track precise near-real time location via GPS, direction of travel, speed, and dwell time within the Transportation Security Administration (TSA)'s 45 designated high-threat urban areas (HTUAs).17"End-of-Train Telemetry (EOT): The FRA requires all freight trains operating on excess of 30 mph to be equipped with a 2-way EOT device that tracks GPS location and can allow a locomotive engineer to initiate an emergency brake application, a critical safety feature for trains that can stretch upwards of 10,000 feet long (See Attachment A)."The presence of these evolving technologies underscores the clear danger of a foreign country, and particularly the Government of China and its state-owned enterprises, having undue control of freight manufacturing in the U.S. market. Already, there are reports of Chinese manufacturers investigating the production of their own "telematics" technology to allow the monitoring and control of their rail cars.18 On the transit side, China is already boasting about how it has utilized the latest advances in AI and facial recognition technology to identify and track its 1.4 billion citizens,19 creating a very real prospect that they could do the same here in the United States.Conclusion"As China's CRRC becomes more dominant as a U.S. rail manufacturer, there are urgent and compelling questions we must answer regarding whether a growing presence of, and reliance upon freight or passenger cars from a major state-owned Chinese rail enterprise is likely to compromise the security and safety of industrial, military, and civilian transportation systems in the United States. For that reason, we are grateful that Congress passed legislation last year that would mandate the Department of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States and the Department of Transportation, produce a report on the national security threats of Chinese SOE investment in our rolling stock manufacturing sector,20 and we strongly urge the Committee to work with DHS as that report is completed."We greatly appreciate the Committee's interest in addressing these critical issues. The strategic targeting of our Nation's infrastructure by the Government of China and its state-owned enterprises poses a fundamental threat to the fabric of our critical infrastructure and is a pressure point for malicious cyber actors to threaten not only the economic and national security of the United States, but to our standing as a global power."Thank you again for the opportunity to testify. I look forward to answering any questions you may have."* * *Footnotes:1 U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, 2016 Report to Congress, November 2016, at 100.2 Langi Chiang, China's largest train maker CRRC Corp announces 12.2 billion yuan in contracts, South China Morning Report, July 23, 2015. https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/1842983/chinas-largest-train-maker-crrc-corp-announces-122-billion-yuan3 CRRC Corporation, 2015 CRRC Annual Report, https://www.crrcgc.cc/Portals/73/Uploads/Files/2016/8-23/636075436968234671.pdf4 Oxford Economics, Will We Derail US Freight Rolling Stock Production?, May 2017, at 24.5 Brenda Goh, China Trainmaker CRRC to build more plants abroad in expansion plan: China Daily, REUTERS, Dec. 5, 2016, http://www.reuters.com/article/us-crrc-expansion-idUSKBN13U0EJ.6 @CRRC_global, "Following CRRC's entry to Jamaica, our products are now offered to 104 countries and regions.

But the government has taken its own steps to crack down on this practice.BodyThanks to blockchain, internet users have achieved some victories in the fight against China's strict internet censorship.A historic moment was made on April 23. Peking University's former student, Yue Xin, had penned a letter detailing the university's attempts to hide sexual misconduct. The case involved a student, Gao Yan,            who committed suicide in 1998 after a professor sexually assaulted and then harassed her. The letter was blocked by Chinese social networking websites, but an anonymous user posted it on the Ethereum blockchain. In another case, in July, Chinese citizens used blockchain to preserve an investigative story which condemned inferior vaccines being given to Chinese babies. The vaccines produced by Shenzhen-based Changsheng Bio-Tech failed to fight tetanus and whooping cough. The company has also            allegedly faked data for about 113,000 doses of human rabies vaccine.A blockchain is a secure database that's stored in a distributed set of computers. Every addition to the database must be digitally signed, making clear who's changing what and when.To ensure that only authorized users have access to the information, blockchains use cryptography-based digital signatures that verify identities. A user signs transactions with a "private key," which is generated when an an account is created. A private key typically is a long and random alphanumeric code, known only to the person who controls the account. Using complicated algorithms, blockchains also create "public keys" from private keys. Public keys are known to the public and make it possible to share information. For instance, a bitcoin wallet address is a public key. Any bitcoin user can send payments to that address. However, only the person with the private key can spend the bitcoin.From researching           blockchain and            China's internet control measures, I can see that blockchain systems' features are in conflict with the goals of the Chinese Communist Party. Truly decentralized blockchains will challenge the ability of authoritarian nations to maintain a tight grip over their populations. Blockchain's censorship-resistance featuresBlockchain makes censorship extremely difficult. Yue Xin's letter, which was written in English and Chinese, and the story about the inferior vaccines have been inserted into the metadata of transactions in the            Ethereum blockchain. Each transaction cost a few cents. Since Ethereum transactions are permanent and public, anyone can read the letter. The posts cannot be tampered with. Since they are distributed among many computers in decentralized networks, it is not possible for Chinese internet censors to pressure any company to remove them. The Chinese government has been alarmed about blockchain censorship resistance. Starting in February, a new regulation of the Cyberspace Administration of China requires users to provide real names as well as national ID card numbers or mobile phones to use blockchains. Law enforcement must be able to access data posted on the blockchain when necessary. Blockchain service providers are required to keep relevant records about transactions and other relevant information and report illegal use to authorities. They also need to prevent the production, duplication, publication and dissemination of contents that are banned by Chinese laws.According to the new regulation, blockchain services are also required to remove "illegal information" quickly to stop it from spreading. This requirement is puzzling because, in commonly understood blockchains, information stored is immutable and thus cannot be removed. Blockchains with Chinese characteristicsThe Chinese strategy toward modern technology is to balance economic modernization and political control. According to the World Economic Forum, blockchain is among six computing "mega-trends" that are likely to shape the world in the next decade. The Chinese government hopes that blockchain can address the diverse economic and social problems China faces, such as            insurance fraud,            environmental pollution and            food safety. The Chinese government is against truly decentralized blockchain systems such as bitcoin, which relies on users, also known as "nodes" or "peers," competing to verify transactions. At least            tens of thousands of computers from all over the world are connected at any point of time in the bitcoin network.The former head of the People's Bank of China's digital currency research institute, Yao Qian, argued against the need for community consensus in which all users engage in transactions and governance related decisions. He favored a            multi-center system, in which consensus is managed by several main nodes. Intervention can be applied in case of emergency. If needed, data can be rolled back, and transactions can be reversed. The system can even be shut down. China has been the first nation to            rank blockchains. Most blockchains that rank high are developed in China or have strong Chinese connections. It is easier for the government to access and control such blockchains. It is impossible for a Chinese blockchain company to operate and succeed in China            without helping the government to achieve its censorship goals. The blockchain most favored by the Chinese government, EOS, uses a model where users vote for representatives. Only the representatives verify transactions and make decisions regarding system updates. All transactions and governance decisions in EOS are processed and approved by only 21 main nodes, known as supernodes. Twelve of the EOS supernodes are in China. This makes it easier for the government to control blockchains, since the penalty of noncompliance with Chinese regulations is high for China-based supernodes.  The third-ranked blockchain,            Ontology, and the            seventh,            Neo, have smaller numbers of main nodes: seven each. Censorship can be easily enforced in these blockchain thanks to small numbers of main nodes, mainly in China, involved in transactions and governance decisions.Struggle for controlChina's approach to blockchain regulation reflects the tension it faces between using modern technologies to maintain control and using them to stimulate economic growth. The Chinese government wouldn't allow blockchain implementation without significant modification. Blockchain applications modified to satisfy China's have lost fundamental elements of the original technology.The new laws, combined with the Chinese government's indication of its favorite blockchains, could constrain activists' ability to use blockchains to fight censorship. For instance, the supernodes of EOS froze accounts associated with email scams and stopped them from making transactions. It also            reversed transactions that were previously confirmed. These examples illustrate that blockchains are being developed that help suppress contents that are objectionable to the Chinese government. Activists who are vocal against the Chinese government may also be barred from using some blockchains, such as Neo. In this way, China could also emerge as a role model for other authoritarian regimes in developing censorship-enabled blockchain solutions.Nir Kshetri does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.Load-Date: February 25, 2019End of Document

AMBASSADOR LU SHAYE PUBLISHES A SIGNED ARTICLEStates News ServiceJanuary 10, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 801 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: BEIJING, China BodyThe following information was released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China:From Chinese Embassy in CanadaThe Hill Times published a signed article by Ambassador Lu Shaye titled "Why the double standard on justice for Canadians, Chinese?" Here is the full text: Recently, China's competent authorities took compulsory measures in accordance with the law against two Canadian nationals who are suspected of engaging in activities that endanger China's national security. Some Canadians and some in the Canadian news media, in disregard of China's judicial sovereignty, accused China of arbitrary detention and demanded their immediate release. However, on the prior groundless detention of Chinese citizen Meng Wanzhou by Canada at the behest of the United States, these same people made utterly different comments. They insisted that Canada's detention of a Chinese citizen who was transferring planes at the airport was "acting in accordance with law," though Meng has not been charged with any violation of Canadian law. It's understandable that these Canadians are concerned about their own citizens. But have they shown any concern or sympathy for Meng after she was illegally detained and deprived of freedom? Without violating any Canadian law, Meng was arrested last month and put in handcuffs just as she was changing planes at the Vancouver International Airport. It seems that, to some people, only Canadian citizens shall be treated in a humanitarian manner and their freedom deemed valuable, while Chinese people do not deserve that. When China called on the Canadian side to release Meng and ensure her legal and legitimate rights and interests, those elites claimed in the media that Canada is a country of rule of law and has an independent judiciary, and therefore it must comply with the judicial proceeding. However, in the case of detention of Canadian citizens in China who violated China's law, those elites completely dismissed China's law and presumptuously urged China to immediately release their citizens. It seems that, to those people, the laws of Canada or other Western countries are laws and must be observed, while China's laws are not and shouldn't be respected. Some people in Canada, without any evidence, have been hyping the idea that Huawei is controlled by the Chinese government and poses security threats to Canada and other Western countries, and that Chinese law requires China's enterprises to collaborate with the government in espionage activities. However, these same people have conveniently ignored the PRISM Program, Equation Group, and Echelon-global spying networks operated by some countries that have been engaging in large-scale and organized cyber stealing, and spying and surveillance activities on foreign governments, enterprises, and individuals. These people also took a laissez-faire attitude toward a country that infringes on its citizens' privacy rights through the Patriot Act. They shouted for a ban by the Five Eyes alliance countries (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States) on the use of Huawei equipment by these countries' own enterprises, which is literally a government-controlled action. When making laws for national security and intelligence, China has drawn references from the relevant laws of the U.S., Canada, and other Western countries. Something is considered as "safeguarding national security" when it is done by Western countries. But it is termed "conducting espionage" when done by China. What's the logic? Canada, pulling a few individual countries such as the U.S. and the U.K. on its side, pressed China in the name of "the international community" to release its citizens. Do a handful of Western countries really represent the whole international community? To those would-be representatives of the international community, non-Western countries are not members of the international community and only their countries can call the shots on international affairs. I have recently heard a word repeatedly pronounced by some Canadians: bullying. They said that by arresting two Canadian citizens as retaliation for Canada's detention of Meng, China was bullying Canada. To those people, China's self-defence is an offence to Canada. If someone slaps you on your left cheek, give him your right cheek, they told us. But I have never seen them doing as they said. The reason why some people are used to arrogantly adopting double standards is due to Western egotism and white supremacy. In such a context, the rule of law is nothing but a tool for their political ends and a fig leaf for their practising hegemony in the international arena. What they have been doing is not showing respect for the rule of law, but mocking and trampling the rule of law.Load-Date: January 11, 2019End of Document

CHINA'S STABILITY IS AT RISKStates News ServiceJanuary 7, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1318 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Center for the National Interest (former the Nixon Center):Offshore investors who have become enamored of the illusion of economic growth and political stability in China may want to recalibrate the reality gauge in 2019.by Christopher WhalenThe western view of China's political economy is driven partly by anecdote, partly by accepting Beijing's propaganda/economic data as fact. Foreign investors have convinced themselves that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is superior in terms of economic management, this despite ample evidence to the contrary, thus accepting the official view is easy but also increasingly risky.In a December 15 speech , Renmin University's Xiang Songzuo warned that Chinese stock market conditions resemble those during the 1929 Wall Street Crash. He also suggested that the Chinese economy is actually shrinking. But this apostate view was quickly rejected by legions of captive western economists and investment analysts whose livelihood depends upon "selling China" to credulous foreign audiences.Facts aside, the perception of China is what matters to global investors, part of a larger pathology of hope-based investment allocation that eschews those rare bits of hard data that disagree with the positive narrative. China growth, Tesla profitability, or the mystical blockchain are require more credulity than ever before.For example, in the first half of 2016 global capital markets stopped due to fear of a Chinese recession. Credit spreads soared and deal flows disappeared. But was this really a surprise? In fact, the Chinese government had accelerated official stimulus in 2015 and 2016 to counter a possible slowdown and, particularly, ensure a quiet domestic scene as paramount leader Xi Jinping was enshrined into the Chinese constitution.Today western audiences are again said to be concerned about China's economy and this concern is justified, but perhaps not for the reasons touted in the financial media. The China Beige Book (CBB) fourth-quarter preview, released December 27, reports that sales volumes, output, domestic and export orders, investment, and hiring fell on a year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter basis. Headed by Leland Miller, CBB is a research service that surveys thousands of companies and bankers on the ground in China every quarter.Contrary to the positive foreign narrative about "growth" in China, CBB contends that deflation is the bigger threat compared to inflation. "Because of China's structural problems, deflation has very clearly emerged as the bigger threat in a slowing economy than inflation. Consumer demand has weakened, and you see that reflected in retail and services prices," CBB Managing Director Shehzad Qazi said in an interview .In fact the Bank of China has been cutting reserve requirements for Chinese banks since the start of 2018, another example of how long it took for Wall Street to get the joke on China. Of course the real driver of the economic tightness in China is the same as in the United States and Europe, namely the voracious appetite that the U.S. Treasury has for cash. The Federal Open Market Committee talks about interest rates, but the debt issuance of the Treasury is the doggie, the Fed is the tail. And the actions of the Treasury, combined with the runoff of the FOMC's bond portfolio (aka quantitative tightening or "QT") is constricting credit markets from Paris all the way to Beijing and back again.The continuing unwind of the shadowy and likely insolvent Chinese conglomerate HNA is a useful metaphor for the Chinese economy more broadly. Lots of debt, but no visible equity in a corporate organization chart that defies understanding. Offshore holdings in companies or real estate are being liquidated as fast as they were accumulated. During the third quarter of last year, Chinese conglomerates sold off more than $1 billion worth of commercial real estate in the United States, while purchasing only $231 million, according to the Wall Street Journal . The retreat from offshore investments came after restrictions were imposed by the Chinese government on foreign investments.Because of the slowing internal economy, there is every indication that Xi intends to increase restrictions on offshore holdings, especially those involving debt, to help maximize liquidity at home. What does this suggest? Chinese companies all clear their currency and securities through Bank of China; thus, the Chinese central bank has a comprehensive view of and risk to offshore flows for investments and debt service. A single point of failure: to borrow from the world of enterprise risk. The forced liquidation of HNA and insurer Anbang suggests a degree of urgency to pairing back the huge amounts of debt leverage used by many Chinese companies and the attendant cost of funding these obligations.HNA, lest we forget, was once touted as a Chinese champion. HNA officials paid for assets, threw lavish events, and pasted the company's name on the sides of building around the world. That's a bit flashy. Also, HNA was seen as a savior for Germany's Deutsche Bank AG, but now the company has begun to unwind its debt financed position in the bank's common stock. Incredibly, U.S. and EU bank regulators still have no idea as to the true beneficial ownership of HNA.Meanwhile, HNA also is in talks to sell its Ingram Micro business to Apollo Global. The Chinese conglomerate reportedly seeks $7.5 billion, including debt, for Ingram Micro, one of America's largest distributors of personal computers and electronic equipment. But why did HNA buy Ingram in the first instance? Nobody knows. And virtually everyone on Wall Street, including the credit-rating agencies, wasand ishappy to do business with HNA.It is telling that China Development Bank (CDB) is leading a team to supervise HNA Group's asset disposals. Watching the liquidation of the HNA Group, you begin to appreciate just how fragile Beijing's control is over the economy. CDB, of course, is HNA's biggest creditor, and it in turn is an appendage of the Bank of China. The financial disarray seen among some once high-flying Chinese companies suggests a major turnabout from the years when offshore investments were encouraged.Western analysts tend to think about China in terms of economic risk, but internal stability may be a more pressing issueboth because of the growing potential for violent change and because western audiences are completely unprepared for this eventuality. These are the key risks facing the Chinese economy: mountains of debt, no real equity leverage in the economy, and a payments system that is entirely focused through the Bank of China.But the most troubling development are the growing signs that the CCP and paramount leader Xi Jinping feel compelled to take more and more authoritarian measures to retain political control. Credulous western observers talk about the "long term" perspective of the CCP, but in fact this gang of "running dogs," to borrow the Marxist terminology, is no different than western politicians. The CCP is no more able to manage a complex modern economy than is President Donald Trump. Thomas Sowell argues that American liberals are authoritarians with a human face. China, on the other hand, is brutally and unapologetically authoritarian.The rise of Xi Jinping to sole power in China is nothing if not a display of massive insecurity and power, starting with the elimination of all rivals and ending with the dissolution of collective leadership. Revelations that Beijing expects to imprison over a million Muslim Uighurs in work camps, a mere 10 percent of the eleven million population of Xinjiang, also suggests a very direct and present fear of instability. But it is difficult to look at China today and not be reminded of some unfortunate historical parallels.

Uighurs who break the rules often vanish, or are held captive in prison-like camps.• Four Uighurs living in the US and Turkey told INSIDER that their family members blocked them on instant messaging apps and social media as a way of protecting themselves.• The expat Uighurs have been left heartbroken by the lack of contact, and many fear their families members are suffering in Chinese captivity."There are no relatives left," said Muyesser Abdul'ehed, referring to the depleted contact book on her phone. "But I'm glad they deleted me."Abdul'ehed, a teacher and poet in Istanbul, Turkey, has been systematically cut off by all her family members on WeChat, the ubiquitous Chinese messaging app.There is only one reason for her entire family - who live in Xinjiang, western China - to cease all contact so abruptly: fear.Her family are Uighurs, a majority-Muslim ethnic minority group China has been relentlessly persecuting.Kevin Frayer/Getty ImagesLife in Xinjiang has effectively come to a standstill over the last two years. According to the US State Department, China has detained up to 2 million Uighur residents, for increasingly flimsy reasons, one of which is messaging people who live in other countries.China's unprecedented crackdown is why Abdul'ehed's relatives in China deleted her from their contacts, leaving her unable to talk to them or even see their latest pictures.INSIDER interviewed four members of the Uighur diaspora, who report a similar experience of being abruptly cut off by those they love most, for fear of retribution by the heavy-handed Xinjiang regional government.Kevin Lee/GettyReports from activists and media outlets claim that Uighurs who cross the authorities are physically tortured, forced to renounce their religion, and            force-fed unknown medications that interfere with their memories.Abdul'ehed's said: "At first I was so hurt. I thought: 'They didn't have to do that.' After that, I understood that something serious was going on.""I'm glad they deleted me," she said. "Because I, somehow, may be a reason for authorities to arrest them."Kevin Frayer/Getty ImagesLocal authorities in Xinjiang don't officially notify relatives abroad when they round people up.And because most people in Xinjiang have either blocked all their contacts abroad, or are scared to talk about what's going on, they are struggling to find out about their loves ones.They are left to wonder when their loved ones disappeared, how they were taken, what they purportedly did wrong, and where they might be now.Read more: Shocking footage purportedly shows cells inside prison camp where China oppresses Muslim minorityCourtesy of Bahram SintashSisters, parents, wives, and children - goneBahram Sintash, a gym owner in Chantilly, Virginia, said his mother blocked him on WeChat in February 2018, likely to avoid getting captured and detained.WeChat has passed on user data to the Chinese government in the past, which means users run a constant risk of being found out.Sintash told INSIDER: "My mum blocked me on WeChat in February 2018. I couldn't send any messages to her. I cannot see her pictures, I cannot send any messages to her. My sister also blocked me."Courtesy of Bahram SintashHis last message to his mother, in the Uighur language, was: "When are you going to [visit] our home in the countryside?"She replied: "After Chinese New Year."Chinese New Year came and went, and Sintash heard nothing from her.The screenshot on the right shows Sintash and his mother's last messages to each other, and the error messages he received when he tried to send videos of his son playing the piano to his mother after she blocked him."Before, WeChat was the only tool that we [used to] communicate with each other," Sintash told INSIDER."Almost once every two or three days we sent messages and pictures. I often sent my son's pictures."Courtesy of Bahram SintashSeven months after his mother blocked him, Sintash heard from a contact on the ground - whom he declined to name - that his father Qurban Mamut, a 68-year-old retired editor, had gone missing."I tried to find out the exact news, but I couldn't get any news out because people can't talk to outsiders," Sintash said.He suspects his father was taken away because he used to edit the state-controlled Xinjiang Civilization magazine, which worked to preserve Uighur culture and history. Scholars and activists have previously warned of Beijing's efforts to eradicate Uighur culture."Xinjiang has become an open-city jail," Sintash said.Abdurahman Tohti via Uyghur Bulletin/TwitterAbdurahman Tohti, a self-employed driver living in Istanbul, said his wife mysteriously blocked him on WeChat shortly after she and their children arrived in Xinjiang to visit family in 2016.His parents, who are still in Xinjiang, had cut off contact with him before that, telling him not to contact them and changing their phone number. He added that the number he had for his parents-in-law also went out of service.Last month he found a video of his 4-year-old son, Abduleziz, filmed in what appeared to be a state-run Chinese orphanage.            You can read more about his story here.Courtesy of Abdurahman TohtiAbdul'ehed, the poet in Istanbul, also started suspecting that her cousin had been disappeared when he blocked her on WeChat.Her cousin Erpat Ablekrem, a 25-year-old professional soccer player with whom she communicated often, blocked her on WeChat early last year, Abdul'ehed told INSIDER. And when she contacted other relatives for news, they blocked her too.Read more: This man's family vanished in China's most oppressed region. Last month he saw his son for the first time in 2 years, in a Chinese propaganda video."He [Ablekrem] deleted me on WeChat and we couldn't have any contact with him," she told INSIDER, adding that her brother also looked through Ablekrem's profile on QQ, a microblogging site, but did not find any updates."We were so curious about it, and we asked a lot of relatives," Abdul'ehed said, "but they just deleted us instead of telling us."Courtesy of Muyesser Abdul'ehedAbdul'ehed believes Ablekrem might have been rounded up because he failed to block her and other family members in Turkey sooner.China is known to punish Uighurs for traveling to or communicating with people in Turkey. The Turkish government has for years offered a space for Uighurs to seek refuge and stage protests against China, and Beijing has threatened to tank their economic relations in response.Read more: The mystery of a Muslim poet who may or may not be dead in a Chinese detention camp is at the center of a diplomatic crisis between China and TurkeyCourtesy of Rushan AbbasRushan Abbas, a Uighur activist living in Herndon, Virginia, took the initiative to remove herself from her family's life instead for fear that her activism would hurt them.She told INSIDER: "I don't communicate with my family because I want to protect them. I didn't want the Chinese government to harm them because of the guilt by association, which the government does all the time."But that appeared not to be enough. Her sister and aunt disappeared from their homes in the cities of Urumqi and Artux last September, six days after she publicly criticized China's human-rights record at an event in Washington, DC.She said: "I have not been in touch with [my sister] since the summer of 2017. I have not talked to her at all."Courtesy of Rushan AbbasAbbas added, with her voice close to tears: "I feel terrible because we are living in the 21st century, you know? With smartphones, people all around the world can communicate. They see each other on FaceTime, using different apps. They can communicate with anybody on the world.""Here I am, living in America for almost 30 years - I've been an American citizen for 25 years - and I am doing everything under my constitution in America, as an American," she said."I am expressing my opinion for what's happening in East Turkestan," she said, referring to an alternative name for the region. "Yet, I have to worry that the Chinese government may persecute my family because of my activism."Kevin Frayer/Getty ImagesThere is almost no other way to find out about Uighurs' disappearances in Xinjiang.Louisa Greve, the director of external affairs at the American non-profit Uyghur Human Rights Project (UHRP), told INSIDER that her organization relies on testimonies from relatives abroad, other activists, and the few rare independent news outlets that remain in the region, like Radio Free Asia Uyghur Service.The UHRP last month identified identified 338 academics, doctors, journalists, and other scholars who have vanished in Xinjiang since 2017.NOW WATCH: North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un is 35 - here's how he became one of the world's scariest dictatorsSee Also:• A WWII US aircraft carrier, lost for 76 years, has been found on the floor of the South Pacific Ocean• 3 US soldiers were injured in a night training exercise, reportedly while practising a 'low open' parachute jump• The mystery of a Muslim poet who may or may not be dead in a Chinese detention camp is at the center of a diplomatic crisis between China and TurkeyLoad-Date: February 16, 2019End of Document

The Market for Wine Import in China to 2023 - France Was the Largest Source of China's Wine Imports in 2018, Followed by Australia and ChilePR NewswireMarch 19, 2019 Tuesday 1:45 PM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 980 wordsDateline: DUBLIN, March 19, 2019 BodyPR NewswireThe"Research Report on Wine Import in China, 2019-2023"report has been added toResearchAndMarkets.com'soffering.According to this market survey, there is neither well-developed wine culture nor well-known wine brands on the Chinese market.Most Chinese consumers find it difficult to identify the types and grades of wines. Therefore, low-end imported wines prevail in China. Some inferior wines are even sold at high prices by the advantage of marketing techniques.China's wine market will become standardized as consumers grow more mature and the market is better regulated. But it may take 5 to 10 years or longer. It is important for wine importers to select brands and products suitable for the Chinese market and spread consumption concept in a way acceptable to Chinese consumers.Market SummaryWith the improvement of living standards and the change of lifestyle, the demand for wine in China keeps increasing. China is the fifth largest wine consumer in the world. The fixed wine consumer groups in China are no longer limited to the middle class and the well-heeled.An increasing number of young people are starting to drink wine, and some middle-aged and elderly people are becoming wine drinkers for health reasons. At official banquets and business dinners, the consumption of Chinese spirits far exceeds that of wine but the gap in market share is narrowing.The development of e-commerce boosts wine sales in China - and consumer groups vary greatly in preference and purchasing power. The output volume and quality of domestic wine can hardly be improved, and wine making costs more in China than in other countries, which pushes up the import volume of wine in China.Many Chinese wine producers repackage imported bulk wine to produce a wine of their own brands. As the Chinese government has no special restrictions on wine import, the number of wine importers in China stays above 5,000 in recent years.According to this analysis, the import volume of wine in China reached 729.68 million liters in 2018. It decreased as compared to 2017 but increased by about 80% as compared to 2013.About 20% of China's wine imports are bulk wine in containers holding more than 10L, and the rest are bottled wine in containers holding 10L or less. In 2018, the import value of wine in China reached USD 3.91 billion, increasing by about 6.5% as compared to 2017.France was the largest source of China's wine imports. The value of China's wine imports from France was about USD 1 billion in 2018, decreasing by nearly 9% YOY.Australia was the second largest source of China's wine imports. The value of China's wine imports from Australia was about USD 700 million in 2018, decreasing by 3.5% YOY.Chile was the third largest source of China's wine imports. The value of China's wine imports from Chile was about USD 340 million, increasing by 4.5% YOY.In 2018, the average import price of wine in China was lower than 6 USD/liter, which shows that China's wine imports are mostly medium-to-low end products.Key TopicsEconomic and policy environments of wine import in China Wine import in China from 2013 to 2018 Major sources of China's wine imports Product segments and prices of wine imports Major wine importers in China Forecasts on wine import in China from 2019 to 2023List of Topics Covered1 Overview of the Wine Industry1.1 Definition of Wine1.2 Classification of Wine1.3 Industry Chain of Wine2 Development Environment of China's Wine Industry2.1 Economic Environment2.2 Policy Environment2.3 Social Environment3 Analysis on Supply of and Demand for Wine in China3.1 Analysis on Supply of Wine in China3.2 Analysis of Demand for Wine in China3.2.1 Wine Consumer Groups in China3.2.2 Consumption Volume of Wine in China4 Wine Import in China, 2013-20184.1 Analysis on Scale of Wine Import in China4.1.1 Import Volume of Wine in China4.1.2 Import Value of Wine in China4.2 Analysis of Average Import Price of Wine in China4.3 Analysis of China's Reliance on Wine Imports5 Analysis of China's Wine Imports by Type5.1 Analysis of Bottled Wine Import in China5.1.1 Sources of China's Bottled Wine Imports5.1.2 Import Volume of Bottled Wine in China5.1.3 Import Value of Bottled Wine in China5.1.4 Average Import Price of Bottled Wine in China5.2 Analysis of Bulk Wine Import in China5.2.1 Sources of China's Bulk Wine Imports5.2.2 Import Volume of Bulk Wine in China5.2.3 Import Value of Bulk Wine in China5.2.4 Average Import Price of Bulk Wine in China5.3 Analysis of Sparkling Wine Import in China5.3.1 Sources of China's Sparkling Wine Imports5.3.2 Import Volume of Sparkling Wine in China5.3.3 Import Value of Sparkling Wine in China5.3.4 Average Import Price of Sparkling Wine in China6 Major Wine Importers in China6.1.1 Enterprise Profiles6.1.2 Analysis on Wine Business7 Prospect of Wine Import in China, 2019-20237.1 Factors Influencing Wine Import in China7.1.1 Major Driving Forces and Market Opportunities7.1.2 Threats and Challenges7.2 Forecast on Import Volume of Wine in China7.2.1 Forecast on Total Import Volume7.2.2 Forecast on Structure of Wine Imports7.3 Forecast on Demand for Wine Imports in ChinaFor more information about this report visithttps://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/fftr5j/the_market_for?w=5Research and Markets also offersCustom Researchservices providing focused, comprehensive and tailored research.Media Contact:Research and MarketsLaura Wood, Senior Managerpress@researchandmarkets.com   For E.S.T Office Hours Call +1-917-300-0470For U.S./CAN Toll Free Call +1-800-526-8630For GMT Office Hours Call +353-1-416-8900U.S. Fax: 646-607-1907Fax (outside U.S.): +353-1-481-1716 View original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-market-for-wine-import-in-china-to-2023---france-was-the-largest-source-of-chinas-wine-imports-in-2018-followed-by-australia-and-chile-300814938.htmlSOURCE Research and MarketsLoad-Date: March 20, 2019End of Document

WiTricity Continues Building Momentum in China with VIE; Chinese automotive Tier 1 licenses WiTricity wireless electric vehicle (EV) charging technologyBusiness WireMarch 20, 2019 Wednesday 12:30 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Business Wire, Inc.Distribution: Business Editors; Technology EditorsLength: 795 wordsDateline: WATERTOWN, Mass. BodyWiTricity , the industry pioneer in wireless power transfer over distance, today announced an intellectual property licensing agreement with a subsidiary of Zhejiang VIE Science & Technology Co., Ltd. (VIE). The terms of the license agreement will allow the company to develop and commercialize highly efficient wireless EV charging systems for sale to leading carmakers in the China market based on WiTricity's patented magnetic resonance technology and industry-leading designs.China is the leading global market for EV development and adoption. According to Bloomberg , China accounted for 60 percent of global EV sales in the fourth quarter of 2018, and by the end of the year, EVs accounted for 7 percent of all new vehicle sales in the country. The Chinese government is playing a large role in increased EV adoption, offering subsidies to EV buyers and quotas for EV sales. Governments at the city-level are also weighing in, creating restrictions on internal combustion engine vehicle purchases. Officials predict that a complete ban on gas-powered automobiles will happen in China by 2040.VIE, headquartered in Zhuji city, China, specializes in R&D and manufacturing of major automotive parts and is a leading developer in the automotive industry. VIE's subsidiary has been active in research and development of wireless charging for the past four years and is already engaged with multiple carmakers."The addition of WiTricity's technology to the VIE family's product line is advantageous for the future of e-mobility," said Mervyn Chen, Chairman at Zhejiang VIE Science and Technology. "Wireless charging will support increased EV adoption in China. VIE will strive to meet the needs of both China-based and global carmakers that are targeting the Chinese market. We also believe that WiTricity's recent acquisition of Qualcomm Halo's assets will simplify and accelerate the implementation of standards for wireless charging, which will result in broader adoption in the market.""Wireless charging is an important component of the EV and autonomous vehicle ecosystem in China. We are proud to be working with an experienced Tier 1 company to bring wireless EV charging to market and accelerate EV momentum in China," said Alex Gruzen, CEO, WiTricity.About VIEThe VIE Group, which is the predecessor of Zhejiang VIE Science & Technology Co., Ltd.'s auto parts business segment, was established in 1985.

America's Cold War With Chinese Tech Turns HotAtlantic OnlineJanuary 29, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 905 wordsByline: Alexis C. MadrigalBodyToday, the most geopolitically significant technology spat in the world ratcheted up a few notches. The Department of Justice unsealed two separate court cases against Huawei, the world's largest telecommunications company, which is headquartered in China. One indictment accused Huawei and the company's CFO, Meng Wanzhou, of creating a "fraudulent financial scheme" that allowed the company to sell technology to Iran, breaking U.S. sanctions. The other newly unsealed indictment documents the 2012 theft of trade secrets from T-Mobile that took the form of designing and operating a            phone-testing robot called Tappy.The current Huawei saga has all the trappings of a Cold War espionage thriller, but reengineered for our current moment. Instead of Russia, it's China. Instead of arms, it's mobile technology. Instead of Iran, it's ... no, it's still Iran, actually.Americans are generally unfamiliar with Huawei because the U.S. government has tried to keep the company out of the market. Around the world, however, Huawei and a few Western companies are vying to become the preferred backbone of the world's wireless infrastructure. It's a huge business, and it's core to every country's national security. American officials have long argued that, if push came to shove, Huawei would bend to the needs and desires of the Chinese government, not its customers in other countries.[Read: Beijing wants to rewrite the rules of the internet]This particular moment is also significant because the new generation of mobile infrastructure-termed 5G-is due to be built out over the next few years. A relatively small group of companies can provide the technology to do 5G, and Huawei is globally competitive, especially given that many countries could see American companies as equally entangled with the nation's national-security apparatus as Huawei is with China's.Even without American business, Huawei has grown tremendously in size and influence. American officials are working their hardest to keep Huawei out of its allies' networks, but the company is "           flourishing in Europe."The U.S. government has a long-expressed distaste for the Chinese telecom giant. In 2005, a            congressional report averred that "industrial espionage is an active tool of China's strategy for technological development." In 2009, congressional opposition            scuttled a proposed deal between Huawei and the American networking company 3Com. The year 2010            saw Sprint Nextel refuse bids from Huawei and ZTE, another Chinese tech company. And in 2012, a different            congressional report recommended that American telecom companies refrain from buying equipment from Huawei because of national-security risks. Huawei, for its part, has            denied being a tool of the Chinese government."Unfortunately, over the past 10 years, as we have been investing in the United States, we have encountered a number of misperceptions that some hold about Huawei,"            the company wrote in a 2011 open letter. "These include unfounded and unproven claims of 'close connections with the Chinese military,' 'disputes over intellectual property rights,' 'allegations of financial support from the Chinese government,' and 'threats to the national security of the United States.'"At the same time, the ongoing trade war with China adds weight to every China-related action by the Donald Trump administration.In early December 2018,            Canadian officials detained the Huawei CFO, who is also the company founder's daughter. The U.S. is pressing to extradite her on fraud charges related to misrepresentations she allegedly made about Skycom, a company that the U.S. says Huawei secretly operated in Iran as a subsidiary, to financial institutions. That's created a three-way diplomatic incident with the Canadian and Chinese governments.The indictment regarding Tappy is less complex. According to the legal document, the Huawei China engineers who are building a similar robot straightforwardly asked Huawei USA engineers working with T-Mobile to gather detailed information all the way down to the "shape, diameter, and hardness" of the little tip that Tappy used to simulate fingers touching phones. After many different entreaties, they eventually smuggled a robot arm out of a T-Mobile facility, then returned it, and allegedly faked an investigation into the incident.To announce the newly available indictments, a coterie of Trump administration officials each took turns slapping at Huawei in a press conference in Washington. "These cases make clear that, as a country, we have to carefully consider the risk that companies like Huawei pose if we're going to allow them into our telecommunications infrastructure," Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker said.[           Reihan Salam: How Trump can challenge China]Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia immediately and firmly endorsed the new tough line. "There is ample evidence to suggest that no major Chinese company is independent of the Chinese government and Communist Party-and Huawei, which China's government and military tout as a 'national champion,' is no exception," he said in a statement. "It has been clear for some time that Huawei poses a threat to our national security, and I applaud the Trump Administration for taking steps to finally hold the company accountable."In 2019, mobile technology cannot be disentangled from national security, and the ramifications of that will continue to reverberate throughout the world.Load-Date: January 31, 2019End of Document

A China-controlled internet? Why tech giant Huawei roils Western fears.; The next generation of wireless networks will help power the 'internet of things,' with links to everything from home thermostats to critical national infrastructure. That sets up a tussle over who should be trusted to build it.The Christian Science MonitorJanuary 30, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 Christian Science Publishing Society All Rights ReservedSection: WorldLength: 1119 wordsByline: Peter Ford Global correspondentBodyHuawei, the world's biggest producer of telecommunications equipment, has been in the headlines as the United States proceeds with a case against one of its executives. Here's a look at the case, the company, and the global issues at stake.Q: Who is Meng Wanzhou and why was she arrested?Ms. Meng, who is also known as Sabrina Meng, is the daughter of the founder of Huawei, the Chinese tech giant. She is also the company's chief financial officer.The US Justice Department issued an arrest warrant for Meng late last year, charging her with violating US sanctions against Iran by doing business through a hidden subsidiary.So when, last December, she flew into Vancouver, British Columbia, where she owns two luxury homes, Canadian authorities detained her under the terms of Canada's extradition treaty with the US. She is under house arrest on $7.5 million bail, wearing an electronic ankle bracelet.In the teeth of furious objections from Beijing, Washington formally requested Meng's extradition on Monday. The Canadian Justice Department must decide within 30 days whether to proceed; if it does proceed, a judge will hold an extradition hearing. Meng can appeal any move to expel her to the US; legal procedures are likely to drag on for several months at least.If she is tried in the US and found guilty, she faces a jail sentence of as many as 30 years.Q: Why has the case attracted so much global attention?Huawei is a flashpoint in what is arguably the biggest current threat to the global economy - a looming trade war between the US and China. The US unsealed fraud and corporate espionage indictments against Meng and Huawei on Monday, just as a top Chinese official arrived in Washington for talks to try to defuse the trade crisis.US officials say that Huawei has close ties to the Chinese government and cannot be trusted to build securely the next set of wireless networks - fifth generation, or 5G - in the US or anywhere else. Washington has led a drive to dissuade allied nations from incorporating Huawei equipment in their 5G networks.China believes the US is trying to block Beijing's emergence as a top-flight technological power out of fear of competition. It sees Washington's campaign against Huawei as a political ploy with protectionist purposes, and the case against Meng as a leverage tool in trade talks.President Trump fed that impression when he said in December that he might intervene with the Justice Department in Meng's case if that would help close a trade agreement with China or serve US national security interests.China is going head-to-head with the US over Meng. "Beijing's reaction will shape the world's understanding of China's national strength and will," according to a Jan. 23 editorial in the Global Times, a Chinese Communist Party-owned daily in Beijing.Q: What is Huawei known for?Huawei makes reasonably priced, advanced wireless network equipment, mobile phones, and laptops, which it sells all over the world. The company is China's international flagship, a shining symbol of its global reach and technological prowess.Huawei was founded in 1987 by Ren Zhengfei, a former engineer in the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Mr. Ren's background is one reason that some Western governments suspect that Huawei takes orders from the Chinese government. (Indeed, all Chinese companies take orders from their government if push comes to shove.)This has sparked fears that Huawei might build hard-to-detect "back doors" into its equipment, giving Chinese intelligence services unparalleled access to - and possibly control over - all manner of devices worldwide that depend on wireless communications.Huawei has repeatedly denied such suggestions, insisting that it is a private, employee-owned company that has never done anything underhanded.But experts, including the European Union's technology chief and the head of Britain's counter-espionage agency, have recently voiced doubts about Huawei's trustworthiness. FBI Director Christopher Wray warned on Monday that "we should all be concerned by the potential for any company beholden to a foreign government - especially one that doesn't share our values - to burrow into the American telecommunications market."Q: How has China reacted to Meng's arrest and the US indictments?It's showed extreme anger and threatened "grave consequences" for Canada and the US if Meng is extradited.As Canadian Justice officials consider the US extradition demand, they are under heavy pressure. Within days of Meng's arrest, Chinese police had arrested three Canadian citizens. Two of them are still being held incommunicado in unknown locations.Another Canadian, who had been sentenced in November to 15 years for drug smuggling, was hastily retried and sentenced to death this month.The Chinese Foreign Ministry responded to the Huawei indictments by accusing Washington of trying to "kill" Chinese businesses. Hu Xijin, editor in chief of the Global Times, tweeted, "The US indictment ... is like putting legal lipstick to a pig of political suppression."Q: What is 5G?The shift to 5G wireless networks is a once-in-a-decade upgrade that will make everything work much faster (think downloading a film in a few seconds) and make the "internet of things" a reality of daily life. Operators will be rolling out 5G in the US this year.5G will be used to control and monitor everything from games on smartphones and the contents of consumers' refrigerators to nuclear power stations and other critical national infrastructure. It will be deeply embedded in society. That is why some regulators are worried about Huawei building such networks.The US and Japan have banned Huawei from supplying government-owned wireless networks; Australia and New Zealand have forbidden their mobile operators to use Huawei gear in their 5G networks, citing national security; BT, the largest mobile operator in Britain, will not invite Huawei to bid on its core 5G equipment; and Vodafone announced last week it would "pause" purchases of Huawei's core 5G kit.Polish police arrested a Chinese Huawei employee on espionage charges, and the Polish government has called on the EU and NATO to reconsider their members' reliance on Huawei technology.There is little Huawei can do to overcome Western misgivings. Governments' mistrust and fear is prompted more by the nature of China's authoritarian and opaque government than by the firm itself.But as Beijing girds itself for battle on behalf of its national champion, the stakes could not be higher. Can China carve itself an influential place in the world on its own terms?

We're taking a look at the big business of gaming once again this morning.All those stories coming up this Friday morning and joining me to break it all down -- Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Cheddar founder and CEO Jon Steinberg, and the president of Maslansky and Partners Lee Carter. Great to see you this morning.LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY AND PARTNERS: Great to be here.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us.Jon -- thank you for being here.JON STEINBERG, FOUNDER & CEO, CHEDDAR INC: Good to be here.BARTIROMO: Yes. Cheddar -- what are you covering this morning?STEINBERG: Oh, I mean we're covering all the big changes going on in technology, media and innovation. I'm sure this morning we'll be talking a lot about Richard Plepler stepping down from HBO. Big surprise, only a day or two after the investigation into the AT&T merger which basically, you know, called off and now the company's one company and the heads have rolled already.BARTIROMO: I know you've talked a lot about China. We've had the China discussion over and over again. So we want to get right to that.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, get right to it. I want to hear your next guest.BARTIROMO: We're covering China and the technology threat. Huawei Technologies recently at the center of intense international scrutiny as several countries begin sounding the alarm on the potential threat to national security.Now the company is fighting to repair its image, taking out a full page print advertisement in yesterday's "Wall Street Journal", titled this, "Don't believe everything you hear, come and see us -- urging American journalists to visit the company's campuses.And joining me right now is the chief security officer of Huawei Technologies, Andy Purdy. Andy -- it's good to have you on the program this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.ANDY PURDY, CHIEF SECURITY OFFICER, HUAWEI TECHNOLOGIES: You're welcome. Good to be here.BARTIROMO: Well, we have a lot to talk about but let's kick it off with your ad that you took out in the "Journal" right here. "Don't believe everything you hear." What are you trying to do with this ad, tell us what your mission is at Huawei as you begin this P.R. campaign.PURDY: Well, for one, Maria -- we would love to invite you and your team to come to Huawei to see what's there and what we do and get to know us.So it's part of trying to open up the dialogue because that's what's fundamentally important, the dialogue about how to address real cyber security risk. And we believe there are proven mechanisms to do it so that companies and governments can take advantage of the most innovative technologies in the world.So we're trying to facilitate that conversation which has sometimes been a little difficult to focus on the facts.BARTIROMO: Well, I want to focus on the facts this morning because you're talking about how to deal with cyber intrusions and people look at Huawei as one of the big perpetrators of cyber intrusions. Are you saying that Huawei Technologies has not stolen trade secrets from other companies in the west?PURDY: What I'm saying is that the pressure on Huawei is part of the geopolitical dynamic between the U.S. and China. It's also part of the fact that the U.S. government is trying to seriously address the risk to the United States globally with rising power of China economically and militarily and trying to do a whole lot more, led by the Department of Homeland Security to protect our critical infrastructure and work to protect our allies.So the communications sector is an important part of it. We have been trusted for the last 30 years in 170 countries. There have been no major cyber security incidents involving Huawei in the world.But we're not saying that because of that record, there should not be strict scrutiny of the kinds of products and technologies that we sell. Now, in fact, we're saying that there needs to be a greater effort to address the risk from all technologies and all products. That's what's going to be necessary to help make us all safer so we can confidently use the new technologies.BARTIROMO: Well wait a second, you just said there have been no major issues around Huawei but in fact over the last year, years, several years, I can cite a list of companies that have sued you and you've done settlements with -- Motorola Solutions, T-Mobile, Cisco -- all of those companies sued Huawei for stealing trade secrets.PURDY: There have been no major cyber security incidents in the world involving Huawei. That industry and the fact that we've had some lawsuits in the past, has characterized the industry for the last 20 years. We have resolved those issues and we're moving forward. The remaining issues that we hope to resolve in next year or so.BARTIROMO: Andy -- it's not accurate to say that there were no issues around Huawei when you had lawsuits for stealing trade secrets. Huawei settled a lawsuit with Motorola Solutions for stealing trade secrets. You settled a lawsuit with Cisco for stealing router trade secrets.Are you saying that, yes, these issues and lawsuits went on in the past and we settled them and now we're not going to steal anymore? Is that what you're saying?PURDY: I'm saying two things. I'm saying that, but I'm also saying there have been no major cyber security incidents in the world in the 170 countries in which we do business. Our customers trust us around the world and we believe there are additional mechanisms that can be done so we can provide assurance and transparency so that we can help make America benefit from us being allowed to compete.BARTIROMO: Look, I understand that you are on this PR trip today and you have this whole page ad in the "Journal" and I agree that Huawei needs to convince the world that we can actually trust the products of the company.But to say there have been no issues with Huawei is just 100 percent inaccurate. I just listed the number of companies that have sued you for stealing trade secrets and the settlements that you've done.PURDY: Maria -- I did not disagree with the facts of those cases.BARTIROMO: Ok.PURDY: I did not disagree with those.BARTIROMO: Ok. Ok. Recently, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was in the studio. He had just come back from Europe and he talked about the threats because he was trying to do his own PR campaign throughout Europe, telling European countries if you have Huawei Telecom, you're going to get less information from the United States.Listen to this. Got to get your reaction to the Secretary of State of the United States.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Europe is pushing back on this idea that President Trump and your administration wants to ban or potentially stop, slow down the use of Huawei Technologies. Is that what you found in Europe?MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: We've been out around the world, just making sure everybody had the same information, that countries understand the risk of putting this Huawei Technology into their IT systems. We can't forget these systems were designed by -- with the express work alongside the Chinese PLA. their military in China.They are creating a real risk for these countries and their systems, the security of their people. If a country adopts this and puts it in some of their critical information systems we won't be able to share information with them, we won't be able to work alongside them.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Your reaction?PURDY: Obviously the U.S. has been in a global campaign to try to stop companies and countries from using Huawei. I just got back from two weeks in Poland. I was there when Secretary Pompeo and Vice President Pence were there.The fact is, there are real risks in cyberspace. The fact is that the benefits that are going to come from 5G are tremendous. But there are measures that need to be taken. There are standards that still need to be developed that need to address the risk that can exist from all products.There are at least five nations in the world that can virtually implant malicious functionality in products. We, as a nation, we and our allies need to do a better job of coming up with objective and transparent mechanisms to address those risks.We support addressing those risks and we look forward to working with the U.S. government and with the other governments we've been working with. The U.K., Germany and others believe there are ways despite what the warnings from the U.S. and they're among our closest allies. They believe the risk can in fact be addressed. And I think the major carriers in the world know that.BARTIROMO: Yes. A lot of the carriers in the world also know that they have been stolen from. I mean this is not just a government conversation. I had on the former CEO of Microsoft, Steve Ballmer, back in November. And we talked about the fact that 90 percent of the companies in China use the Microsoft operating system and a fraction of those actually pay for it.Listen to what he said about intellectual property protection, Andy.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: 90 percent of companies are using the Microsoft operating platform and only 1 percent are paying for it. How do we -- what are we going to do that China keeps stealing everything this way? I mean that's pretty extraordinary.STEVE BALLMER, FORMER CEO, MICROSOFT: I'm a free trader, by nature. I went to school, economics. It's the best thing for the world. This one's a tricky issue because it's absolutely clear that the rules don't apply in China and the U.S. government needs to do something, whether tariffs are right or wrong, I'm silent on that point. But without any pressure from the U.S. government.We're talking about $10 billion, plus, for example in Microsoft that would go into profit. As a shareholder, that's the easiest thing for me to now see as an outsider. We just haven't seen the rise in profits that would be commensurate with real intellectual property protection in China.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: So Andy, there you heard Steve Ballmer put a number on it. The theft has cost Microsoft $10 billion a year in profit.PURDY: Let me mention two things. First, you mentioned the carriers. The major global carriers in the world trust Huawei and they have said that within the last week or twoSecondly, on the theft of intellectual property by the China government, that's not us. The China government does not speak for us. We don't speak through the China government.I applaud the efforts of the United States and other to try to crack down on the global theft in intellectual property which has been a disgrace over the last 15 years that we haven't done enough about it. So I'm glad to see President Trump is raising that as an important issue in the trade talks.BARTIROMO: Huawei Technologies is a Chinese company. This is a communist country. Of course the companies are state actors as an arm of the government in a communist nation. Isn't that true?PURDY: No, that's not. We are a privately owned company. There are a number of companies out there that have government ownership. We are not one of them. And the fact is, that major nation states sophisticated and well-armed with cyber tools have the ability to hack into the global supply chain of everybody. We have vulnerable networks and systems.The China government doesn't need to hack into Huawei's products to be able to conduct the spying that they want to do around the world just as they did when they hacked into the Office of Personnel Management a few years ago. And still all very personal records.BARTIROMO: All right. Let's not forget Marriott. But let me ask you this -- Andy. Do you have a member of the communist government on your board?PURDY: I don't know. I assume since there are so many members of the communist party, I have to assume that some of the officials of our company are members of the communist party but they're not government officials.BARTIROMO: No, they are on your board. They are communist government officials because that's the rule in China. You have to have a communist government official on the board, isn't it?PURDY: I don't think so.BARTIROMO: But you do have government officials on your board or members of the communist party on your board?PURDY: I think we probably have members of the communist party. We don't have Chinese government officials on our board.BARTIROMO: Let me say it. I mean I know that Huawei Technologies is very successful throughout the world, Andy. And I know that the company has been going into several countries in Africa, several countries in Europe. Over the years, this is a long-term thing and saying, look, we will develop your telecom system.How many systems do you believe that Huawei has developed throughout Africa and Europe?PURDY: Well, we've been involved in a lot. I can't give you a number. I mean the fact that we have such a tremendous growth around the world, the fact that the major carriers, despite incredible pressure from the U.S. Government continue to back us. That's an indication that we have demonstrated that we're worthy of trust to those major companies.BARTIROMO: And it's a lot cheaper than something in the west. That's one of the reasons why so many of these countries have signed on -- right?PURDY: The fact is, our products have gone from being inexpensive to being quality, to representing to major companies in the world that we can help them innovate, to be competitive going forward.The fact that we participate in markets that compete, you see our competitors dramatically lowering their prices. That brings down the profit margin and that benefits everybody who has the opportunity whether it's to end up buying Huawei products or just that Huawei is part of the competition.BARTIROMO: But there's no privacy. I mean you can buy the technology but at the same time if Huawei has created that telecom infrastructure, you can tap into anybody's private information, financial data, any information that's on that telecom infrastructure.PURDY: Well, the fact is that the carriers control the security. We are just providing, and as we talked about for 5G, we want to provide just the radio access part. We don't want to provide the core where all the sensitive information is.BARTIROMO: And Andy -- I know that the components of Huawei are in for example for facial recognition a whole host of video cameras components from Panasonic and others. How many video cameras would you say Huawei components are in right now across the world? What's the percentage.PURDY: I couldn't estimate. I'm sure it's a lot. But I don't have any idea of the percentage.BARTIROMO: It's a significant percentage isn't it?PURDY: I assume it is but I'm not sure.BARTIROMO: Andy -- we're going to be watching your public relations to try to convince the world that we can trust Huawei Technologies. We really appreciate you joining us this morning and answering the important questions -- Andy.PURDY: You're welcome.BARTIROMO: Andy Purdy joining us. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.We're looking at a market that is rallying this morning, up 175 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.So did he convince you? I just spoke with the chief security officer of Huawei Technologies. That's Andy Purdy and we've been covering this story now for upwards of a year and-a-half about China and about the national security threat.Jon, you were with us this morning from cheddar. I want to get your take on the conversation. You've also covered China.STEINBERG: Yes. Well, I mean did he? He convinced me that our of government and our company should definitely not have any of their equipment, you know. That's pretty much for sure.My favorite line in his interview with you was when you asked him, do you have communist elected officials on your board, he said no, we just have members of the communist party.Even if they're not deliberately hacking there's no way that we should have a quasi-government entity which is effectively what this company is, powering our4 cell towers and Internet equipment and the like.BARTIROMO: Yes. Dagen, what did you think? Because I think he tried hard to get the world to trust Huawei Technologies. The fact is, as we've seen a list of companies that have sued Huawei for trade secret theft. We've had them in the studio, Microsoft, Motorola Solutions, T-Mobile, to talk about that.MCDOWELL: I think that you crushed it. I think that -- to be quite frank, I think that it was -- your interview was stunning and your depth of knowledge. Because I know how much you work. I know how much of what's really going on with Huawei you understand and I think that that was on full display in that interview.I think that we need to take it, just rerun it -- seriously. He did not convince anybody that Huawei Technologies is safe for consumption, so to speak.CARTER: I frankly, as someone who advises people in crisis communication and others how to communicate, he didn't do anything to reassure us. I mean his big argument was well, you know, Chinese government can do it without our technology so look at what happened.BARTIROMO: Right.CARTER: You know it's like -- how does that make anybody --BARTIROMO: Let's not forget how Huawei Technologies started, ok. Huawei Technologies is a combination of assets from Nortel Networks, a Canadian company.I want to get your take on what he said when I asked him about the list of companies that have sued him. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Are you saying that Huawei Technologies has not stolen trade secrets from other companies in the west?PURDY: What I'm saying is that the pressure on Huawei is part of the geopolitical dynamic between the U.S. and China. It's also part of the fact that the U.S. government is trying to seriously address the risk to the United States globally with rising power of China economically and militarily and trying to do a whole lot more led by the department of Homeland Security to protect ou8r critical infrastructure and work to protect our allies.So the communications sector is an important part of it. We have been trusted for the last 30 years in 170 countries. There have been no major cyber security incidents involving Huawei in the world.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Which we know is not true.(CROSSTALKING)BARTIROMO: I just listed a whole host of companies that have sued them.STEINBERG: He thinks the bar is lower than it is. A lot of companies don't want to use competitive company's technology, much less another nation.BARTIROMO: All right. Let's slip in a quick break and we have more to tell you about YouTube. That's here.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Eye on the economy, the first look at the fourth quarter GDP yesterday showed that the economy grew 2.6 percent in the fourth quarter, that was better than the 2.3 percent estimated for the GDP report.Joining us right now is the former CBO director, former McCain economic adviser and American Action Forum president, Douglas Holtz Eakin. And Doug, you are the man of the moment. Thank you so much for joining us this morning.DOUGLAS HOTZ-EAKIN, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN ACTION FORUM: My pleasure. Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: Yes. And I say you're the man of the moment because of your report about how much the green deal is going to cost. We're going to get to the $90 plus trillion price tag in a second.But first, let's talk about growth for the economy. Your reaction to what we saw yesterday. Now, we're looking at an economy for 2018 growing 2.9 percent. Of course, we'll get revisions on that number.HOLTZ-EAKIN: Sure. Look, I'm really pleased with the report yesterday. If you look at growth as fourth quarter over fourth quarter, take out any seasonal effects, we've seen growth really ramp up steadily -- 2016, 2017, 2018. it's now 3.1 percent at four over four. That's very strong.Inside that top line, I think is something that people are missing. The household sector's been incredibly solid. It's grown between 2.7 percent and 3 percent every year for four straight years. And so we've got a lot of momentum going into 2019.Business investment faltered a bit in the third quarter, came back in the fourth. That's very promising, it's way above what a lot of people have forecast. I think if we get some, you know, just a little bit of solid housing growth, we've got another good year in front of us.BARTIROMO: All right. Let's get to the green deal cost because I know the panel wants to get in here too. Growing concerns about the soaring federal debt, the proposed Green New Deal would add to it big-time. The plan will cost an estimated $93 trillion according to your analysis, that you came out with this week.The President spoke about the proposal last night with Sean Hannity. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: $100 trillion and you couldn't do it for that. But it's not even the money, it's so ridiculous - - no planes, let's not fly anymore. It is crazy.But personally, they should go with it. I love it. It's one of the greatest plans I've ever seen, as long as they're the ones that have to sell it, not me.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: So Doug, tell us how the American Action Forum, your group came up with this. How did you arrive at $94 trillion?HOLTZ-EAKIN: Well, we took the proposal seriously as we do with all proposals that come out. It's a 14-page list of specific projects that they would envision undertaking. Really comes into two groupings. There's the green part of it which is an all renewables electricity grid -- about $5.4 trillion to get that done.There's the high speed rail and other ways to have a zero net emissions system for transportation. And then there's a retrofitting of every building for high energy standards. That's a lot of money. That's the green part.There's also in there a huge amount of economics. There's a universal healthcare program, there's a guaranteed jobs program that could cost up to $44 trillion. There's guaranteed food for individuals. So there's a lot of going on in this that's not really just about a clean energy supply system.MCDOWELL: And Doug -- it's Dagen McDowell. I want to get your reaction --HOLTZ-EAKIN: Hey -- Dagen.MCDOWELL: -- to Jay Powell, the chief of the federal reserve was asked about this this week on Capitol Hill, this notion that the national debt budget deficits won't be an issue and the Federal Reserve can essentially help fund these projects, keeping interest rates low, even maybe monetizing the debt.We can just keep issuing debt and maybe the Federal Reserve can blow their balance sheet out again by buying it up, all to fund the Green New Deal and the pie in the sky projects. He basically threw cold water on it, Jay Powell did.What do you say to these notions that we're getting from the left in the likes of AOC?HOLTZ-EAKIN: You're getting this thing they call modern monetary theory which I don't really think makes a lot of sense. But the idea is that somehow the Federal Reserve can just continually buy the debt, monetize everything, you'll face no real risk of inflation which is a bit perplexing and as a result you don't really have to pay for any of these programs.The problem is when you get down to the basics of economics, someone can either work in the dry cleaner or they can be in the high speed rail, but they can't be both.And so if you keep adding projects on you eventually you strain the resources of our booming economy and you start to suffer the consequences.There's no financing mechanisms that can disguise that. So what our estimates say is the is an enormous amount of economic resources that would be devoted to these efforts.They're going to have to come from somewhere. Do you really want to do that.STEINBERG: Doug -- Jon Steinberg. Looking at the headline numbers for GDP growth. I just want to ask you a question about that. We saw a bunch -- in your comment about business investment being a little bit light. We've seen a number of companies issue weak Q1 guidance on the idea that there were weak sales, Voxx (ph) drop off; a host of other enterprise software companies.Is that a little bit of an overhang? Is Q2 going to be even stronger now with the shutdown behind us and people back buying products and services?HOLTZ-EAKIN: I think we saw some real diminishment in confidence in the economy, the second half of 2018, particularly in the C-Suite. You look at CFO surveys, CEO surveys, there's a big drop-off in planned CapEx and confidence in the economy. We know the shutdown had a big hit on the consumer confidence. We've seen both of those rebounds.So, if there's going to be softness, it will be in Q1, some of the monthly data has been troubling, to be honest. I mean, you look at the orders for capital goods. They're not what I would have hoped. But I think people missed the fact that the underlying strength in the household sector, 70 percent of the economy, means that there's going to be good sales out there somewhere.And as long as the jobs keep growing, we see wages go up, there's no reason to worry about that household sector. It's a foundation on which we can build the rest.MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: How likely are these programs to materialize, Doug, knowing the cost that you've just gone through in terms of the Green Deal? Do you think we'll still see this continue to get more momentum?HOLTZ-EAKIN: So here's how I think about it, Maria. People want a clean environment. People want people to have health insurance. They want people to have a job. These are -- these are good intentions, and those intentions will not go away. The question is, do you want these programs?And the point of trying to put some dollar costs on them, is to try to help answer that question, is this the best way to get to those perfectly sensible societal goals? I think it'll be hard to make the sale for these particular programs. They are very, very top-down government regulatory, you know, intrusive programs. They have big changes envisioned for the institutions in this country.Every one of those guaranteed jobs would be a union job and it's hard for me to imagine that that will gain a lot of momentum in the years to come.BARTIROMO: All right, Doug, it's great to have you on the program. Thanks so much, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, joining us there.HOLTZ-EAKIN: Thank you.BARTIROMO: American action form, we'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Friday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Friday, March 1st, your top stories right now, 7:35 a.m. on the East Coast.Trade tensions between the U.S. and China continue a key issue in the negotiations I.P. theft and the threat of Huawei telecom. Here's Huawei technologies chief security officer, Andy Purdy, with me earlier this hour, about the pressure the company says it's facing.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ANDY PURDY, CHIEF SECURITY OFFICER, HUAWEI: The pressure on Huawei is part of a geopolitical dynamic between the U.S. and China.It's also part of the fact that the U.S. government is trying to seriously address the risk to the United States, globally, with the rising power of China, economically and militarily, and trying to do a whole lot more led by the Department of Homeland Security, to protect our critical infrastructure and work to protect our allies.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: The fallout coming up, this morning. Meanwhile, markets kicking off the new month with gains this morning, Futures indicate a gain of almost 200 points, right out of the gate, three quarters of a percent higher on the Dow, two-thirds of a percent higher on the S&P, with the S&P up 17 points and the NASDAQ up 52, three quarters of one percent, these after modest declines yesterday.Take a look at the market yesterday when the Dow lost 69 points, the S&P was down 7, and the NASDAQ was down 22. It has been a strong start to the year, however, all of the major indices up, at least 11 percent year-to- date in 2019.Global markets this morning, in Europe, are also firmer, FT-100 up 39 points, the CAC Quarante in Paris is up 36 points, and the DAX Index up 145 points, one and a quarter percent.In Asia overnight, gains across the board there, as well. And take a look at the best performer, China, Shanghai composite up 1.8 percent.Protecting children on YouTube, the website taking action this morning, after facing backlash over comments, we'll tell you about a major change happening at YouTube, owned by Alphabet.Buying the rumor, Southwest shares flying high, this morning, on speculation that it could get acquired by none other than Warren Buffett, more on that, plus the airline suing a Mechanics' Union.Plus, the new season of Fortnite is out. It is looking to take on Apex Legends. We're taking a look at the big business of gaming this morning.All those stories coming up, but first, we kick off this half hour with this top story, the Democratic field for 2020, getting more crowded. The Washington governor, Jay Inslee, just announced his bid for the White House.This, as Hillary Clinton said she will not run for a third time. Appearing on a podcast, the former secretary of state said she can't imagine running for the White House in 2020. But she said she's going to keep speaking out about President Trump.Joining us right now is the Washington Times Opinion Editor and Columnist, FOX News Contributor, Charlie Hurt. Charlie, it's good to see you this morning.CHARLIE HURT, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning, Maria.BARTIROMO: Assess the line-up for us for 2020. How do you see things playing out the next year and-a-half?HURT: I tell you, this is a -- this is a rough start to the campaign, to say the least, to have these -- you've got these all this in-fighting between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton, which is -- you know, I don't see how that's possibly helpful for Democrats.And then, you have other situations like the show hearings with Michael Cohen on Capitol Hill. I have no problem with show hearings. That's what politics is all about. But you have that. And it was clearly designed to be juxtaposed against the President's efforts in -- to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula. I don't think that's a good look.And then, you have a situation with domestic policy, like AOC, peddling her green dream, and then you have the old guard, like Nancy Pelosi, poo-pooing it and having to answer, of course, for it because AOC is the most exciting thing they've got going right now.It's -- I don't -- and the party, of course, is not going to -- I don't think they're going to settle this time on a sort of conservative -- and by conservative, I mean, you know, not -- you know, not crazy left wing.BARTIROMO: Yes.HURT: They're not going to go with a moderate for the general. I think they're going to push as far left as they can. It's shaping up to be a pretty good -- a pretty good field for the current president.LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS: So Charles, I think it's really fascinating to watch now. Because back in 2015, Republicans had a very similar set-up where it seemed like everybody was jumping in the race with 17 candidates. I think the Democrats are going to have north of that.And as you say, it's going to force -- I think, probably a far left candidate to rise up because it's going to have a lot of people fighting for the same territory. Who do you worry about the most, though? When I look at this field of candidates, there's not a lot that make me sweat. But are there any that you are sitting there, going, that could be a problem for Republicans.HURT: It's funny, actually, that you ask that question, because probably the person that I think is most concerning would be somebody like Amy Klobuchar, not because she's particularly moderate, she's not. And that's what's kind of terrifying about the situation.That people like Amy Klobuchar, she's a fairly left-leaning politician and if she gets -- but she's getting all of this free press now, as being this moderate because of all the crazies that are running in the field right now.And if she comes out of this, somehow gets the nomination, I don't think she does, but if she comes out of this and somehow gets the nomination, she will be -- she has gotten all of this free press as a moderate, which again, she's not, and then, she can sort of --She would do a good job of going after those blue collar workers that have traditionally been Democrat, that voted for Barack Obama, for example, and then fled the Democratic Party in 2016 and went with Donald Trump.STEINBERG: Charlie, question for you. Howard Schultz, which is, sort of, an interesting topic to me, I can't get over. The Democrats picked somebody out of the field, you know, probably doesn't matter who, Schultz runs, and that basically pulls votes from the Democrats, and then Trump wins. I mean, isn't that the most likely outcome?HURT: I think, absolutely. I think any of the third party candidates right now, if they were to try to run like Schultz, I think that it would definitely damage the Democrats a lot more than Republicans.You know, President Trump, right now, within the party, within the Republican Party, within the people that voted for him the first time, you've never seen these numbers of the popularity that he enjoys among the Republican base and those -- and even the people that he stole.And I talk to people every now and then who have -- you know, that seemed to have--- you know, they voted for Hillary, but are pleasantly surprised by how he's run the government.BARTIROMO: Yes, all right, Charlie, great to have you on the program.HURT: Great to be with you.BARTIROMO: The problem, Dagen, is that you can't have a moderate get past the Democrats because they've lurched so left. I don't think there is a moderate that can actually be their candidate. You mentioned Howard Schultz. That's it.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: And who -- and if -- somebody who is very left-leaning, who is in the far left, if they get the nomination, then when they're standing on the stage, debating President Trump, they're going to get pushed on the fact that they endorsed a Medicare-for-all plan that not only eliminates but it outlaws all private insurance in this country, and it also does away with Medicare, and we'll see how older voters react to that.BARTIROMO: Do you think they understand that so many people right now get their insurance from private healthcare? A hundred and sixty million people.MCDOWELL: A hundred -- it is more than 150 million people are going to lose their health insurance through their employer. It is outlawed by these -- by these plans. It's astonishing.BARTIROMO: Quick break. And then a major change by YouTube, we'll tell you what the company is doing now to keep children safe. And then Southwest is suing its Mechanics' Union. The stock is high this morning, on speculation that it could get acquired by Warren Buffett, full story after this.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, a major change to YouTube, Lauren Simonetti with details on the site, turning off comments, Lauren.LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, Maria. So YouTube is disabling all comments on videos that feature minors. This is all in response to reports of a growing number of predatory and obscene comments on videos with children in them.Some exceptions will be made for older kids and teenagers and because millions of hours of footage are uploaded daily, there are also reports that YouTube will use algorithms to help them out. Many companies have already stopped running ads on YouTube because of this controversy. You're looking at Google shares -- Alphabet shares, rather.Southwest, filing a lawsuit against its Mechanics' Union, accusing the workers of reporting minor maintenance issues in an effort to take planes out of service and gain an advantage in contract negotiations. The union leaders have said the mechanics are calling out for legitimate safety concerns.Let's take a look at shares of Southwest, up 1.7 percent in the premarket, after gaining more than four percent yesterday. The stock jumped yesterday, after unconfirmed reports on social media that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway plans to acquire the carrier. Maria?BARTIROMO: Big news there. All right, Lauren, thank you. Coming up, Fortnite Season 8 is out, the juggernaut facing off against Apex Legends, the big business of gaming, right after this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: So, how cool was that? No wonder it's so popular. That was footage from the brand new 8th season of the hit videogame, Fortnite, the new season bringing ninjas and p pirates into the game's world, a feature that was synonymous with Apex Legends, one of Fornite's biggest competitors.Joining us right now is Gamer World News Founder and CEO, Gayle Dickie. Gayle, it's good to have you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us. I guess first, characterize --GAYLE DICKIE, FOUNDER AND CEO, GAMER WORLD NEWS: Thanks, Maria, great to be here.BARTIROMO: Characterize for us the incredible success. I mean, Fortnite and Apex Legends, gaming in general, and then about how Fortnite is responding to Apex Legends.DICKIE: Well, Fortnite is just -- has been this global phenomenon for the past year and I think that you have to keep in mind that Apex Legends coming into the game, you know, this year, it's riding the coat tails of Fortnite.You've got $2.4 billion war chest from epic games. And I think they can pretty much ward off anything Apex throws their way. For example, what's happened now is there's this ping system in Apex Legends, and lo and behold, it's appeared in Fortnite.So, they can just about make any improvement or on any modes that Apex throws their way. There's also a new Weezer jukebox coming to Fortnite. And so, I think it's good for the business. It's competitive. It's Battle Royale to the max. Look for more Battle Royales coming out this year.I mean, I think they're a lot of fun. I've played both. They're completely different games, though. It's really not fair to compare them. I know the media likes to do that, but one's very pop culture cartoony, and the other one's very gritty and, you know, last man standing, you know, shoot them up.STEINBERG: Fortnite is not a game, OK. So, light speed -- light speed, which was my lead investor, which actually just put some money into epic games, right? The thesis is, that this could be bigger than a game, it could be a social network that Fortnite could be the next Facebook.And the reason for that is they just had a concert, in Fortnite, by Marshmello, you know the guy with the marshmallow hat -- says you could be happier -- he sings the happier song?BARTIROMO: Yes, yes.MCDOWELL: It was during the Super Bowl was it?STEINBERG: Millions of people danced and watched the Marshmello concert inside of Fortnite. That's the opportunity. That's what makes Fortnite special.BARTIROMO: What do you think about that, Gayle?DICKIE: Well, I think, you know what, I'll see that and I'll raise you a dating app inside Fortnite. How's that?STEINBERG: Amazing.DICKIE: It could -- it could very well happen.CARTER: It could be anything. I just think it's amazing, the generational appeal. We were just talking about whether it's our kids or husbands or, you know, all the way up into the 60s, people are playing this. And the pace at which it's adapting and changing, you know, it's fascinating.Do you think that this is going to be a trend for others that are now going to have to keep up with something that just evolves like this, or is this going to be a, you know, standalone thing?DICKIE: No, I do not think it's stand-alone. I mean, look for other Battle Royales to come out this year. I was researching yesterday just what was ahead of us. And there's a new game coming out with a thousand player drop-in.There's a play -- a new Battle Royale within E.A.'s treasure chest for Battlefield 5 called Firestorm. There's another one called Not My Car, and then there's my personal favorite, I thought it was just a funny title called Not Another Royale, so it's called NAR.So, the Battle Royale modes are just so popular, and I think it's here to stay. Look to Fortnite to just continue to be number one and lead the pack. But, certainly Apex offers a different experience and I think it's good for the business.I think it's good for everybody and I always tell parents, play with your kids. I mean, whether they're 7 or 8 years old or 10 or 17, at least take a shot at playing. I mean, you probably won't last long in the game, but at least you'll have fun doing it.BARTIROMO: Incredible stuff, Gayle, really, what a business. Thanks so much for joining us.DICKIE: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Gayle Dickie --DICKIE: Thanks so much, Maria.BARTIROMO: -- joining us there from Gamer World News, the founder and CEO.President Trump just tweeted on his summit with North Korea. And here's what he just wrote, great to be back from Vietnam, an amazing place. We had very substantive negotiations with Kim Jong-un. We know what they want and they know what we must have. Relationship, very good, let's see what happens, the President writes this morning, after his trip from Vietnam.STEINBERG: That's very diplomatic.BARTIROMO: Yes.CARTER: It is very diplomatic.MCDOWELL: But that was the tone coming out of that meeting. And I think that despite there has been some back and forth between North Korea and the U.S., about what North Korea really wanted, it was -- certainly, they wanted enough that we weren't willing to waive the vast sanctions that they demanded, so --BARTIROMO: He was spot-on yesterday. You were spot-on in terms of the way you read it. That it wasn't a disappointment. It was actually a success.Quick break, and then House Minority Whip Steve Scalise on the U.S.-China relations, right here.Load-Date: March 1, 2019End of Document

The Huawei indictment marks the end of US and China's cycle of trustBusiness Insider USJanuary 31, 2019 Thursday 04:39 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 2670 wordsByline: llopez@businessinsider.com,  (Linette Lopez)Highlight: The US Justice Department's criminal indictment of Huawei marks a new phase in the cycle of trust between the US and China.BodyReuters/Paul Yeung• The US Justice Department's criminal indictment of Huawei marks a new phase in the cycle of trust between the US and China.• It is one in which aggression is more out in the open, and that aggression will directly influence perception and policy in both countries.• What's more, China is no longer opening. It's closing. And President Xi Jinping stands to make the country more totalitarian as time goes on.And just like that, with its indictment of the Chinese phone maker Huawei, the US entered a new, chilling phase in its cycle of trust with China. There is no knowing where the cycle will take us next, but what is for certain is that there is no going back.Huawei stands accused of stealing trade secrets from US partner, German telecom firm T-Mobile. The company encouraged employees to lie and steal until they secured the design of a phone-inspecting robot named Tappy. When the Huawei employees were discovered, the company feigned concern, writing a falsehood-filled memo - complete with redactions - to cover its tracks. Huawei even offered its employees bonuses for stolen technology.None of this subterfuge was particularly elegant, and it didn't go unpunished. In 2017, T-Mobile won a civil suit against Huawei and was awarded a $           500 million fine for this very behavior.So this information is not new. Everyone knows what happened to Tappy. What's new is the US Justice Department's willingness to bring criminal charges against one of China's national champions - a symbol of the success of its economic development and victory over the humiliation of a lost century.In this way, Tappy - though hardly the pinnacle of Western robotics - has ushered in a new era in global relations.The relationship between the US and China has worn out its phase of polite negotiation and plausible deniability. Beijing can no longer pretend it isn't engaged in state-sanctioned technology theft, and American companies can no longer pretend to be ignorant of that theft. Now that bad actors and actions are out in the open, repercussions are carried out in the open.None of what is happening in this new phase would have happened in the old phase: The US seeking extradition of a well-connected Chinese executive; the US State Department            warning Americans not to go to China if they ever want to come home;            Chinese billionaires who thought they had friends in Washington realizing those friends have turned against them;            Americans billionaires with friends in Beijing being forced to admit that things have gone awry in the country both economically            and politically. There is a trade war with little hope for a            lasting resolution. The planet, it seems, is being split in two.Trust and cooperation between people - posited Martin Nowak, a mathematical biologist at Harvard University - is cyclical. Decisions have consequences, and those decisions impact people's perceptions. That perception, in turn, impacts people's decisions. It's a conversation.And in an address at the Bloomberg New Economy Forum in Singapore last year Hank Paulson, former US Treasury Secretary and founder of US-China think tank The Paulson Institute, said the conversation between the US and China has turned sour."...at this point, after forty years, when we have had one kind of relationship but now, quite clearly, face the daunting task of transitioning to a new one - anchored in a realistic and more sustainable - strategic framework - divorce is a real risk."It is a risk not just because of where the US and China are in their cycle of trust, but also because of where China is in one of its own cycles - its cycle of opening to the world and closing again. Right now, it is closing.ReutersA cycle of opening and closingFor the past few decades, the history of China has been rather short, at least in the West.Here, the narrative of what China is has been crafted to encourage investment in the country, and so it begins in 1978, at the beginning of Deng Xiaoping's "reform and opening" of the Chinese economy.But that's a mistake, according to Anne Stevenson-Yang, co-founder and research director of J Capital Research Ltd., a China-based investment advisory firm, who headed up the US Information Technology Office in the 1990s."When China embarked on its current opening phase in 1970s and mainly in the 1990s, a lot of international corporations and countries believed that China was in the process of liberalizing, and that the liberalization was open ended, and that China ultimately would become some kind of Jeffersonian democracy and a capitalist country," she said in a recent interview with Bloomberg Radio."That is not at all the case. China goes through these cycles of opening and closing again. It opens when the country needs cash and that's what happened through the 1990s and the 2000s to date... now the cost is getting higher than the benefit and so you'll see China closing again."The cost Stevenson-Yang is talking about is more about control than money. To truly open its economy, China would have to take its hands off the wheel and allow the market to dictate winners and losers. It would have to allow foreign companies - or even its own private companies - to compete freely without joint ventures with Chinese state owned companies. These are among the thorniest demands the Trump administration is making in trade talks with China. They are the demands that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross says the two countries are "miles and miles away" on.To China, the demand to resolve these issues has come unexpectedly. China has been opening up its economy at a snail's pace since it joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. For example, American companies like Visa, Mastercard and American Express have had major trouble entering China's growing payments market. Only American Express has won regulatory approval to begin clearing transactions, and that just happened in November.As for the US's demand that China stop stealing technology by force or trickery - Hong Kong property tycoon Ronnie Chan, an American citizen who sits on the Council of Foreign Relations and counts Henry Kissinger among his friends, told the South China Morning Post: "People said China has been stealing technology. Well first of all, everybody steals technology. And number two, three years ago, I had a discussion with [former CIA director] general David Petraeus and [former US secretary of state] Condoleezza Rice on this subject of stealing technology from one another. Is that something that happened in the last one year? Did it get worse? It didn't get worse, so what changed your mind?"To China, the US is simply not behaving rationally. To the US, China is veering off a course it never necessarily charted.The kind of opening the Trump administration wants costs too much in the only currency China's leaders really care about - political control. If that were not the case, the convulsions we're seeing from China's economy right now might not be so worrisome. But they are.A credit cycle, with Chinese characteristicsAll of China's economic indicators are flashing red. The eerily stable labor market is even showing signs of strain. In 2018, the country's stock market had its worst performance in a decade. The yuan is weakening against the US dollar, threatening to dip below an important psychological threshold of 7 to 1. Debt has spread from the Chinese corporate and financial sectors to            households, who've accumulated the same level of household debt to GDP as the US after just around a decade of having credit cards. Societe GeneraleThe problem isn't all about the level of debt either, as Dr. Keyu Jin, professor of economics at the London School of Economics explained during a discussion at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. The problem is how China's system allocates capital - it's that China's state-controlled system is throwing good credit after bad. "Today's challenge is, how do you get credit and resources from the financial sector into the real economy, and into the productive firms, into the highly innovative private sector with latent potential. That's China's problem. It's not necessarily the debt levels and slowing growth rate," he said.Autonomous ResearchLast year the government shut down China's shadow-banking system, an increasingly risky capital-allocation mechanism that provided credit to private companies and individuals. Shadow banking exploded after 2009 when the Chinese government went on an credit creation and infrastructure spending spree to avoid getting sucked into the global financial crisis.But when the shadow-banking system was stamped out, it took around 40% of China's new credit with it.Since the crackdown, big state-run banks have stuck to lending to big state-run companies with implicit/explicit government guarantees, leaving private enterprise and individuals out to dry. This has even China's most successful entrepreneurs wringing their hands, especially after an            op-ed suggesting the state should just take over the private sector went viral on the country's closely monitored internet.The government is feverishly trying to figure out how to get capital to the right places - through tax cuts, for example - but their efforts have yet to hit the real economy, if they ever do. Autonomous Research"To the extent that a pickup is occurring in lending to SMEs [small and mid-sized enterprises] - as the authorities have been encouraging for months - we suspect it is largely taking place via shorter-term loans that can be quickly reassessed if repayment issues emerge," Charlene Chu an analyst at Autonomous Research wrote in a recent note to clients.This is a moment when the world could help China out of an economic mess. But it won't.China needs credit and the world has it. But credit comes from the Latin word for trust, and trust is in short supply right now, especially since China is unwilling to do the things (outlined above) that would cede control of the economy to the market.Oxford Economics"Foreign banks in theory could fill the gap left by maxed out mid-sized and city/rural banks," Chu told Business Insider via email. "But in reality, many of them say they haven't figured out how to lend in China. That's why their books remain so small. I also don't know that the authorities want a truly independently operating part of the banking system - it would be a lot harder to lean on foreign banks to be aggressive with lending to whoever the state wants them to."A political cycle of perpetual struggleThis turn in China's domestic credit cycle is part of why, earlier this month, Chinese President Xi Jinping told his cadres to prepare for a "worst-case situation."Xi also outlined all the risks China is facing in the year ahead - "political, ideological, economic, technological, social and international threats, as well as those from within the party," according to the South China Morning Post.So, risks from everywhere. Enemies everywhere. This suits Xi's political reality just fine. His understanding of socialism and politics is one of perpetual struggle. This worldview was outlined in a recent speech by John Garnault, a former journalist and Australian government official who came to have rare access to China's Deep Red princelings - the Chinese Communist Party's ruling class - Xi and his (almost) peers. Garnault gave the speech for the Asian Strategic and Economic Seminar Series, and it was called "Engineers of the Soul: Ideology in Xi Jinping's China."Garnault argues Xi understands his party in the same way the USSR's Joseph Stalin did - as a vehicle to engage in a perpetual struggle against enemies internal and external, where politics serve as an end unto themselves. Xi is not an opener, he is a closer.Because of this, Garnault says, China will only become more totalitarian, not less. Xi's anti-corruption campaign will never end, much like Stalin's purges never did. As for the West, in this framework it exists only to serve as the Chinese Communist Party's ideological foil. From the speech: "The Western conspiracy to infiltrate, subvert and overthrow the People's Party is not contingent on what any particular Western country thinks or does. It is an equation, a mathematical identity: the CCP exists and therefore it is under attack. No amount of accommodation and reassurance can ever be enough - it can only ever be a tactic, a ruse. Without the conspiracy of Western liberalism the CCP loses its reason for existence. There would be no need to maintain a vanguard party. Mr Xi might as well let his party peacefully evolve." Totalitarianism is the only way to guard against this encroachment from the West, and that is why Xi - who eliminated term limits for himself - has worked harder than any of his recent predecessors to stamp out influence in China's physical and digital space.Garnault does not believe that's where this ends either:"The challenge for us is that Xi's project of total ideological control does not stop at China's borders. It is packaged to travel with Chinese students, tourists, migrants and especially money. It flows through the channels of the Chinese language internet, pushes into all the world's major media and cultural spaces and generally keeps pace with and even anticipates China's increasingly global interests." So when Chinese billionaires like Ronnie Chan muse as to why the US is suddenly unfriendly, it isn't just because of President Donald Trump and his cabinet of economist war dogs. It isn't just because the US is suddenly angry about things that have been going on for years either.It is because Xi is a kind of Chinese leader the world had not yet seen in this last 40-year cycle - one who naturally reorients the country toward a closed society. Lintao Zhang/Getty ImagesOn Wednesday, China's parliament fast-tracked a bill meant to protect foreign companies in the country. The body will vote on the bill in March. According to Chinese state media, it includes penalties for failure to report violations to relevant authorities.This should be good news, but we are experiencing a trust deficit, so members of  Trump's economic team are waiting to see how China says it will enforce these measure           s           .This isn't the only gesture to end the trade war China has made that has been met with skepticism. Officials also reportedly offered to buy enough US imports over the next six years to eliminate the trade deficit between the two countries. But, as analysts at Barclay's pointed out, sticking to that commitment would throw China's economy off-kilter. It isn't realistic.Important details like that - which only amplify the trust deficit between the two countries - will only spur more talk of "decoupling" in US circles. That conversation isn't about whether or not decoupling is valid, either.As Paulson mentioned in his speech, it's about whether or not decoupling will be "comprehensive" or "carefully calibrated." Too much and the world could end up split behind an "economic iron curtain," he said.None of this ends with the trade war, it transitions. In this new reality, it is more important than ever to recognize China's agency over its own destiny, independent of the West's ambitions. It's Xi's understanding - not ours - of where China is in its cycle of opening and closing that could mean the difference between peace and prosperity, and confrontation and calamity. NOW WATCH: Japanese lifestyle guru Marie Kondo explains how to organize your home once and never againSee Also:• When Tom Brady was 25 knew he had to make a change in his lifestyle to keep playing football.• A polar vortex is engulfing the US.

And it is Thursday, March 7th.Your top stories right now, just before 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.Chinese telecom giant Huawei making it official this morning. The company has filed a lawsuit against the United States, saying that Congress acted as judge, jury and executioner.Markets are on edge this morning, futures indicating a lower opening for the broader averages. Dow Industrials down about 90 points right now, one- third of 1 percent. This is the low of the morning right here. S&P 500 down 7.25, Nasdaq down 21 points this morning.That after another day of declines yesterday making it three in a row. The market was lower across the board. Dow Industrials down 133 points yesterday, at the close, half of a percent. S&P 500 was down 18.

And joining me to break it all down -- Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the "Wall Street Journal's" assistant editorial page editor James Freeman, and Fox News contributor Liz Peek. Great to see everybody this morning.LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning.I just really hope Hillary Clinton comes in the race. I just think that would be so much fun. Sorry.I really do.(CROSSTALKING)BARTIROMO: It would.PEEK: I mean everyone was shocked that she actually made this announcement to a very small, local newspaper I believe it was. And so I mean, it is funny though that she woke up the next day and said what have I done.BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, Maggie Haberman which Dagen was talking about yesterday tweeted out a conversation that she had with somebody someone close to Hillary.MCDOWELL: Right. And she -- Hillary of course, immediately pivoted to gender bias, saying how -- why aren't you asking John Kerry if he's not running. Well, because you ran against Trump and lost and you won't go away.You gave this speech in Alabama over the weekend, that you lived in the south for much of your adult life and you still can't sound like a southerner. And she was blaming the Voting Rights Act being chipped away at as one of the reasons that she lost.PEEK: She is also now blaming people in Minnesota or Michigan on race, basically, that they --JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, "WALL STREET JOURNAL": Wisconsin.PEEK: Wisconsin -- excuse me. That's right. I mean, really. Get over it Hillary, please. Do something else.MCDOWELL: Let me just point out something. 1994 crime bill, later which was -- she lobbied for, her husband signed into law. She later referred to essentially young black men in part who were in gangs as super predators.And then remember she asked -- she said that she wasn't going to drop out of the Democratic nomination process against Barack Obama in 2008 because she said remember, Kennedy got shot in June. Do you remember that?BARTIROMO: Oh, wow.MCDOWELL: And now she wonders why black Americans didn't come out in the same numbers for her that they did for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. So again, she still needs to -- there's a lot of like self-analysis that Hillary Clinton needs to do.FREEMAN: Maybe. But the Clinton Foundation needs to raise money and I think that's why --PEEK: That's why she keeps her oar in.(CROSSTALKING)FREEMAN: It's to raise money. And I think when you shut the door on future high office that's not --BARTIROMO: That's a good point. They did around the election, I don't know where that stands now. Let's talk about that actually coming up.Joining the conversation this morning is Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson joining us this morning, along with New York Congressman and House Ways and Means Committee member Tom Reed joining us. The congressman will be on the panel with New Jersey Congressman and Problem Solvers Caucus co-chair, Josh Gottheimer this morning.Florida Congressman and House Judiciary and Foreign Affairs Committee member Ted Deutch is here.We've got a big two hours coming up so don't miss a moment of it.And we kick it off here with this top story. China's telecom giant, Huawei is suing the United States. President Trump signed a law restricting American businesses from working with Huawei over national security and espionage concerns. One of Huawei's chairmen saying that the Congress acted as the judge, jury and executer. Coming up we're going to talk more about that.It comes amid the U.S.-China trade uncertainty. But President Trump has signaled progress in those negotiations.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: They're moving along well. We'll see what happens. They're either going to be a good deal or it's not going to be a deal. But I think they're moving along very nicely.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is the former White House press secretary under President Trump, America First Action senior adviser and the author of "The Briefing: Politics, the Press and the President", Sean Spicer is with us this morning.Sean -- good to see you. Thank you so much for joining us.SEAN SPICER, FORMER TRUMP WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: You bet. Good morning.BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean the President was one of the first to poke China in terms of pushing back on China and all of the issues that we speak about, not just the trade imbalance but really the IP theft, the forced transfer of technology. And now we're learning so much more about espionage and how they're spying on countries across the world -- Sean.SPICER: Yes, absolutely. I mean as you point out, for decades the President's been very clear about his concern of the trade imbalance and other issues with China and Japan.But in this particular issue, Huawei is kind of the embodiment of all of those concerns all at once. It poses a huge national security risk for the United States. And as we build out this 5G network in our country and throughout other places in the world, there is a deep concern about China's involvement. I mean it is a state-owned company.BARTIROMO: Right.SPICER: And it's kind of rich that Huawei is not only suing us but citing our constitution as a concern. If you think about it, we have an entire CFIUS process to talk about foreign ownership. And this isn't even a jump ball. It is controlled by the Chinese government.BARTIROMO: Right.SPICER: So the idea that we're taking a further step in protecting our national security and our key cyber infrastructure is crucial.They already have foreign problems, foreign ownership issues with U.S. companies doing business in China.BARTIROMO: Right.SPICER: The idea that they'd come here and basically be doing it through a back door technologically-speaking is something that the President's very right to be protecting.BARTIROMO: Yes. And it's one of the issues that I brought up last week in my exclusive interview with Huawei's chief security officer, Andy Purdy, last week. And I mentioned to him that he's got Communist Party members on his board of directors. And yet here's what he said about IP theft. Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ANDY PURDY, CHIEF SECURITY OFFICER, HUAWEI: On the theft of intellectual property by the China government, that's not us. The China government does not speak for us. We don't speak through the China government.I applaud the efforts of the United States and others to try to crack down on the global theft in intellectual property which has been a disgrace over the last 15 years that we haven't done enough about it.So I'm glad to see President Trump is raising that as an important issue in the trade talks.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Well, there you go. The follow-up there was how many people on your board are from the Communist Party. And there are several, actually - - Sean.SPICER: Right. But I actually look at IP theft as two things. One is sort of the manufactured goods, right. So if you think about everything from movies to knock-off watches and iPhones -- things where they're stealing our intellectual property and making products that present themselves as U.S.-made products.But then you have the intellectual property that Huawei really poses a deep threat on which is going into the networks and pulling out the guts of what a lot of our companies and networks that our things run on and the computing and being able to embed their information into our critical infrastructures.BARTIROMO: Right.SPICER: I think that's the big problem that Huawei poses. And I don't think that people understand that. Just owning some of their phones in itself, you've got to kind of be able to pull it back and wonder what's embedded in that phone. Are they able to send back encrypted data and messages and other key infrastructure type things back to their home network.BARTIROMO: Right. Which is why when the Secretary of State was in the studio just a couple of weeks ago he said if European countries are using Huawei telecom, James -- then the U.S. is going to have to pull back and not share all of the information that normally we would with our European friends.FREEMAN: Yes, that's right. I think that was a really key interview, just pointing out that there could be consequences to countries that don't cooperate with the U.S. on this.But Sean -- I'm wondering just as a political question, in terms of persuasion, do you think the President has a good political case here, whether it's to a domestic audience or to countries overseas, that he's trying to persuade not to use Huawei technology?SPICER: I think domestically, James -- it makes a ton of sense. I don't think that there's a ton of concern about standing up to China in any of these issues -- whether it's trade, IP theft, et cetera, tech transfer. The President's going to be hopefully rewarded in a bipartisan way because I think all Americans understand not just the national security threats that China poses but the sort of -- the other trade issues that we have with China. And so I think the President would have bipartisan accolades for standing up to them.I think my fear is more that China presents sort of this cheap option not to just domestic consumers with their phones but also to European folks who may not have the same capability to build the networks that we do.BARTIROMO: Yes.FREEMAN: Yes.SPICER: And that's where I think the problem is. They present this cheap immediate alternative that's really appealing to folks that would have long-term devastating consequences. And that's why I think the President's not just standing up for America but frankly standing up for the entire world right now.BARTIROMO: Yes. Because this is a major issues.We've got to switch gears and get your comment on this Democratic-control House Judiciary Committee meeting and how they issued the subpoenas to 81 individuals and entities as part of an investigation into President Trump - - Sean. You are one of the people receiving a subpoena. Tell us, have you received it?SPICER: Well, I'm not going to comment clearly on anything with respect to this investigation. I will say the Democrats started this whole thing off a while back talking about Russia and collusion. They had a House investigation, didn't prove anything; in fact came out and said there was no collusion.Then they put all their chips in the Senate basket. That came out, Senator Burr --BARTIROMO: Yes.SPICER: -- and even Senator Warner and said nothing.Now, they've moved on and even Chairman Nadler has said now they're going beyond that scope. And I think there's a point at which they're going to jump the shark and lose the support of the American people who realize this is purely a fishing expedition into a political opponent.They're now going after the President, his associates, his business dealings and his past interactions with individuals because simply they don't like him. They're literally on a fishing expedition. They had three shots at this --(CROSSTALKING)BARTIROMO: Right. They got their guy, now they're looking for the crime.SPICER: -- the House Committee, the Senate --MCDOWELL: I just want to correct something though.BARTIROMO: Right.MCDOWELL: They haven't been subpoenaed. Based on what we know they're request for documents, that's different. Maybe it takes -- maybe the judiciary committee takes that step. But I do not believe --(CROSSTALKING)BARTIROMO: If they don't -- right --MCDOWELL: But I don't believe they've been subpoenaed.BARTIROMO: If they don't willingly send the documents, then the documents will be subpoenaed as well.MCDOWELL: Just to clarify that and if I'm wrong, I'll correct it. But I don't believe it's gone that far yet.PEEK: Has there ever been a president subjected to this kind of scrutiny and investigation to your knowledge -- Sean?SPICER: Well, I think one of the things that's interesting, Liz -- is it's one thing to be subjected to scrutiny, right. If there's been a crime, if there's something to look into.PEEK: Exactly.SPICER: At this point what they're saying is we don't know so we're just going to look into all of these entities and all of these individuals and see what we come up with.I think that's vastly different in terms of approach because everyone keeps looking at past issues, where there is evidence of something and there was an investigation that followed it.In this case, I think the Democrats like I said have jumped the shark. They basically have said we've got to get him. So let's figure out all of the people and associations and corporations and associations around him. And if we dig far enough we'll probably find something.BARTIROMO: Right.SPICER: And so I think that's the big difference because it's not an investigation into wrongdoing. It's an investigation to find wrongdoing.BARTIROMO: Right. They have their guy. Now they want to find the crime. So they're going to go under every rock to try to do that.Meanwhile we know that there was wrongdoing done in the 2016 election. We know that there was FISA abuse. We know that a couple of people tried to put their finger on the scale and change an election and get the duly- elected president out but there's no mention of that.SPICER: Well there's also, look -- and I'm not trying to rehash old talking points here -- but there's also, if they want to talk about associations with Russia, we know of them. We know that the Clinton Foundation took money, we know that the former president received money, we know that John Podesta was -- you know -- so we know all of these things.And the fact of the matter is that they have just sort of turned a blind eye to all of those past wrongdoings that are known and we've spent no time investigating those actual issues of wrongdoing.BARTIROMO: Right, exactly. Sean -- thank you. We will see you soon.SPICER: You bet -- guys.BARTIROMO: Sean Spicer joining us there.Coming up, the home of the future -- one company is using 3D printers to build affordable homes. We will take a tour of that with HUD Secretary Ben Carson later this hour.

Thank you -- Lauren.Coming up automation transforming manufacturing -- the effect on jobs in America coming up next.Then, it is wine o'clock somewhere. Yes, wine o'clock. We've got the best time of the day to enjoy a glass of wine. Details on when you should unwind later this hour. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.The future of manufacturing -- Rockwell Automation helping companies across several industries make their production more efficient. A key issue for many companies now is uncertainty over the potential U.S./China trade deal.Joining us right now is Rockwell Automation CEO Blake Moret. Great to see you -- Blake. Thank you so much for being here.BLAKE MORET, CEO, ROCKWELL AUTOMATIN: Great -- Maria. Thank you for -- thanks for allowing me to be on your show.BARTIROMO: Yes. No, we're happy you're here. You know, this is such an important industry and the China story has been integral to really the growth of so many businesses.Let me start there in terms of the U.S.-China trade deal. Has the tariffs and the impact of it been an impact for your company?MORET: Well, the uncertainty is certainly not helping. But as we're providing customers from around the world being more productive, China's an important market for us.The U.S. is our largest market and our ability to help U.S. manufacturers do more with less and to create sustainable production processes is really important for us and that continues to be strong. The American economy, the American manufacturing economy remains strong.BARTIROMO: And automation is so important in the manufacturing economy. Where are you seeing growth right now in terms of sectors?MORET: So we provide automation and workforce development for a wide variety of industries within the U.S., particularly important and particularly strong growth areas are food and beverage, as U.S. manufacturers seek to expand their operations around the world.Life sciences, as people want to live longer and healthier and we've seen strong growth in the life sciences pharmaceutical industry.Certain heavy industries, so U.S. oil and gas and so on.BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, in the last quarter you talked a lot about paper and pulp being among those heavy industries that were among the drivers. Does that stand still?MORET: It does. Pulp and paper added a lot of capacity back in the late 80s and early 90s. And a lot of that equipment needs to be refreshed. And people are looking for new, modern technology. And so we're seeing quite a boost in that industry.BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean we're talking about the automation, industrial automation as far as a growth story for the U.S. What steps need to be taken to ensure that our workers can thrive in today's economy? Because a lot of people say, look, our people are not skilled enough.That's why the White House is going through this skills advisory board, that a number of CEOs are involved. I know you as well. So tell us about that.MORET: So first of all, I think the perception, and we're happy to see the trends going in the right direction, that the recognition that manufacturing is at the vital core of the American economy is starting to be more widely recognized. And so as more people look at manufacturing as a great destination for their career, that's a good starting point.Then the concept of life-long learning, so becoming comfortable with STEM skills early in their careers and then having manufacturers continue to make the commitment to provide training so that workers are comfortable with the advanced technology -- that's the winning combination.BARTIROMO: Isn't that about education?MORET: It is about education but in a variety of forms. It's not necessarily requiring college degrees. We have a program that we started a year ago, the academy of advanced manufacturing for returning veterans. We graduated over a hundred veterans so far on our way to a thousand a year.Most of these veterans have high school educations and in a 12-week hands- on program, we equip them for technician level skills at U.S. manufacturers.BARTIROMO: I love that you're doing this because this is really underlining the point that it's really the onus is on private business, the onus is on companies to make sure our people are trained.MORET: That's right.BARTIROMO: It should be a partnership, I guess. But you don't want government getting involved in everything but you could actually do it as a private company.MORET: There are certain things the government can do to help but we're not waiting.BARTIROMO: Yes, exactly.The company recently partnered with Schlumberger to create a company with a goal of advancing digital technology and automation in the oil field. Tell us about that and about the innovation you're seeing in the oil field.MORET: So again, in oil as in other industries that we serve, it's about doing more with less. And if you can have more efficient wells, then you have to drill less of them. And so the ability to work with Schlumberger, which has unequaled domain expertise in oil and gas and with our control know-how, it's a great marriage, brought together to help advance the concept of a digital oil field.BARTIROMO: So tell me where the growth comes from at this point from Rockwell. Let's say looking out three years.MORET: Well, it's certainly about the basic automation. There continues to be demand for the basic automation of repetitive physical processes, but increasingly it's about taking the data that's a natural byproduct of those automation processes and turning it into additional insights, whether it's through artificial intelligence, whether it's through other forms of software-based technology to take that data, turn it into insights and working with the people who are in these manufacturing operations to help them make better decisions.BARTIROMO: AI is so important and getting more important. What kind of data are you referring to as it relates to oil?MORET: So a lot of that is about predicting maintenance issues before it causes down time.BARTIROMO: I see.MORET: Nothing drives a return on investment like reducing unplanned down time and so that's a big part of the focus of what we're doing with Schlumberger.BARTIROMO: Well, we're looking at a chart of your stock. And obviously you've done real well in terms of your execution. And we are happy to report that your company was named one of the most ethical companies in the world.MORET: Well, it's about long-term value and it's about winning the right way. And it's important to our customers. It's important to our share owners. And it's important to our employees. It's one of our best recruiting tools.BARTIROMO: Blake -- it's great to have you on the program.MORET: Thanks so much -- Maria.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. Blake Moret here --MORET: I appreciate it.BARTIROMO: -- joining us, the CEO of Rockwell Automation.Coming up, the longest-held American hostage in history.

And joining me to break it all down -- Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the "Wall Street Journal's" assistant editorial page editor James Freeman, and Fox News contributor Liz Peek. Great to see everybody this morning.LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning.I just really hope Hillary Clinton comes in the race. I just think that would be so much fun. Sorry.I really do.(CROSSTALKING)BARTIROMO: It would.PEEK: I mean everyone was shocked that she actually made this announcement to a very small, local newspaper I believe it was. And so I mean, it is funny though that she woke up the next day and said what have I done.BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, Maggie Haberman which Dagen was talking about yesterday tweeted out a conversation that she had with somebody someone close to Hillary.MCDOWELL: Right. And she -- Hillary of course, immediately pivoted to gender bias, saying how -- why aren't you asking John Kerry if he's not running. Well, because you ran against Trump and lost and you won't go away.You gave this speech in Alabama over the weekend, that you lived in the south for much of your adult life and you still can't sound like a southerner. And she was blaming the Voting Rights Act being chipped away at as one of the reasons that she lost.PEEK: She is also now blaming people in Minnesota or Michigan on race, basically, that they --JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, "WALL STREET JOURNAL": Wisconsin.PEEK: Wisconsin -- excuse me. That's right. I mean, really. Get over it Hillary, please. Do something else.MCDOWELL: Let me just point out something. 1994 crime bill, later which was -- she lobbied for, her husband signed into law. She later referred to essentially young black men in part who were in gangs as super predators.And then remember she asked -- she said that she wasn't going to drop out of the Democratic nomination process against Barack Obama in 2008 because she said remember, Kennedy got shot in June. Do you remember that?BARTIROMO: Oh, wow.MCDOWELL: And now she wonders why black Americans didn't come out in the same numbers for her that they did for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. So again, she still needs to -- there's a lot of like self-analysis that Hillary Clinton needs to do.FREEMAN: Maybe. But the Clinton Foundation needs to raise money and I think that's why --PEEK: That's why she keeps her oar in.(CROSSTALKING)FREEMAN: It's to raise money. And I think when you shut the door on future high office that's not --BARTIROMO: That's a good point. They did around the election, I don't know where that stands now. Let's talk about that actually coming up.Joining the conversation this morning is Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson joining us this morning, along with New York Congressman and House Ways and Means Committee member Tom Reed joining us.

But I do not believe --(CROSSTALKING)BARTIROMO: If they don't -- right --MCDOWELL: But I don't believe they've been subpoenaed.BARTIROMO: If they don't willingly send the documents, then the documents will be subpoenaed as well.MCDOWELL: Just to clarify that and if I'm wrong, I'll correct it. But I don't believe it's gone that far yet.PEEK: Has there ever been a president subjected to this kind of scrutiny and investigation to your knowledge -- Sean?SPICER: Well, I think one of the things that's interesting, Liz -- is it's one thing to be subjected to scrutiny, right. If there's been a crime, if there's something to look into.PEEK: Exactly.SPICER: At this point what they're saying is we don't know so we're just going to look into all of these entities and all of these individuals and see what we come up with.I think that's vastly different in terms of approach because everyone keeps looking at past issues, where there is evidence of something and there was an investigation that followed it.In this case, I think the Democrats like I said have jumped the shark. They basically have said we've got to get him. So let's figure out all of the people and associations and corporations and associations around him. And if we dig far enough we'll probably find something.BARTIROMO: Right.SPICER: And so I think that's the big difference because it's not an investigation into wrongdoing. It's an investigation to find wrongdoing.BARTIROMO: Right. They have their guy. Now they want to find the crime. So they're going to go under every rock to try to do that.Meanwhile we know that there was wrongdoing done in the 2016 election. We know that there was FISA abuse. We know that a couple of people tried to put their finger on the scale and change an election and get the duly- elected president out but there's no mention of that.SPICER: Well there's also, look -- and I'm not trying to rehash old talking points here -- but there's also, if they want to talk about associations with Russia, we know of them. We know that the Clinton Foundation took money, we know that the former president received money, we know that John Podesta was -- you know -- so we know all of these things.And the fact of the matter is that they have just sort of turned a blind eye to all of those past wrongdoings that are known and we've spent no time investigating those actual issues of wrongdoing.BARTIROMO: Right, exactly. Sean -- thank you. We will see you soon.SPICER: You bet -- guys.BARTIROMO: Sean Spicer joining us there.Coming up, the home of the future -- one company is using 3D printers to build affordable homes. We will take a tour of that with HUD Secretary Ben Carson later this hour. He's going to join us live.And then a new way to never be bored, a look at how Nintendo is using cardboard in its new VR product for its wildly (ph) popular Switch game.Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Democrats are divided over a measure on Congresswoman Ilhan Omar's comments.Lauren Simonetti with the details on that now -- Lauren.LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: And Maria -- some in-fighting in the Democratic Party. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is postponing a vote on a resolution condemning anti-Semitism because some House Democrats are pushing back. This after freshman Congresswoman Ilhan Omar suggested last week that Jewish-Americans are pushing lawmakers to pledge allegiance to Israel.The Minnesota lawmaker giving Fox News, check this out, the silent treatment when questioned about her perceived anti-Semitic comments.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Congresswoman Omar, it seems like there's some confusion among your colleagues. Are you anti-Semitic?(END VIDEO CLIP)SIMONETTI: Didn't answer Peter Doocy there. Omar's fellow freshmen and their liberal supporters protesting the way Democratic leaders tried to rush out the resolution.Well, Family Dollar is getting a makeover. Its parent company, Dollar Tree, announcing it will close up to 390 Family Dollar stores this year. It's also going to experiment with charging more than a dollar for some items and selling alcohol. Dollar Tree admitting that it paid too much for Family Dollar, writing off nearly $3 billion in the fourth quarter.Let's take a look. Shares of Dollar Tree, they're up 12 percent for the year. That's a one week chart that you're looking at.Women's fashion retailer Charlotte Russe is closing all of its remaining stores as it files for bankruptcy. The company was unable to find a buyer before the deadline set by lenders and has run out of cash. Charlotte Russe said it had more than 500 stores when it filed for bankruptcy.So another store closes shop -- Maria.BARTIROMO: Yes, incredible.All right. Thank you -- Lauren.Coming up automation transforming manufacturing -- the effect on jobs in America coming up next.Then, it is wine o'clock somewhere. Yes, wine o'clock. We've got the best time of the day to enjoy a glass of wine. Details on when you should unwind later this hour. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.The future of manufacturing -- Rockwell Automation helping companies across several industries make their production more efficient. A key issue for many companies now is uncertainty over the potential U.S./China trade deal.Joining us right now is Rockwell Automation CEO Blake Moret. Great to see you -- Blake. Thank you so much for being here.BLAKE MORET, CEO, ROCKWELL AUTOMATIN: Great -- Maria. Thank you for -- thanks for allowing me to be on your show.BARTIROMO: Yes. No, we're happy you're here. You know, this is such an important industry and the China story has been integral to really the growth of so many businesses.Let me start there in terms of the U.S.-China trade deal. Has the tariffs and the impact of it been an impact for your company?MORET: Well, the uncertainty is certainly not helping. But as we're providing customers from around the world being more productive, China's an important market for us.The U.S. is our largest market and our ability to help U.S. manufacturers do more with less and to create sustainable production processes is really important for us and that continues to be strong. The American economy, the American manufacturing economy remains strong.BARTIROMO: And automation is so important in the manufacturing economy. Where are you seeing growth right now in terms of sectors?MORET: So we provide automation and workforce development for a wide variety of industries within the U.S., particularly important and particularly strong growth areas are food and beverage, as U.S. manufacturers seek to expand their operations around the world.Life sciences, as people want to live longer and healthier and we've seen strong growth in the life sciences pharmaceutical industry.Certain heavy industries, so U.S. oil and gas and so on.BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, in the last quarter you talked a lot about paper and pulp being among those heavy industries that were among the drivers. Does that stand still?MORET: It does. Pulp and paper added a lot of capacity back in the late 80s and early 90s. And a lot of that equipment needs to be refreshed. And people are looking for new, modern technology. And so we're seeing quite a boost in that industry.BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean we're talking about the automation, industrial automation as far as a growth story for the U.S. What steps need to be taken to ensure that our workers can thrive in today's economy? Because a lot of people say, look, our people are not skilled enough.That's why the White House is going through this skills advisory board, that a number of CEOs are involved. I know you as well. So tell us about that.MORET: So first of all, I think the perception, and we're happy to see the trends going in the right direction, that the recognition that manufacturing is at the vital core of the American economy is starting to be more widely recognized. And so as more people look at manufacturing as a great destination for their career, that's a good starting point.Then the concept of life-long learning, so becoming comfortable with STEM skills early in their careers and then having manufacturers continue to make the commitment to provide training so that workers are comfortable with the advanced technology -- that's the winning combination.BARTIROMO: Isn't that about education?MORET: It is about education but in a variety of forms. It's not necessarily requiring college degrees. We have a program that we started a year ago, the academy of advanced manufacturing for returning veterans. We graduated over a hundred veterans so far on our way to a thousand a year.Most of these veterans have high school educations and in a 12-week hands- on program, we equip them for technician level skills at U.S. manufacturers.BARTIROMO: I love that you're doing this because this is really underlining the point that it's really the onus is on private business, the onus is on companies to make sure our people are trained.MORET: That's right.BARTIROMO: It should be a partnership, I guess. But you don't want government getting involved in everything but you could actually do it as a private company.MORET: There are certain things the government can do to help but we're not waiting.BARTIROMO: Yes, exactly.The company recently partnered with Schlumberger to create a company with a goal of advancing digital technology and automation in the oil field. Tell us about that and about the innovation you're seeing in the oil field.MORET: So again, in oil as in other industries that we serve, it's about doing more with less. And if you can have more efficient wells, then you have to drill less of them. And so the ability to work with Schlumberger, which has unequaled domain expertise in oil and gas and with our control know-how, it's a great marriage, brought together to help advance the concept of a digital oil field.BARTIROMO: So tell me where the growth comes from at this point from Rockwell. Let's say looking out three years.MORET: Well, it's certainly about the basic automation. There continues to be demand for the basic automation of repetitive physical processes, but increasingly it's about taking the data that's a natural byproduct of those automation processes and turning it into additional insights, whether it's through artificial intelligence, whether it's through other forms of software-based technology to take that data, turn it into insights and working with the people who are in these manufacturing operations to help them make better decisions.BARTIROMO: AI is so important and getting more important. What kind of data are you referring to as it relates to oil?MORET: So a lot of that is about predicting maintenance issues before it causes down time.BARTIROMO: I see.MORET: Nothing drives a return on investment like reducing unplanned down time and so that's a big part of the focus of what we're doing with Schlumberger.BARTIROMO: Well, we're looking at a chart of your stock. And obviously you've done real well in terms of your execution. And we are happy to report that your company was named one of the most ethical companies in the world.MORET: Well, it's about long-term value and it's about winning the right way. And it's important to our customers. It's important to our share owners. And it's important to our employees. It's one of our best recruiting tools.BARTIROMO: Blake -- it's great to have you on the program.MORET: Thanks so much -- Maria.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. Blake Moret here --MORET: I appreciate it.BARTIROMO: -- joining us, the CEO of Rockwell Automation.Coming up, the longest-held American hostage in history. We're talking with the son of Bob Levinson this morning. The former FBI agent has been held for nearly 12 years in Iran.Wait until you hear this. That's next.Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Thursday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, March 7th, 7:32 a.m. on the East Coast.Markets are lower this morning. Dow Industrials expected to be down about 60 points, right out of the gate, a quarter of a percent lower, S&P 500 is down 5, and the NASDAQ is down 16, after another day of declines yesterday, making it three in a row. Yesterday, the markets were down, the triple digits on the Dow, down 133 points. The S&P 500 is down 18 and the NASDAQ down 70.The big event this morning is the European Central Bank meeting, we will hear details out of the ECB in about 15 minutes on whether the ECB will move on interest rates, provide stimulus for the European economy.Mario Draghi, the president of the ECB will also give a news conference. We're looking to see what he says about tightening policy amid the economic slowdown in the region. Last check, we were expecting the Eurozone to grow just one percent in 2019.All the major indices are lower this morning, in Europe, FT 100 down 26, CAC Quarante down 18, and the DAX Index down 56.In Asia overnight, markets finished mostly lower, it was fractional moves pretty much. The Hang Seng, the worst performer, down almost one percent in Hong Kong.Our top story this half an hour, bringing Americans home, President Trump spoke out yesterday on negotiations for Americans held captive overseas.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We've gotten a lot of them out and they shouldn't have been there. Aya from Egypt and many others, North Korea, we have a few negotiations going on right now. I won't tell you where because we don't want to blow the negotiation out the window, but we have a few negotiations going on.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: And one of the Americans that the President could be talking about is Robert Levinson. You remember this story. He disappeared in Iran, 12 years ago, on Saturday. Levinson was in the FBI and on a private investigation as a contractor for the CIA, when he disappeared in Iran.Today, his wife will appear at a hearing on Capitol Hill to discuss the status of American hostages held in Iran. Joining me right now is Congressman Ted Deutch from the House Foreign Affairs Committee and Robert Levinson's son, Daniel Levinson, is joining us as well. Good to see you both, gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us.REP. TED DEUTCH (D-FL), CHAIRMAN, HOUSE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE: Thank you.BARTIROMO: And Congressman, you are going to be bringing -- introducing a bill that would create a Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs. Tell us about this and whether or not you believe Bob Levinson will be freed any time soon.DEUTCH: Well, thanks for having me and it's good to be with Dan, as well. Bob's the longest-held American in history, Saturday will mark 12 years, and we have to do everything we can to bring the world's attention to Bob's case.That's why we're reintroducing a resolution that I've introduced to every Congress to get the entire House of Representatives on record, speaking as one, to bring Bob home.And this legislation, Maria that you talked about that will elevate the person who is in charge of working to negotiate, to bring home all hostages, in this case, the focus being on Bob, and will impose sanctions on countries who take Americans, hostage.BARTIROMO: Yes.DEUTCH: This is -- this is an issue that should matter to every American because every American is at risk when one of us is taken hostage around the world.BARTIROMO: Daniel, have you heard anything about your father? What can you tell us?DANIEL LEVINSON, SON OF BOB LEVINSON, MISSING IN IRAN: We're constantly hearing from people inside and outside of Iran. There are sightings of him. It's always encouraging because we're just looking for every kind of -- any kind of information.It's been several years since we actually got the proof of life. But we're just meeting with anybody who has information, talking to anybody. So, that's the latest on him.BARTIROMO: So, you're saying you've heard that there were sightings of your father in Iran?LEVINSON: Yes. We get a lot of information coming in and out and, you know, it's hard to discern what is true and what's not, but we know that the FBI's looking into it, the U.S. government's always looking into it, and we're going to follow up with anybody who has information.There is a $5 million reward out there for anybody who does have information, leading to my dad's safe return home.BARTIROMO: No, it feels like President Trump is adamant about making this a priority. Do you think there's been enough pressure on Iran to free your father?LEVINSON: We're encouraged, especially with the bills, like what Congressman Deutch was talking about, that are going to impose sanctions. And I think I'm encouraged -- encourage increased pressure against Iran, increased sanctions by the United States government over the past year is going to --We're hopeful that's going to bring the Iranians to the table and actually pressure them to finally release my dad. It's only going to -- we've learned from experience, for 12 years, dealing with the Iranians, they only respond to pressure. And we're going to have to keep up the pressure. We're hopeful that the President and his administration are going to keep doing that.BARTIROMO: So, what about that, Congressman? What kind of pressure can you put on the Iranians to free Mr. Levinson?DEUTCH: Well, that's one of the reasons that we're introducing this legislation, the idea is that we ought to be able to make countries, in this case, to make Iran pay, if they take Americans, hostage. You can do that through sanctions. You can do that by denying visas.The important thing to remember here is that Bob's the longest-held American hostage in history and Iran has offered to cooperate and yet, they have not. They refuse to acknowledge any responsibility for Bob, being taken captive. And we have to continue to work here in Congress and with our allies around the world to increase, to maximize pressure on Iran.The President has a powerful -- a powerful pulpit from which to do that and I've spoken to multiple -- every Secretary of State since I've been here, I've raised this with anyone in the administration, two different administrations who can help. The Levinsons are a beautiful family and they deserve to have Bob, home, with them.BARTIROMO: Yes. And Daniel, I mean, your father spent 20 years in the FBI, he retired from the FBI in '98 and was working as a -- as a private investigator when he traveled to Kish Island, Iran. Can you tell us a bit about what happened when he left and when the last time you spoke with him?LEVINSON: Well, I can confirm that he never left. He was definitely taken -- detained by authorities there, in his hotel, somewhere around between the time that he checked out of his hotel and he never made it to the airport. His flight has never -- his passport's never shown up in any -- in any other countries, no flight manifest ever had his name.So, we know that he's still in the country and that the Iranian government definitely knows exactly where he is. There are people -- it might be just a few people within the government, but they know that he was taken on Kish Island. It's a very small island. I've been there twice now.And it's impossible to believe that they don't know exactly what happened to him. It's very tiny and very -- it's a tight security state, so they know what's going on there.BARTIROMO: And Congressman, you serve as the Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East. What can you do? I mean, how has this platform helped you pursue Bob's case?DEUTCH: Well, today, we're using this platform to highlight Bob's case and all the Americans who have gone -- have been held hostage in Iran and we're holding a hearing so that, again, this Congress will make clear that we can't accept this any longer.BARTIROMO: Yes.DEUTCH: We're going to give -- we're going to give Christine the opportunity to speak to the world about Bob. And Maria, can I just add, you have an important network that major business executives watch. The power of CEOs and --BARTIROMO: Yes.DEUTCH: -- the business community to actually take a stand here, in dealing with the business that affects Iran --BARTIROMO: Yes.DEUTCH: -- is also important and I hope that people will consider that.BARTIROMO: I think this is a really important point. And Daniel, I want to get back to this in a moment and ask you what you're expecting to hear from your mother.But Congressman, let me stay with you for a moment and ask you, given your prominent position on the Foreign Affairs Committee, obviously, one of the big topics of conversation is your colleague, Congresswoman Omar's comments. Do you want her to step off of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Sir?DEUTCH: Well, I'll tell you what I want, Maria. I want a very strong condemnation of anti-Semitism to pass in the House today. We've had lots of discussions about foreign policy. But the fact is that using anti- Semitic tropes, like the Dual-Loyalty Charge, which I take so personally, both as a member of Congress and the son of a World War II veteran, that language is unacceptable and must be condemned.It's important that we do it clearly. It's important that we do it singularly, and it's important that we do it today.BARTIROMO: Yes. How come this keeps getting delayed? I mean, I'm sort of like, scratching my head a little, saying well, obviously, anti-Semitism is -- should be condemned and, obviously, bigotry should be condemned. I mean, we need a resolution to tell us that? I mean, this is pretty obvious, isn't it?DEUTCH: Well, of course, it should be condemned and we --and we condemn it --BARTIROMO: But how come it keeps getting delayed, though? It keeps getting delayed, right?DEUTCH: We should condemn it every way we can. It's important for the entire house, I believe, to have the opportunity to condemn the use of anti-Semitic tropes that throughout the history of the Jewish people, has led to threats and expulsion from countries and violence and death, and we need to do it quickly. There is no time to waste, I agree with you. It needs to happen right away.BARTIROMO: I totally agree with you, Congressman, and that's all good and fine, but people say that that's not going far enough. I mean, if you've got a key member on your committee, Congresswoman Omar, who is obviously making anti-Semitic comments, wouldn't the best thing to just ask her to step off of the committee?I mean, that's what the Republicans did with Steve King, right, they relieved him of all of his committee assignments. Why not just relieve her of this committee assignment?DEUTCH: Yes. Look, Maria, I think the last -- the last time we dealt with this, just weeks ago, entire house leadership offered a strong condemnation. This time, it's important for the entire House of Representatives to do the same thing.BARTIROMO: And that would be enough for you, you don't need her to step off Foreign Affairs?DEUTCH: And that's -- and that's it. And there is -- and there is no tolerance for this kind of language beyond that.BARTIROMO: Yes.DEUTCH: There is no -- we can't accept it. We just -- we can't accept it because of what it does to corrode the operation --BARTIROMO: Yes. I totally get that.DEUTCH: -- the operation of the Congress.BARTIROMO: And I agree with you. So, why not just ask her to step off of Foreign Affairs, sir?DEUTCH: Well, because I'm focused right now on dealing not with comments that have anything to do with Foreign Affairs. I want it today, Maria, I want to condemn anti-Semitism. I don't want -- I don't want to have a conversation about foreign policy. This isn't about foreign policy today.BARTIROMO: Well, it's Foreign Affairs. If you're -- if you're -- if you're on the Foreign Affairs Committee and you're trashing Israel, obviously, the first thing is step off of Foreign Affairs, because there's -- you obviously can't be fair.DEUTCH: Well, when you're -- when you're using -- when you're using anti- Semitic tropes that have done such damage to the Jewish community throughout our history, the first thing -- respectfully, the first thing is that we condemn the use of that language so that it stops.BARTIROMO: Right.DEUTCH: And when you suggest -- when you suggest, Maria, the idea that because I am a supporter of Israel, that I have some dual loyalty to Israel, that is -- that's enormously problematic, not just because it's unfair and unacceptable to suggest that --BARTIROMO: Yes. No, I think we're agreeing with each other. I'm just wondering why you're not going the extra step and getting her off of Foreign Affairs, Congressman.DEUTCH: Well, I'm -- as I said, Maria, right now, let's do this.BARTIROMO: Yes. OK.DEUTCH: Tomorrow, we'll have conversations about foreign policy and the impacts and why statements that --BARTIROMO: Yes.DEUTCH: -- suggest that our important relationship with Israel is founded on anything other than the strong shared values that we have, are unacceptable.BARTIROMO: We will watch that, Congressman, thank you. And very quickly, Daniel, final comments from you. What should we expect from your mother today, as she testifies in this important hearing?LEVINSON: I'm one of seven children. My parents have seven kids. They've been married for almost 45 years, and in 2 months, my sister's going to walk down the aisle. She's the last one that my dad has a chance to walk down the aisle. It's going to be on my parents' anniversary.And she's going to talk about how tough this has been for the past 12 years for everyone in our family, and no family should ever have to go through what we're going through.BARTIROMO: That's right.LEVINSON: It's a reminder, if you will.BARTIROMO: All right. Congressman Ted Deutch, Daniel Levinson, our prayers are with you, Daniel Levinson, we hope you have success. Congressman, we appreciate you joining us. Gentlemen, thank you.DEUTCH: Thanks, Maria.LEVINSON: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Coming up next, HUD Secretary Ben Carson is here. He will join us later this hour, to discuss housing in America. You don't want to miss that, back in a moment.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Nintendo introducing its new virtual reality kit, Lauren Simonetti with all the details in headlines now. Lauren.SIMONETTI: It's pretty low tech, Maria, the new V.R. kit is for the Nintendo switch, it is part of its Labo series of do-it-yourself cardboard sets. The main kit comes with six different accessories to build, including goggles and a camera. It costs about 80 bucks. It comes out next month. But there's also a smaller version that will set you back $40.00And take a look at this, a massive sinkhole opened up at a zoo in Louisville, Kentucky. Officials had to close the zoo after finding the sinkhole, the size of a football field. Fortunately, the sinkhole is in an undeveloped area, no animals were hurt, no people either. Engineers now working to find out what caused that.A new study finds something you might have already known, wine makes us happy, 65 percent of respondents named a glass of wine as their best little treat. Half said they drink wine, at least, weekly. When is the best time to indulge? 6:59 p.m., to be exact. That was voted wine o'clock, if you will.The pole of 2,000 respondents was done in conduction with the winemaker, Jam Cellars. And if you really love wine, wait until you hear this, and look at this. The Quinta da Pacheca vineyard in Portugal, you can literally sleep inside a wine barrel. These are replicas of wine barrels made of pine.They include all of the amenities of a regular hotel. You even get Wi-Fi, $300 a night. I know you're going to ask me, is the wine free? You get a free tour of the vineyard. I'm sure you can sip a little bit for free.BARTIROMO: That is gorgeous.SIMONETTI: It is.BARTIROMO: Wow.SIMONETTI: Definitely clever.BARTIROMO: All right, 6:59 p.m.SIMONETTI: Head there. It's in Portugal.BARTIROMO: Wine o'clock. Thank you, Lauren. Coming up, the future of home building, one company is using 3D printers to build affordable homes. We're going to tell you how. We will take you there. We're taking a tour with the HUD Secretary, Ben Carson. He's up next, back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Revolutionizing home building, one company managed to do the unthinkable, build a home in less than 48 hours for just $10,000. That's Icon, the Austin-based construction company. It's using 3D printing to build homes.Joining me now is Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, who will tour the Austin 3D printed house later today. Secretary, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.BEN CARSON, SECRETARY, HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT: Good to be with you, Maria.BARTIROMO: So tell us about this Icon, it sounds pretty extraordinary.CARSON: Well, you know, there are a lot of new technologies that are coming online. And you know, we have an affordable housing crisis. So what we have to do is update what we do and start thinking out of the box. And Icon, I wanted to come down here and witness it for myself. Obviously, I've read things about it and seen things.But this kind of technology actually is able to print a house, believe it or not, in a short period of time, for amazingly little money. And, you know, there are other types of technologies that are coming along in terms of building materials to make them much more resilient.But you can see how something like this could be a tremendous advantage to us after a natural disaster, where multiple homes are destroyed. You think about what happened last week in Alabama and the ability to now come in and produce -- these are -- they appear to be very nice homes.You also look at the technologies and other types of buildings, accessory dwelling units, tiny homes, manufactured homes. A lot of times when people think of manufactured homes, they think about trailers. We've gone far beyond that. And now, you know, manufactured housing looks better than site-built housing, and is much more resilient.So, looking at these kinds of things, I think we have an opportunity to make a real dent in the affordable housing crisis.PEEK: Secretary, good morning. The issue is price. Do you have any sense at all? Can you give us a clue about what the cost of something like the house that we're looking at on the screen, looks -- amounts to?CARSON: Well, they say they were able to produce that house for like $10,000. But I think, you know, by the time you get through with the plumbing, all the amenities, electrical, you're still talking, you know, 140, 150, $160,000, which is considerably less than the average price of a home.PEEK: Sure, competitive.CARSON: So, yes.PEEK: Yes.CARSON: And resilient also. You're able to build it out of materials that can resist natural disaster, because that's what we're really concentrating on now. I will have to give credit to our Congress who actually came up after the 2017 season of unprecedented disasters --BARTIROMO: Yes.CARSON: -- with enough money for us to actually begin to concentrate on mitigation.BARTIROMO: Secretary, I know you're going to be stepping down soon. We so appreciate your time this morning. Thank you so much.CARSON: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Ben Carson there. We'll be right back.Load-Date: March 7, 2019End of Document

Following Google CEO Meeting With President Trump, Senator Hawley Calls on Google to Publicly Address Its Partnership With ChinaTargeted News ServiceMarch 28, 2019 Thursday 6:30 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 752 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodySen. Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, issued the following news release:Today, Senator Josh Hawley sent a letter to Google CEO Sundar Pichai asking him to address the company's refusal to work with the United States Department of Defense while partnering with China on artificial intelligence initiatives.The letter was sent following Google's meeting with President Trump to discuss the company's decision to not work with the Department of Defense while partnering with China.The meeting with President Trump was sparked by an exchange Senator Hawley had - earlier this month at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing - with the Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in which the two defense leaders said that Google's work in China was providing "direct benefit" to the Chinese military.In his letter, Senator Hawley writes, "I understand that today you have met with General Dunford and the President of the United States to address these concerns. Now meet with the American people by addressing publicly the work your company does in China, the benefits it may provide to the Chinese government and military, and your reluctance to partner or aid the Armed Forces of the United States."Full text can be found below.March 28, 2019Mr. Sundar Pichai, Chief Executive Officer, Google, 1600 Ampitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043Dear Mr. Pichai, I have been deeply troubled by the testimony of our national defense leadership regarding Google's unwillingness to partner with the U.S. Armed Forces, even while pursuing lucrative projects in China that directly or indirectly benefit the repressive Chinese government.At a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on March 14, both Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joseph Dunford expressed deep concern about Google's actions.In response to my questions, Chairman Dunford testified that Google's work with Chinese companies in China may directly threaten the United States. As General Dunford further elaborated at an event at the Atlantic Council on March 21: "Typically if a company does business in China, they are automatically going to be required to have a cell of the Communist party in that company and that is going to lead to that intellectual property from that company finding its way to the Chinese military." I suspect most Americans would find it mind-boggling that an American company would partner with our adversary in this way.According to reports, the work Google is doing with China not only includes development of artificial intelligence technology that may possibly be used by Chinese military and intelligence services to exploit Americans' data and privacy, but also the introduction of platforms that advance a value system and modes of behavior fundamentally at odds with our own, such as the censor-friendly search engine Project Dragonfly.That Google persists in seeking partnerships in China - including building an artificial intelligence facility in Beijing - suggests a long-term commitment by the company to have China as a partner. Indeed, in October 2018 you described China as "a wonderful, innovative market" and said that "given how important the market is and how many users there are, we feel obliged to think hard about this problem and take a longer-term view." And yet, a letter from 1,400 of your employees revealed that Google employees "do not have the information required to make ethically-informed decisions about our work, our projects, and our employment."It is worth asking what Google stands to gain from partnering with a country that routinely violates basic human liberties, including maintaining detention facilities for nearly a million Uyghur Muslims, banning freedom of speech and the press, and repressing its Christian, Tibetan Buddhist and other religious communities. Is the technology Google develops, ostensibly for the welfare of consumers, being used by the Chinese government to further perpetuate these human rights violations?I understand that today you have met with General Dunford and the President of the United States to address these concerns. Now meet with the American people by addressing publicly the work your company does in China, the benefits it may provide to the Chinese government and military, and your reluctance to partner or aid the Armed Forces of the United States.Sincerely,Josh D.

Chinese tech firms lay lower at CES 2019 amid trade tensionsAssociated Press Financial WireJanuary 7, 2019 Monday 12:27 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: DOMESTIC NEWSLength: 995 wordsByline: By MATT O'BRIEN, AP Technology WriterDateline: LAS VEGAS BodyLAS VEGAS (AP) - The CES 2019 gadget show, which kicks off Sunday, will showcase the expanding influence and sway of China's rapidly growing technology sector. But some of its firms are stepping back from the spotlight amid rising U.S. national-security concerns over Chinese tech and a trans-Pacific trade war launched by President Donald Trump.Last year, a top executive of the Chinese telecom firm Huawei delivered a CES keynote address critical of AT&T's abrupt cancellation of plans to sell a Huawei phone following espionage concerns raised by the U.S. government. This year, Huawei's chief financial officer was arrested in Canada at the behest of the U.S.; Meng Wanzhou, daughter of Huawei's founder, now awaits U.S. extradition . No Chinese technology executives will deliver CES keynotes in Las Vegas this week.There are fewer Chinese entrepreneurs buying up booth space to show off their latest technology - more than 20 percent fewer exhibitors than last year, according to registration numbers tracked by the South China Morning Post. Chinese firms still account for more than a quarter of the conference's 4,500 exhibitors, second only to the U.S. in sheer numbers. But some of the biggest names are taking a more subdued approach.Internet company Baidu last year hosted a flashy event touting its self-driving software, but this year is sticking to a more conventional booth. E-commerce giant Alibaba is eschewing the big outdoor tent it helped erect last year in favor of quieter meetings marketing its voice assistant to business partners. The phone maker Xiaomi is simply skipping this year's event altogether.None of them are citing U.S.-China tensions as a reason, but it's hard to ignore the geopolitical backdrop - even with a 90-day "cease-fire" on tariffs set to expire in March. Trump struck a more conciliatory tone Sunday as American trade negotiators prepared to meet with their counterparts in Beijing.The U.S. and China have imposed import taxes on hundreds of billions of dollars of each other's goods - and Trump has threatened more to come, including tariffs that could make devices like iPhones more expensive. The U.S. is also exploring new export restrictions that would target industries where China is hoping to get ahead, such as artificial intelligence and robotics. And the Justice Department brought charges last month against two Chinese citizens it accused of stealing American trade secrets and other sensitive information on behalf of Beijing's main intelligence agency.Of course, plenty of Chinese entrepreneurs are still eager to show off their innovations. Hosts of the 52-year-old trade event have sought to downplay the tensions, noting that they've weathered previous trade tensions, such as those that roiled U.S.-Japan relations in the 1980s."The Japanese presence used to be very big and it was similar in that the U.S. was in a panic about it," said Gary Shapiro, CEO of the Consumer Technology Association, which organizes CES. That ended when the Japanese "bubble" economy burst in 1991 and its tech industry began a long, slow decline."Japanese innovation from those companies shrunk and those companies consolidated," Shapiro said. "These things are impermanent. So I don't lose that much sleep over it."Shapiro said the trade dispute with China and the Meng arrest in Canada aren't impacting attendance. CES organizers on Sunday wouldn't confirm numbers showing a sharp drop in Chinese exhibitors, but said a decline in small Chinese companies on the show floor was made up by expanded booth presence from bigger firms.Chinese tech firms are increasingly joining their American, South Korean and Japanese counterparts in using CES to build enthusiasm for up-and-coming electronics products, while also connecting with potential new international partners and suppliers. That's especially true for electronics firms like Hisense and TCL, which have increasingly sought to sell their TVs in North America, and Lenovo, which is already a big player in the U.S. laptop market but is pushing to sell other internet-connected devices.Hisense is making a splashier presentation this year as it invests in boosting its U.S. brand awareness, said Jim Ninesling, head of marketing for Hisense USA. Previously, the company, which has a large market share in China, mostly kept on the U.S. sidelines, branding some of its products under the name of the better-known Japanese firm Sharp.Chinese electric carmaker Byton, a startup backed by internet giant Tencent, on Sunday unveiled what it called the "world's most intuitive automotive interface" involving a touchscreen mounted on the steering wheel. AI firm iFlytek - sometimes described as China's Siri or Alexa - is planning to showcase its latest advances in voice recognition and real-time translation services.And a startup expo co-hosted by the Chinese government features a bevy of gee-whiz innovations, from indoor delivery robots and portable karaoke headsets to "smart" suitcases aided by computer vision.In an ideal world, the tech industries in the two countries would be seen as complementary, said venture capitalist Kai-Fu Lee, who led Google's subsidiary in China before the company withdrew over censorship and other concerns."The U.S. strength is deep technologists, universities, academics, people with superior experience," he said. "China's superiority is a larger market, more data, and very tenacious and hardworking entrepreneurs."Lee said his optimism for a more collaborative approach is now "merely a dream" because of the worsening trade dispute. But he said there could still be partnerships between U.S. firms and Chinese companies that, for now, mostly cater to Chinese consumers."Google feels much, much more threat from Amazon than any Chinese company," he said. "That makes Tencent and Alibaba potential allies, especially when customer needs cross international boundaries."__AP Business Writer Joseph Pisani contributed to this report.Load-Date: January 7, 2019End of Document

Microsoft's Bing search engine returns to China just a day after users reported outagesBusiness Insider USJanuary 24, 2019 Thursday 05:30 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Insider Inc.

After China removed access to Google back in 2011, Bing was the only search engine from a non-Chinese company that remained.Reports of Bing outages first surfaced on social media Wednesday from users in China who were unable to access Bing's Chinese website, cn.bing.com.The Financial Times reported that the Chinese government cited "illegal content" as the reasoning for the block. The same reasoning has been used by Chinese authorities in the past to block Chinese citizens from accessing popular social media platforms (like Facebook, Google, and Twitter) and prominent news outlets (like the BBC, the New York Times, and Bloomberg).Bing is the latest website to be blocked in China behind what has been nicknamed the "Great Firewall."In the past, China has implemented temporary blocks on websites before restoring them or blocking them permanently. It's unclear which category the block on Bing falls into. In an appearance on FOX Business Network on Thursday, Microsoft president Brad Smith said that China's block of Bing "is not the first time it's happened."NOW WATCH: Apple forever changed the biggest tech event of the year by not showing upSee Also:• Microsoft's search engine, Bing, is the latest website to be blocked under China's strict online censorship rules• Huawei's CEO threatens to axe 'mediocre' staff after global security worries• Here's why Apple's China situation is at 'code red,' and why it needs to take dramatic action to plug up a key weakness in the businessLoad-Date: February 11, 2019End of Document

Good Friday morning everybody. Thank you so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Friday, February 22nd. Your top stories right now, 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.Trade talks now head to the White House, President Trump will meet with China's top negotiator today. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo waiting on the talks on this program yesterday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE, UNITED STATES: It's one thing to write something on the piece of paper. It's another thing to have enforcement mechanisms and I know our trade team has harder work making sure that the American people get that.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Markets are rallying on some optimism this morning. Dow Industrial up 110 points, almost a half of a percent. S&P 500 is up 10 and the NASDAQ up 31. Looks like it should be a positive open this morning.Yesterday not so much at the close. The Dow Industrial down 103 points, S&P was down 10 points and the NASDAQ was down 29.In Europe this morning, the momentum is on the upside. FT-100 up 46, CAC Quarante in Paris up 21 and the DAX Index in Germany up 54.In Asia overnight gains pretty much across the board with the exception of a fractional loss in Japan but here too is the China story really impacting markets. The Shanghai Composite up almost two percent.Meanwhile, back at home or backlash for Congreewoman Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez as she's defending her Green New Deal now.And another serious security concern to report of WhatsApp user finding a flaw that bypasses face and touch I.D. locking features. The details coming up right here.And Photoshop fail, a new image of Khloe Kardashian for her company Good American brand going viral for all the wrong reasons.All those stories coming up this Friday morning. And joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Networ's Dagen McDowell, MaxFunds.com co-founder Jonas Max Ferris, and Fox News contributor, Liz Peek. Great to see you.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Great to see you.LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: We just don't talk about the Kardashians enough on this program and we never do.BARTIROMO: That was a new one.MCDOWELL: Well, Khloe dumped her -- the guy who's the father of her child apparently because he hooked up with Kylie's best friend. So, I'll keep you up-to-date (INAUDIBLE).But by the way, I did want to clarify Glenn Close was nominated. Her first Oscar nomination was "The World According to Garp" she'd lost. She lost to Jessica Lange in "Tootsie". She was nominated like for the "Big Chill", "Fatal Attraction", "Dangerous Liaisons". All roles she probably should've won for but maybe she's got it this weekend.BARTIROMO: So, she was nominated but she's never won?MCDOWELL: Never won. SO, I want to say, never won. And I thought they were talking seven Best Actors nominations but they were including Best Supporting Actress to clarify that.BARTIROMO: All right, good clarification there. We've got a big hour coming up. Joining the conversation this morning is the CEO of Cisco. Now, Cisco completes with Huawei. Yes, so we want to see what's going on at Cisco's business in the face of all of the concerns around the Chinese telecom company Huawei. The CEO Chuck Robbins is here, we're going to talk about that. And then New York Congressman Peter King is here, a member of the financial services at Homeland Security Committees, plus the host of "VARNEY & CO.", Stuart Varney weighs in as well. Don't miss the moments of this upcoming hour.We kick it off here with the U.S.-China trade talks, another round of talks taking place today at the White House. Blake Burman is covering the story live at the White House. Blake, any new information for us?BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Well, we're going to find out Maria, here shortly as it's the second day of discussions among the senior most members of the U.S. and China trade teams. They will resume their talks here later this morning and will culminate over here at the White House with an Oval Office gathering between President Trump and China's top negotiator, its Vice Premier Liu He.You might remember those two along with the large gathering met two weeks ago. I believe two weeks ago to today. And that ended with China announcing a major soybeans purchase. Since then though, the U.S. is publicly noted they are pushing for much more than that. The two sides we are told are outlining multiple Memorandum of Understanding that could be agreed-upon. Those MOU's deal with economic and trade issues.However, the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo saying yesterday that whatever might come from those MOUs the ability to enforce agreements will be paramount.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)POMPEO: If you talk to Ambassador Lighthizer or Secretary Mnuchin for even two minutes, they will tell you how the heart of these discussions will surround enforcement mechanisms and I hope that the Chinese will be prepared to permit those to take place. If they do, perhaps we can find a good, solid trade way to move forward.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURMAN: Now the Chinese have targeted a possible meeting between President Trump and President Xi at the end of March though. We should say nothing is firm yet as it relates to a possible meeting between those two but Maria, when you talk about maybe a face-to-face meeting at some point at the end of the month, next month, it's a reminder that at the end of next week is the deadline to get this deal done. Now the president has suggested in the recent days that it could slide.So, the 2:00 hour over here at the White House, the vice premier in the Oval Office with President Trump. I think then Maria we'll start to get a better sense of where things stand, if there are those MOU's and what might be in them, Maria.BARTIROMO: So, the Chinese delegation will be there today.BURMAN: Right.BARTIROMO: Are they going to slip it and make it slide in to tomorrow on a Saturday? Do you think we have these talks extended to the weekend, Blake?BURMAN: Well, I mean, you know, when I was speaking with someone yesterday, one of the guidance that I was given was let's just kind of -- kind of wait to see how this all shakes out.BARTIROMO: OK.BURMAN: You know, I don't think they want to -- want to predict this in real time, maybe it's a possibility but you know, as they say, just kind of let it all play out and we'll see where it lands.BARTIROMO: Blake, thank you so much. Blake Burman is at the White House.And joining me right now to talk more about is New York Congressman and House Homeland Security and Financial Services Committee member, Peter King. Congressman, always a pleasure to see you. Thank you so much for being here this morning.REP. PETER KING (R-NY), HOUSE HOMELAND SECURITY AND FINANCIAL SERVICES COMMITTEE MEMBER: Thank you, Maria. Thank you -- thank you very much.BARTIROMO: First on China, you know, we are hearing some reports that maybe this flips into Saturday. I'm not sure. You heard Blake say, you know, we'll see what happens but look, if they don't make a real commitment to moving the needle on the big issues like I.P. theft, like force transfer of technology, like espionage, can this go anywhere? I mean, it can't possibly be that China's just going to buy more stuff from the U.S., right?KING: It really has to go beyond playing economic as important as that is. Cyber theft and again just the theft of secrets by the Chinese is something that has to be stopped. That's the reinforcement mechanism on that. Secretary Pompeo was right. I mean, again, the theft by China is really unprecedented and that has to be stopped.As far as the trade issues themselves, I know we talked to Ambassador Lighthizer a while ago. And he seemed someone optimistic on that and that was you know, I guess about a month ago. But he thought everything was going in the right direction at that time.But I agree with Secretary Pompeo. The whole idea of industrial secret theft by China is -- it can't be counted. That it puts us at a disadvantage and it also has a very strong essence security effect.BARTIROMO: Yes. But one of the issues is the Chinese will not even admit to all of these cyber intrusions and we know that our networks get attacked thousands of times every day. Some from China, Russia. I mean, we know who the bad actors are, North Korea, but they need to acknowledge it I guess is one thing.But look, let me move on to the border wall showdown, congressman. Because your Democratic colleagues in the House are following the resolution today to block President Trump's National Emergency to fund the southern border wall. Tell me how that goes down and your reaction.KING: My feeling is that it will probably pass the House. I will oppose it. I think the president has the legal right to do this. We can again question whether or not it's the right thing to do but I think the president feels that he's in an all-out war to get this wall done and under the statute I believe he has the right to do it, even though some would disagrees with his judgment the fact is he's given the right to exercise that judgment. I think it's a stunt by the Democrats and probably will pass the House. I don't know what will happen in the Senate but the president will veto it and there's no way they're going to get the two thirds vote to override his veto.BARTIROMO: So, it's more bluster to try to resist as much as they can any of the president's policies?KING: Yes, and I think that it's going to backfire in them because even if not everyone agrees with the president on the wall this is overkill by the Democrats and has built-in resistance to fight whatever he wants to do and so I think they're in many ways they're playing it to his hands.BARTIROMO: Look, I saw your tweet about the Amazon story, the HQ2 backlash, Democratic politicians being blamed for Amazon's decision to scrap the New York City headquarters plan. Peggy Noonan out with a skating op-ed in the Journal. She titles it, welcome to New York Amazon, now go home. Saying, no CEO is going to do what Jeff Bezos did, invest all that time, all that money, do all the planning, negotiating, deciding only to see it collapse in bitter headlines because politicians you're making the deal who are making the deal with can't control their own troops. And because in the end, it is summoning humiliation to do big business in the town whose political life is dominated by a wild and rising progressive left. That's Peggy Noonan. What do you say, congressman?KING: Well, I'm not as articulate as Peggy but I agree with everything she said. Because I grew up at Sunnyside, next to Long Island City. That is such a booming area. This was a deal which was going to bring in 25,000 jobs, $150,000 average salary and would have brought in probably $27-30 billion more in revenue at least. And Democratic left to oppose it the ones who got hurt the most is the Democratic working-class, the hard- working blue-collar families. Think of all those pizza parlors, bodegas, Uber drivers, cabdrivers, all the small businesses, all the small homeowners in that area. Well, that would've done, it would have been a magnet for so many jobs and would have -- would have gone beyond Amazon. It would've said that New York is open for business.And I think listen, the burden right now is on Andrew Cuomo and Bill de Blasio to fight the left wing of their own party. I mean, Andrew Cuomo fought to get a Democratic State Senate. It was a State Senate that killed it. It was the Democratic legislators who under the deal which wasn't perfect but no deal is perfect. We don't live in a perfect world. And the fact is that would have been such an economic boon for the New York at the time when revenues and jobs are leaving New York. This would've been reversed.So, any of those people on the left to stay there fighting for the working people, they're not. They're working for their own naked ideology which is bereft of any real thought that's just class politics is bigotry at its worst.BARTIROMO: Well, that's too bad. Because Cuomo has already said that there's a $2 billion hole in the budget because all the rich people are moving out and they're not going to deal with this. And you've got New York freshman Alexanderia Ocasio-Cortez appearing on a radio show yesterday defending her Green New Deal plan, she said this. Listen, we got to address factory farming. Maybe we shouldn't be eating a hamburger for breakfast, lunch and dinner like let's keep it real.That's what she said, I don't even know what that means. Is she trying to outlaw hamburgers? Now, I mean, I just don't even know what that means?KING: I don't know if she knows what she's talking about. Listen, last week she was talking about -- instead of giving $3 billion to Amazon, lets build schools with it. That wasn't $3 billion New York had, that was $3 billion as part of a performance contract out of the 27 that was going to come in from Amazon. Three was going to Amazon. And anytime you get a deal that's nine to one and you knock it down, it shows you're an economic illiterate. And that's the reality here.So, (INAUDIBLE) soundbites to the left. And what it's done is it's going to turn it into a European type begrudge class of people where you begrudge with the other guy makes.Listen, I'm not a millionaire, I'm not going to be a millionaire, I don't care. I have the opportunity to do whatever I want and that's what other people (INAUDIBLE) everyone the opportunity to do. Don't begrudge the person that makes the money. They're the ones who generate the jobs. They're the ones who make it better for everyone. For somebody who grew up in that area, this to me is really a disgraceful stunt to those working people.BARTIROMO: You know, it's interesting because here you are in the House of Representatives -- I mean, you know, and we only hear from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and she served the loudest voice in the -- in the room. What happens when you guys run into each other? I mean, if everybody's talking about how crazy her ideas are and how they are pie-in-the-sky, they don't make economic sense trillions of dollars for the Green Plan, trillions of dollars for Medicare for all, free college, 70 percent tax rates which are not going to cover all of this anyway. So, when you see her, I mean, do these issues come up or is this just talking about it on T.V.?KING: I already actually bumped into her once and she said hello. She seemed very gracious and I was -- I look upon her as a metaphor for the movement. And the media has put her out there. You know, she's a metaphor for the resistance left. So, this is nothing personal. I'm sure she's a well-being person. But the fact is --BARTIROMO: No, I know that. But you -- I mean you're calling it a metaphor and I think a lot of your colleagues on the left will say these are just broad strokes, these are just values, well, they're not, congressman. These are actual plans in the bill. We see the cost of these plans, we see the Medicare for all, wipes out the whole private insurance industry. So, just say they're just brushstrokes and there's values and just ideas, they're actually not. She's actually pushing forward a plan.KING: She is but saying is that I don't take it personally this is a metaphor -- because she is a metaphor but there's a solid movement behind her.BARTIROMO: That's right.KING: There's a movement in the congress. I mean, think of all the people who sign on to that Green Bill. Think of again, this was Amazon one of the most powerful companies in the world and they are proud of the fact that they brought it down.And again, it's overwrought publicity they get. I'm not saying there's substance behind it, I'm not saying we should take them -- not take them seriously.BARTIROMO: Right.KING: I'm just saying I don't think it's personal. I just think that they are misguided and unfortunately that's the direction the Democratic Party is going in. I mean, it's Bernie Sanders on one end, Cortez on the other.BARTIROMO: That's a really large to the left. Congressman, it's good to see you. Thank you so much. Peter King joining us.KING: Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Coming up, security alert messaging app, WhatsApp, confirming a flaw that's allowing anybody to bypass the phase I.D. or the touch I.D. security features. I'll tell you how the company is responding this morning.And then, Pinterest is going public. The Journal is reporting the company has filed, next up.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A disturbing security flaw uncovered in WhatsApp. Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now. Cheryl?CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, Maria. A Reddit user has found a bug on WhatsApp that allows anybody to bypass Apple's face and touch I.D. features. WhatsApp which is owned by Facebook says it's working on a fix right now until then the company recommends people set the screen lock option to immediately on their phones.Well, photo sharing social media sites Pinterest reportedly is ready to hit the market. According to the Journal, the company is filing confidential - - filing confidentially for its initial public offering. Now, they're seeking evaluation of at least $12 billion. IPOs are picking up folks.OK. Khloe Kardashian's good American brand slammed on Instagram over what some are calling an editing fail. The reality star critics say this picture of Khloe in her skinny jeans appears to be heavily Photoshoped because the reflection shows Khloe's waist larger and more promotion to her body than to how she looks in the actual photo. You guys look at that and decide.OK. And then finally here. We'll give you this one, Maria. Meet the world's first female A.I. news anchor.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: China's state-run news outlet is unveiling this latest addition to their team. The A.I. anchor announcing her role as broadcaster for China's political conferences next month.And then you may remember this. Of course you do, Maria? Your exclusive interview with humanoid bot Pepper in Davos.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: What job do you want?PEPPER, HUMANOID ROBOT: Maria, I would like your job one day. What do you think?BARTIROMO: Not today but maybe one day.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Pepper is designed to recognize people emotions. You know what though, Maria?BARTIROMO: No, no. I don't like it. No.CASONE: Here's the thing. OK. That A.I. check in China can't interview the Secretary of State, can't dance to the Ramones, so whatever.BARTIROMO: OK. I don't like it.CASONE: I don't like it either.BARTIROMO: Wow. She was good. She look exactly like the real thing. So this is where it's going, Dagen. This is where it's going.JONAS MAX FERRIS, FOX NEWS ECONOMIC ANALYST: The future of these computers are going to look back at us and laugh. How we used to laugh at them. And they takeover. Remember when they thought we were funny?BARTIROMO: Oh, yes.MCDOWELLL: The A.I. news -- like news anchor really that big of a stretch from that heavily Photoshoped photo of one of the Kardashians? Not really. None of them look like that in real life?BARTIROMO: Who is looking that closely at Karsdashian's -- I mean, really? OK. Everyone is looking --(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELLL: Yes. But they're all -- they're so heavily Photoshoped, they're blurry.BARTIROMO: OK.MCDOWELLL: In their photo. Anyway.BARTIROMO: Well, there you go.MCDOWELLL: And by the way, that doesn't look -- I don't know who that looks like but it's not Khloe Kardashian.BARTIROMO: She's changed a lot. Coming up.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Oh, yes. Yes, Maria. Craft Hines shares are plummeting. Take a look. This is a serious situation down 26 percent this morning. We'll tell you what's behind this in heavy volume. Then booming baby business. I'm speaking with the cofounder of one organic baby food delivery startup. It's backed by the San Francisco 49ers. And Tinder, next up.BARTIROMO: Fast and fresh baby food delivered to your door. Growing startup, Little Spoon offers affordable and organic baby food plus delivery. You just --and we want to talk right about it, they just announced a $7 million round of funding. Some of the investors include the founder of Tinder and the San Francisco 49ers. Joining us right now is Little Spoon cofounder, Lisa Barnett. Lisa, great to see you.LISA BARNETT, COFOUNDER, LITTLE SPOON: Great to see you too, Maria.BARTIROMO: Thank so much for joining us. Congratulations on the company.BARNETT: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Tell us about how this came about and you've brought some little baby food.BARNETT: I sure did. So, you know, I don't know when the last time it is that any of you bought baby food, crazy reality is that --FERRIS: I used to steal it.BARNETT: The crazy reality is that baby food hasn't changed in nearly 100 years. Literally the same unhealthy processed food. And so Little Spoon came about because that didn't make any sense. This is a time in a child's life when the quality of the nutrition matter so much. So we came into the door and develop a fresh organic solution that's delivered right through door or (INAUDIBLE) designed for the modern parents.BARTIROMO: I love this idea. Dagen, you're eating it. How was it?MCDOWELLL: (INAUDIBLE) carrot. Not having had baby good in long. It's vegan and it's just sweet potatoes, carrots and a little bit of lemon juice.BARNETT: There's truly nothing else added it. We used over 80 different ingredients. Make sure a kid easily getting exposed to a variety of different healthy nutrients. And, you know, when you think about this generation and the parents that we're targeting. 80 percent of new parents were now millennial generation. This is the same generation that we've seen disrupt and create billion-dollar companies in every other consumer category.You think of Casper (ph), you think of Morgan Parker (ph). We're doing the same thing but for baby food.PEEK: It's amazing that no one has done -- I mean, wasn't there a movie many years ago --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: It's true. It's amazing --(CROSSTALK)BARNETT: A woman who goes out and makes fresh apple sauce, remember that movie about --BARNETT: Yes. The baby boomer something.PEEK: Yes. Something like that. Anyway, but --BARNETT: It's very cool.(CROSSTALK)FERRIES: There's like 10 people doing this, right? I mean, essentially right now delivering baby food, that's like -- does that help you like raise venture capital that's it's already a space or do you need to be a first move advantage to be worked out because it's the same going with adult delivery food too, it's like, you know, the Blue Apron. There's so many of them. They've all raised so much money. Is that good in general or is that while none of your -- you're not all going to make it kind of thinking?BARNETT: You know, this is a massive opportunity. We think about it's not just baby food, this is serving the modern parent, right? We're talking about every decision a parent is making for their child's health and well- being. Baby food is one of the first decisions that they have to make where the market is really broken or coming in and developing that trusted brand. I mean, we delivered over a million meals in just our first year.And it's exciting because people are trusting us for any solution that they need to ensure their child's healthy.MCDOWELLL: And I'll add this, so I'm tasting. I'm going to put my hand over my face because I have green baby food in my teeth. But avocado, green apple, broccoli and spirulina and I have to say this is really get your -- get a child trained on eating super healthy green vegetables because it's really tasty, it's actually tastier than those sweet potatoes.BARNETT: Yes. You'd be surprised and that is actually one of our best sellers, avocado. I mean, who doesn't like an avocado? But every single blend that we make has intention behind it and actually if you turn over the back of the packaging we include different health badges because parents want to know, are you feeding your child, you know, avocado and spirulina just for fun or what is that serving.And for spirulina, lots of calcium, plant -based protein, avocado, healthy fat, great for brain development. Just makes it super simple and easy to ensure your child's healthy.BARTIROMO: It's exactly what is says it is. This is P.B. chickpea, pear, apple, cumin, avocado oil. I mean, there's no -- nothing else in it. Just this. Hey, this is great idea. Lisa, great to have you on the program.BARNETT: Yes. Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. And the name of the company is Little Spoon, cofounder Lisa Barnett. Coming up, shares of Dropbox taking a nosedive this morning after reporting a disappointing fourth-quarter guidance. The stocks down seven percent. We're going to tell you all about. Then the 5G revolution. I'll be talking with the CEO of Cisco, Chuck Robbins is here weighing in on the race to deliver 5G technology.The future of telecommunication and what it's doing for Cisco. Back in a moment.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Friday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast. Your top stories right now.U.S.-China trade talks. President Trump set to meet with China's Vice Premier at the White House today ahead of the meeting, and the deadline, of course, it's one week away. March 1st is expected to be the deadline where we would see a deal between the China and the U.S. officials. The Dow Industrials are up today, 112 points. There is some optimism that perhaps we're getting close after a memorandum of understanding was put out yesterday in terms of some of the critical issues the two sides are discussing.Dow Industrials up 114 points, S&P 500 is up 10, and the NASDAQ up 30 points right now. The Dow and the S&P 500 fractionally away from their longest winning streak in nearly a quarter century. For the week, the markets have been fractionally lower as you can see this week. In Europe this morning, real momentum on the upside there as well, in particular the European indices are higher across the board. FT-100 up two-thirds of a percent, 46 points, the CAC Quarante in Paris is impairs up 19, and the DAX Index is up 61. Asian markets, for the most part, higher across the board. The Shanghai Composite, the standout, the Chinese market again reacting to what they're expecting to be a deal. Shanghai Composite up almost two percent.There is trouble this morning for Kraft Heinz. Details on the Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into the company that has the stock down 20 percent in the premarket. As you can see, Kraft Heinz shares plummeting right now in the premarket in pretty sizable volume as well. Meanwhile Dropbox and -- also dropping. The cloud service lower after reporting disappointing guidance. As you can see, that stock down about seven percent on the session right now.Our top story this half an hour, the 5G future, Verizon announcing that it will roll out its 5G mobile networks in 30 cities this year, but no word yet on which ones. AT&T also said that it will work on phasing out 3G service entirely in the next few years. Yesterday, I spoke with both AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson, and the Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo. We talked 5G technology and here's a look at what they said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RANDALL STEPHENSON, CEO, AT&T: I have seen a lot of technological innovation in this industry over my 36-year career. I have yet to witness what we're about to see in 5G. This is going to change everything. This becomes -- you talk about a faster network, it's more than that. This is an instantaneous network. No latency is what the technical term is, but it is an immediately responsive network.POMPEO: This technology, this 5G technology, is going to be a wonderful thing and allow data to be transmitted in volumes and the speeds that make what we're doing today which frankly, for some of my generation, feels pretty good, be in the distant past. It's an important technology that will be ubiquitous around the world over some period of time and we have to get this right at the outset.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Also yesterday, President Trump mentioned on Twitter that he wants 5G and even 6G technology in the United States as soon as possible. Joining me right now, in an exclusive FOX Business interview, it is the CEO of Cisco, Chuck Robbins. Chuck, it's great to see you.CHUCK ROBBINS, CEO, CISCO: It's good to see you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. So your router product portfolio, let's talk about that. Are you seeing any impact from the deployment of the initial deployment of 5G?ROBBINS: Well, you -- Maria, you mentioned some of the pilots that are going on with some of our customers, and we're very involved with that. We sell both the technology that actually terminates the -- or actually brings the mobile traffic into the network and into the I.P. network and then clearly, if you think about what's going to happen, the number of high- speed connections at the edge of the network is going to force an increase in capacity in the core, and so that's why we're building a lot of next generation innovation to actually help our customers build out the networks that they're going to need to accommodate all the new volume because the speeds are just going to be unbelievable.BARTIROMO: The -- so is it really that's the story, the speeds will be unbelievable? What else will we see as a result of this 5G rollout? And what's realistic, Chuck? Because I mean there are no 5G phones on the market. I mean this is a 2020 story.ROBBINS: Well, I think what you're seeing this year is you're going to see some of the providers that are going to be piloting these opportunities to deliver 5G to a mobile handset to show what's possible. If you look at -- we did a study and released it earlier this weekend. In 2022, you're going to see more traffic created in that single year than we've seen created the internet to date, the 400 million plus 5G connections, and you're -- what's going to happen is that you're going to see these customers and the large service providers, they're going to need to build out dedicated network infrastructure, 4, 5G because of all the capacity.So when you see speeds at four to five times on a mobile device what we're seeing today, and lower latency so that we can deliver -- latency meaning, you know, how quickly you get responses across the network, allows you to do real-time video applications, really enables new enterprise applications so it is going to be big, and it's going to start this year, and then it's just going to roll for the next few years.BARTIROMO: And that's one part of your business that's going to get a growth boost. You're -- you've seen great growth.ROBBINS: Yes.BARTIROMO: I want to ask you about that. From an organic standpoint, as well as to your software acquisitions, because we've seen revenue momentum grow 24 percent year-over-year in applications, 80 percent year-over-year insecurity. What can you tell us in terms of enterprise spending and really how business is doing right now? I had so many people speculate that things are slowing down.ROBBINS: Yes, well, we're -- on our earnings goal, we said that in our Q2, which ended at the end of January, so we have an odd quarter that, you know, encompasses the first month of the year as well. And we really saw no change in demand from the first of the quarter to the end of the quarter. And that's in light of all the geopolitical dynamics frankly. And our federal business grew double digits even with the shutdown. And we saw broad-based strength around the world. Now we've said with everything going on, all of that could change, yes, at any moment in time. But during the quarter, we didn't see anything. We saw consistent demand.BARTIROMO: And so you still feel like things are elevated in terms of growth in the U.S. economy based on enterprise spending?ROBBINS: Well, everything that you hear says that things are getting worse or slowing.BARTIROMO: Right.ROBBINS: Slowing a bit. We talked about this a little in Davos. But, you know, what we saw in our last quarter, we saw pretty consistent growth. Now what -- our customers, if you think about where they are today, they don't view this technology as, you know, some operational enabler of their strategy anymore, they actually -- the technology is sitting in the middle of their strategy because their strategy is actually defined by what the technology makes possible. So, it's -- there's a little different perspective I think right now versus, say, a decade ago as how our customers think about this technology and how critical it is to them going for.BARTIROMO: And I guess the government part of the business has to be hotter than ever right now given the security concerns. You said that you grew the security business, government business, even during the shutdown.ROBBINS: Well, our global public sector bookings last year grew 18 percent, I think. It was high teens and it was consistent around the world, so it was -- we see governments around the world looking at -- how do I take this technology and deliver citizen services more effectively. How do I drive productivity? For the longest time, governments were somewhat, you know, reluctant to talk about productivity --BARTIROMO: Yes.ROBBINS: -- because that translated to jobs. But now, we see governments around the world that are embracing the productivity improvements that the technology brings.BARTIROMO: And we're talking about the U.S. government and the Chinese government now for a moment because President Trump is meeting with the Chinese --ROBBINS: Uh-hmm.BARTIROMO: -- Vice Premier this afternoon at the White House. And this issue about finishing up a high level trade negotiation week ahead of the March 1st in line, is front and center, but security is really a big part of this because it's not just about trade, it's about Huawei, it's about the telecom and the threats to national security. Mike Pompeo, the Secretary State of State, was here yesterday. Here's what he said.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: Europe is pushing back on this idea that President Trump and you're your administration wants to ban or potentially stop, slow down the use of Huawei. Is that what -- is that what you found in Europe?POMPEO: We've been out around the world, just making sure everybody had the same information that countries understand the risk of putting this Huawei technology into their I.T. systems. We can't forget these systems were designed by --with the express work alongside the Chinese PLA. They're a military in China, they are creating a real risk for these countries, and their systems to the security of their people.If a country adopts this and puts it in some of their critical information systems, we won't be able to share information with then. We won't be able to work alongside them.(END VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: I think that was stunning, what he just said. That we might not be able to share information with our partners, our friends in Europe if they're using Huawei technology or telecom, Huawei is your competitor.ROBBINS: Uh-hmm. They are.BARTIROMO: What's the impact at Cisco?ROBBINS: Well, look, the reality is, is that this issue is between the Government of United States, and the -- and other governments around the world. They have to make their decisions about how they feel about the security of any technology, our technology and others.And what we're focused on really is driving innovation that is going to really differentiate us and I have incredible confidence in our innovation right now, and our ability to win independent of any of this --BARTIROMO: Right.ROBBINS: -- in the system. I --BARTIROMO: No, you've got the leadership position of course.ROBBINS: And we -- and we've talked -- we've talked on our earnings gold that right now, we're at a moment in time where I think we have the most robust innovation across our entire portfolio that we've had in a very, very long time. So, we'll continue to compete. We're not, you know, paying a lot of attention to this. Although I get asked about it a lot.BARTIROMO: Yes.ROBBINS: And we're continuing to just do what we do.BARTIROMO: I understand, but you've got to be able to see market share gains at some point, and businesses and even governments across the world are questioning Huawei telecom that there's espionage there. Have you gotten market share gains yes --ROBBINS: Yes, I would -- I would --BARTIROMO: -- as a result of this yet?ROBBINS: I would say that we have not seen any material movement --BARTIROMO: OK.ROBBINS: -- based on it.BARTIROMO: Cisco yesterday posted a total of 15 security updates for some of its products. I want to ask you about this.ROBBINS: Yes.BARTIROMO: Because two of those vulnerabilities allowed attackers to gain root access to a device, another bypass authentication altogether. How are you dealing with what seems like a constant, never-ending breach story?ROBBINS: Uh-hmm.BARTIROMO: I mean cyber intrusions.ROBBINS: Right. Well, you know, first of all, we actually block 20 billion threats on a daily basis for our customers today. But in our portfolio, anytime you're driving the level of innovation we're driving, whether it's us or other technology companies, there are always going to be issues, there are always going to be vulnerabilities that are introduced because this is incredibly complicated, what we're doing. And the key is when you find something is transparency, moving quickly, getting patches out to your customers, and we did all that.This was -- this week was a very normal process that we had in place that we use when we find these vulnerabilities. I mean you have millions and millions of lines of code, so we all do the best we can. And when you find things, you fix them --BARTIROMO: Yes, and -- exactly.ROBBINS: -- and you tell your customers.BARTIROMO: But I mean --ROBBINS: That's it.BARTIROMO: -- are you seeing more and more of that today because of the cyber intrusions and the -- I mean has it picked up?ROBBINS: No, I don't -- not on our -- not on our products.BARTIROMO: No, not on your products.ROBBINS: Not on internal.BARTIROMO: But I'm saying in general, the --ROBBINS: Oh, of course. We're seeing -- the volume is -- the threat surface is increasing so --BARTIROMO: Right.ROBBINS: -- as we continue, you know, IoT, and 5G, and all of this new conductivity that's occurring, the threat surface is just getting bigger.BARTIROMO: Yes.ROBBINS: Which gives just more targets and so, yes, everyday it's increasing.BARTIROMO: Chuck, it's great to have you on the program.ROBBINS: It's great to be here. Thanks.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Chuck Robbins is the CEO at Cisco and he will be my special guest this weekend on Wall Street, so we'll see you then.ROBBINS: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Coming up, taxing the rich, hitting new records, the top one percent of income earners pay even more of the total tax bill. Stuart Varney wants to weigh in on that. And then trouble for Kraft Heinz. The stock is tanking today after reports that the SEC is probing the firm. Back in a moment with that, 26 percent lower on Kraft Heinz right now. Stay with us. Wow. Not --BARTIROMO: Well, Democrats are pushing for more taxes on the rich even though they now shoulder most of the financial burden. Joining us now the host of "VARNEY & CO.", Stuart Varney. Good morning, Stu.STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria. I've been pouring through the tax records at the Tax Policy Center and guess what? The top one percent of income earners, no, they don't pay 38 percent of all taxes, they don't pay 40 percent of all taxes, that's what I thought, no, the top one percent pays 43 percent of all federal income tax. That's the narrow concentration of taxpayers just the top one percent. I don't know how many thousands there are, but it's not that many. They pay 43 percent --BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.VARNEY: -- of all income. And by the way, the top 20 percent of income earners pays 87 percent of all income taxes at the federal level. Now I know we've had statistics like this before, but clearly, payment of taxes now being more and more concentrated among the rich and that coincides with precisely the same time with the Democrats demanding more and more from the rich.BARTIROMO: Right.VARNEY: You know, something's got to give here --BARTIROMO: I know.VARNEY: -- because you ain't going to get the money for all these special programs by taxing the rich even more.BARTIROMO: Right.VARNEY: It's not going to happen.BARTIROMO: Yes, no, I -- I'm with you. I'm with you, Stu. I mean we see these numbers and it's just mindboggling. So --VARNEY: Crazy.BARTIROMO: -- I mean what's the answer to lifting those on the bottom of the scale?VARNEY: Good question.BARTIROMO: Because this is the question --VARNEY: Yes.BARTIROMO: -- that keeps coming up.VARNEY: Yes.BARTIROMO: And you would think that the Democrats and the Republicans would both agree that capitalism in the free markets lift people from poverty.VARNEY: Yes. And that is absolutely accurate. That's how you lift people out of poverty. I would point out that under the Trump growth era that super -- that nonsupervisory workers' wages are growing faster than supervisory workers' wages.BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.VARNEY: So that is lifting the very bottom --BARTIROMO: Yes.VARNEY: -- more rapidly than it's lifting Middle America.BARTIROMO: Right.VARNEY: And I guess that's the -- but to completely get rid of the extremes of income inequality, I don't have an answer.BARTIROMO: Yes.VARNEY: Just don't have it.BARTIROMO: Well, look, I mean we're going to be watching this, and I know you're going to have a lot more in ten minutes, Stu.VARNEY: Sure. We will. I promise.BARTIROMO: "VARNEY & CO." begins top of the hour, 9:00 a.m. Eastern right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA. Join Stuart. First though, shares of Dropbox taking a decline today after reporting disappointing fourth quarter guidance. We'll break down those numbers as we watch the stock down about six percent.Then big trouble for Kraft Heinz today. That stock is tanking after reports of the SEC probe, stock is down 26 percent, back in a minuteBARTIROMO: Welcome back. Kraft Heinz shares are sliding ahead of the open. You're talking about a 25 percent selloff. Deirdre Bolton on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange looking at this.DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER: Yes.BARTIROMO: This is going to be the story stock of the day, Deirdre.BOLTON: It definitely is, Maria. It is tanking premarket, as our viewers can see. Three key headlines that are moving in, one the company missing sales and revenue for the fourth quarter. So, below expectations. The company trimming its dividends as it seeks to strengthen its balance sheet. Most importantly, it has disclosers received a subpoena from the SEC, part of an investigation to the procurement of accounting policies. Long story short, it made sales look stronger than they were. Kraft Heinz says it is addressing that issue.We're also watching Ford, lower as well, premarket hiring outside investigators to try to examine fuel economy and testing procedures and this is actually a request coming from employees. You remember the scandal Volkswagen had of course using those so-called defeat devices to make the cars look a little bit more fuel-efficient than they were. Ford is saying this is the case, this is not even a possibility, but employees did ask for it to take a look at some of the testing procedures so they are doing that.Dropbox down as well. So the company actually beat the street for its quarterly earnings posting a disappointing outlook statement. And as we know, that is more important sentiment than anything. And for those who don't know Dropbox, it essentially is a cloud-based application and it competes with a lot of bigger users like Apple, Google, Microsoft. So, the company's saying the outlook is not what Wall Street had hoped. Maria, three key stories here from the New York Stock Exchange. Back to you in the meantime.BARTIROMO: All right, Deirdre. Thank you so much.BOLTON: True.BARTIROMO: Quick break and then some final thoughts from this all-star panel. Back in a minute. Liz Peek and Jonas Max Ferris back on FOX Business later today nu the way. Catch them on "BULLS & BEARS" 5:00 p.m. Eastern with David Asman. You won't want to miss that. But we'll hear from them first right after this.BARTIROMO: All right. It is not a good morning for Kraft Heinz, writing down the value of Kraft (INAUDIBLE) by 15-1/2 billion, cutting the dividend. And then there's that SEC investigation, Jonas.FERRIS: I think it's the (INAUDIBLE) it goes back to financial engineering in the 80s era. But the real story is that the internet is destroying certain brands. They don't Instagram well. It -- the actually house caprice on its guest like you just had on, delivering an artisanal authenticity product, it just doesn't work with the Kraft lineup.BARTIROMO: Wow. All right. Well, there you go. Any thoughts? Final -- real quick. Real quick.PEEK: Last thought would be I'm worried about auto tariffs and the possible trade battle with Europe. We don't need it. And I hope they don't go there.BARTIROMO: I think Dagen agrees with you. Hey, have a great weekend, everybody.MCDOWELL: You, too, Maria Bartiromo.BARTIROMO: Good to see you.PEEK: Thank you.BARTIROMO: "VARNEY & CO." begins right now. Stuart, take it away.VARNEY: All right. Maria, good morning to you.Load-Date: February 22, 2019End of Document

China Lithium Battery Cathode Material Markets 2019-2023: Development Environment, Supply & Demand, Competition, Development of LFP, LCO, LMO, NCM and NCA, Market Dynamics & Future ProspectsPR NewswireFebruary 18, 2019 Monday 2:30 PM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1292 wordsDateline: DUBLIN, Feb. 18, 2019 BodyPR NewswireThe"Research Report on China's Lithium Battery Cathode Material Industry, 2019-2023"report has been added toResearchAndMarkets.com'soffering.In 2017, the sales volume of new energy vehicles totaled 777,000 units, increasing by 53.3% YOY and accounting for 2.7% of the total vehicle sales in China. As the new energy vehicle market expands rapidly, lithium-ion batteries, especially lithium-ion power batteries, has also seen exponential growth in China.Critical to the performance of lithium-ion batteries, cathode materials are the major sources of the lithium ion in commercial lithium-ion batteries. Their performance and prices have a great impact on lithium-ion batteries.By chemical composition, lithium battery cathode materials are classified into lithium cobalt oxide (LCO), lithium iron phosphate (LFP), lithium manganese oxide (LMO) and ternary materials including lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide (NCM) and lithium nickel cobalt aluminum oxide (NCA).According to this analysis, cathode materials have different applications in China. The direct consumers of lithium battery cathode materials are lithium battery manufacturers. With distinctive advantages and disadvantages, LCO, LMO, LFP and ternary materials are applied in different downstream industries. LMO and LCO are mainly used in the batteries for consumer electronics while ternary materials and LFP are mainly used in the power batteries for new energy vehicles including electric vehicles.This market survey shows that LCO, LFP and ternary materials are the mainstream of the cathode materials in China. LMO has good cycle performance and rate discharge performance at normal temperature but it has poor high-temperature performance. Therefore, LMO is mostly used in mobile phones, tablet computers and other digital products but seldom used in power batteries. Because of high technical barriers, the production capacity of NCA concentrates in Japan and South Korea. NCA sees little production and application in China though it is known for the electric vehicles of Tesla. The mainstream ternary material in China is NCM.According to this analysis, China's lithium battery cathode material market is highly concentrated. In 2017, the top 10 manufacturers of lithium battery cathode materials contributed more than 60% production volume in total. Hunan Shanshan Energy Technology Co., Ltd., GEM Co., Ltd., BTR New Energy Materials Inc. and Xiamen Tungsten Co., Ltd. have great advantages on the market.According to this market survey, with the development of the cathode material market, the demand for raw materials such as lithium carbonate, nickel, cobalt and manganese has been growing. As a result, the prices of these raw materials showed an upward trend from 2013 to 2018. For example, the prices of cobalt rose from about 204,000 CNY/ton in 2013 to 535,800 CNY/ton in 2018. However, the prices of cathode materials showed different trends. From 2013 to 2018, the prices of NCM, LCO and LMO all increased except that the prices of LFP decreased.If the sales volume of new energy vehicles in China exceeds 2 million units in 2020 and 5 million units in 2025 as planned by the Chinese government, China's cathode material market will maintain rapid growth from 2019 to 2025.Topics Covered:Development environment of China's lithium battery cathode material industry Supply of and demand for lithium battery cathode materials in China Competition in China's lithium battery cathode material industry Development of LFP, LCO, LMO, NCM and NCA in China Major factors influencing the development of China's lithium battery cathode material industry Prospect of China's lithium battery cathode material industry from 2019 to 2023Key Topics Covered:1 Overview of Lithium Battery Cathode Material Industry1.1 Definition of Lithium Battery Cathode Materials1.2 Classification of Lithium Battery Cathode Materials1.2.1 Lithium Cobalt Oxide (LCO)1.2.2 Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP)1.2.3 Lithium Manganese Oxide (LMO)1.2.4 Lithium Nickel Cobalt Manganese Oxide (NCM)1.2.5 Lithium Nickel Cobalt Aluminum Oxide (NCA)1.3 Overview of Industry Chain of Lithium Battery Cathode Materials1.4 Methodology2 Analysisof Global Lithium Battery Cathode Material Industry2.1 Global Supply of Lithium Batteries2.2 Global Demand for Lithium Batteries3 Analysis of China's Lithium Battery Cathode Material Industry3.1 Development Environment of China's Lithium Battery Cathode Material Industry3.1.1 Economic Environment3.1.2 Policy Environment3.1.3 Technological Environment3.2 Supply of Lithium Battery Cathode Materials in China3.2.1 Production Volume of Lithium Battery Cathode Materials in China3.2.2 LFP3.2.3 Ternary Materials3.2.4 LCO3.2.5 LMO3.3 Demand for Lithium Battery Cathode Materials in China3.3.1 Major Consumers of Lithium Battery Cathode Materials in China3.3.2 Market Size of Lithium Battery Cathode Materials in China4 Analysis of Import and Export of Lithium Battery Cathode Materials in China4.1 Import of Lithium Battery Cathode Materials in China4.1.1 Import of Ternary Materials4.1.2 Import of LFP4.1.3 Import of LMO4.1.4 Import of LCO4.2 Export of Lithium Battery Cathode Materials in China4.2.1 Export of Ternary Materials4.2.2 Export of LFP4.2.3 Export of LMO4.2.4 Export of LCO5 Analysis of Competition in China's Lithium Battery Cathode Material Industry, 2013-20175.1 Barriers to Entry in China's Lithium Battery Cathode Material Industry5.1.1 Raw Material Barriers5.1.2 Technical Barriers5.1.3 Scale Barriers5.2 Competitive Structure of China's Lithium Battery Cathode Material Industry5.2.1 Bargaining Power of Raw Material Suppliers5.2.2 Bargaining Power of Consumers5.2.3 Internal Competition5.2.4 Potential Entrants5.2.5 Substitutes6 Analysis of Manufacturers of Lithium Battery Cathode Materials in China6.1 Rankings of Manufacturers of Lithium Battery Cathode Materials in China6.1.1 Manufacturers of LFP6.1.2 Manufacturers of Ternary Materials6.1.3 Manufacturers of LCO6.1.4 Manufacturers of LMO7 Analysisof Costs and Prices of Lithium Battery Cathode Materials in China, 2013-20177.1 Costs of Lithium Battery Cathode Materials in China7.1.1 Price Trend of Lithium Carbonate, 2015-20187.1.2 Price Trend of Nickel, 2015-20187.1.3 Price Trend of Cobalt, 2013-20187.1.4 Price Trend of Manganese, 2013-20187.2 Prices of Lithium Battery Cathode Materials in China7.2.1 Prices of LFP7.2.2 Prices of LMO7.2.3 Prices of Ternary Materials7.2.4 Prices of LCO8 Forecast on Development of China's Lithium Battery Cathode Material Industry, 2019-20238.1 Factors Influencing Development of China's Lithium Battery Cathode Material Industry8.1.1 Major Driving Forces and Market Opportunities8.1.2 Threats and Challenges8.2 Forecast on Supply of Lithium Battery Cathode Materials in China8.3 Forecast on Demand for Lithium Battery Cathode Materials in ChinaCompanies MentionedBTR New Energy Materials Inc.

Wine Import in China, 2019: Analysis & Forecasts Through 2013-2023 - ResearchAndMarkets.comBusiness WireMarch 14, 2019 Thursday 2:30 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Business Wire, Inc.Distribution: Business EditorsLength: 929 wordsDateline: DUBLIN BodyThe "Research Report on Wine Import in China, 2019-2023" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.According to this market survey, there is neither well-developed wine culture nor well-known wine brands on the Chinese market.Most Chinese consumers find it difficult to identify the types and grades of wines. Therefore, low-end imported wines prevail in China. Some inferior wines are even sold at high prices by the advantage of marketing techniques.China's wine market will become standardized as consumers grow more mature and the market is better regulated. But it may take 5 to 10 years or longer. It is important for wine importers to select brands and products suitable for the Chinese market and spread consumption concept in a way acceptable to Chinese consumers.Market SummaryWith the improvement of living standards and the change of lifestyle, the demand for wine in China keeps increasing. China is the fifth largest wine consumer in the world. The fixed wine consumer groups in China are no longer limited to the middle class and the well-heeled.An increasing number of young people are starting to drink wine, and some middle-aged and elderly people are becoming wine drinkers for health reasons. At official banquets and business dinners, the consumption of Chinese spirits far exceeds that of wine but the gap in market share is narrowing.The development of e-commerce boosts wine sales in China - and consumer groups vary greatly in preference and purchasing power. The output volume and quality of domestic wine can hardly be improved, and wine making costs more in China than in other countries, which pushes up the import volume of wine in China.Many Chinese wine producers repackage imported bulk wine to produce a wine of their own brands. As the Chinese government has no special restrictions on wine import, the number of wine importers in China stays above 5,000 in recent years.According to this analysis, the import volume of wine in China reached 729.68 million liters in 2018. It decreased as compared to 2017 but increased by about 80% as compared to 2013.About 20% of China's wine imports are bulk wine in containers holding more than 10L, and the rest are bottled wine in containers holding 10L or less. In 2018, the import value of wine in China reached USD 3.91 billion, increasing by about 6.5% as compared to 2017.France was the largest source of China's wine imports. The value of China's wine imports from France was about USD 1 billion in 2018, decreasing by nearly 9% YOY.Australia was the second largest source of China's wine imports. The value of China's wine imports from Australia was about USD 700 million in 2018, decreasing by 3.5% YOY.Chile was the third largest source of China's wine imports. The value of China's wine imports from Chile was about USD 340 million, increasing by 4.5% YOY.In 2018, the average import price of wine in China was lower than 6 USD/liter, which shows that China's wine imports are mostly medium-to-low end products.Key Topics• Economic and policy environments of wine import in China• Wine import in China from 2013 to 2018• Major sources of China's wine imports• Product segments and prices of wine imports• Major wine importers in China• Forecasts on wine import in China from 2019 to 2023List of Topics Covered1 Overview of the Wine Industry1.1 Definition of Wine1.2 Classification of Wine1.3 Industry Chain of Wine2 Development Environment of China's Wine Industry2.1 Economic Environment2.2 Policy Environment2.3 Social Environment3 Analysis on Supply of and Demand for Wine in China3.1 Analysis on Supply of Wine in China3.2 Analysis of Demand for Wine in China3.2.1 Wine Consumer Groups in China3.2.2 Consumption Volume of Wine in China4 Wine Import in China, 2013-20184.1 Analysis on Scale of Wine Import in China4.1.1 Import Volume of Wine in China4.1.2 Import Value of Wine in China4.2 Analysis of Average Import Price of Wine in China4.3 Analysis of China's Reliance on Wine Imports5 Analysis of China's Wine Imports by Type5.1 Analysis of Bottled Wine Import in China5.1.1 Sources of China's Bottled Wine Imports5.1.2 Import Volume of Bottled Wine in China5.1.3 Import Value of Bottled Wine in China5.1.4 Average Import Price of Bottled Wine in China5.2 Analysis of Bulk Wine Import in China5.2.1 Sources of China's Bulk Wine Imports5.2.2 Import Volume of Bulk Wine in China5.2.3 Import Value of Bulk Wine in China5.2.4 Average Import Price of Bulk Wine in China5.3 Analysis of Sparkling Wine Import in China5.3.1 Sources of China's Sparkling Wine Imports5.3.2 Import Volume of Sparkling Wine in China5.3.3 Import Value of Sparkling Wine in China5.3.4 Average Import Price of Sparkling Wine in China6 Major Wine Importers in China6.1.1 Enterprise Profiles6.1.2 Analysis on Wine Business7 Prospect of Wine Import in China, 2019-20237.1 Factors Influencing Wine Import in China7.1.1 Major Driving Forces and Market Opportunities7.1.2 Threats and Challenges7.2 Forecast on Import Volume of Wine in China7.2.1 Forecast on Total Import Volume7.2.2 Forecast on Structure of Wine Imports7.3 Forecast on Demand for Wine Imports in ChinaFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/4rjvvr/wine_import_in?w=4View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190314005532/en/CONTACT: ResearchAndMarkets.comLaura Wood, Senior Press Managerpress@researchandmarkets.comFor E.S.T Office Hours Call 1-917-300-0470For U.S./CAN Toll Free Call 1-800-526-8630For GMT Office Hours Call +353-1-416-8900Related Topics: Winehttp://www.businesswire.comLoad-Date: March 15, 2019End of Document

Sen. Rubio Issues Remarks at Coalition for Prosperous America's Trade Conference BanquetTargeted News ServiceMarch 12, 2019 Tuesday 7:32 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2008 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe office of Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, issued the following remarks and accepted the American Trade Hero award at the Coalition for a Prosperous America's Annual Trade Conference Banquet for his work on trade and the U.S.-China relationship:Through his roles on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and as Chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, Rubio has worked tirelessly to make the American people aware of the threats the Chinese Government and Communist Party, including state-directed telecom companies like Huawei and ZTE, pose to our national and economic security. Rubio has also long been a leader in advocating for human rights in China. Recently, Rubio released a report on Made in China 2025's implications for small-and medium-sized American businesses and held a hearing on countering the Chinese threat.U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer received the "American Trade Hero" award as well. Rubio and Baldwin introduced the Fair Trade with China Enforcement Act (S. 2), which would safeguard American assets from Chinese influence and possession, and serve to blunt China's tools of economic aggression.Rubio's full remarks as prepared are below and a Facebook live can be viewed here (https://www.facebook.com/SenatorMarcoRubio/videos/413881149369925/)."Thank you all for being here and representing America's manufacturers. What makes us strong as a nation is not just what we can buy, but what we can make. What we can build. What we can produce. Our ability to create is what you, and all the working men and women that are the backbone of these industries, and you embody that here this evening.""You embody the strength of the American economy. And you represent a direct threat to the Chinese government's ambition to reduce us to a nation of consumers instead of producers, a nation that can only purchase the products of the 21st century's high-end industries, instead of making them.""So I thank each of you for what you do and for the critical part you play in creating dignified work, which is the bedrock of our family and community life, and the part you play in securing the future of our prosperity.""I would like to take a few moments to discuss the threat posed by the Chinese Government and Communist Party to America's national and economic security, and how it is instructive of our broader challenge in creating dignified work for all Americans.""Trade normalization with China occurred with the optimistic promise of fair-market access, economic liberalization, and an improvement in Chinese political and human rights.""That didn't happen. China took advantage by playing fast and loose with international trade rules and global norms, to the detriment of American productive capabilities.""After China's accession to the World Trade Organization, we saw what is now called the "China Shock," which was a devastation to American small- and medium-sized manufacturers in concentrated areas throughout the country.""And now we're facing an unprecedented threat to American competitiveness from China's whole-of-society efforts to capture the high-value manufacturing industries of the 21st century.""We have not encountered anything like this, and it is critical we understand the seriousness of the moment.""This challenge is ultimately one of national security, and more fundamentally about whether or not the future of the world will be defined by authoritarianism or by democracy.""If we get this wrong, we will have to explain to the next generation why they didn't get to grow up in the America that we did, the America that led the world in innovation, that created the greatest prosperity in history, and that was a beacon of freedom and opportunity for millions around the world.""We'll have to explain why we have become a second-tier power while the Communist Chinese government--a regime that has no respect for human rights, no respect for free speech or other basic freedoms, no respect for political and religious liberty--dominates everything that matters. A world whose most powerful nation is a one-party authoritarian state instead of a democracy is not a better world.""But more immediately, Chinese economic ambition presents a serious threat to American industry. Through its whole-of-society strategy, the Chinese government is attempting to steal and subsidize and ultimately compete its way to the top of the global production value chain. They want to supplant American industrial leadership by any means necessary, including illegal means.""China's "Made in China 2025" plan outlines a coordinated effort to achieve dominance in critical technological sectors, some of which the U.S. currently leads globally, and all of which will profoundly shape and drive the 21st century economy.""And make no mistake: Whoever controls these technologies not only will control the upper end of the value chain, but also will be able to set the standards and terms of engagement for the rest of the world. And it's clear the Chinese government wants to dictate the terms and conditions of the future of global trade and global technological engagement, and to do so for their own benefit.""This threat to American competitiveness and capacity is a threat to working Americans all across the country, who rely on innovation and investment in our real economy--who rely on our national capacity to make things--in order to find decent and well-paying jobs.""It's a threat to the wages of American workers, and the well-being of American families, and the stability of American communities. It's our job as lawmakers to ensure that U.S. economic policy aligns with our national interests. And nothing is more critical to our national interest than ensuring that the American people can find dignified work.""That's the other question we're going to have to answer for our children: Will they inherit an America where stable, well-paying work is available only to the few, or to the many? Will our country look like the land of shared opportunity that my parents found when they arrived here, or will we become a stagnant nation fighting over how to divide up what little opportunity is left?""I believe our best and brightest days are still ahead. But for that to happen, we must meet the challenge honestly and creatively.""We must choose to prioritize national development, economic dynamism, and small business competitiveness.""We must invest in our own innovative capacity, and ensure we're fighting for high-wage industries, to the benefit of American businesses, workers, and their families.""And we must directly confront China's unfair trade practices.""Ambassador Lighthizer is here this evening. I'm grateful that we have someone serving as U.S. Trade Representative that is standing up for American industry as we negotiate with the Chinese government.""Bringing balance to America's relationship with China is the geopolitical challenge of this century. The fact that we are in a position today to face that challenge so directly is impressive.""The President has done what many thought the U.S. would be unable or unwilling to do: actually stand up to China and force them to the table. The pressure is starting to work. America's new assertiveness has created powerful leverage that could be used to change the behavior of China's government.""This is a massive accomplishment. And it is critical that we make the most of the moment we've created. American negotiators must not waste their leverage by prematurely agreeing to a bad deal.""We must not focus on a handful of individual trade matters at the expense of addressing structural imbalances. To take just one example: China's theft of American IP costs the U.S. almost $600 billion every year. That more than the profits of the top 50 companies on last year's Fortune 500 list.""An improved U.S. trade surplus in soybeans would not be enough. A quick deal to satisfy financial markets would not be enough. China wants to displace the United States in the 21st century - we must hold strong against the political pressures of the short-term.""There is some news emerging recently that Chinese officials are dropping the use of the term "Made in China 2025" in official statements and are considering ending required technology transfers from companies investing in China.""We cannot afford to accept more empty promises.""Until the Chinese Communist government fundamentally alters its goals and methods, the U.S. must stay focused on the critical issues of economic theft and competition.""If we accept a deal that does not bring fundamental structural changes to the U.S.-China economic relationship, we risk losing this century's most important strategic, economic, and geopolitical competition.""This challenge is also why I introduced the Fair Trade with China Enforcement Act (S. 2). This legislation would take a number of steps to ensure that our trade with China is in our own long-term best interests - starting by imposing duties on Chinese capital goods in the sectors targeted by the "Made in China 2025" plan, to ensure that American buyers do not inadvertently finance the long-term displacement of their own country's manufacturing.""It would also impose a tax on Chinese entities that earn investment and dividend income in the U.S., in order to discourage Chinese attempts to price out American exports.""Trade is not the only question in front of us. We need to confront China directly. But ultimately China will not determine the future of American manufacturing for us. We will determine our future for ourselves.""As I said earlier, we need to embrace a policy agenda of national development and economic dynamism that places working Americans and their families at the center.""In today's global economy, high wages for American workers are not inevitable. We know this.""Free markets are an unparalleled force for the creation of prosperity and wealth, but they also produce in response to the policy terms they are given. They produce in response to what we prioritize. And we have too often failed to make the well-being of working Americans the terms for market success.""We like to talk about the status quo as if it's neutral, as if it's simply the result of a natural process. But, for example, prioritizing the growth of financial services instead of advanced manufacturing, like we've been doing for the last few decades, is a decision. It's result of policy choices that we've made. And I think we can make better ones.""For example I think we should stop giving stock buybacks a tax preference. That's the incentive that exists now - the policy choice that exists now.""If we're going to give tax preference to certain behavior, I think it should be for practices that create more jobs with better wages and benefits for American workers. We can do that.""I also think we can find a common-sense, common-ground way to provide paid family leave to working parents. All of this is within our ability. We can put dignified work and healthy families at the center of our policy decisions.""We need to stand up to the Communist Chinese government, in the face of their economic aggression and ambition to capture the 21st century's high-value industries at our expense. We need to ensure they back down and back off trying to win at our expense.""But our economic future is ultimately ours to choose. And I believe we can choose a future that prioritizes American innovation and production, our ability to make quality instead of just buy cheap.""And I believe if we get it right, we'll be doing right by our fellow Americans who rely on industry for decent work, and who rely on policymakers to make them and their families our national priority.""That's why I'm here, and that's why this award is so meaningful to me. I'll continue to fight for you. You continue to make the things that America needs. Thank you."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6647257 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: March 13, 2019End of Document

US charges Chinese tech giant Huawei, top executiveAssociated Press InternationalJanuary 29, 2019 Tuesday 4:57 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 779 wordsByline: By MICHAEL BALSAMO and ERIC TUCKER, Associated PressDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) - The Justice Department unsealed criminal charges Monday against Chinese tech giant Huawei, a top company executive and several subsidiaries, alleging the company stole trade secrets, misled banks about its business and violated U.S. sanctions.In a statement, Huawei denied committing any of the violations cited in the indictment.The charges were announced just before a crucial two-day round of trade talks between the United States and China are scheduled to begin in Washington. Trade analysts say they could dim prospects for a breakthrough.The sweeping indictments accuse the company of using extreme efforts to steal trade secrets from American businesses - including trying to take a piece of a robot from a T-Mobile lab.The executive charged is Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, who was arrested in Canada last month. The U.S. is seeking to extradite her, alleging she committed fraud by misleading banks about Huawei's business dealings in Iran.David Martin, Meng's lawyer in Canada, didn't immediately respond to messages seeking comment. Meng is out on bail in Vancouver and her case is due back in court Tuesday as she awaits extradition proceedings to begin.Huawei is the world's biggest supplier of network gear used by phone and internet companies and has long been seen as a front for spying by the Chinese military or security services."The company denies that it or its subsidiary or affiliate have committed any of the asserted violations of U.S. law set forth in each of the indictments," the company statement said. Huawei is "not aware of any wrongdoing by Ms. Meng," it added, "and believes the U.S. courts will ultimately reach the same conclusion."Prosecutors say Huawei did business in Iran through a Hong Kong company called Skycom and Meng misled U.S. banks into believing the two companies were separate."As I told high-level Chinese law enforcement officials in August, we need more law enforcement cooperation with China," acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker said at a news conference with other Cabinet officials, including Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. "China should be concerned about criminal activities by Chinese companies - and China should take action."The officials provided details from a 10-count grand jury indictment in Seattle, and a separate 13-count case from prosecutors in the Eastern District of New York.Among the accusations, prosecutors say Huawei stole trade secrets, including the technology behind a robotic device that T-Mobile used to test smartphones.Beginning in 2012, Huawei hatched a plan to steal information about T-Mobile's robot, named "Tappy," and Huawei engineers secretly took photos of the robot, measured it and tried to steal a piece of it from T-Mobile's lab in Washington state, according to prosecutors.

US charges Chinese tech giant Huawei, top executiveAssociated Press Financial WireJanuary 29, 2019 Tuesday 4:56 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: WASHINGTON DATELINELength: 779 wordsByline: By MICHAEL BALSAMO and ERIC TUCKER, Associated PressDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) - The Justice Department unsealed criminal charges Monday against Chinese tech giant Huawei, a top company executive and several subsidiaries, alleging the company stole trade secrets, misled banks about its business and violated U.S. sanctions.In a statement, Huawei denied committing any of the violations cited in the indictment.The charges were announced just before a crucial two-day round of trade talks between the United States and China are scheduled to begin in Washington. Trade analysts say they could dim prospects for a breakthrough.The sweeping indictments accuse the company of using extreme efforts to steal trade secrets from American businesses - including trying to take a piece of a robot from a T-Mobile lab.The executive charged is Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, who was arrested in Canada last month. The U.S. is seeking to extradite her, alleging she committed fraud by misleading banks about Huawei's business dealings in Iran.David Martin, Meng's lawyer in Canada, didn't immediately respond to messages seeking comment. Meng is out on bail in Vancouver and her case is due back in court Tuesday as she awaits extradition proceedings to begin.Huawei is the world's biggest supplier of network gear used by phone and internet companies and has long been seen as a front for spying by the Chinese military or security services."The company denies that it or its subsidiary or affiliate have committed any of the asserted violations of U.S. law set forth in each of the indictments," the company statement said. Huawei is "not aware of any wrongdoing by Ms. Meng," it added, "and believes the U.S. courts will ultimately reach the same conclusion."Prosecutors say Huawei did business in Iran through a Hong Kong company called Skycom and Meng misled U.S. banks into believing the two companies were separate."As I told high-level Chinese law enforcement officials in August, we need more law enforcement cooperation with China," acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker said at a news conference with other Cabinet officials, including Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. "China should be concerned about criminal activities by Chinese companies - and China should take action."The officials provided details from a 10-count grand jury indictment in Seattle, and a separate 13-count case from prosecutors in the Eastern District of New York.Among the accusations, prosecutors say Huawei stole trade secrets, including the technology behind a robotic device that T-Mobile used to test smartphones.Beginning in 2012, Huawei hatched a plan to steal information about T-Mobile's robot, named "Tappy," and Huawei engineers secretly took photos of the robot, measured it and tried to steal a piece of it from T-Mobile's lab in Washington state, according to prosecutors.

China is catching up to the US on artificial intelligence researchThe Conversation - United StatesFebruary 27, 2019 Wednesday 11:41 AM ESTCopyright 2019 The Conversation Media Group Ltd All Rights ReservedLength: 1106 wordsByline: Thomas H. Davenport, Professor of Information Technology and Management, Babson CollegeHighlight: A recent executive order from President Trump won't do much to help the US stay ahead of Chinese innovation and investment in AI.BodyResearchers, companies and countries around the world are racing to explore - and exploit - the possibilities of artificial intelligence technology. China is working on an extremely aggressive multi-billion-dollar plan for government investment into AI research and applications. The U.S. government has been slower to act. The Obama administration issued a report on AI near the end of its term. Since then, little has happened - until a            Feb. 11 executive order from President Donald Trump encouraging the country to do more with AI.The executive order has several parts, including directing federal agencies to invest in AI and train workers "in AI-relevant skills," making federal data and computing resources available to AI researchers and telling the National Institute of Standards and Technology to create standards for AI systems that are reliable and work well together. These are all good ideas, but they lack funding and bureaucratic structure. So after researching how large organizations use AI for the past five years, in my view the executive order alone is not likely to            transform the American approach to AI. Government spendingChina is doing far more than talking about AI. In 2017, the country's national government announced it wanted to make the country and its industries            world leaders in AI technologies by 2030. The government's latest venture capital fund is expected to invest            more than US$30 billion in AI and related technologies within state-owned firms, and that fund joins even larger state-funded VC funds.One Chinese state alone has said it will devote $5 billion to developing AI technologies and businesses. The city of            Beijing has committed $2 billion to developing an AI-focused industrial park. A major port, Tianjin, plans to            invest $16 billion in its local AI industry.These government programs will support ambitious major projects, startups and academic research in AI. The national effort also includes using AI in China's defense and intelligence industries; the country's leaders are not reluctant to use AI for social and political control. For example, both AI-driven facial recognition, even to            catch jaywalkers, and "           social credit" - an AI-driven credit score that factors in social behaviors - are already in use.U.S. investment plans, mostly in the defense industry, are dwarfed by the Chinese effort. DARPA, the Defense Department's research arm, has sponsored AI research and competitions for many years, and has a $2 billion fund called "           AI Next" to help develop the next wave of AI technologies in universities and companies. It's not yet clear how much real progress its efforts have made. Private sector contributionsThe U.S. has a strong private sector effort in this technology. There are, for instance, many more AI firms in the U.S. than in China. American investment appears strong, too. In 2015, for example, the combined research and development spending at the U.S.-headquartered companies Google, Apple, Facebook, IBM, Microsoft and Amazon was $54 billion. Much of that spending            went toward AI research, but some of the work            actually happened in China and elsewhere outside the U.S. That work has been used to            personalize ads,            improve search results,            recognize and label faces and generally            make products smarter.In China, the private sector is much more closely tied to government plans than in the U.S. The Chinese government has asked four large AI-oriented firms in China - Baidu, Tencent, Alibaba and iFlytek - to develop AI hardware and software systems to handle autonomous driving and language processing, so other companies could build on those skills.China may have also surpassed the American historic advantage in venture capital investments. In 2018, U.S. AI startups received $9.3 billion in venture funding - a record amount, but the number of deals was down from 2017. However, one report from China suggests that in the first half of 2018, Chinese venture investments - many of which involved AI - were higher than in the U.S. Data from 2017 suggest that            Chinese AI firms received more venture funding than U.S. companies, although the American funding went to many more firms.Beyond investment moneyThere are other factors than investment that determine a country's long-term competitiveness on AI. Talent is an important one. The U.S. had an historical edge in this regard, with strong technical universities, many technology sector employers and relatively open immigration policies. A recent analysis of LinkedIn data suggests that the U.S. has far more AI engineers than China does. But China is closing the gap rapidly, with a variety of            education and training programs beginning as early as elementary school. The Trump administration's            restrictions on immigration are encouraging some of the world's best AI researchers to stay home, rather than come to the U.S.Another element in long-term AI success is how particular regions build mutually reinforcing communities of companies, university ecosystems and government agencies. Silicon Valley is the world leader in this regard, and China doesn't have anything to match it yet. Both the U.S. and China could learn from efforts in Canada, such as the work by the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms, which has offered companies access to facilities, venture capital and university research partnerships to accelerate AI development in that city.A final key element in AI progress is data: The more data a country's companies have, the better able they are to develop capable AI systems. Chinese online firms have massive amounts of consumer data on which to train machine learning algorithms. Because of its very large number of inhabitants, the population's heavy use of digital services and its lax regulatory environment, China clearly beats the U.S. on data.I still think the U.S. has the edge over China in AI capabilities at the moment. However, as much as I would like the U.S. to win this race over the long run, if I were a betting man I would bet on China. As I describe in my new book "The AI Advantage," China is executing its strategy for AI, and the U.S. is still wrestling to create one. China is also reaping the benefits of having a determined government, an inexhaustible pot of money, a growing cadre of smart researchers and a large, digital-hungry population. Perhaps if the leadership of the U.S. government devoted as much attention and investment to AI as it does to its other strong priorities, the U.S. could maintain its lead in the field. That seems unlikely over the next couple of years, however.MIT Press provides funding as a member of The Conversation US.Load-Date: February 27, 2019End of Document

China accuses detained Canadians of stealing state secretsAssociated Press Financial WireMarch 4, 2019 Monday 11:43 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 862 wordsByline: By ROB GILLIES and CHRISTOPHER BODEEN, Associated PressDateline: TORONTO BodyTORONTO (AP) - China accused two detained Canadians on Monday of acting together to steal state secrets, just days after Canada announced it will proceed with a U.S. extradition request for a senior Chinese tech executive.China arrested the two Canadians on Dec. 10 in what was widely seen as an attempt to pressure Canada to release Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies, who was arrested in Vancouver on Dec. 1 at the request of U.S. authorities.Meng's arrest set off a diplomatic furor and has severely strained Canadian relations with China.The U.S. is seeking the extradition of Meng, who is the daughter of Huawei's founder, to face charges she misled banks about the company's business with Iran.China's official Xinhua News Agency cited unidentified Chinese authorities as saying former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig violated Chinese laws by acting as a spy and stealing state secrets and intelligence with the help of Canadian businessman Michael Spavor. It was the first time the two men's cases have been linked.It said Kovrig often entered China using an ordinary passport and business visas, and acquired information from Spavor, his "main contact.""Authorities stressed that China is a country ruled by law and will firmly crack down on criminal acts that severely undermine national security," Xinhua said.The same information was posted on the official news blog of the ruling Communist Party's Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission.No other details were given and Xinhua said further judicial proceedings would "take place based on the case's progress.""We are obviously very concerned by this position that China has taken," Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said. "It is unfortunate that China continues to move forward on these arbitrary detentions."Kovrig is a former diplomat who was working as an expert on Asia for the International Crisis Group think tank. Spavor is an entrepreneur known for contacts with high-ranking North Korean officials, including leader Kim Jong Un.Rob Malley, president of the International Crisis Group, said the accusations against Kovrig are unsubstantiated and unfounded."Michael worked transparently and openly, keeping Chinese authorities informed of what he did and of his mandate: to advise all parties, Beijing included, on steps they could take to resolve and prevent deadly conflict around the world," Malley said."But false accusations aside, the reality is clear for all to see.  The timing of Michael's detention and his citizenship leave little doubt as to why he is being arbitrarily detained.  We continue to hope that China will do the right thing and release him so that he can be reunited with his family."After Meng's arrest, a Chinese court also sentenced a Canadian to death in a sudden retrial, overturning a 15-year prison term handed down earlier. Kovrig and Spavor haven't had access to a lawyer or to their families since being arrested.Canada said Friday that it will allow court hearings for the U.S. extradition request for Meng to proceed.David Mulroney, a former Canadian ambassador to China, said the new allegations against Kovrig and Spavor are a response to that action."Every step in the process will be matched by a step by China. The desire is to raise the raise the pressure to extent that we simply give in," Mulroney said.Meng is due in court on Wednesday to set a date for the extradition proceedings to start. It could be several months or even years before her case is resolvedGuy Saint-Jacques, also a former Canadian ambassador to China, said Beijing is clearly putting additional pressure on Canada."It's a predicable escalation in the crisis," he said. "They are probably hoping it will convince the prime minister to free Meng."Lawyers for Meng, who is staying at a property she owns in Vancouver after her release on bail, said Sunday she is suing the Canadian government, its border agency and the national police force, alleging she was detained, searched and interrogated before she was told she was under arrest.Meng's lawsuit alleges that instead of immediately arresting her, they interrogated her "under the guise of a routine customs" examination and used the opportunity to "compel her to provide evidence and information."Also Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang accused Canada and the U.S. of abusing their bilateral extradition treaty. He reiterated Beijing's demand that Washington withdraw its accusations against Meng.The U.S. has been lobbying its allies to shun Huawei's products on national security grounds, saying Chinese law requires the company to provide the government with intelligence on its foreign clients whenever requested.A Chinese government spokesman took issue Monday with the U.S. claims that Huawei poses a threat to other countries' information security.Spokesman Zhang Yesui said U.S. officials were taking China's national security law out of context and "playing up the so-called security risks" associated with Chinese companies.___Associated Press writer Rob Gillies reported this story in Toronto and AP writer Christopher Bodeen reported in Beijing.Load-Date: March 5, 2019End of Document

Research Report on China's Lithium Battery Cathode Material Industry (2019-2023) - ResearchAndMarkets.comBusiness WireFebruary 18, 2019 Monday 4:56 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Business Wire, Inc.Distribution: Business EditorsLength: 1002 wordsDateline: DUBLIN BodyThe "Research Report on China's Lithium Battery Cathode Material Industry, 2019-2023" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.In 2017, the sales volume of new energy vehicles totaled 777,000 units, increasing by 53.3% YOY and accounting for 2.7% of the total vehicle sales in China. As the new energy vehicle market expands rapidly, lithium-ion batteries, especially lithium-ion power batteries, has also seen exponential growth in China.Critical to the performance of lithium-ion batteries, cathode materials are the major sources of the lithium ion in commercial lithium-ion batteries. Their performance and prices have a great impact on lithium-ion batteries.By chemical composition, lithium battery cathode materials are classified into lithium cobalt oxide (LCO), lithium iron phosphate (LFP), lithium manganese oxide (LMO) and ternary materials including lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide (NCM) and lithium nickel cobalt aluminum oxide (NCA).According to this analysis, cathode materials have different applications in China. The direct consumers of lithium battery cathode materials are lithium battery manufacturers. With distinctive advantages and disadvantages, LCO, LMO, LFP and ternary materials are applied in different downstream industries. LMO and LCO are mainly used in the batteries for consumer electronics while ternary materials and LFP are mainly used in the power batteries for new energy vehicles including electric vehicles.This market survey shows that LCO, LFP and ternary materials are the mainstream of the cathode materials in China. LMO has good cycle performance and rate discharge performance at normal temperature but it has poor high-temperature performance. Therefore, LMO is mostly used in mobile phones, tablet computers and other digital products but seldom used in power batteries. Because of high technical barriers, the production capacity of NCA concentrates in Japan and South Korea. NCA sees little production and application in China though it is known for the electric vehicles of Tesla. The mainstream ternary material in China is NCM.According to this analysis, China's lithium battery cathode material market is highly concentrated. In 2017, the top 10 manufacturers of lithium battery cathode materials contributed more than 60% production volume in total. Hunan Shanshan Energy Technology Co., Ltd., GEM Co., Ltd., BTR New Energy Materials Inc. and Xiamen Tungsten Co., Ltd. have great advantages on the market.According to this market survey, with the development of the cathode material market, the demand for raw materials such as lithium carbonate, nickel, cobalt and manganese has been growing. As a result, the prices of these raw materials showed an upward trend from 2013 to 2018.For example, the prices of cobalt rose from about 204,000 CNY/ton in 2013 to 535,800 CNY/ton in 2018. However, the prices of cathode materials showed different trends. From 2013 to 2018, the prices of NCM, LCO and LMO all increased except that the prices of LFP decreased.If the sales volume of new energy vehicles in China exceeds 2 million units in 2020 and 5 million units in 2025 as planned by the Chinese government, China's cathode material market will maintain rapid growth from 2019 to 2025.Scope• Development environment of China's lithium battery cathode material industry• Supply of and demand for lithium battery cathode materials in China• Competition in China's lithium battery cathode material industry• Development of LFP, LCO, LMO, NCM and NCA in China• Major factors influencing the development of China's lithium battery cathode material industry• Prospect of China's lithium battery cathode material industry from 2019 to 2023Companies Mentioned• BTR New Energy Materials Inc.• GEM Co.

China's Huawei soft power push raises hard questionsAssociated Press Financial WireFebruary 13, 2019 Wednesday 6:28 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 1132 wordsByline: By KELVIN CHAN and ROB GILLIES, Associated PressDateline: TORONTO BodyTORONTO (AP) - Canada's national game - brought to you by China's Huawei.As a nasty diplomatic feud deepens between the two countries over the tech company, involving arrests and execution orders, it hasn't gone unnoticed that Huawei's bright red fan-shaped logo is plastered prominently on the set of "Hockey Night in Canada." TV hosts regularly remind the 1.8 million weekly viewers that program segments are "presented by Huawei smartphones."The cheery corporate message contrasts with the standoff over the arrest of Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. warrant. In what looks like retaliation, China detained two Canadians and plans to execute a third - heavy-handed tactics that, because they leave some Canadians with the impression the privately owned company is an arm of the Chinese government, give its sponsorship a surreal quality.The TV deal is one of many examples of how Huawei, the world's biggest telecom gear producer and one of the top smartphone makers, has embarked on a global push to win consumers and burnish its brand. It sponsors Australian rugb y, funds research at universities around the world, and brings foreign students to China for technical training. It has promoted classical music concerts in Europe and donated pianos to New Zealand schools .Its efforts are now threatened by the dispute with Canada and U.S. accusations that it could help China's authoritarian government spy on people around the world."Huawei's marketing plan up until Dec. 1 (when Meng was arrested) was working very well," said Guy Saint-Jacques, a former Canadian ambassador to China. Now, "public opinion is changing toward China and Huawei."At stake for Huawei are lucrative contracts to provide new superfast mobile networks called 5G. The U.S. says Meng helped break sanctions and accuses Huawei of stealing trade secrets. It also says the company could let the Chinese government tap its networks, which in the case of 5G would cover massive amounts of consumer data worldwide. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo pressed that point to European allies on a tour this week.Huawei, which did not respond to requests for comment for this story, has previously rejected the allegations. The Chinese government says Huawei's critics were fabricating threats.Still, the headlines have been relentlessly negative."At some point there could be a majority of Canadians that will say 'We don't think the government should do business with Huawei,'" said Saint-Jacques.There's no evidence of sinister intentions behind Huawei's marketing, which isn't unlike that of Western multinationals, although its efforts have been unusually strong for a company from China, where brands have struggled to capture global attention.Rogers Communications, which broadcasts "Hockey in Night in Canada" and also sells Huawei smartphones, said it has no plans to change its sponsorship deal, which started in 2017 and runs to the end of 2020.In Australia, the Canberra Raiders rugby team indicated it would renew a Huawei sponsorship deal this year despite a government ban on using its equipment in 5G networks.Huawei has also ventured into high culture by using its smartphone artificial intelligence to complete the remaining movements in German composer Franz Schubert's "Symphony No. 8," known as the "Unfinished Symphony." It held a symphony orchestra concert in London this month to perform the completed score.And Huawei has a vast network of relationships with universities around the world through research partnerships and scholarships. It has helped fund a 25 million pound ($32 million) joint research project at Britain's Cambridge University.Some universities have begun to rethink their collaborations, although there's no allegation of wrongdoing by Huawei. Universities point out that companies that fund research don't automatically own any resulting patents.Britain's Oxford University stopped accepting Huawei's money last month. Stanford University followed suit after U.S. prosecutors unsealed nearly two dozen charges against the company, as did the University of California at Berkeley, which also removed an off-campus videoconferencing set-up donated by Huawei based on guidance from the Department of Defense.Faced with these setbacks, Huawei has responded by stepping up its public relations efforts.Its normally reclusive chairman, Ren Zhengfei, last month held three media briefings, fielding questions from Western, Japanese and Chinese journalists.The company will be out in force this month at the Mobile World Congress, a major telecom industry gathering in Barcelona, Spain. It's expected to unveil its latest smartphone, a 5G device with a folding screen. Company executives are scheduled to brief analysts and give presentations on 5G technology.Huawei is a corporate sponsor of the show and Ren is expected to attend to help win business deals, though U.S. officials are reportedly expected to turn out in force to lobby against Huawei.The company last week hosted a Lunar New Year reception in Brussels for the European Union diplomatic community, in a ballroom commissioned by Belgium's King Leopold II. There was a piano concert, a jazz performance, a bubble tea bar, and a speech by Huawei's chief EU representative, Abraham Liu."We are shocked or sometimes feel amused by those ungrounded and senseless allegations," Liu told the reception guests, adding that the company is "willing to accept the supervision" from governments in Europe, Huawei's biggest market after China. Huawei plans to open a cybersecurity center in Brussels next month, he said.To attract top talent, Huawei runs a program called "Seeds for the Future," under which it sends students from more than 100 countries to China to study Mandarin and get technical training at its headquarters.Shanthi Kalathil, director of the National Endowment for Democracy's International Forum for Democratic Studies, sees Huawei's charm offensive dovetailing with broader efforts by China to influence the global debate on the government's surveillance and censorship it uses."It's not like an afterthought. That is the foundation of the entire system," she said.Whether or not Huawei is linked to the Chinese government or merely defended as a corporate champion, the fight over the company shows how world powers see technology as the front line in the fight for economic supremacy."Today's innovation economy is based on IP (intellectual property) and data," said Jim Balsillie, the former chairman and co-CEO of BlackBerry-maker Research in Motion. "So soft power is the best tool for advancing national interests because the battle is not about armies and tanks."___Chan reported from London.___Follow Kelvin Chan at twitter.com/chanman.

CRU: New Year Present for OEMs - China Relaxes EV Battery RequirementsPR NewswireJanuary 8, 2019 Tuesday 4:00 AM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 563 wordsDateline: LONDON, Jan 8, 2019 BodyPR NewswireThe EV revolution represents a number of significant opportunities for China, and the Chinese government has been keen to stimulate domestic EV production as a result. But while other countries are using incentives and subsidies to encourage the improvement of battery technologies, China gave indications that it would instead use highly punitive measures to encourage manufacturers to improve their energy densities over the coming years. An announcement this week suggests that this may no longer be the case.The growth of the e-mobility sector represents a huge opportunity to the Chinese governmentThe growth in EV usage in China will have a number of far-reaching effects on the country.Reduced smog in cities. China has been battling with dangerous levels of smog and pollution across many major cities. Growth in adoption of EVs would reduce tailpipe emissions, leading to reduced pollution.Growth in domestic vehicle sales. The Chinese vehicle market has historically been dominated by foreign brands like GM, Ford, VW Group, Toyota and Daimler which operate manufacturing plants in the country. While there have historically been a small number of Chinese-owned OEMs, they have never had a substantial market share. The EV revolution is an opportunity for China to build its fledgling auto industry, as EVs are typically cheaper and easier to make than traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles.The potential for an export market. If China can ramp up scale of good quality, high-performance EVs fast enough then it could outpace the plans of foreign OEMs and potentially export vehicles into other regions. This would be a new market opportunity for the country.As a result, the Chinese government has been keen to encourage EV production through a combination of measures.While other countries use carrots, China uses a stickLike other countries, China offers generous subsidies to EV consumers. When considering subsidies offered at a government and a local level, these equate to around $10,000 per vehicle currently - though China does intend to reduce this in the coming years.Read the full story:https://www.crugroup.com/knowledge-and-insights/insights/2019/new-year-present-for-oems-china-relaxes-ev-battery-requirements/Read more about CRU:http://bit.ly/About_CRUAbout CRUCRU offers unrivalled business intelligence on the global metals, mining and fertilizer industries through market analysis, price assessments, consultancy and events.Since our foundation by Robert Perlman in 1969, we have consistently invested in primary research and robust methodologies, and developed expert teams in key locations worldwide, including in hard-to-reach markets such as China.CRU employs over 260 experts and has more than 10 offices around the world, in Europe, the Americas, China, Asia and Australia - our office in Beijing opened in 2004.When facing critical business decisions, you can rely on our first-hand knowledge to give you a complete view of a commodity market.

China Lithium Battery Cathode Material Industry Report 2019-2023GlobeNewswireFebruary 18, 2019 Monday 8:10 AM PTCopyright 2019 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: RESEARCH ANALYSIS AND REPORTSLength: 1272 wordsBodyDublin, Feb.  18, 2019  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The     "Research Report on China's Lithium Battery Cathode Material Industry, 2019-2023"   report has been added to     ResearchAndMarkets.com's  offering.        In 2017, the sales volume of new energy vehicles totaled 777,000 units, increasing by 53.3% YOY and accounting for 2.7% of the total vehicle sales in China. As the new energy vehicle market expands rapidly, lithium-ion batteries, especially lithium-ion power batteries, has also seen exponential growth in China.Critical to the performance of lithium-ion batteries, cathode materials are the major sources of the lithium ion in commercial lithium-ion batteries. Their performance and prices have a great impact on lithium-ion batteries.By chemical composition, lithium battery cathode materials are classified into lithium cobalt oxide (LCO), lithium iron phosphate (LFP), lithium manganese oxide (LMO) and ternary materials including lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide (NCM) and lithium nickel cobalt aluminum oxide (NCA). According to this analysis, cathode materials have different applications in China. The direct consumers of lithium battery cathode materials are lithium battery manufacturers. With distinctive advantages and disadvantages, LCO, LMO, LFP and ternary materials are applied in different downstream industries. LMO and LCO are mainly used in the batteries for consumer electronics while ternary materials and LFP are mainly used in the power batteries for new energy vehicles including electric vehicles. This market survey shows that LCO, LFP and ternary materials are the mainstream of the cathode materials in China. LMO has good cycle performance and rate discharge performance at normal temperature but it has poor high-temperature performance. Therefore, LMO is mostly used in mobile phones, tablet computers and other digital products but seldom used in power batteries. Because of high technical barriers, the production capacity of NCA concentrates in Japan and South Korea. NCA sees little production and application in China though it is known for the electric vehicles of Tesla. The mainstream ternary material in China is NCM. According to this analysis, China's lithium battery cathode material market is highly concentrated. In 2017, the top 10 manufacturers of lithium battery cathode materials contributed more than 60% production volume in total. Hunan Shanshan Energy Technology Co., Ltd., GEM Co., Ltd., BTR New Energy Materials Inc. and Xiamen Tungsten Co., Ltd. have great advantages on the market. According to this market survey, with the development of the cathode material market, the demand for raw materials such as lithium carbonate, nickel, cobalt and manganese has been growing. As a result, the prices of these raw materials showed an upward trend from 2013 to 2018. For example, the prices of cobalt rose from about 204,000 CNY/ton in 2013 to 535,800 CNY/ton in 2018. However, the prices of cathode materials showed different trends. From 2013 to 2018, the prices of NCM, LCO and LMO all increased except that the prices of LFP decreased. If the sales volume of new energy vehicles in China exceeds 2 million units in 2020 and 5 million units in 2025 as planned by the Chinese government, China's cathode material market will maintain rapid growth from 2019 to 2025.Topics Covered:• Development environment of China's lithium battery cathode material industry• Supply of and demand for lithium battery cathode materials in China• Competition in China's lithium battery cathode material industry• Development of LFP, LCO, LMO, NCM and NCA in China• Major factors influencing the development of China's lithium battery cathode material industry• Prospect of China's lithium battery cathode material industry from 2019 to 2023Key Topics Covered:          1 Overview of Lithium Battery Cathode Material Industry1.1 Definition of Lithium Battery Cathode Materials1.2 Classification of Lithium Battery Cathode Materials1.2.1 Lithium Cobalt Oxide (LCO)1.2.2 Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP)1.2.3 Lithium Manganese Oxide (LMO)1.2.4 Lithium Nickel Cobalt Manganese Oxide (NCM)1.2.5 Lithium Nickel Cobalt Aluminum Oxide (NCA)1.3 Overview of Industry Chain of Lithium Battery Cathode Materials1.4 Methodology2 Analysis of Global Lithium Battery Cathode Material Industry2.1 Global Supply of Lithium Batteries2.2 Global Demand for Lithium Batteries3 Analysis of China's Lithium Battery Cathode Material Industry3.1 Development Environment of China's Lithium Battery Cathode Material Industry3.1.1 Economic Environment3.1.2 Policy Environment3.1.3 Technological Environment3.2 Supply of Lithium Battery Cathode Materials in China3.2.1 Production Volume of Lithium Battery Cathode Materials in China3.2.2 LFP3.2.3 Ternary Materials3.2.4 LCO3.2.5 LMO3.3 Demand for Lithium Battery Cathode Materials in China3.3.1 Major Consumers of Lithium Battery Cathode Materials in China3.3.2 Market Size of Lithium Battery Cathode Materials in China4 Analysis of Import and Export of Lithium Battery Cathode Materials in China4.1 Import of Lithium Battery Cathode Materials in China4.1.1 Import of Ternary Materials4.1.2 Import of LFP4.1.3 Import of LMO4.1.4 Import of LCO4.2 Export of Lithium Battery Cathode Materials in China4.2.1 Export of Ternary Materials4.2.2 Export of LFP4.2.3 Export of LMO4.2.4 Export of LCO5 Analysis of Competition in China's Lithium Battery Cathode Material Industry, 2013-20175.1 Barriers to Entry in China's Lithium Battery Cathode Material Industry5.1.1 Raw Material Barriers5.1.2 Technical Barriers5.1.3 Scale Barriers5.2 Competitive Structure of China's Lithium Battery Cathode Material Industry5.2.1 Bargaining Power of Raw Material Suppliers5.2.2 Bargaining Power of Consumers5.2.3 Internal Competition5.2.4 Potential Entrants5.2.5 Substitutes6 Analysis of Manufacturers of Lithium Battery Cathode Materials in China6.1 Rankings of Manufacturers of Lithium Battery Cathode Materials in China6.1.1 Manufacturers of LFP6.1.2 Manufacturers of Ternary Materials6.1.3 Manufacturers of LCO6.1.4 Manufacturers of LMO7 Analysis of Costs and Prices of Lithium Battery Cathode Materials in China, 2013-20177.1 Costs of Lithium Battery Cathode Materials in China7.1.1 Price Trend of Lithium Carbonate, 2015-20187.1.2 Price Trend of Nickel, 2015-20187.1.3 Price Trend of Cobalt, 2013-20187.1.4 Price Trend of Manganese, 2013-20187.2 Prices of Lithium Battery Cathode Materials in China7.2.1 Prices of LFP7.2.2 Prices of LMO7.2.3 Prices of Ternary Materials7.2.4 Prices of LCO8 Forecast on Development of China's Lithium Battery Cathode Material Industry, 2019-20238.1 Factors Influencing Development of China's Lithium Battery Cathode Material Industry8.1.1 Major Driving Forces and Market Opportunities8.1.2 Threats and Challenges8.2 Forecast on Supply of Lithium Battery Cathode Materials in China8.3 Forecast on Demand for Lithium Battery Cathode Materials in China             Companies Mentioned                   • BTR New Energy Materials Inc. • Xiamen Tungsten Co.

Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Live from Switzerland. Good to have you with us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is, Wednesday, January 23rd. Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast. We're looking at a rebound in stocks this morning. Futures indicating a big rally at the start of trading. The Dow Jones Industrials average right now up 170 points, three quarters of one percent.The S&P 500 is up a half percent, 13 points higher as is the NASDAQ with a 33-point move higher on the NASDAQ. This after a sell-off yesterday for stocks as global growth worries and trade concerns weighed on markets. Bank of America chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan weighed in on the economy earlier on the program saying he doesn't see a recession.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BRIAN MOYNIHAN, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, BANK OF AMERICA: You're seeing that grow, you know, that five, six percent in January so far. Eight percent year-over-year from '18 to '17 in terms of cash used and spending. Very strong and unemployment is real low and wages are growing. So everything is, you know, pretty good. It's just slowing down a little bit and everybody saying, oh my gosh, that means it has to go here. It doesn't -- it just can slow down.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Global markets this morning mixed, FT-100 is down 15 points, quarter of a percent but the CAC Quarante in Paris is up a half of percent and the DAX in Germany up a quarter of one percent right now, 30 points higher in Germany. In Asia overnight, fractional moves across the board as you can see. Nikkei Average was a downer but the others up just fractionally.We are watching potentially the end of the shutdown. The Senate will hold votes tomorrow on competing bills to reopen the government. It is still however if either of those bills have enough votes to advance. This comes as President Trump is moving forward with plans for State of the Union this coming Tuesday. Earnings in focus on Wall Street this morning. Procter & Gamble among those reporting. We've got the numbers.Stock is up 4-1/4 quarter percent. $94.25 a share last trade on P&G. All those stories coming up this Wednesday morning and joining me back in New York to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the President Maslansky and Partners, Lee Carter. Good morning, ladies.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria Bartiromo.LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS: Great to see you. Great interviews today.MCDOWELLL: Crushing it.BARTIROMO: Well, look, I mean I think that we are hearing more and more optimism in terms of where we are going with the economy in terms of the global story and it does feel like things are slowing down but certainly not all the hype over a recession.MCDOWELL: And one thing that is really interesting it -- listening to all these CEOs and optimism that you would hear from say Brian Moynihan earlier in the show is that -- from Bank of America, is that CEOs need to be careful how they talk about the economy and -- because if they all get too negative then it actually can create a recession, if it changes their behavior and changes the behavior of the finance chiefs at the companies if they're worried about hiring.If worried about investment. So, they are very cognizant of basically looking at their business instead of listening to other CEOs.BARTIROMO: Yes. That's is true. And of course, the shutdown is another issue. So far not a major impact on the economy. We will see how long that goes on. The President is tweeting this morning on the border wall. And he said this just a few moments ago. Great unity in the Republican Party. One, two, once and for all put end to stoppable crime and drugs, border security, and wall no doubt.He went on to write this. Build a wall and crime will fall. This is the new theme for two years until the wall is finished under construction now of the Republican Party. Use it and pray. Lee Carter, your reaction to President's tweets this morning.CARTER: These tweets are so Trumpian and their simplicity and the focus of the message and it's very clear what his strategy is right now. He is not reaching across the aisle. He is indicating no compromise, he is clearly saying with space, I am standing by my word and I am not going to compromise on this wall and I think really, really interesting that he is still using this language that this is hi focus.You know, the thing that a lot of folks whether you like the President or not, 91 percent Americans right now believe that he is going to stand by what he believes in. And he is making it very clear that this wall is something he believes and is going to be his priority. And as we look at this, I just don't see a path to compromise even though they put DACA on the table, I just don't see how Democrats are going to come around and say I'm going to work with you on this one.MCDOWELL: Can I just add one quick thing on that, Maria? In terms of compromise --BARTIROMO: Please. Yes.MCDOWELL: Democrats feel like that they have gotten a little bit of breathing room and not having to agree to three-year temporary protection for the DACA recipients because the Supreme Court on Tuesday took no action on the Trump administration's request to hear the President's plan cancellation of the program, the expectation is that the protections stay in place for now.The high court, it might be a year or longer before they hear this. And now they -- the Democrats feel like they've got room on this. So they'll have to stand with that, that they don't stand with the DREAMers, they don't stand with giving them even a three-year protection but that Supreme Court decision yesterday not to hear, the President's request is very interesting and place into what's a foot in Washington.BARTIROMO: Yes. That's absolutely right. We will be watching this. And certainly those bills tomorrow will give us the window into where the thinking is. And of course there's -- then there's China, futures pointing higher this morning as investors are awaiting the U.S. and China talks to continue, that next deadline is -- that next meeting is next week on the 31st and then of course they've got a deadline of March 1st.Joining me right now is the CEO of SOHO China, this is the largest prime office real estate developer in China, he is known as the woman who built Beijing, Zhang Xin is joining us this morning. Xin, it's great to see you.ZHANG XIN, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, SOHO CHINA: Good to see you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. Can you give us your assessments of what's happening in China in terms of real estate and the economy there right now?XIN: So, last year we had a -- one of the most challenging years in recent history. Economy -- economic growth slowdown. And I think that's largely to do with the tightening of credit. Last year the focus was on debt constraint and then it came to the fourth quarter, the data is showing, you know, not good. So right away, the Central Bank changed the policy. And so now we're seeing the ease of credit.And I think this year we're going to see tax cuts, plenty of credit and that surely would help the economy on the growth side. And of course, all eyes are on the U.S.-China trade talk. And if that, you know, ends well and that would boost the confidence which is much-needed for China now. And around the globe I think is much-need because we need China continue to grow to contribute to the global growth.BARTIROMO: What do you think about the China-U.S. trade deal? Do you think we will see a deal over the near-term? It feels like both countries really need an agreement.XIN: Yes, yes. I feel like we should reach an agreement. Maybe each side need to make some, you know, compromise but as you say, you know, the world needs it, both sides needs it and I think that without willingness it's hard to see why is that not going to be a deal.BARTIROMO: What about the U.S., you've got a lot of investments in the United States as well, how would you characterize real estate and the activity in the United States right now?XIN: Right now, real estate is soft, you know, generally speak whenever we see interest rate goes up or anticipating the interest rate will go up, asset prices go down and real estate is, you know, capital heavy so that's why real estate prices are heading down and a lot of -- if not done yet buyers are just generally waiting and thinking that the market will go down and that will drive out the transaction. That itself is eventually going to drive the prices down.BARTIROMO: Is that on the commercial side you're referring to or retailer both?XIN: That's generally everything. Well, retail has another headwind which is online shopping that, you know, retailers are not needing as much physical spaces before. But on the office is -- again, you know, softer, asset trading is softer, rent is not necessarily going down but the asset prices because of interest rate about to go up is holding and, you know, not nearly as many transactions this year and the high-end market is definitely soft.BARTIROMO: Do you think that continues in '19? What's your outlook?XIN: I think '19 will be a softer market than last year because, you know, market is anticipating Central Bank, the fact to increase interest rates even though the Central Bank -- I mean the Fed chair came out to be -- seem to be, you know, less certain than before but still that the market anticipation is that the economy is doing so well, almost overheated. Therefore there's got to be some measure to be taken. And if interest rates go up we will definitely see as it goes down.BARTIROMO: Were you happy with the pivot from the Chinese government in terms of now looking to lower taxes in terms of making it easier for developers and easier for people in terms of getting that activity to sustain because I think the last time we spoke, this was a few years ago, couple times ago, there was some moves that the Chinese government were putting in place making it --(CROSSTALK)XIN: Yes.BARTIROMO: Have two homes, et cetera.XIN: Exactly.BARTIROMO: Is this a better for the Chinese government?XIN: So what happened is that when the economy is growing too fast and the government --Chinese government worried about the economy being overheated and they typically will out with measure to control the real estate market because people -- Chinese have such a habit of putting money into real estate, buy real estate and so -- and but -- now they're worrying -- on the other side, you know, the economy slowing down. So then, what does the government do?And, you know, to ease the credit, let the real estate continue and then people will with the credit put money into real estate buying real estate.BARTIROMO: I know I always ask you about your own story, it's so empowering to see you as a woman have succeeded the way you have in China. Is the environments for women conducive to that? How have you done it?XIN: I always find China, you know, sort of business private sector at least is easier environment for Chinese woman, you know, than -- of course, if you look at the Chinese government, the state-owned sectors you don't see very many women, but private sector you see so many women entrepreneurs, self-made, and I think it's because we're in the relatively young economy, so that we don't have -- it didn't have as many gigantic companies there that are just making it harder for women to break the glass ceiling.BARTIROMO: And I guess there is an increasing number of billionaires were female in China.XIN: Yes. Yes. Well self-made.BARTIROMO: And self-made. And here we have world at the World Economic Forum lots of wealth obviously but we're hearing these new proposals from younger lawmakers like 70 percent tax on income. What do you think that would do to the economy?XIN: Well, you know, I'm a Chinese but I'm also a capitalist. You know, I don't know when you put 70 percent of the highest bracket income tax to people with high income. What would really happen to that spirit, you know, that capital spirit and we need the driver, we need people who want to be making that profit and that has to be -- there has to be a driver there for the whole society to perform. Now it's whether you believe in capitalism or not.BARTIROMO: Yes. Final question here, Xin. Where do you see the growth right in the world in terms of sectors? Real estate obviously (INAUDIBLE) but are you seeing other areas that you are looking at as particularly growing sectors?XIN: I think around the world has sustained the growing sector, you know, driver is technology is healthcare is no different in China. You know, China has another leg which is export and also investment. So that on that investment needs credit and so credit easing would help a bit. Export is really depending on this U.S.-China trade talk.BARTIROMO: Yes. For sure. Xin, it's great to have you on the program.XIN: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. Zhang Xin joining us. CEO at SOHO China. The shutdown now in day 33 while the Senate is gearing up for votes tomorrow. it doesn't look like there will be a resolution. Blake Burman is live at the White House with the very latest this morning. Blake, good morning to you.BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Maria, good morning to you as well. That's right. Day 33 here and likely to shut little middle movement. Day 34 tomorrow, the Senate will take up President Trump's proposal but there will probably be little success. The Senate's -- the President proposal rather will be taken up by the Senate, it calls for $5.7 billion in border wall funding. Essentially in exchange for protections for DACA recipients.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: The opportunity to end all this is starring us right in the face all that needs to happen is for our Democratic friends to agree that it's time to put the country ahead of politics, take yes for an answer and vote to put the standoff behind us.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURMAN: Now, seven Democrats would need to side with Republicans but if that does not happen then the measure fails. Democrats are pointing to their own measure that would happen after that, that would call for opening up the government -- opening up the government between now and February 8th.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER: Now the President said his proposal was a reasonable compromise. In fact, it is neither reasonable nor a compromise. Well, now there's a way. And that is the second vote that will occur on Thursday.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURMAN: But the president has said, Maria, that he would not sign that and thus right now you have the stalemate. The President tweeting out this morning "Build a wall and crime will fall." Maria?BARTIROMO: All right, Blake. Thank you so much. Blake Burman is at the White House this morning. Quick break. And then earnings alert. Big names like Comcast, P&G, and United Technologies reporting better than expected earnings this morning. We will break down the numbers when we come right back.And then sweetening the deal, Coca-Cola teams up with Korean boy band BTS for its latest lines of bottles and cans. What Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey had to say about that partnership. Back in a moment.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Some upbeat earnings numbers this morning for the fourth quarter. Cheryl Casone with headlines right now in New York. Cheryl?CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Here we go up until today about eight percent of the S&P reporting. So let's look at Procter & Gamble. Stocks higher in the premarket. They did report better-than- expected quarterly resorts -- results. Look at that, the stock is up more than 4-1/2 percent. Plus an adjusted profit $1.25 a share, revenue 17.4 billion. Strong demand for beauty and fabric care products there.Now let's look at Comcast, higher in the premarket as well up almost four percent right now. They reported an adjusted profit of $0.64 a share. They beat expectations. They added more than 350,000 internet subscribers in the fourth quarter. Revenue, 27.9 billion, again, beating estimates on Comcast.Well, U2 front man Bono who was at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where you are, Maria, speaking out about capitalism. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PAUL DAVID HEWSON, LEAD VOCALIST, U2: Capitalism is not immoral. It's amoral. It requires structure. Capitalism has taken more people as poverty than any other ism, but it is a wildebeest and if not tamed it can chew up a lot of people along the way.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Ok. Well, he also said in those comments that those that who have not benefited from capitalism are driving politics towards populism.Two days ago, Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortz said the capitalist system it allows billionaires to exist is immoral just to add that there.OK. K-pop craze, Coca-Cola has recently launched bottles and cans themed to the Korean boy band BTS with seven different designs. One for each band member. Maria, earlier, you spoke with Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Tell us about the K-pop craze, Coca-Cola recently launching bottles and cans themed to the Korean boy band BTS. Seven different designs, one for each of the band members. This is a big break right now.JAMES QUINCEY, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, COCA-COLA: They look nice. I think they're going to work. It's very -- it's very Korean. But we've done a program around the world of trying to make our packaging interesting (INAUDIBLE) whether it's for the names on or linking with some of the iconic -- the iconic figures like BTS and I think it will be really cool in Korea.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Dagen, look at Coke shares over the last year pretty much flat, Maria. We should also say Super Bowl is going to be in Atlanta and that of course is Coca-Cola country. Appearing there's going to be a lot of installations from Coke on the ground in Atlanta. Back to you.BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl. Thanks so much. Coming up. Technology under the microscope. We are breaking down the industry's impact across the globe. We are talking business and economy with the CEO of Cisco, Chuck Robbins is here, next.And then global growth concerns. Dow Chemical CEO Jim Fitterling weighing in on the impact of trade and the worries there. Back in a moment right here.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Technology among the growth stories of the globe right now in a world where people are unsure of the global growth especially in the face of cybersecurity spend and the privacy issues taking center stage. Joining me right now is the CEO of Cisco, Chuck Robbins. Good to see you, Chuck. Thanks so much for joining us.CHUCK ROBBINS, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, CISCO: Thank you.BARTIROMO: You've got a lot of catalyst on the horizon. 5G security, cloud transition. Tell me how growths look from your standpoint.ROBBINS: Yes. You know, Maria first of all, it's -- the security architectures have to be built with our customers today are much different than what they used to be. You think about none of our customers in this new world have a perimeter anymore. They're all effectively virtual enterprises. So, security has to be built actually into the network using A.I. machine learning, all the things that we like to talk about.So that's a key area for us. And in order to do that, we see our customers having to refresh, and build in new infrastructure that actually can provide that, so that's a big thing to 5G big -- build out, it's a big thing, the early days of IOT are big but there are lots of positives.BARTIROMO: Tell me what you're seeing in terms of growth right now given this dominating theme that we're seeing in global slowdown.ROBBINS: You mean it's like the world is coming to an end?BARTIROMO: Yes. I guess.ROBBINS: I don't know. I thought coming here I thought the world was coming to an end. I was just convinced by all the people. But the reality is, is that, you know, I like others have said, we run risk of talking ourselves into something. I talk to my peers here and, you know, we all are asking each other sort of where this is coming from? And so I think, that clearly there are lots of geopolitical risks primarily.I think clearly a lot of us benefited from the tax reform in '18, so you're going to have tougher comps year over year but everybody has built it in. They know that. These geopolitical risk were actually the biggest ones and I think that most of us remain optimistic that whether it's Brexit or whether it's a shutdown or whether it's trade that those things are going to be resolved because they just need to be resolved.BARTIROMO: Have you seen customers react to the uncertainties in Europe like Brexit, like the Italian budget issues perhaps the issues are in France as well?ROBBINS: Well, I think that as you talked to folks around here, I think many of them have seen, you know, a little bit of a slowing, I'm not talking about our business but a little bit of a slowing in Europe over the last two or three, four quarters. But what they told me is it hasn't been like precipitous. And any time you see Brexit, you've got, you know, the bit of uncertainty in Germany. You've got situation in France, situation in Italy.I mean, you would expect that that might be the case. I actually believe that we should be super impressed with the resilience of the global economy over the last few years in the face of all these things and that's the thing that gives me hope as well as the fact that the underlying reasons that some of these issues need to be solved in a constructive way I think - - I think people who have to solve them understand that.BARTIROMO: So, I know you're reporting earnings next week, you're in the quite -- couple of weeks.ROBBINS: A couple weeks. Yes.BARTIROMO: You're in the quite period but you -- just sounds like you don't see this a slowdown?ROBBINS: Well --BARTIROMO: Particularly in the U.S.ROBBINS: Well, we just see -- if you go back to last quarter, we grew eight percent last quarter. So what? I don't know, did something happen last 90 days? I mean, it was like the fastest growth quarter we've seen in years and years and years. So I think that -- the other thing that we believe is if you go back before the last, you know, the financial crisis, if you look at the role of technology particularly in a business to business world and we tend to focus so much on consumer technology that we don't talk about this a lot.If you look at the role that business technology is playing, 10, 12 years ago our customers would build their strategy and then they would turn to their operations teams, their technology teams and they would say, do what you need to do to enable our strategy. And today, they're building their strategy based on their understanding of what technology allows them to do. So, technology is at the core of how they evolve their strategy, so it's not a -- it's a not an operational enabler, it's not an -- something that -- well, we just need to stop spending right now.It's a part of their business. So, I think that we, you know, my belief is that tech could see less, we'll see if it plays out. We could see of a potential, you know, precipitous fall-off as we've seen in other earlier slowdowns. Even though I'm not suggesting we're in a slowdown.BARTIROMO: Chuck, let me -- let me switch gears and ask you a bit about China in particular, Huawei because there is a lot of folks on Huawei, obviously the CFO detained initially because of espionage. Has Huawei -- I know you have common lines of businesses with Huawei, right? Has Huawei stolen trade secrets from Cisco?ROBBINS: Well, first of all, I mean, they are our biggest competitor on a global basis. And I'll just say what I know about the situation same thing that everybody else knows that what we read but we had a -- we had a suit back in the early 2000s, like -- literally like 2002, 2003. And so we'll skip to that. I mean, I have no knowledge of anything occurring. So what we focus on around the world with them or any other competitor is really delivering on, you know, significant innovation to actually help our customers achieve what they're trying to achieve and that's what we focus on.BARTIROMO: it seems to me that given the worries about spying at Huawei, it's -- I mean, if a customer has to choose they're probably going to choose Cisco.ROBBINS: Well, I think look, every customer around the world right now, they're making technology decisions based on innovation, based on customer support, based on -- but they're also making a base on trust and that's no different whether they're looking at -- we're talking about some of the social platforms or we're talking about companies like Cisco, I mean, that is an element when you think about privacy and you think about data and everything, it has become a much more important decision factor for our customers.So we focused on trying to just ensure that our customers feel as good as they can possibly feel about how we operate with them and what -- how we take care of them in these areas.BARTIROMO: But what are you doing specifically in terms of protecting the data? Your business is critical to so many companies in this environment where they're afraid of espionage.ROBBINS: Yes. We actually have very few elements of our portfolio where we capture our customer's data and we have zero where we monetize our customer's data. So, where we do, in some of collaboration products, we actually -- we comply with GDPR. In many cases, we host it in a country if that's what our customer -- our countries are asking us to do. So, we're just actually working with them. The other thing we're trying to do, frankly, is if you're a -- if you're in government today, and your task is to regulate or drive policy in this rapidly changing technology world, I have tremendous empathy for them. I mean that is a very hard thing to do, particularly when technology's not what they do for a living, so we're trying --BARTIROMO: And government's about 20 percent of your business?ROBBINS: It's probably a little more than that, globally. But it is -- but the issue is that we're trying to spend time with them to the extent they want help to -- so they can understand this -- these issues a little more, they can understand the implications of the different policies that they're considering, and we're trying to create a level of trust with them so that we can actually help them work through because it's a implicated situation.BARTIROMO: Real quick on the cloud. You're seeing a lot of transition there from your customers. How significant is that business for you in terms of growth?ROBBINS: Yes. It's funny. I actually said a few months ago that, if you go back five years, the cloud was going to be death of us, and in the irony of all ironies, the cloud is actually driving our growth today, and so what we see happening is that our customers are consuming cloud services from IBM, from Google, from Amazon, from Microsoft, they're consuming software applications from workday and sales force and others.BARTIROMO: Right.ROBBINS: And so the underlying hypotheses that they used to build their original technology infrastructure, completely gone. Their traffic is going everywhere. And they got IoT, so they're having to restructure and reconstruct their infrastructure to actually accommodate that world which is where we come in. So --BARTIROMO: Chuck, it's good to have you on the program.ROBBINS: It's great to see you. Thank you.BARTIROMO: Thanks so much. Chuck Robbins is the CEO of Cisco. We'll be right back.ANNOUNCER: Here again is Maria Bartiromo with a special edition of MORNINGS WITH MARIA live from Davos, Switzerland at the World Economic Forum.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. It is Wednesday, January 23rd, we are coming to you live from Switzerland. Your top stories right now 8:35 a.m. on the East Coast.Markets are rebounding this morning. Take a look at futures indicating a gain at the start of trading. This is off of the best levels of the session, but, nonetheless, we're looking at a gain of 158 points on the Dow, two-thirds of one percent, the S&P 500's up 10-1/2, and the NASDAQ is up 25, about a third of a percent higher after weakness yesterday.Earlier in the program, I spoke with Bank of America's CEO, Brian Moynihan, who says he doesn't see a global recession coming at all.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MOYNIHAN: Well, let's start with what our experts predict, we have the top researcher firm in the world and they have done a great job and they have the U.S. growing at 2-1/2 percent this year, the world growing 3-1/2 percent GDP growth, but that's down from last year, and so the confusion in the environment right now is, is it a slowdown or is it going into recession? Nothing we see says it's close to recession.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Nonetheless, investors were concerned yesterday about global growth and trade. The White House is denying reports that they rejected trade meeting set this week with Chinese officials. There is a major meeting that has been on the calendar set for January 31st. That is in place. We are waiting to see what comes out of it. European indices this morning are mixed. Take a look. The FT-100 right now is down 20 points, the CAC Quarante in Paris is up 20, and the DAX Index in Germany up 26, a quarter of a percent higher. Asian markets overnight, flat, take a look. Fractional moves here across the board.It is, however, standoff day 33. The Senate is set to vote on two bills tomorrow to end longest government shutdown in history in the U.S. They are likely nonstarters since they probably will not get enough votes to advance, according to insiders. President trump is moving forward meanwhile with plans for the State of the Union on Tuesday, and we're watching earnings. Some big name reporting this morning. We heard from Comcast, Procter & Gamble, Kimberly-Clark, as you can see, those stocks, across the board, are higher. Kimberly-Clark was a miss, but UTX is up four percent. P&G up almost five percent, and Comcast this morning up almost three percent. We'll take you behind all those numbers coming up.A bit of a crude awakening, the price of crude oil headed higher this morning. We're taking a look at the demand, and what demand will bring to crude prices this year. Now oil standing at $53.16 a barrel. Our top story this half an hour, trade sensations with China, investors are awaiting on this big meeting between the U.S. and China delegation next week. The trade uncertainty a key issue for business leaders since the tariffs went into effect. Joining me right now is the CEO of Dow, Jim Fitterling, to talk more about that and the global story in general. Great to see you, Jim.JIM FITTERLING, CEO, THE DOW CHEMICAL COMPANY: Good morning, Maria.BARTIROMO: Thanks very much for joining us. So, we're hearing a debate about what's going on in the global economy right now. Within China, there was really a credit situation. Can you tell us what you see was being talked about as a slowdown in China?FITTERLING: I think what happened when China tightened credit, especially in the secondary market last year, that had an impact obviously on individual consumer who would buy an automobile, might buy a new property, and that might have had some knock-on effect in the durable goods because you don't buy a new property, you don't but durable goods. It also had a little bit of an impact on small and medium-sized enterprises, but then there were some quick changes made on policy to address VAT and income tax policies in China, and I think those are going to kick in this year.So, China's announced six percent growth targets for this year, which second largest economy in the world six percent growth, I think, is a pretty healthy growth rate for the year.BARTIROMO: Well, it certainly sounds like it.FITTERLING: And the consumers in general around the world are doing relatively well right now. Businesses are reporting decent results, so I think if we don't policy our way into a problem, I think we've got a pretty good outlook.BARTIROMO: How's your business going? Tell us about plastics as well as chemicals.FITTERLING: Well, I run the Material Science Division of DowDuPont which will spinout from DowDuPont on April 1st, and it'll be the new Dow. We have six businesses focused on three market vertical, so we create solutions for plastics -- for packaging, for infrastructure, and for consumer goods companies, like P&G, Unilever, others -- other brand owners. We help them make products. And business has been good. We've had a lot of investments over the last several years and they've been coming to fruition. We had a very strong year in 2018 where we brought on all of our additional capacity in the U.S. Gulf Coast and in Saudi Arabia. And so now as we move forward, we're going to continue to build out that capacity to keep growth with those industries.About 70 percent of what we sell goes into a finished consumer goods, so consumer demand really drives our business.BARTIROMO: How will investors and customers see the company differently after the spinout? Tell us what changes specifically after April.FITTERLING: The biggest change will be about a $50-billion company, as we spin out, focused on six business units. The old Dow was a $50-billion company focused on 13 business unities including the ag and specialty products, so we'll be more focused, we'll be able to go deeper into those businesses, we'll be able to keep up with the growth rate, we'll be able to be the market leader and many of those franchises were the number one or number two position in the world. And I think the investors are looking for that focus and for that leadership, and for us to continue obviously the innovation that we need to do to grow with those customers, and the geographic growth that Dow is known for around the world.BARTIROMO: Given the importance of plastics and that end result of the goods being sold to consumers, what is your outlook for the consumer environment right now? How is the retail sector doing?FITTERLING: Retail sales, consumer sales have been good. All the reports that we got back are good, U.S. consumer's good, China consumer's good, I think there were some concerns expressed when auto sales dropped, but as I mentioned, I think that was more due to credit policy than anything, and so policies can change that, those things can come back around.BARTIROMO: How are you dealing with this movement against plastic? I know you've got the Allianz to end plastic waste made up of approximately 30 major global companies. How are you dealing with that in terms of the issues around plastic and garbage in the oceans?FITTERLING: Well, this issue has really catalyzed a response in the public. It's also catalyzed a response from the industry and the entire value chain. So, last week, we announced a 1-1/2 billion-dollar campaign called The Alliance to End Plastic Waste. It is, right now, made up of more than 30 companies, brand owners, chemical industry companies, plastics companies, converters who make packaging, retailers, and also waste management companies. And we're looking at full circle economy solutions and so the waste issue has to be tackled. We get that. We -- it's not acceptable to have a sustainable product like plastics and lose use that sustainability when it becomes waste in the environment.So, our mission is very clear, we're going to stop the plastic waste going into the environment. We've got to clean up what's there, but more importantly we've got to create the circular economy. These materials can be recycled and upscaled into products. So there are brand owners out there today that are making fully-recycled materials. There are new lines of business, there are also social value change that have to be created, and that's what the industry is committed to do.BARTIROMO: So you can do that even while conducting your business in terms of the end result for good in plastic.FITTERLING: We can. It isn't a new thing to the plastics industry to tackle this. Back in the 80s, in the early days of recycle, the industry got together, and really brought to the table what has become ubiquitous now, the blue recycle bin that you would see at most venues around the United States. So, that was a really -- and industry-led initiative. This is an entire value chain initiative. And what we have to do is we have to bring solutions to the table. This has to be done at the community level. The focus early on will be on cities and rivers. There are about 10 rivers around the world, mostly Southeast Asia, India, China, where most of this waste gets into the ocean. If we can stem that tide, clean up the ocean, create these circular economies, we can help get to a different level of sustainability in plastics.BARTIROMO: Good for you. Thanks for doing that.FITTERLING: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Jim, good to have you on the program.FITTERLING: Nice to see you.BARTIROMO: Thanks so much. And we'll be watching thee spinout in April. Best wishes. We will take a break. When we come back, oil in focus, prices are up this morning, on the heels of some weak economic data out of China. What it means for the global economy, we're going to check the demand-supply situation. But first, take a look at a special update from the Tennis Channel.JONATHAN NOVACK, TENNIS CHANNEL HOST: Welcome back to another Tennis Channel Court Report for FOX Business. I'm Jonathan Novack. Serena Williams is out of the Australian Open. The American went down at Karolina Pliskova in a dramatic quarterfinal in Melbourne.The Czech star fought back from 5-1 down in the third set and saved four match points before closing out the victory 7-5, denying Williams the chance to equal Margaret Court's all-time record at the Slams.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SERENA WILLIAMS, TENNIS PLAYER: There's nothing I did wrong on those match points. I didn't do anything wrong. I stayed aggressive and she just literally hit the lines on some of them. I can't say that I choked on those match points. She literally played her best tennis ever on those shots, so I don't really -- I can't really say that it's incredibly painful as opposed to what can I do better.(END VIDEO CLIP)NOVACK: And don't forget Tennis Channel's live coverage of the Australian Open continues Wednesday at 6:00 p.m. Eastern.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BOB DUDLEY, CEO, BP: U.S. production now, you take the three big heavyweights in the world, so United States, Saudi Arabia, and Russia, the United States is heading towards being the largest producer in the world. Huge amounts of investments are happening, different characteristic than conventionally. You put a lot of cap on it, it declines fast. You got to keep it running fast. There's a lot there.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: That was Bob Dudley, BP CEO, with me earlier on global oil production. Joining me right now is IHS Markit Vice Chairman, Daniel Yergin. And, Dan, that was a pleasure to see you.DANIEL YERGIN, VICE CHAIRMAN, IHS MARKIT: Great to see you.BARTIROMO: You think the U.S. is already the largest producer.YERGIN: Yes. I think last October, nobody noticed it very much. It was very quiet. The U.S. became number one. It overtook Saudi Arabia and Russia, something that would have been unimaginable even five years ago.BARTIROMO: It's incredible actually. So, with all of that new supply coming to market, is that why we saw such whiplash in the oil markets? Oil going all the way down to $40.00 a barrel last year?YERGIN: Well, at first it went to $86.00 on the --BARTIROMO: Right.YERGIN: -- expectations that was going to be zero exports from Iran. And then when there wasn't, combined with all the issues about China and the slowing world economy, it plummeted and then OPEC and non-OPEC got together and kind of got a foundation under that price again, and it sort of stabilized and people are back investing in United States.BARTIROMO: So where are we now? What are the big issues around oil from your standpoint.YERGIN: Well, I think there are really two that are wrapped around the oil price, one is China. Not demanding China, but what happens on the trade talks is one thing, and the slowing -- the slowing growth, and that's one of the factors. And the other's rate with U.S. shale growth and how the rest of the world responds. We're seeing that February is expected to be slower growth, investment was down a little bit, we think that this coming -- this year, we're going to have another million 1/2 barrels a-day of supply from the United States.BARTIROMO: That's incredible. Did the -- did the deregulation help that? The fact that regulations have come all the way down in -- from the Trump administration, does that enable the shale production?YERGIN: Well, I think what the real risk was that there were going to be more and more regulations, and I think kind of stabilizing them back in some (INAUDIBLE) but those take times to have the impact. I think it's just incredible innovation this machine we have, this entrepreneurial machine in the United States, and this application of technology, and learning more and more about how to do this stuff.BARTIROMO: That is wonderful. So is the shale production story a five- year story, 10-year story, 20-year story, what?YERGIN: Well, I think it's a -- certainly a five-year story in terms of growth. At what point does it level off? I mean, we'll see, but it's somewhere probably between five and 10 years because it not going to, you know, it's not going to the sky, but it -- but it's going to continue to grow and that means that the U.S. is going to be a bigger and bigger impact not only in supply but in terms of exporting, and with that goes a new dimension to American influence in the world.BARTIROMO: So many implications as a result of that. Dan, it's good to see you.YERGIN: Good to see you. Thank you.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us.YERGIN: Sure.BARTIROMO: Dan Yergin is here, IHS, and we'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. It's been a great three hours. Markets are about to open higher in about 35 minutes. Be sure to join us tomorrow for my continued coverage here at the World Economic Forum in Davos. I'll be speaking with the CEO of IBM, Ginni Rometty, on the heels of very strong earnings at IBM. Plus SAP CEO, Bill McDermott, gives us a window into cloud computing, and the global story, Microsoft President, Brad Smith, same thing, also UBS Chairman, Axel Weber, give us -- give us his sense of business in banking. Join us. We got a packed show tomorrow as well. Coming up, we got final thoughts on this all-star panel in New York. Don't miss it. Back in a moment.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Markets are pointing to a higher opening this morning due to some strong earnings. Also this view that maybe yesterday's gloom and doom was overdone. We're expecting a rally at the start of trading of 180 points, three-quarters of a percent, S&P 500, 12-1/2 higher, and the NASDAQ up 34 points. Dagen, what's on your radar?MCDOWELL: It is those very earnings out of IBM, Procter & Gamble, and UTX this morning. Those stocks rallying big time on better than expected results. You throw in -- look at these stocks go, IBM is up seven percent. You throw in Boeing, that's up also this morning higher because maybe a little bit of lift from the trade tensions easing. If you add up those four stocks, they're adding roughly 150 points to the Dow Jones Industrial Average in premarket trading. So, again, focused on the fundamentals and it looks good.BARTIROMO: I'm so glad you said that. I was just thinking about that, fundamentals rule. I like to see a day when the actual fundamentals are driving the story. Lee Carter, you also got a government shutdown and what the people are thinking. How do you see things?CARTER: You know, I see things -- I'm holding on to what Brian Moynihan said in your interview earlier that the consumer behavior is not indicating that a recession is coming. The fundamentals are good, their behavior's strong. And I think a lot of people are surprised at how positive things are in 2019 so far given how we ended 2018, but again, look at the consumer behavior and consumer sentiment and ting that you can feel a lot more optimistic.MCDOWELL: I'm going to quote Lee Carter quickly because we were talking about this in the break and she said what will make the shutdown come to life for all Americans? We don't yet know what that is, but it hasn't so far.BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.CARTER: That's for sure.BARTIROMO: Yes. We'll see what happens in the -- in the next couple of days.MCDOWELL: Right.BARTIROMO: That IBM move is seven percent.MCDOWELL: Right.BARTIROMO: We talk with Ginni Rometty tomorrow. Ladies, have a great day.MCDOWELL: You, too.CARTER: You, too.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for a great show once again, and that'll do it for us. Stay with FOX Business, "VARNEY & CO." is next.Load-Date: January 23, 2019End of Document

Good Thursday morning, everybody. Thanks so much joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, March 7th. 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast. Your top stories right now, Chinese telecom giant Huawei making it official. The company filing a lawsuit against the U.S. saying that Congress acted as judge jury and executer.Markets are on edge this morning but well off of the lows of the morning. Dow Industrials now down just nine points, the S&P 500 is actually up, it is positive territory by a fraction. And NASDAQ is -- right now lower by two. A big bounce after the ECB meeting this morning where we did not see any moves in interest rates. Another decline yesterday for the markets making it three in a row.Take a look, Dow Industrials down 133 points yesterday. The S&P was down 18 and the NASDAQ down 70. The European Central Bank have left interest rates unchanged this morning setting a new round of long-term loans. ECB President Mario Draghi holding a news conference later this hour. We will bring you all of the developments but as you see her too, we're seeing a big of a turnaround after the ECB meeting.Markets are well off of the lows, the FT-100 is down just 15 points, the CAC quarante in Paris is actually positive by three points and the DAX Index Germany still down but down just 10 points right now. Pretty good bounce after the ECB meeting this morning. In Asia overnight, market mostly lower with the exception of China, Shanghai Composite was up a fraction.The push for privacy at Facebook. CEO Mark Zuckerberg shifting focus to private communication. The details on this major strategy shift to world's largest social network coming up. And Apple facing slowing iPhone sales. We are taking a look at what the technology giant is looking to do instead with services that's become a big business for Apple.Plus, a new twist on a Philly cheesesteak. It is raising some eyebrows because it's salty and sweet as well. The controversy coming up.All those stories coming up this Thursday morning and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the Wall Street Journal's Assistant Editorial Page Editor, James Freeman and Fox News Contributor Liz Peek. Great to see you this morning.LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning. Good news from the ECB I guess.BARTIROMO: Yes.PEEK: Great, you know.BARTIROMO: Well, we'll see if the ECB actually starts easing at some point because the economy in Europe is quite slow. The other day we had Mohamed el-Erian on and he said that the Eurozone would be lucky to see growth -- GDP growth of one percent this year.PEEK: And that's pretty much the forecast I think and there was an expectation they were going to lower that. I don't know if they did that or not but, yes, they need a change in regimen lower over there. Lower taxes, deregulation, sound familiar?BARTIROMO: Well, that's what you write about in France with the 33 percent corporate rate in your op-ed today, James.JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. So, instead of doing the reforms you're talking about they want to get the rest of the world to force tax rates higher, not good for growth but you wonder with Europe how long they can do this extending and pretending the very loose monetary policy. The government of Greece this week is back in the bond market borrowing money, healthy demand, less than four percent and the European regulator said they haven't fulfilled their promises, they haven't done the privatization and either kind of reforms that you would want to see.So, it doesn't really make sense why these highly indebted governments with zero growth economies can borrow so cheaply but they'll see how long they can --PEEK: Because they know if they're going to about bailed out by the ECB, that's why, right?FREEMAN: Yes. But I --PEEK: There is back stop.FREEMAN: I think there's a reckoning at some point if you don't --PEEK: Yes. For sure.FREEMAN: -- transition as we have done to a real economy.PEEK: Yes.BARTIROMO: Yes.FREEMAN: Based on by the decision making.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: No. I was just going to say this -- the -- I want to point this out, the U.S. economy is so much healthier than the rest of the world. That's why our trade deficit hit a record last year and I will call out a lot of these publications, a lot of these media organizations the way that they're framing this.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: They're trying to bait the President into doing something that's destructive to economic growth in this country.BARTIROMO: Yes. They're framing --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: -- what a failure and expanded, he's trying to narrow the gap.MCDOWELL: Front page of the New York Times, U.S. trade deficit under President bulges to record failing a Trump metric. I think that they're trying to go and poke the President into doings something rash.BARTIROMO: Yes. I think you're reading it right. And by the way, we'll talk more about your op-ed on tax rates in France and the U.S.'s response what Steven Mnuchin said about that. But first our top story this hour is Huawei, it is suing the United States as President Trump signals progress with China on trade talks. Blake Burman is covering the story, he's at the White House this morning. Blake, good morning to you.BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Maria, good morning to you as well. You're right. Huawei is now fighting back as it has sued the U.S. government in a Federal Court. At issue here is a provision that was in the middle of the National Defense Authorization Act that was put into law at the end of last year which says that Federal agencies cannot use Huawei products.Now Huawei is saying that that is singling out company and that they claim is unlawful. Huawei's chief information officer though has said in the recent days that the company should be trusted and is completely separate from the Chinese government.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ANDY PURDY, CHIEF SECURITY OFFICER, HUAWEI: On theft of the intellectual property by the China government that's not us, the China government does not speak for us, we don't speak through the China government. I applaud the efforts of the United States and others to try to crack down on the global theft of intellectual property which has been a disgrace over the last 15 years that we haven't done enough about it.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURMAN: The issue of I.P. theft as you heard him mention there is at the heart of a possible trade deal between the U.S. and China. President Trump yesterday continued to remain more optimistic than pessimistic at the prospects of a detail.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Gong OK. We're moving along, we're discussing that with Lindsey and Mitt. That moving along well, we'll see what happens. There either going to be a good deal or it's not going to be a deal but I think they're moving on very nicely.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURMAN: As we've talked about, Maria, any possible deal needs to eventually be signed off by President Trump and President Xi of China, a possible meeting between those two are likely meeting between those two as it relates to a possible date. That has not yet though confirmed up by the White House. Maria?BARTIROMO: All right. We've been hearing rumblings of the end of March in Mar-a-Lago, right?BURMAN: End of March, yes.BARTIROMO: We'll see.BURMAN: Yes. End of March, we'll see. Still awaiting the official word from the folks behind me.BARTIROMO: All right. Thank you. Blake Burman is at the White House this morning. And joining me right now is House Ways and Means Committee Member, Congressman Tom Reed and House Financial Services member, Congressman Josh Gottheimer. Good to see you, gentlemen. Thank you so much for joining us this morning.REP. TOM REED (R), NEW YORK: Good to see you.REP. JOSH GOTTHEIMER (D), NEW JERSEY: Good to be with you.BARTIROMO: So, Congressman Reed, let me kick this off with you. Your reaction in terms of Huawei suing the U.S.?REED: Well, you know, obviously, they have been one of the individuals we've been looking at in regards to intellectual property theft, the unfair trade advantages that Chinese companies as well as Chinese government have taken advantage for for years. And so I think now accountability is being imposed by this administration and that's the right thing to do.BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, I guess -- is this somewhere where we have common ground, Congressman Gottheimer in terms of China? You know.GOTTHEIMER: Definitely.BARTIROMO: Huawei says, it's -- the Congress, you and your colleagues acted as judge, jury, and executioner.GOTTHEIMER: Well, I think we need to hold them accountable. I think Tom is exactly right on this. And, you know, we know that there has been questions of practices and a lot of our security at stake here and we have to be incredibly mindful that in wary of their intentions and hold them accountable at every step.BARTIROMO: Yes. But I mean, how do you do that? Right? Isn't that the real question here? because isn't this a culture? I mean, they have been stealing I.P. for decades and I don't know that you change a culture so easily. They've got a lot of money, they're acquiring companies from energy to financial, acquiring companies in Silicon Valley, they've got their Confucius centers in and around Silicon Valley to soak up more intelligence from the U.S. How do you -- how do you turn this ship?GOTTHEIMER: I think -- I think we make sure that we don't put their 5G centers all over the United States. We make sure we got great companies like Qualcomm doing that and be very careful from a national security perspective of watching our I.P. and being vigilant. And I think the administration is holding them accountable on it. Right, Tom?REED: And I would say, Maria, this is -- most Americans don't realize, we don't have a trade agreement with China per se.BARTIROMO: Yes.REED: They work under an old WTO type standard. We need enforcement mechanisms at the table negotiated that. When you engage in these activities, this theft of our intellectual property. There is accountability immediately and enforceable accountability in those agreements. That's why I so appreciate President Trump sitting at the table face-to-face saying enough is enough, we're going to hold you accountable.BARTIROMO: Yes. The enforcement is really critical here because they've said they would do things in the past and then they didn't follow up like they said they would buy all this beef. So you think there is a measure, Congressman Gottheimer that you can actually put in place that if things go awry, they don't keep up their promises, you can quickly and easily put the tariffs back in place?GOTTHEIMER: I think we have to and I think we need to use our legislative authority to do that. And of course, the administration has to enforce it enforce all trade deals. But I think we have to act and I agree that with Tom that we've got to find a way the mechanisms in place to make sure that we can react so they can't steal our intellectual property, all of our technology they've been doing it for a long time and it's time to put our foot down about it.BARTIROMO: Yes. No, I agree. I think this is such an important subject, we've been covering it a lot, so thank you for input both of you on this. Let me move to another issue, Congressman Gottheimer because House Democrats obviously are divided over how to deal with this measure on freshman Congresswoman Ilhan Omar's comments regarding U.S. policy towards Israel, a vote on a resolution condemning anti-Semitism, being delayed in the House as a result.What's with all the delays here? I mean, can't we all agree that anti- Semitism should not be in the Foreign Affairs Committee and in the Congress?GOTTHEIMER: I think there is sweeping agreement about the fact that there is no room for anti-Semitism in our country or any hate speech or Islamophobia. You know, there's no room for that. And in our public discourse, obviously, someone who is Jewish, the idea that you would question my -- some would question my loyalty to the United States of America because of my fact is unacceptable.Just like it was unacceptable when they questioned President Kennedy's allegiance to our great country because he is catholic. There's no room for that in our country and it's clearly anti-Semitic. You know, I think there's -- there are different ways to approach this and broadly talk about a lot of rhetoric that's happened in our country which is unacceptable over many years but especially over the last couple years.And I think we need to address that too but we can't let-- get lost that what happened here and one member of Congress said about me and my faith and others are questioning our loyalty is unacceptable. We want to make sure that that does not get lost, move our foot down and say no anti- semitism in this country.BARTIROMO: Yes. No, I mean, we all agree with that. I mean, we all agree with you but how come it keeps getting delayed? Like what's the delay? What are we questioning?GOTTHEIMER: I think it's just a -- I think honestly it's a question of all -- there're so many issues that of course concerning when it comes hate in this country. It's what else should we address in a resolution we bring to the floor and I think that's what really the discussion is about at this point. I don't think anyone is questioning that the anti-Semitic comments that were made were unacceptable.And we have to make sure that speak out against them. I think it's the approach in how we do it. And, you know, we're working obviously together to try to get there. But, you know, it's unacceptable and there is no room for it as you point out.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Do you think she should step off foreign affairs? I mean, wouldn't that cure this?GOTTHEIMER: Well, I think that's certainly above my pay grade but I'll tell -- but I know what I feel about what was said and that's what I can speak to. It's unacceptable questioning anyone's loyalty in Congress to the United States of America because of their fate. It's unacceptable and we have to -- and we just have to make sure that people understand in this country there's no room for it in our rhetoric.BARTIROMO: So it's the Nancy Pelosi's decision then, right, Congressman Reed?REED: Yes, it is. But Maria, I would add one thing and I so appreciate Josh leading the charge standing up for being, you know --BARTIROMO: Me too.REED: And leading that charge and taking on anti-semitism head on. But this is also a symptom of extremism in our politics. This is more about a political issue that I think we used to face potentially in the Republican Party after 2010 that are now seeing the Democratic Party. You see a very strong vocal minority trying to push back on this issue and it's about internal politics more than dealing with the actual root cause.And I encourage my colleagues on the Democratic side. Stand with Josh, send the message, anti-semitism is not allowed. Anybody who speaks it, anybody who believes in it needs to be about called and shouldn't be in any party, Democrat or Republican.BARTIROMO: Yes. It's nice to see you, guys, having this common ground. Let me ask you about taxes, Congressman Reed. The state and local tax burden for New York, 12.7 percent, that s that is the highest in the country. New Jersey ranked number three by the way, Congressman --GOTTHEIMER: Yes. Not good.BARTIROMO: Gottheimer. State and local tax burden of 12.2 percent, this information according to the tax foundation, both your states dealing with an exodus of residents fleeing to lower tax states. So, Congressman Reed, what are you going to do about it?REED: I'm going to keep putting pressure on our state capitol and encourage my fellow New Yorkers wake up, we need to change policies out of Albany that are going to lower taxes, business a business friendly climate to the table so that people invest across all spectrums in New York and also stand with the existing businesses and residents first before you hand out goodies to potential people that you want to entice to come to the state.BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, Congressman Gottheimer, same deal in New Jersey. Do you guys have the power to actually move the needle on this?GOTTHEIMER: First on those jobs, I'll take them in Jersey, Tom, especially in Amazon. We'll take them but let me, you know, be clear what I feel. We've got to cut taxes in New Jersey, this tax hike bill that came through last year raised taxes on it. Jersey is pointing out on those statistics because of gutting the state and local tax reduction. We've got to reinstate it, stop double taxation, so we're working on that but frankly I'm sick and tired of these other states taking of our -- tacking of our tax dollar and Jersey and, you know, we're not getting anything back for it.We've got a tunnel between New York and New Jersey that's crumbling. We can't get any resources for it.BARTIROMO: Yes.GOTTHEIMER: We're sick and tired of it.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: You want to solve deduction back, right? You want that solved?GOTTHEIMER: Yes. Got to get -- got to get salt back, it's critical.BARTIROMO: Congressman, both of you, good to see you. Thank you so much for joining us.GOTTHEIMER: It's good to be with you, Maria.REED: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Congressman Reed and Gottheimer there. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We are watching shares of Kroger this morning. The stock falling on earnings. Gerri Willis is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange checking that out in the broader markets. Gerri, good morning.GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Hey, good morning, Maria. That's right. A double miss for Kroger on both the top line and the bottom line. Take a look at these numbers, the stock down nearly 10 percent here. EPS of 52 cents a share, that was the expectation, they came in at 48 cents a share. Revenue estimate was 28.38 billion --nah ah, 28.1 billion, as you can see right here,So a big disappointment in this -- what is really a narrow margin business, very difficult business because the margins are so narrow. This company spending heavily on technology and delivery services to better compete with companies like Wal-Mart and Amazon. As you remember on Friday, the stock was down mightily after Amazon announced they're going to start their own line of grocery stores in major American cities.Now, tonight, the opposite side of the coin, Costco coming in big expectations for that company. EPS estimates of $1.69 at stock, up marginally here. We expect a positive earnings result and revenue should be higher as well at 35 billion. So higher membership fees at E-commerce revenue should be higher for Costco. I guess we'll have to wait and see but Kroger, double miss today. Maria, back to you.BARTIROMO: All right, Gerri. Thank you. Coming up next, defending the border. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen defended President Trump's emergency declaration over the border crisis. We're going to bring you what she said. And then, flip-flop fine. The beautiful clinic, Cinque Terre Italian Coastline is ready to implement a no flip-flop rule for tourists. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen defending the President's national emergency declaration. Lauren Simonetti with headlines now. Lauren?LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER: Good morning, Maria. Secretary Nielsen saying that the country faces a serious and sustained crisis at the southern border in her testimony before the House Homeland Security Committee yesterday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY: The projections are dire at the current pace we are on track to encounter close to one million illegal aliens at our southern border this year.Our capacity is already severally restrained but these increases will overwhelm the system entirely. This is not a manufactured crisis, this is truly an emergency.(END VIDEO CLIP)SIMONETTI: The Senate expected to pass the measure in opposition to the national emergency declaration. The President has vowed to veto that resolution. Well, SoftBank's next big bet is in Latin America. The Japanese company launching a $5 billion fund to invest in tech start-ups in the region. SoftBank says, it will work with the Saudi backed $99-billion SoftBank vision fund to make bigger investments.It's already shaken up the tech industry with splashy investments and start-ups including Uber and WeWork. And finally an historic Philadelphia restaurant is putting together two of the city's famous foods, cheesecake and pound cake. Joe's Steaks and Soda Soups is selling a hybrid sandwich of the two. Every Tuesday this month pound cake cheese steak. You can even top it with chocolate icing.So it's added to the menu to celebrate Jo's Steak's 70th anniversary. Some people are writing on Twitter. April Fool's Day is next month but, yes, it's not getting the best rest reviews as you can imagine.BARTIROMO: All right. You don't have to very dessert, you just have the dinner and dessert all in one.SIMONETTI: That's very practicable, Maria. Yes. That's a good justification.BARTIROMO: I don't like it. What do you guys, think? Dagen? Do you eat that?MCDOWELL: I'm just thinking it's like a hamburger instead of a bun, you use two Krispy Kreme donuts, that's the same -- it's just --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Yes.FREEMAN: Yes. Just stick with the regular bond and mushrooms and pepperoni. Some people call that a Carmen, it's outstanding.BARTIROMO: There you go.PEEK: It all sounds like a heart attack on a plate, honestly.BARTIROMO: Yes. It does.PEEK: Forgive me but --BARTIROMO: Good point.MCDOWELL: The Italian stuff, that a Philly too, when I used to eat meat that had the -- it's broccoli raab and the beef steak. I remember that being quite delicious.PEEK: It's a different direction.BARTIROMO: Yes. Coming up. Facebook's privacy push, CEO Mark Zuckerberg's plan to go private sharing after losing users. Details next. And then awaiting key economic data this morning. Initial jobless claims are out, moments from now, we will bring you the numbers and see if there's an impact on markets. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Thursday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, March 7th. Your top stories right now just before 8 a.m. on the East Coast. New stimulus from the European Central Bank sparking a turnaround. Futures as you see are higher across the board. The ECB left rates unchanged. In Europe the European Central Bank taking new measures to support the struggling European economy.The ECB is launching a new round of long-term loans. As you can see, the markets completely reversed course. In the U.S. as well as in Europe, the FT-100 is still lower but just by nine points. And the CAC Quarante is up 11 points, and DAX Index up 15. Ditto for the U.S. markets as you saw a moment ago. We are waiting on jobless claims which will be out in about 30 sections right here.In Asia overnight, take a look at the markets. And as you can see, it was lower across the board with the exception of China, Shanghai Composite, did squeak out a fractional gain. iPhone sales are slowing. There could be more problems brewing for Apple. We're going to take a look this morning. And the end of an era today. General Motors closing its Lordstown, Ohio plant which has been open since 1966.Plus, a fine over flip-flops. Get this. A major tourist destination in Italy focusing on footwear. You will have to pay up. We have the story. But first we begin this half an hour. It's Facebook's future. CEO Mark Zuckerberg unveiled a new plan to address privacy concerns after losing users. Joining me now is Wedbush Securities Managing Director of Equity Research, Dan Ives. Dan, it's good to see you.DAN IVES, MANAGING DIRECTOR, WEDBUSH SECURITIES: Great to be here.BARTIROMO: So the -- let's talk about what you're seeing out of -- out of this company, and whether or not this is the way to move in terms of Facebook and private.IVES: Yes, I think we'll get to posturing, too. I mean given what they've seen the Beltway in Brussels to some extent here, you know, they really need, from a privacy perspective, to kind of give, you know, I think directionally go in this move. (INAUDIBLE) comes down to monetization. The game hasn't changed Facebook in terms of how they're going to monetize this. And I think that's what really investors are focused on. But I think right now, they continue to face an uphill battle on the privacy side as we've seen.MCDOWELL: So they're going to offer encrypted messaging across all of it's products, some of the messages, the private conversations will be ephemeral, is the word, the operative word. The problem is Facebook has never figured out a way how to make money, expect from revenue from advertisers. Ninety-eight percent of its revenue comes from advertisers. How did -- this actually hurts Facebook. And to your point, the issue hasn't been really -- it's how Facebook treats our private information. Just because you say our conversations are going to be private in the future, how are you going to prove to us that you're not going to be selling our data, that you're going to be combing through our conversations to get the juiciest details to then offload to advertisers for money?IVES: Yes. I mean look, they're playing nice in the sandbox, but the reality is it's 98 percent revenue, and that's not going to change, that's why, you know, as they went through the congress, and they went in Brussels, they've kind of done some of those moves. But if you'll get numbers, you've seen obviously advertising revenue hasn't really been hit. And I think this is just a move where they need to continue to go from a privacy perspective, in that direction, especially when you look at Cook and Apple and you saw obviously the advertisement at CES, I mean they've kind of gotten the other side. So right now, there's kind of a battle brewing among tech giants with Facebook on one side, Apple on the other.MCDOWELL: Dan, I said this privately really quickly. I went through my preferences on my Facebook app, I don't -- I rarely use Facebook anymore. I do use Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, and under my ad preferences, it said advertisers who uploaded a contact list with your information in it is a thousand advertisers. And I've barely used that service in the last --BARTIROMO: So you can actually do that, you can actually go in and see how many advertisers uploaded your content.MCDOWELL: And who there are. And who there are. And I had -- you have to go through though and block every single one of them, basically delete them.PEEK: It's almost impossible.IVES: Yes.PEEK: And what we know is from last week, revelation, I think that they're -- even if you're not on Facebook, they're taking your information somehow and selling it. So, it seems to me that this constant parade of mea culpas from Facebook are become meaningless. I mean they're going to have to do something to address this issue or people are going to stop using Facebook.IVES: And there's a lack of teeth in terms of what you're seeing from a regulatory perspective.PEEK: Sure.IVES: That's pushing back the background. (INAUDIBLE) the stocks jumped significantly, investors now view it as background noise.BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.IVES: Versus maybe a year ago where it actually was a big overhang in stock.FREEMAN: I don't understand the business model going forward. You're saying that they're not going to get their money from fees, from subscription fees. It's still going to be almost entirely advertising.BARTIROMO: You said it's 98 percent.IVES: Yes. I mean, look, you're going to -- you'll -- you could start to slightly to move that, but realistically right now and you look at it in the numbers, advertising (INAUDIBLE) Facebook is.FREEMAN: OK. So you -- if you're transition in a big way from people publishing stuff and large audiences being able to see it to private communications in small groups where audiences are very much restricted from seeing it. That sounds, on its face, like much lower advertising revenue.MCDOWELL: Yes.IVES: Yes.FREEMAN: Is there a reason they can charge more per thousand or per chat group? Or how do they --IVES: And then --FREEMAN: -- sustain the revenue?IVES: And now --BARTIROMO: And you --and you compared it to WhatsApp.MCDOWELL: Yes. WhatsApp, which Facebook owns --IVES: Yes.MCDOWELL: -- is private when they spend -- how much did they spend? $19 billion for WhatsApp, and they haven't figured out a way how to monetize these private messaging platforms. The plan is, and I don't mean to interrupt you, Dan, is to build payment systems and e-commerce systems within these private messaging apps and that's how they would theoretically make money off of --BARTIROMO: So how do we know --IVES: Yes. Driving Whats -- the -- it's really driving the WhatsApp acquisition in trying to monetize that.BARTIROMO: Yes. Yes. But I mean why would that mean that your private conversations are not going to go to the advertisers?IVES: It does -- and look, and that's why right now --BARTIROMO: It doesn't.IVES: I mean fundamentally, this is a paper -- it's a -- it looks good on paper, but the jury's still out in terms of --FREEMAN: I don't think it looks good on paper.BARTIROMO: I don't -- yes. I don't know if it looks good on paper either.FREEMAN: From a -- from a shareholder perspective. If you're saying -- when you said these huge audiences (INAUDIBLE) now we're going to tiny audiences, that doesn't sound like an advertisement bonanza --MCDOWELL: Well, like --IVES: And investors have seen -- and investors have seen through it. Investors looked at this and kind of, you know, I think shrugged their shoulders in terms of what this release ultimately (INAUDIBLE)FREEMAN: (INAUDIBLE)MCDOWELL: It lets -- it -- well, you have to think about it in terms of, say, the iMessage that Apple offers on its phones, which is a protected messaging service, like in iMessage, you can use your Apple Pay and send cash to people. That's the model that Facebook is potential using within the -- offering private messaging across its platform.IVES: That's really the ultimate goal --MCDOWELL: Right.IVES: -- on the next step, but the first step is where you have to really get those private message and you could ultimately monetize.BARTIROMO: It seems --MCDOWELL: And then this raises the issue though of Mark Zuckerberg because he's -- well, a phony baloney, has damaged the company's reputation and his reputation so much, does anybody believe him? Again, it's -- this is impossible to quantify, but it raises the issue of like -- but can they build out this idea with the users trusting this guy?BARTIROMO: What do you think?IVES: Yes. Look, I think right now, it's an average, like, uphill battle for him to prove, you know, not just to consumers but even investors, that they can do this successfully, and that's why right now then you see the stock in the penalty box.BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.IVES: And then the other side --BARTIROMO: Are you still avoiding the stock?IVES: Look, we continue -- we would much rather own a name like, you know, a name like Microsoft, on the Clouds on large cap --BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.IVES: -- rather than Facebook here, you know, in terms of our opinion, or even Apple. Just to --BARTIROMO: But what about Apple? I mean they have their own issues, slowing iPhone sales. Apple's app fees might be next because companies are pushing back on how much Apple is charging them.IVES: Look, iPhones obviously fell off the cliff in China, and it's really about to services business, 50 billion a year right now. And, look, you saw with Netflix, Netflix pulled the ripcord going off of, you know, the App Store, and I think that's why right now for Apple, March 25th, they'll announce their video streaming service, it's about putting few (INAUDIBLE) on that content on the services side. We ultimately think Apple is continuing to have pressure to do an acquisition on content, on original content. And I think right now, remember that case is going to the courts, too, in terms of the App Store.PEEK: It seems to me one of the sort of derivative problems for the tech companies is that with all these bad publicity, Europe is feeling freer and freer to impose taxes on revenues. I mean, you know -- and this is a small thing, but Europeans really don't like these big tech companies very well, and I think the latest thing was in fact a proposal that they're going to start to tax revenues. I mean maybe that's what all this bad publicity leads to, not regulations on privacy because we all agree that's unenforceable possibly. But simply a money pull.IVES: Yes, and, look, the four letters that no tech company wants to hear, GDPR.BARTIROMO: Yes, well --IVES: And if you look at what happened in Europe --BARTIROMO: It's in place.IVES: And it's in place, and that's really the star, and I think that's the fear of tech companies, but when you look at Apple specifically, services is really the linchpin to the valuation, the installed base. Right now, it's seeing more and more pressure on the services side, and I think Netflix is just the start of this.PEEK: Interesting.BARTIROMO: Yes. We will leave it there. It's great to have you on the program, Dan.IVES: No, thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much, Dan Ives. Joining us there. Coming up, high emotions at General Motors this morning, the final Chevy rolls off the line at the company's Lordstown Ohio Plant, we're taking a look at what's next for the automaker. Then flip-flop fine, a top tourist destination in Italy, wants you to pay up if you're not wearing the right footwear, back in a minute.DANI KLUPENGER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER: Welcome back to another Tennis Channel court report. For FOX Business, I'm Dani Klupenger. There was plenty for the home fans to cheer for day one at Indian Wells as American women proudly flew the red, white, and blue. Seventeen-year-old Amanda Anisimova is the youngest player in the WTA's top 100, and she cruised into the second round with a straight sets win over Serbia's Aleksandra Krunic.Sofia Kenin continued her excellent running form with a comeback win over China's Wang Yafan. The 20-year-old fighting her way back into the match after losing the opening set 6-1.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SOFIA KENIN, TENNIS PLAYER: In the third set, I started off good, but then things went -- didn't go so well but I was fighting and like I said, you guys are amazing and I love playing out here.(END VIDEO CLIP)KLUPENGER: And don't forget, you can watch all the action from Indian Wells on Tennis Channel. Our daily live coverage hits the air at 1:00 p.m. Eastern. I'm Dani Klupenger.BARTIROMO: Democrats are pushing a vote to condemn Anti-Semitism, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi facing conflicts within her own party this morning. Joining me now, the host of "VARNEY & CO." Stuart Varney to weigh in on that. Stu, we've been talking about this a lot this morning.STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes. Hey, look, if you can't condemn Anti-Semitism, clearly --BARTIROMO: Yes.VARNEY: -- don't be in congress. If you can't condemn the scourge of centuries, you are a disgrace. And furthermore, if you can't recognize and understand that there is a crisis on our border, you are wilfully blind. And if you insist on undermining the present with constant investigations that will stretch out for the next couple of years, just looking for dirt of any kind, you're just a hater. I'm frankly disgusted with the state of the Democrat Party, and I'm going to let everybody know on my three-hour show.BARTIROMO: Yes.VARNEY: They are a disgrace.BARTIROMO: Well, I'll tell you, I had two Democratic congressman on in the last 15 minutes, Stu, and it kept asking that question, why do we need, you know, why do we need a resolution to condemn this? It's like I don't get it, you know. And why is she still on Foreign Affairs?VARNEY: They can't get the wording right?BARTIROMO: I don't -- I don't understand.VARNEY: Are you kidding me?BARTIROMO: Yes.VARNEY: You can't get the wording right?BARTIROMO: Yes.VARNEY: That's pathetic.BARTIROMO: Well, we're going to be watching, Stu. I know you'll have a lot more. We will see you in about 15 minutes.VARNEY: Oh, yes.BARTIROMO: "VARNEY & CO." begins top of the hour.VARNEY: I'll calm down. I promise I'll calm down.BARTIROMO: Yes. No, seriously, tell us how you really feel.VARNEY: OK.BARTIROMO: Stuart Varney. "VARNEY & CO." begins top of the hour right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA. Join Stuart and his wonderful panel coming up. First though, beyond clothes, Rent the Runway is moving into your home in a whole new way. It's a partnership with West Elm and we've got it for you right after this, back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A sad day for G.M. and the plant in Ohio, ending production. Lauren Simonetti with the details there. Lauren.SIMONETTI: Yes, Maria. It's a sad story for the workers. The last Chevy Cruze rolling off the assembly line at G.M.'s Lordstown Ohio Plant after more than half a century making about 16 million vehicles. That factory is now idled, 1,700 jobs lost.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is a day that I don't think anybody ever saw coming. It's very tough. It's hard to swallow. It's almost surreal, like, is this really happening?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It'll night be a blow to the economy. It'll be a blow to all the local businesses which rely on General Motors.(END VIDEO CLIP)SIMONETTI: The plant is the first of five North American factories that G.M. plans to close by next year. Well, Rent the Runway is expanding beyond designer clothes, partnering with West Elm to allow subscribers to rent home goods, things like blankets, pillows, and quilts. Rent the Runway's unlimited subscribers pay $159 a month to rent four outfits at a time for as long as they wish. The home goods would count as one of the four items. Just think millennials move around a lot, maybe they don't want to own furniture and the like.And this, the Italian hot spot Cinque Terre is flipping its rules on tourists. People will reportedly be fined up to $2,800 if they're caught wearing flip-flops, sandals, or pumps on hikes through those hills. Officials say they're sick of rescuing people because they're wearing the wrong shoes. Ooh.BARTIROMO: Wow.SIMONETTI: I mean why would you wear high heels if you're hiking in Cinque Terre? But anyway --BARTIROMO: Well, maybe people didn't know what they're up against. I mean they don't --SIMONETTI: True.BARTIROMO: -- realize the terrain before they went out.SIMONETTI: Well, you better realize now. Otherwise, you're out 2,800 bucks.BARTIROMO: That's incredible. Wow.SIMONETTI: It's a big number, right? Italy needs money, right?BARTIROMO: That's a lot of money, Liz.PEEK: Italy. It's a growth industry. Look, I think actually -- it's -- it is an interesting thing, when someone goes hiking in one of our national parks, they don't have a map, or they don't take with them, and then you have a search party that spends tens of thousands of dollars to find them. There should be some accountability, right? I mean I think this is kind of ridiculous, but, you know, I'm not totally unsympathetic that --BARTIROMO: They need to tell people beforehand.PEEK: -- people should be responsible. Oh, totally.BARTIROMO: Yes?FREEMAN: Yes.PEEK: I think that's right -- exactly right.MCDOWELL: You know, here's a revenue --FREEMAN: Maybe just a sign at the bottom of the trail would work. I don't know.PEEK: Yes.BARTIROMO: Just stay at the bottom of the trail. Don't hike.MCDOWELL: But they don't read -- but they're Italian, and they don't read Italian because they're from --FREEMAN: Oh.MCDOWELL: -- everywhere else.FREEMAN: All right. Maybe English, too.MCDOWELL: You know, I'm proposing a $10,000 fine in New York City as a revenue raiser for all men wearing flip-flops because nobody needs to see your hairy toes. I don't care if it's June or January.PEEK: That's discrimination, really, Dagen. And so now --FREEMAN: Well, I was told by my wife and kids that my sandals were ugly so I went to flip-flops even though they're not my favorite. Now -- you're telling me that now?BARTIROMO: Now you're facing Dagen's fine.MCDOWELL: Do you not dirty your feet walking around in flip-flops in New York City?FREEMAN: Well, I don't.PEEK: Sneakers are good (INAUDIBLE) sneakers are good.BARTIROMO: We've got final thoughts from this all-star panel when we come right back. Stay with us.PEEK: Better than those.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A couple of lines from the ECB Meeting and the news conference that's happening. As you just saw, the markets have reversed course again and are now negative. One of the issues is that Mario Draghi put a growth outlook out there and his target is now GDP of 1.1 percent for Eurozone in 2019, that's down from 1.7 percent. So, even though the ECB today said, you know, fresh measures to stimulate the Eurozone's faltering economy, they also talked about the weakness there in terms of the growth outlook, 1.1 percent versus 1.7 percent, turn these markets down again. Dow Industrials lower, S&P, and the NASDAQ, along with the European indices down across the board.Meanwhile, comments from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin raising some questions about tax policy in Europe particularly taking a page out of France. James Freeman wrote the op-ed this week, and you asked in your op- ed, James, is Team Trump getting along too well with France? A bad tax idea gets a surprise U.S. endorsement. Tell us about it.FREEMAN: Yes. I know there's a concern obviously that this white house is not getting along so well with our traditional allies and I'm -- but I'm worried maybe the Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin, is going too far to make the French feel better. He -- I don't know --BARTIROMO: He agreed with the French policy.FREEMAN: He agreed that we ought to have a minimum corporate income tax. I think maybe there will be a debate about what this ought to be, but this is a terrible idea. You mentioned the slow growth in Europe, there is slow growth in France. Instead of trying to become more competitive, their politicians want to try and get everybody else to raise tax levels up to where they are. This is a play by that guy, Bruno Le Maire to tax and punish tech companies based in the United States and to go after Ireland's competitive low 12-1/2 percent corporate tax rate. He doesn't like it because Ireland grows faster and steals business from France, he doesn't like low tax rates because the U.S. does better than France. Why the U.S. wants to encourage them --BARTIROMO: Yes.FREEMAN: -- participate in this effort beyond --BARTIROMO: I know. But I mean look at the rates. I mean what is the corporate tax rate in Ireland and the corporate tax rate in France? You write that the corporate tax rate in France was 33 percent.FREEMAN: Very high.BARTIROMO: Compare that to the U.S. at 21 percent now.FREEMAN: This is the game-changer from this tax reform.BARTIROMO: Yes.FREEMAN: We used to at 40 when you count the local --BARTIROMO: Yes.FREEMAN: -- state and local. Now we're competitive than France.PEEK: But France is really an outlier now because almost --FREEMAN: Yes.PEEK: -- everyone else in Europe has lowered corporate tax rates, but I mean it's sort of shocking to me that Mnuchin would advocate anything to do with the French tax scheme because it is clearly contrary to what we tried to do in this country successfully. And --BARTIROMO: And Ireland's like 12 percent?MCDOWELL: Yes.FREEMAN: 12-1/2.BARTIROMO: 12-1/2.FREEMAN: That's right. Yes. Very -- I'm just -- I'm hoping Mnuchin was confused and he wanted to make ties --PEEK: Lives now change.FREEMAN: -- given that we've got these other trade disputes going on, but really, really negative signal.MCDOWELL: Well, meantime, you have like Elizabeth Warren proposing the wealth taxing in the United States, unconstitutional, but she's trying to borrow from France, although it didn't work in France.PEEK: Yes. They nixed it.MCDOWELL: That they had to nix it because guess what (INAUDIBLE) and they all leave because Maria keeps saying money's mobile.BARTIROMO: Right.MCDOWELL: And all these other nations, same thing happened with corporate tax rate. All these other nations stepped back and go, oh, you don't want rich folks living in your country and paying taxes? You want to confiscate their wealth? You can come here. Russia would be handing out passports right and left, to American if we tried to --BARTIROMO: Yes. And it's important to look at the growth story here. I mean we're just hearing this morning from Mario Draghi who cut his Eurozone growth target to 1.1 percent for 2019, down from 1.7 percent. Part of that is the bite from taxes.PEEK: And this is not a one quarter phenomenon. I mean since the recession, basically the United States has outperformed handily Europe, and it's not just -- it's also regulations. The E.U. bureaucracy is nonpareil, there is no other group that puts regulations on industry the way they do. So, look, they got to figure this out. I think Macron would like to lower taxes and kind of deregulate, but this liberal's view, corporate taxes, as a painless enterprise. They don't believe that it impacts growth, they don't believe it flows through the consumer, both things are true.BARTIROMO: Which is why the talking point on the left is that the tax cut plan went to the rich.PEEK: That's right. Yes.BARTIROMO: That's how they get there, by looking at the corporate tax rate.MCDOWELL: Family of four got --FREEMAN: And the real result is more jobs for people at all income levels.PEEK: That's exactly right.FREEMAN: And, of course, there was a cut at every income level, which often is overlooked.BARTIROMO: And they doubled the standard deduction.FREEMAN: Right.MCDOWELL: family of four got a tax cut of more than $4,000.BARTIROMO: Yes. All right, guys.FREEMAN: Look, the, you know --BARTIROMO: Great show.FREEMAN: Thanks.BARTIROMO: And great piece. Dagen McDowell, James Freeman, Liz Peek, good to see you.PEEK: Nice to be here.BARTIROMO: Thanks so much. It was a great show today. Thank you for joining us. Be sure to tune tomorrow, we've got the coverage of our jobs in America, special, it kicks off at 8:00 a.m. Eastern as we identify where the jobs. We're expecting 180,000 jobs created in the month of February when we get that report tomorrow. And the unemployment rate to move lower to 3.9 percent. That'll do it for us today. We'll see you again tomorrow. Seize the day, everybody. "VARNEY & CO." begins now, Stuart, take it away.VARNEY: And good morning, Maria.Load-Date: March 7, 2019End of Document

The Communist Chinese government poses the greatest, long-term threat to America's national and economic security. The U.S. must be vigilant in preventing Chinese state-directed telecoms companies, like Huawei, from undermining and endangering critical U.S. systems and infrastructure.

US LAWMAKERS NOMINATE JAILED UYGHUR ACADEMIC ILHAM TOHTI TO RECEIVE NOBEL PEACE PRIZEStates News ServiceJanuary 30, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1016 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:More than a dozen bipartisan U.S. lawmakers have nominated jailed Uyghur academic and blogger Ilham Tohti to receive the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize, citing his commitment to peaceful interethnic dialogue between members of his ethnic group and China's Han Chinese majority.An outspoken economics professor who regularly highlighted the religious and cultural persecution of the mostly Muslim Uyghur ethnic minority in northwest China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), Tohti was sentenced to life in prison on Sept. 23, 2014 following a two-day show trial on charges of promoting separatism.The court decision cited Tohti's criticism of Beijing's ethnic policies, his interviews with overseas media outlets, and his work founding and running the Chinese-language website Uighurbiz.net, which was shut down by Chinese authorities in 2014.In a letter dated Jan. 29, a group of 13 U.S. lawmakers including Senator Marco Rubio and Representative Chris Smith, who head the bipartisan Congressional-Executive Commission on China, called on the Nobel Peace Prize Committee in Oslo to consider Tohti for the prestigious award, saying that amid an ongoing crackdown in the XUAR, "voices like Professor Tohti's are needed more than ever."The lawmakers cited the XUAR's network of political "re-education camps," where authorities are believed to have detained up to 1.1 million Uyghurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities accused of harboring "strong religious views" and "politically incorrect" ideas throughout the region since April 2017 "in possibly the largest mass internment of an ethnic minority population in the world today."They also highlighted "an unprecedented campaign of pervasive surveillance" that includes mandatory "homestays" by Communist Party officials in Uyghur and Kazakh homes in the XUAR, "highly disproportionate rates of arrest" and detention of Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in the region, and a targeting of intellectuals and other prominent members of the Uyghur community.In 2011, high-ranking Chinese officials had sought out Tohti's advice on Beijing's policies in the XUAR, but rejected a paper he wrote detailing the difficulties faced by Uyghurs in the region and how they could be addressed.Authorities in the XUAR went on to institute a crackdown on intellectuals and others voices of dissent in 2013, following the appointment of Chinese President Xi Jinping.Repressive tactics in the XUAR grew to include detentions in the region's vast network of re-education camps, which Beijing initially denied the existence of, but which XUAR chairman Shohrat Zakir told China's official Xinhua news agency in October 2018 were an effective tool to protect the country from terrorism and provide vocational training for Uyghurs.Reporting by RFA's Uyghur Service and other media organizations, however, has shown that those in the camps are detained against their will and subjected to political indoctrination, routinely face rough treatment at the hands of their overseers, and endure poor diets and unhygienic conditions in the often overcrowded facilities.In Tuesday's letter, lawmakers said that Tohti knew the risks he was taking by speaking and writing openly about ethnic policy and development in the XUAR, and suggested that his advice could have helped to avoid the state of conflict the region is facing today."Professor Tohti's courageous work embodied precisely the kind of insight and guidance on interethnic problems that should be embraced by Chinese officials who have, instead, chosen to silence Professor Tohti and to embark on a massive crackdown on Uyghur intellectuals, the broader Uyghur community, and other Muslim groups in the XUAR," the letter said.The lawmakers drew comparison between Tohti's case and that of late Nobel Peace Laureate and democracy activist Liu Xiaobo, who died from late-stage liver cancer in 2017 while serving an 11-year jail term for subversion."Like Liu, Professor Tohti is a determined champion of human rights, and his life's work demonstrates that freedom, due process, liberty, and the rule of law are not foreign ideas in China, but ones that eventually should be a part of a more peaceful and prosperous future for China and the world," they said, adding that "there is no one more deserving of the Committee's recognition in 2019."Nomination welcomedOn Wednesday, president of the Ilham Tohti Initiative Enver Can expressed his appreciation to the 13 lawmakers, calling Tohti's nomination "of historic significance" and a critical part of a broader push by rights groups and the international community to free the professor."The official nomination by members of the U.S. Congress at this historic juncture, in which the Uyghur people are facing policies of ethnic cleansing, is the first giant step for securing the release of Professor Tohti, who peacefully struggled for the rights and freedoms of Uyghurs," he said."His nomination ... will shine a spotlight on his condition and the horrible difficulties endured by the Uyghur people."Earlier this month, in an open letter marking the fifth anniversary of his arrest, 132 scholars and 18 civil society groups called on China's government to immediately release Tohti and other notable academics held in re-education camps, saying his case represents "a warning shot directed at Uyghur intellectuals and activists in China more broadly.""The

China says pest concerns justify ban on Canadian canolaAssociated Press Financial WireMarch 7, 2019 Thursday 4:07 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 591 wordsByline: By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN, Associated PressDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - China said Wednesday that it is blocking some imports of the agricultural product canola from Canada because of fears of insect infestation.The move, which comes amid heightened tensions over Canada's arrest of a Chinese tech executive, is seen by some as a new tactic to seek leverage over Ottawa.China suspended canola imports from a Canadian company "in accordance with laws and regulations and international practice," foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said at a daily news briefing.He cited "harmful organisms" that he did not identify further, and said China's government "needs to protect the health and safety of its own people.""I can tell you responsibly that the Chinese government's decision is definitely well-founded," Lu said. "Upon verification, China customs has recently detected dangerous pests in canola imported from Canada many times."One of Canada's largest grain processors, Richardson International Ltd., said Tuesday that China had revoked its permit to export canola there.Some saw that as retaliation for Canada's arrest of Meng Wanzhou, the CFO of Chinese tech giant Huawei.Canada announced recently that it is going ahead with an extradition hearing for Meng, the daughter of Huawei's founder. Canada arrested her at the request of the U.S., where she is wanted on fraud charges for allegedly misleading banks about the company's dealings with Iran.Canadian Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau said in a statement that the Canadian Food Inspection Agency conducted investigations after China issued notices of non-compliance on canola seed imports, including nine since January. She said the agency had not identified any pests or bacteria of concern.China, whose rapid growth has made it an important market for many countries, has a history of using commercial retaliation against those at odds with Beijing.The most recent high-profile target was South Korean retailer Lotte, which sold land to the Seoul government for a U.S. anti-missile system opposed by Beijing. Authorities closed most of the company's 99 supermarkets and other outlets - often alleging safety violations - and a theme park project.China suspended a trade deal with Norway and restricted imports of Norwegian salmon after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Chinese political prisoner Liu Xiaobo in 2010. It stopped buying fruit from the Philippines during a dispute over territory in the South China Sea. Britain and other countries also faced retaliation over meetings with Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, considered a dangerous separatist by Beijing.China receives about 40 percent of Canada's canola exports, and the revocation of Richardson's permit hurts the entire chain of industries involved in the market, the Canola Council of Canada has said.Canola prices already have been hit by China's retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural exports. Further cutbacks on Chinese buying would deal a major blow to what is a lifeline for agriculture in western Canada."We are working very, very hard with the Chinese government on this issue," Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said Tuesday.China has warned of serious consequences if the Huawei executive is not released. China arrested two Canadians on Dec. 10 in what was widely seen as an attempt to pressure Canada.After Meng's arrest, a Chinese court also sentenced a Canadian to death in a sudden retrial, overturning a 15-year prison term handed down earlier.___Associated Press writer Rob Gillies in Toronto contributed to this report.Load-Date: March 7, 2019End of Document

Here's Maria Bartiromo with the special edition with MORNINGS WITH MARIA.MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good Friday morning from Switzerland. Hello, everyone, I'm Maria Bartiromo, happy Friday to you. It is Friday, January 25th, your top stories right before 6:00 a.m. on the east coast. Making his case, the CEO of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, defending the company he created in a new Wall Street Journal op-ed this morning, what he said about the company's data practices coming up.Shutdown showdown now enters day 35, two Senate bills failed yesterday, lawmakers are back at the negotiating table today, we have the very latest. As some federal employees are now about to miss their second paycheck. Senator Elizabeth Warren's new tax plan, hit the rich, she's proposing an annual wealth tax now, we have the details as she makes her 2020 push. Plus, Intel under pressure this morning. The stock is down after fourth quarter revenue missed expectations. Stock down almost six percent, guidance was weak.Taking a look at the broader markets this morning, Futures are pointing to a gain at the start of trading this morning. Take a look, pretty good rally is expected this morning. Dow Industrials up 166 points, two-thirds of one percent. S&P 500 also up two-thirds of a percent, 19 points higher and the NASDAQ this morning up 66 points, about a percent higher. This after a muted session on Wall Street yesterday. Check the close yesterday, and we see the markets not too far from where it began the day, Dow Industrials down 22, S&P 500 up three, and the NASDAQ at the close yesterday 47 points higher at 4:00.Checking global markets this morning, Europe stocks are higher this morning across the board, FT-100 up 23 points, that's a third of a percent. The CAC Quarante in Paris is up about one percent, 46 points higher. And the strongest performance in Germany, DAX Index up 155 points, that's 1-1/3 percent. In Asia overnight, gains across the board. Take a look at the close in Asia, where the best performer was Hong Kong. Hang Seng Index up 1-2/3 percent. The other majors also higher. All those stories coming up this morning, on this Friday morning.Joining me from New York, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Independent Women's Voice CEO Heather Higgins. Ladies, good morning to you.HEATHER HIGGINS, CEO, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S VOICE: Good morning.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria Bartiromo.HIGGINS: Hello.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: How are you doing today? We've got a lot to talk about, Dagen.MCDOWELL: Oh, I have been talking to myself all night long about the Elizabeth Warren wealth tax. I can't wait to --BARTIROMO: It's such a beautiful story.MCDOWELL: I can't wait to talk to you about it. Because, to me, it just looks like she's tired of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez taking all the --BARTIROMO: Yes. Yes, yes, yes.MCDOWELL: -- steam out of her little engine, or taking all of the air out of the room, so she's got to figure out one way to one up AOC on tax and the tippy tops which they now both call the richest of the rich.HIGGINS: That's absolutely correct.BARTIROMO: Yes, that's absolutely -- you know what I was thinking about this morning, when you take a look at some of the wealthy out there, they're not necessarily creating or gaining more wealth because of higher income levels, they've created wealth and have money in stock, money in real estate, but you know, you take someone like a Warren Buffet who always used to say, well, it's just disgraceful that I have a lower tax rate than my secretary. Well, that's because his wealth was in stock, so he's paying capital gains versus her in income. So, when you take a look at the wealth, they think you also have to take a look at what we're actually measuring.MCDOWELL: Right. She wants to essentially confiscate people's money, she wants to confiscate people's wealth.BARTIROMO: Right.MCDOWELL: And the only way this works is if the -- all the other countries in the world where billionaires or multimillionaires might live, do the exact same thing. I think one of her ideas is to -- if you try to rescind your -- or turn in your U.S. citizenship, she's going to hit you with a penalty to do that, which -- that's communist.HIGGINS: Well, it's not just that. It's that in every country where you've had wealth taxes, what you find happens is that the really wealthy people have the ability to evade them. And what you really do is you suppress the ability of people to rise. You find that in any of these countries that have had historically wealth taxes, the families that were wealthy hundreds of years ago, are the same families that still have all the wealth in (INAUDIBLE)MCDOWELL: Well, that's my point, is that the only way this works is that all the other countries have the same wealth tax because otherwise people will move. Billionaires don't need to stay here to collect Social Security.BARTIROMO: That's right.(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: They'll take their money somewhere else.BARTIROMO: Like we always say, money is mobile, and we've got a lot to talk about in that regard, so stay with us on that, everybody.We want to get to our top story right now at the top of the hour, Mark Zuckerberg, he's answering his critics this morning in a new op-ed, the Facebook CEO writing an op-ed in The Journal, titled this, "The Facts About Facebook" writing, "We don't sell people's data, even though it's often reported that we do. In fact, selling people's information to advertisers would be counter to our business' interest, because it would reduce the unique value of our service to advertisers. We have a strong incentive to protect people's information from being accessed by anyone else."Joining me right now is the Wall Street Journal's Editor-at-Large, Gerry Baker, to talk more about this. Good to see you, Gerry.GERRY BAKER, EDITOR-AT-LARGE, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Good morning, Maria.BARTIROMO: What was your reaction to the op-ed?BAKER: Well, clearly, Facebook has been under tremendous pressure for the last couple of years. They've been called out in a number of ways that have been incredibly embarrassing the company. The stock is down hugely, there's massive reputational damage. Everything they do to try to repair this seems to make it worse. So, what he's trying to do, he's trying to reset and to say, look, here are some basic facts about the company, some of them -- all of which are true, not necessarily all of which are the most relevant facts. You know, we don't -- we don't sell data, we do -- you know, we do our best, we take privacy very seriously. The reality is though that the business model is a revenue-generating model that depends on the ability of advertisers to reach the people who use Facebook.BARTIROMO: And to know all the details about you. So, can you really say you're not selling the data?BAKER: Yes, they don't have to know everything. But they want -- the unique ability of Facebook is that it's so large, the scale of it reaches so large, the number of users it has, but if you're an advertiser and you're trying to reach a particular segment, a particular sub-segment of an audience, you can do it through Facebook. So, Facebook is giving the advertisers access to the users of Facebook. That's how he makes the money. There's no way around that. They can put privacy protections in to stop them getting certain types of (INAUDIBLE) they can -- they can encourage users if they want to protect themselves by opting out of certain services that they use, but the fundamental business model is about selling people's information, selling people -- selling access to people's information to advertisers who are willing to pay a lot of money.BARTIROMO: Well, that's what I'm saying. So, how can you say you're not selling data when in fact, that's basically what advertisers are paying for?BAKER: That's a very narrow description what he's saying. They don't actually take the data and sell it to some third party, what they are doing is they are selling access to the people, to the users themselves to the advertisers, so they're not -- you know, again, they're not actually taking the data and selling it, but they are giving profiles, essentially they are -- because they have so many users, advertisers will choose to advertise to particular groups, and they can do that through Facebook because they have so many people.BARTIROMO: Ladies in New York, that's the business, selling access to person's data. Is that selling data?HIGGINS: Yes. In an indirect way. So, you know, it's a bit like what the definition of 'is' is. You can --BARTIROMO: Right. Exactly.HIGGINS: So, you can technically say that you're not selling the data, but the reality is that you're selling the access. And I think Facebook's problem is not just the people recognize that they're selling their data, but it is also won the whole argument about censorship and social control, trying to decide what's permitted speech because it fits their political agenda versus a very double standard if you're a conservative.And then you start seeing what's going on in countries like China, where it was just recently reported, for example, that if you don't have enough fit bit steps, then you don't improve your social standing. And your social standing gets determined by the government which then determines what you're not only ability is to access social media but also to travel, to have certain jobs. People are starting to realize that there is a price to all of this data being acquired in terms of where they are, what they're doing, your phone is no longer a phone, it's a tracking device. We're using ways and loving --BARTIROMO: Yes, that's absolutely right. And by the way, everything you're saying -- everything you're saying is making me think about China. I mean, because that's exactly what they do in China, you've got your own score, and the way you behave will either increase the score or decrease the score, and that will dictate whether or not you can get on a train or get on a plane, or do anything. The other thing, Gerry -- what were you going to say?BAKER: Yes. It's a bit of a leap from what Facebook are doing to what Chinese government (INAUDIBLE)BARTIROMO: Yes. No, no, I'm talking about what -- I'm talking --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Heather just said in --BAKER: Yes, when you -- when you sign up Facebook, you're doing it voluntarily, nobody's requiring you to do it. And if you, you know, behave in particular ways, Facebook doesn't punish you by -- in a way the Chinese government is proposing to do. But, yes -- but this -- look, when -- if anybody -- if anybody has a digital profile, they are amassing data about themselves and they are handing that data essentially over to powerful organizations, companies, governments, and other things.BARTIROMO: Yes.BAKER: That is a fundamental problem. You know, we're all grappling with this. The European Union last year just introduced this thing, GDPR, which we're all familiar with, whereby people now have to -- have certain rights, and they are -- they are able to protect those rights whenever they are using -- whenever they're accessing Web sites or other -- or other forms of content. But it is a huge -- this is a massive problem. If we are all -- essentially now, all of our information, every time -- all of the information that we put out there is collected, is available and it's -- and will presumably someday be accessed by somebody.BARTIROMO: Yes. The other thing is that Facebook CEO Zuckerberg is really responding to a lot of his colleagues who've come out aggressively against this, you've got everybody from Tim Cook to Ginni Rometty, saying we do not save your data, we don't do any of this, pointing the finger basically suggesting that Facebook does in fact, do this and sell the access.BAKER: There's no question. Again, back to the point, this is their business model. It's not Apple's business model to collect -- to sell advertising. It is Facebook's business model to do that. In order to do that effectively, they need to collect people's data.BARTIROMO: Let's move onto the shutdown because the Senate failed to move two dueling bills yesterday, aimed at ending the partial government shutdown. Now, we're in day 35, Gerry, another pay period that government workers are missing. President Trump calling for down payment now on the wall as part of a deal. Airlines feeling the strain. JetBlue CEO said, we are close to a tipping point in our travel, your reaction?BAKER: This has got to come to an end soon. It's not good for anybody, it's not good for the 800,000 government workers and the million-plus contractors who are associated. It's not good for the public because there are certain aspects of what these government employees do that are starting to impact people's lives, and I think it is -- it is -- it is rather tragic that this political game is being played in Washington with increasingly important public services and with the lives and the livelihoods of people who work there. It's got to come to an end. It's not doing anybody any good in Washington, it seems to be, according to all the polling, hurting the President more than it's hurting the Democrats and that's understandable, because he said I own this, it's my -- it's my responsibility and because he's the President. And I think they've got to find a way. They've got to find its --And the ridiculous thing is they're not that far apart. The Democrats have agreed to funding for increase security at the border, they've agreed to that, or they have included in their own spending bill a certain amount of extra funding for that. The President has dropped his insistence that it'd be called a wall. You can call it a wall or fence or whatever. They're arguing over the semantics of what you call it, and a billion or two dollars in a -- in a trillion -- in a trillion-dollar plus budget. It -- and the livelihoods of so many people are at stake. And increasingly, the lives of people are at stake.BARTIROMO: Dagen, I want to get your take on this, but also on this, taxing the wealthy, presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has, in fact, proposed a tax on America's wealthiest household. This proposal include an annual two percent tax on household wealth above $50 million, and an addition one percent tax on wealth above $1 billion. National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow responded to the proposal last night on Fox Business' "LOU DOBBS TONIGHT," watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LARRY KUDLOW, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL: Let's tax all the rich people, let's confiscate all the wealth people earn, let's destroy private sector incentives and market-base reforms. So, you know what happens? Everybody is equal, nobody has any money. Nobody has any money except the dictator and a handful of generals. This stuff has been tried for all of these hundred years, it never works and always makes the country poorer.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Dagen, your reaction?MCDOWELL: A big noisy argument from Elizabeth Warren to drown out Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and what she proposed which was the top income tax bracket of 70 percent. But this doesn't work unless -- like I said, all the other countries in the world join in and tax wealth because, as you said, money is mobile, billionaires will go somewhere else, multimillionaires will go somewhere else, and ultimately, it prevents investment in the United States. And that's what makes our economy vibrant and robust. It won't go anywhere, it'll be interesting, though, to see how the Democratic candidates for president respond to Elizabeth Warren.HIGGINS: It makes sense for a world that is the politics of envy.BARTIROMO: Yes. Yes, that's right.HIGGINS: It doesn't make (INAUDIBLE) where you think that it's a zero (INAUDIBLE) society, but if you understand that there actually is such a thing as growth and exactly what Dagen said, that it's all about income being mobile and this is actually suppressing people's ability to rise, then it's a bad idea.MCDOWELL: And it's likely unconstitutional.BARTIROMO: And as I -- as I always say, I remind people to go to the TaxFoundation.org because the top 10 percent of earners already pay 71 percent of all income taxes already. Gerry Baker, it's good to have you weigh in on all of this.BAKER: There's massive inequality in this country. It's getting worse. It's getting dramatically worse.BARTIROMO: What's the answer?BAKER: The -- what's happening also is the mobility -- income ability is getting less, so people used to being able to move up the mobility scale, they don't anymore. There is real concerns about this. I think there are all kinds of problems with the plan that Elizabeth Warren has come up with, but I don't doubt for a second that there is increasing anger in the country. You know, we're here in Davos, Maria, with all of these people who go around preaching and telling everybody what they should be doing when actually --BARTIROMO: After they (INAUDIBLE) on their private jets.BAKER: -- they get richer and richer and richer every year, and the middle class people in the United States are getting screwed year after year after year -- medium wage, and people are angry about it, and Elizabeth Warren and the Democrats are going to tap into that anger. Don't be surprised --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Well, let me tell you, what surprises me is the issue of education never comes up in all of these subjects. I mean, we need to discuss education and arming people on all income levels to actually be better prepared for the workforce and what's needed. Gerry, it's great to see you.BAKER: Thank you very much.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much, Gerry Baker. Be sure to catch Maria Bartiromo's "WALL STREET" tonight at 9:00 p.m. Eastern, followed by "WSJ AT LARGE WITH GERRY BAKER" at 9:30. That's in Fox Business right here, join us back to back tonight. But first, quick break right here, and we've got a lot more live, stay with usBARTIROMO: Welcome back. Some earnings news this morning, Intel this morning is down, following the company's weak outlook. Cheryl Casone in New York with the headlines, Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, Intel, Maria, is lower in the premarket right now. Fell about seven percent in after-hours trading, it's down a little more than five percent right now. This is a Dow component. Their fourth-quarter revenue, 18.7 billion, it missed the estimate. They posted an adjusted profit of a $1.28 a share. Now, that did beat, but this is the world's largest chipmaker, and this weak outlook for the current quarter is raising fears about a chip slowdown, and that of course infected some other -- there's talks as well like NVIDIA might be under pressure as well today.Let's talk about Starbucks, higher in the premarket, a little more than 3- 1/2 percent right now. They reported better-than-expected results. Adjusted profit, $0.75 a share that beat estimates. Revenue 6.63 billion, topped estimates expectations. In China, there was worries about the numbers in China and Starbucks actually did OK in China, so some good news on Starbucks.Let's talk about Venezuela, the military there has thrown its support behind socialist dictator Nicolas Maduro. That has dealt a blow to the U.S. effort to back opposition leader Juan Guaido, excuse me, as President. Meanwhile, nonemergency American workers are on their way home from Venezuela amid all of the chaos there. Two days ago, Maduro gave all U.S. diplomats 72 hours to leave. In an interview with Maria yesterday, United Nations Secretary General Antonio Gutierrez called on leaders in Venezuela to end this crisis.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ANTONIO GUTIERREZ, SECRETARY GENERAL, UNITED NATIONS: We are trying to do it at all cost, a surge in diplomacy for peace and to bring those that can't have any funds on the situations of conflict to explain that these wars that we witness are wars nobody wins. There are no military solutions. The solutions must be solving the root causes of the conflict, and making sure that peace prevails.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: China, Turkey, and Russia also are standing behind Maduro and they are criticizing the United States for intervening. Well, General Colin Powell gets help changing a flat tire along a Washington, D.C. highway by a veteran who lost his leg in Afghanistan. The veteran, Anthony Maggert, couldn't believe that it was the former Secretary of State, a man he had long admired. He later messaged Powell in Facebook, calling him an inspiration. The general responded, writing in part, "You touched my soul and reminded me about what this country is all about, and why it is so great." And a great story. And it's nice to see Colin Powell. He looks pretty good, Maria.BARTIROMO: Oh, my God, that is such a good story, Cheryl.CASONE: It really is.BARTIROMO: I love it. Thank you so much. We'll take a short break. When we come back, stocks surge. Shares of PG&E up this morning after the company cleared -- is cleared for responsibility for the deadly 2017 Tubbs wildfire -- what it means for the company's future. As you can see there, the stock really reacted. Then, unlimited redemption, MoviePass attempts to recoup its loses by offering its unlimited movie plan one more time, details there. Back in a minute right here, live from Davos.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We are looking at a higher opening this morning for stock prices. Take a look at Futures, not the high of the morning, up 190 points on the Dow Industrials, three quarters of one percent. The S&P is up 21, almost one percent. And the NASDAQ 73 points higher, that's almost -- that's better than one percent, actually. It's been, of course, a volatile few weeks for markets, uncertainty of about global growth, about trade as well. S&P Global is one of the leading providers of ratings, benchmarks, and analytics in the global capital and commodities markets. Joining me right now is the CEO of S&P Global Douglas Pearson. Doug, it's good to see you.DOUG PEARSON, CEO, S&P GLOBAL: Hi, great to see you.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. So, based on your research in terms of ratings, in terms of assessing where we are in the global economy, how do you see things?PEARSON: Well, we see a slowdown in the economy from the last couple of years. As you recall last year, we were all here, it was a synchronous global growth.BARTIROMO: Yes, I remember.PEARSON: And now, we've got some slowdowns. I --BARTIROMO: Yes, it's sort of a synchronized global slowdowns.PEARSON: Global slowdown, but it's -- but nobody -- if you look -- if we went back a few years ago, and the we said that the globe was going to grow 3.5 percent, that was actually up. So, we're slowing down, China is slowing down a little bit but off of a massive base. Right now, the things that I hear in Davos that people are generally concerned about relate to trade policy, Brexit, shutdown in the United States, these are the things that are kind of self-inflicted wounds, which are creating some political tension and uncertainty in the markets.BARTIROMO: Because they do impact the economy. I believe there were two firms today that cut their estimates for the U.S. economy, expecting the GDP now to be under two percent, out of J.P. Morgan, anyway. S&P Global is launching a campaign on workforce inclusivity, which you presented here in Davos on Wednesday. Tell me about that because we know that work is changing dramatically with technology.PEARSON: Well, it is. And what we presented here was all about the participation of women in the labor force. We did some analysis, we went back 40 years ago to see what economies have evolved the most in terms of women participation in labor force, and stars are the Scandinavian countries, Norway, Sweden, Iceland, Finland. And we did projections around that, and what we're launching now is the campaign called "Change Pace" it is trying to create a dialogue about having more women in the workforce. So, people that are heroes like you --BARTIROMO: Thank you.PEARSON: -- that we can -- we can look up to, and what we found is in the United States itself, if it had continued with the same labor participation rate for women from 40 years ago to now, our economy would be six percent bigger, $1.6 trillion larger, $5,000 per capita, larger in terms of our economy, and the stock market would also be a lot bigger.BARTIROMO: So, why don't we have that already? I mean, if you've got the performance, whether you're a man or a woman, why aren't we seeing more women in leadership positions then? And you wanted to take us through the economic impact of increased hiring of females in the workplace.PEARSON: Well, there's social issues around the globe, there's cultural issues, but there's also political issues, where we see the economies that have the most advanced approach to maternity leave, to paternity leave, that have ways to provide health care that's not just your neighbor or your grandmother, these are the economies that have more women in the workforce. And also, it starts with companies like our own. You know, we have a long way to go ourselves, and we are finding ways to improve our own working system and building a really strong pipeline of women into our senior management.BARTIROMO: What happens when robotics take over jobs, whether it's men or women?PEARSON: Well, robotics is one of those topics that we spend a lot of time here at Davos. We spend a lot of time in our own company, thinking about it, and it's not just the robotics, it's really the workforce of the future. There will be a lot of new jobs created. We think about jobs that will go away, but remember when we used to worry about people that were bellhops, and people that were doing jobs that no longer exist, those jobs created new jobs, the travel industry came up with completely new jobs that were never there before.BARTIROMO: Well, that also requires education.PEARSON: Absolutely.BARTIROMO: So, it takes me back to what I said moments ago, I don't understand why education is not a bigger part of these subjects. You need to train people in order to get those jobs around A.I. What does a steelworker know about engineering?PEARSON: Well, there's two aspects that, one of them is just basic education, and I was really frustrated in the last campaign in the United States that not one person ever talked about education.BARTIROMO: Crazy.PEARSON: It was never talked about, ever.BARTIROMO: Yes, you're right. Doug, it's good to see you.PEARSON: Great. Thank you so much.BARTIROMO: Thanks so much. Doug Pearson joining us. S&P Global. Coming up, a shift at the Super Bowl, Coca-Cola announces it will not have an ad during the big game for the first time in 11 years. Details coming up. And then, Tom Brady busted, how one kid's science project proves that deflategate is still alive and well. Back in a moment.ANNOUNCER: Here again is Maria Bartiromo with a special edition of MORNINGS WITH MARIA, live from Davos, Switzerland, at the World Economic Forum.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, everybody, happy Friday to you, it is Friday, January 25th, your top stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.It is day 35 of the partial government shutdown, furloughed workers now missing their second paycheck under the longest shutdown in U.S. history. This has two bills meant to end the shutdown yesterday, were defeated in the Senate.Futures this morning are rallying, we're expecting a strong open this morning, stock prices, Dow Industrials up 183 points, 3 quarters of 1 percent. S&P is also up three quarters of a percent. And the NASDAQ, with a 70-point move higher, is up better than one percent.This after a relatively flat day yesterday for stock prices, take a look at the indices at the close, where the Dow lost 22 points, the S&P was up 3, and the NASDAQ was up 47.In Europe this morning, we do have some momentum. Although, once again, it's fractional in the U.K., up 23 points on the FT-100, the CAC Quarante in Paris, doing well, up about a percent, 47 points higher, and the DAX Index in Germany, up 171 points, that's good enough for a 1-1/2 percent move higher, in Germany.Asian markets finished higher across the board, overnight, best performer there was Hong Kong and Korea, by the way, Korea up 1-1/2 percent, Hong Kong, Hang Seng Index up 1-2/3 percent.PG&E has been cleared. The stock is reacting. It is up nearly 75 percent after investigators determined that the company was in fact not responsible for one of the deadliest fires in California history, we'll tell you why the stock is taking a hit in the premarket this morning, all that coming up.Then, back to the movies, how Movie Pass is trying to get you in the theater, once again, with a new version of its controversial unlimited plan.Then, gear it up for the Super Bowl, Coca-Cola is out with its new ad, but it will not play during the big game.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A coke.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is a coke.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is a coke.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's the same for everyone.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You can get one if you wanted.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No matter where you're from.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He drinks Coke and she drinks Coke.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Even though they disagree.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And while the bottles look alike, you aren't the same as me.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: We'll tell you why Coke is opting out of the big game, coming up.Bad news for Tom Brady, this morning, how a 10-year-old won a science fair for proving that the football star did cheat. We will tell you about it.But first, our top story this half an hour, China, opening up to Wall Street, yesterday, China Securities Regulatory Commission, Vice Chairman Fang Xinghai, said China will give more licenses to Wall Street banks that seek a majority ownership in local securities in the next six months.Earlier this week, I spoke with Dr. Fang, on my panel, here on Davos. Here's what he had to say about China opening up to global companies.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DR. FANG XINGHAI, VICE CHAIRMAN, CHINA SECURITIES REGULATORY COMMISSION: China, right now, seems to focus on, you know, macro demand management. The supply policy has not been stopped and we continue to push forward for supply side, what we call supply side structural reform.And I will give you a few example, you open up the financial sector for more international competition, is one example. China's vision for the economy is to make it open and large and competitive, so it's not only an opportunity for the Chinese companies, but, you know, also be a huge opportunity for all the companies around the world.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: You saw Axel Weber on that panel, as well. Dr. Weber joined me yesterday, remember? And he said right now, UBS has been the first bank to actually be allowed to operate in China and own 51 percent within 3 years, 100 percent, so UBS has been first. Earlier this month, I sat down with J.P. Morgan Chase CEO, Jamie Dimon. He expressed interest in opening up operations in China, he's waiting for approval.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: You can't go to China and open up a bank and own it outright?JAMIE DIMON, CEO, J.P. MORGAN CHASE: No, we've applied for a license. And I still hope when all of this stuff get settled, that we actually get a license and we build, you know, 100 percent owned major investment bank and do everything we can do at Hong Kong, London, Singapore, New York, that we can do in Shanghai, effectively.BARTIROMO: But right now, you're going to have to go in as a joint venture, 49 percent owned, right?DIMON: Yes. We are --we have limited (INAUDIBLE)BARTIROMO: Yes.DIMON: But the Chinese have told us that they are going to open up.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: And it does feel, Dagen, that the Chinese that's one thing that they are willing to do, your reaction to all of this because this is obviously something that all the major financial institutions want at, given the 1.4 billion population in China.MCDOWELL: It's a little bit of a peace offering, I think, to the United States and the rest of the world that China is moving to do this, the question is, will Wall Street banks and institutions be willing to operate at this level in China, because again, this is what President Trump and the trade negotiations are trying to tackle, the force to surrender of technology, intellectual property theft, and even cyber espionage.So, if you're a major bank based here in the United States or in Europe, are you really going to be willing to do that kind of business in China until you have assurances from that government in that country, maybe the president here can tackle that.BARTIROMO: Yes, I don't think -- I mean, I find it very hard to believe that that culture, changes, the theft of I.P., the force transfer of technology. I do think the major financial institutions want in, because this 1.4 billion person population, eventually, slowly but surely, are moving up the income ladder, I mean, it's a small portion of that so far.But they're going to need everything from credit cards to mortgages, so we'll see about that. But right now, it feels like that's one of the things that China is willing to give on, in this upcoming meeting.Meanwhile, Wall Street on Capitol Hill, executives of the sixth largest U.S. banks are expected to testify before the House Financial Services Committee, this spring, this is the first time, banks will testify since right after the financial crisis.The House Financial Services Committee is chaired by Democrat, Maxine Waters, it includes freshman Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who is calling for a 70 percent income tax on the wealthy, what will AOC ask of the big banks? This is going to be something to watch, Dagen.MCDOWELL: Lending to lower-income Americans, things that will close the, you know, inequality gap in this country. And it's interesting because she has made a big -- a big to do about not taking money from any of these financial institutions.You know they have historically poured money into every politician's pockets, so will she be tougher on them, than some of the other people on the committee, I don't know.BARTIROMO: Yes, we'll see about that. But interesting that this is one of their big issues, bring those banks in, let's interrogate them and see what we can get. Look, we've been talking about that in a lot of subjects this week. We had a big week here in Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum. In case you missed it, some of the top highlights for the week, right now.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)RAY DALIO, FOUNDER, BRIDGEWATER ASSOCIATES: Europe has a negative growth and the United States is going to have a negative growth environment. I don't mean absolute negative, I mean, slowing of growth in a material way that could be close to between zero and two percent, over the next 18 months.But I think we can expect much greater polarity and with that, I think that'll be a market driving influence as we're moving ahead.BRIAN MOYNIHAN, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, BANK OF AMERICA: The confusion in the environment right now is, is it the slowdown or is it going into recession, nothing we see says it's close to recession.KEVIN HASSETT, CHAIRMAN, WHITE HOUSE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISORS: We've been getting stronger numbers in the U.S., you know, despite the government shutdown. I'm looking at a third quarter that's very close to three, which gives a year of about three, and an enormous amount of capital spending in the industrial production last week, suggested there's a lot of momentum going forward for the U.S., especially if we can get this government shutdown worked out.STEPHEN SCHWARZMAN, CHAIRMAN, BLACKSTONE GROUP: What we are seeing is the economy slowed a bit, remember, it was at 4.2 percent growth, which is almost unheard of for a country our size, in the second quarter. And then the third quarter, we were at 3.5 percent.CHUCK ROBBINS, CEO, CISCO: I actually believe that we should be super impressed with the resilience of the global economy over the last few years and the face of all of these things and that's the thing that gives me hope.GINNI ROMETTY, CEO, IBM: Governments are anxious to regulate, and so my recommendation strong has been, there needs to be what I call precision regulation, like precision medicine, right? You don't want the doctor to kill the whole body, when he's just treating one piece.In the precision, meaning, we do need for consumer privacy consent, opt in, opt out, see your data, be able to remove yourself, that's where we need some regulation and liability.BRAD SMITH, PRESIDENT, MICROSOFT: We don't have the same legal freedom that we do in other countries, but at the same time, you know, we stick to our guns. There are certain principles that we think it's important to stand-up for, and you know, we'll, you know, go at times into the negotiating room and, you know, the negotiations are sometimes pretty darn direct.And I think, more than ever, you know, tech companies really need to think about these things, they need to be principled and you have to have a little moral courage, in my view, if you're going to be in this business and really take care of your customer.JENS STOLTENBERG, SECRETARY GENERAL, NATO: We are -- NATO is an alliance with 29 allies from both sides of the Atlantic, with different political parties and government, different history, different culture, and some are neighbors of Russia, some are not.So, there are differences. Despite those differences, for instance, on this pipeline from Russia, we are always been able to unite the NATO around our (INAUDIBLE) and that is that we protect and defend each other, one for all and all for one.TONY BLAIR, FORMER PRIME MINISTER OF UNITED KINGDOM: And basically, we've got a choice, we can stay close to Europe to minimize the economic damage of falling out of the trading system we've been in for even four decades. But if we do that, and we are obliged to stay bound by Europe's rules, then it's a kind of pointless Brexit. You know, why have you done it?If we decide right, we're going to break free of this trading system and we're going to set our own rules, then you got a painful period of economic adjustment. So, this is the pointless versus painful dilemma of the government's in.BOB DUDLEY, CEO, BP: We produced about 20 percent of what we have in the ground down on the Gulf of Mexico. It's great for the United States. And by using new technologies, we image things, we could see the reservoirs easier and we found what we think are another billion barrels of reserves without having a drill to find them.JAMES QUINCEY, CEO, COCA-COLA: So, we've been able to focus on sparkling, making them grow faster by focusing on some reformulations (INAUDIBLE) bring down the sugar, dial up, Coke Zero, Diet Coke. But then, getting to other categories, and most recently, into some high-end sports drinks in the U.S., investing in -- investing in the coffee business, and a whole series of portfolio tranches around the world.JIM FITTERLING, CEO, DOW: The waste issue has to be tackled, we get that, it's not acceptable to have a sustainable product like plastics and lose that sustainability when it becomes waste in the environment. So, our mission is very clear, we're going to stop the plastic waste going into the environment.(END VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: Big week, Dagen, in New York. You know, it's interesting, there weren't many leaders of state here, so there's a lot of business people.MCDOWELL: Thank goodness, we love hearing -- we love hearing from people who make decisions about really that help grow the global economy and add jobs and spread prosperity. You started the week with Ray Dalio, who is super -- I would say, super negative. He's looking at zero to --BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: -- two percent growth in the United States, a Federal Reserve that's probably going to loosen, you know, cut interest rates, rather than even --BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: But again, these CEOs are much more optimistic than that.BARTIROMO: That's true. Yes, he said the Fed will not be able to raise rates in '19, maybe they'll have to cut in 2020, and we'll see what happens with the balance sheet there in the enwind.A quick break here, PG&E has been cleared, details into the 2017 tabs fire probe, next. And then, Movie Pass' redemption, the company helping to revamp and recoup losses by bringing back that controversial unlimited pass, back in a moment, right here.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Shares of PG&E are surging this morning, 75 percent higher after company was cleared in a 2017 wildfire. Cheryl Casone with details now in New York, Cheryl.CASONE: This have a big overhang, Maria, on PG&E, but the stock, as you mentioned, jumping. California fire investigators now say, the utility did not cause the deadliest fire in a series of wild fires that happened back in 2017. The Tubbs Fire killed 22 people and destroyed nearly 37,000 acres. The investigators say, the fire was caused by private electrical system. State officials have yet to determine whether PG&E equipment caused last year's campfire -- so there could be more to come for PG&E.We're getting some breaking news in the Fox Business this morning. A long- time ally of President Trump Roger Stone has been arrested in Florida. Robert Mueller Special Counsel's office says that Stone was taken into custody early this morning following a grand jury indictment. Now, Stone is charged with seven counts -- in those counts, that includes obstruction, witness tampering and making false statements. We're going to have more on this story as it develops as we go through the indictment here at Fox Business.Meanwhile President Trump's one-time attorney, Michael Cohen, has received congressional subpoena to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee. Now, lawmakers want Cohen to address a number of unanswered questions they call it, before he heads to prison in March. Now, the subpoena comes one day after Cohen postponed testimony in front of the House Oversight Committee. Cohen's attorney says his family is being threatened -- and they blame President Trump and Trump's current attorney Rudy Giuliani.Well, MoviePass is bringing back its unlimited plan. The company used to offer the plan that lets you watch as many movies as you want for $9.95 a month. Well, after hitting cashflow problems, the subscription price had to be raised and customers were limited to three movies per week. MoviePass is not yet saying how much the new unlimited plan is going to cost -- they're going to launch it next week. And I know you've interviewed executives from MoviePass, Maria, and we've been following that story. Back to you.BARTIROMO: Yes, all right, thank you, Cheryl. Coming up next, as countdown is on to the Super Bowl, Coca-Cola out with its new ad, but it is not playing during the big game, details coming up. Then, Tom Brady busted; how this kid's science proves that the quarterback cheated during Deflategate scandal. We're going to tell you what this 10-year-old came up with. Back in a momentBARTIROMO: Well, the big game is on the way. Super Bowl LIII, now nine days away. It's not just teens going at it during the big game. Jared Max with more on the soda wars, Jared.JARED MAX, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SPORTS REPORTER: Maria, good morning. Coca-Cola has given us some of the best ads in Super Bowl history. But for the first time in 12 years, we will not see a Coke ad during the America's most-watched telecast of the year. However, we will see this ad that celebrates unity just before the game -- part of the pregame show broadcast. Coke says, it wanted this ad inspired by 1975 Andy Warhol quote to air just before the national anthem. As Americans come together in living rooms to remind everyone that together is beautiful. The company says, "The ad brings to life the idea that Coke is for everyone, with its closing line: We all have different hearts and hands; heads holding various views. Don't you see? Different is beautiful. And together, is beautiful too." Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey joined MORNINGS WITH MARIA this week in Davos.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Do you have plans for a big ad campaign around the Super Bowl?QUINCEY: We do marketing all-year-round, including we show spots at the Super Bowl or just before the Super Bowl. And we'll do something again this year, but to all the noise, we just like to say we welcome everyone; it's a great place to come.(END VIDEO CLIP)MAX: The most popular Super Bowl ad ever Coca-Cola (INAUDIBLE). Before the NFL season, two men would make NFL history as male cheerleaders, the first in league. Well, now, these two L.A. Rams cheerleaders, Quinton Peron and Napoleon Jinnies will become the first such male cheerleaders in a Super Bowl. And they say they've inspired many; a lot of males reaching out saying they want to be cheerleaders also.10-year-old, Ace Davis, of Lexington, Kentucky says he hates, hates Tom Brady, which is why he created a project for a science fair to prove that Patriots quarterback, Tom Brady, is a cheater because Brady used deflated footballs a few years back. Ace's sister and mom (INAUDIBLE) footballs, they calculated averages, he won the science fair. Asked what he will say to Tom Brady if he met him: give me some of your money, you don't deserve it.BARTIROMO: Oh, God!MAX: 10-years-old. You get the impression of maybe his dad is not a brady fan.BARTIROMO: I know somebody else who has an opinion on that, with you in New York, Dagen?MCDOWELL: Yes, I hate the Patriots, but you know what, I would never bet against Tom Brady, ever. My favorite moment of the Patriots game against Chiefs was Bob Kraft pushing coat sleeves up, and his cufflinks were Super Bowl rings. It was awesome.BARTIROMO: He's got to flaunt it.HIGGINS: The only way to support Brady is to be from Massachusetts, Connecticut or New Hampshire, and anyone else has a more realistic view of the Patriots. But again, as Dagen says, you don't bet against them, but you do love to hate them.MAX: Everybody, I think -- unless you're in New England or maybe in New Orleans this week, you're rooting against Tom Brady in the Super Bowl but just for a moment. Step back and think years from now, you're going to love to tell your grandkids or tell somebody, I got to see the greatest football team ever play. So, while you're hating on the Patriots, just think about that, we are seeing something special here, Maria.MCDOWELL: Kumbaya, Jared.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: No, that's a good point.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Together is beautiful.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: Thanks, guys.

Top US general to meet with Google on China security worriesAssociated Press InternationalMarch 21, 2019 Thursday 11:59 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: WASHINGTON DATELINELength: 509 wordsByline: By LOLITA C. BALDOR, Associated PressDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) - The top U.S. military officer will meet with Google representatives next week amid growing concerns that American companies doing business in China are helping its military gain ground on the U.S.Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Wednesday that efforts like Google's artificial intelligence venture in China allow the Chinese military to access and take advantage of U.S.-developed technology."This is not about me and Google," Dunford told an audience at the Atlantic Council. "This is about us looking at the second and third order of effects of our business ventures in China, Chinese form of government, and the impact it's going to have on the United States' ability to maintain a competitive military advantage."Google says its AI activities in China are focused on "education, research on natural language understanding and market algorithms, and development of globally available tools."In a statement last week Google said it is not working with the Chinese military. And the company said that it continues to work with the U.S. government, including the Defense Department, in many areas, including cybersecurity, recruiting and healthcare.Dunford's comments reflect widespread U.S. government worries that any information or data an American company has or uses as it does business in China is automatically available to the Chinese government and its military.U.S. companies in China are required to have a cell of the communist party present, said Dunford, adding, "that will lead to that intellectual property from that company finding its way to the Chinese military."Last week he and acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan expressed similar concerns during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing."We watch with great concern when industry partners work in China knowing that there is that indirect benefit," Dunford said during the hearing. "And frankly, indirect may be not a full characterization of the way it really is. It's more of a direct benefit to the Chinese military."Shanahan also noted that Google is stepping away from some Pentagon contracts.Internal protests by workers at Google led the tech company to say last year that it is dropping out of Project Maven, which uses algorithms to interpret drone video images from conflict zones. Employees had complained that Google was helping with technology that could improve lethal targeting.Shanahan told senators that $5 trillion of China's economy is state-owned enterprises, "so the technology that is developed in the civilian world transfers to the military world. It's a direct pipeline. Not only is there a transfer, there's also systemic theft of U.S. technology that also facilitates even faster development of emerging technology."As a result, Shanahan said the U.S. military needs to continue to invest in artificial intelligence, adding that funding would double in the proposed 2020 budget.The Joint Staff did not release details on the timing of Dunford's meeting next week or who would be attending from Google.Load-Date: March 22, 2019End of Document

China's top gay dating app stops accepting new users after claims it put minors at riskCNN WireJanuary 7, 2019 Monday 12:18 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 678 wordsByline: By Jethro Mullen and Nanlin Fang, CNN BusinessDateline: BEIJING (CNN Business) BodyBEIJING (CNN Business) --  China's most popular gay dating app has temporarily stopped accepting new users after allegations that it put underage people at risk by letting them sign up.Blued, which says it has more than 40 million users worldwide, said in a statement Sunday that the week-long halt will enable it to review the claims and make improvements to the app.The announcement followed a report Saturday by Chinese financial news publication Caixin in which Blued was accused of failing to protect young teenagers. The report cited a researcher who said the app let boys set up profiles in which they falsely claimed to be 18 or older, exposing them to explicit content and sexual exploitation. Blued is the latest high profile app to come under increased scrutiny in China over safety concerns.Founded by a former police officer, Blued has expanded rapidly in recent years despite homosexuality remaining a delicate subject in China. The app has moved beyond straightforward matchmaking services into live-streaming and gaming. Last year, it raised $100 million in funds, and its CEO has talked about issuing shares in the company on a US stock exchange.Caixin's article questioned whether the company took enough steps as it grew to prevent underage people from using it. According to the researcher it cited, Qingdao University sexologist Zhang Beichuan, multiple high-school students said they had been pressured into having sex with older men after meeting them through the app. Zhang and the head of an unidentified Chinese LGBT community welfare group told Caixin that some underage users of Blued said they had contracted HIV, the virus that can cause AIDS, from people they met through the app.The company stressed in its statement that it has been putting resources into AIDS prevention and treatment for years and promised to do more to educate its users about the risks."What we have done on AIDS prevention is seen by all," Blued founder and CEO Ma Baoli told CNN on Monday. "We probably are the best and we have done the most. Our priority now is to supervise and examine our content."New measures promisedMa, who also goes by the alias Geng Le, said people under the age of 18 are forbidden from using the app, in line with Chinese regulations. Blued is promising that it will improve its efforts to detect accounts set up by underage users and block illegal content. It will also increase the number of notifications warning that people have to be at least 18 to use the app.Homosexuality is no longer illegal in China, and authorities in 2001 removed it from the official list of mental disorders. But activists and experts say prejudices and discrimination persist, along with periodic government crackdowns.The Chinese government hasn't objected to gay dating apps, as long as they stick to internet rules that restrict the dissemination of pornography and politically sensitive information. A Chinese company bought US-based gay dating app Grindr in 2016.The Chinese government, which has sought tighter control of social media platforms under President Xi Jinping, hasn't so far commented on the allegations against Blued in the Caixin report.Blued said in its statement that it will continue to accept inspections by the media regulator and other supervisors.Tencent is checking ages In August, Chinese authorities said they were stepping up regulation of online gaming because of concerns about young people becoming addicted to it.Gaming giant Tencent (TCEHY) said in November it would check the identities of all its gamers in China by 2019 with the aim of limiting the hours young people spend playing. It will check gamers' IDs against police databases and block any accounts it can't verify.The country's dominant ride-hailing company, Didi Chuxing, indefinitely suspended a carpooling service on its app last year after two separate killings of female passengers by drivers. The murders caused a public outcry and increased scrutiny from the government.TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Xi Jinping's global dreams hit a wall amid growing backlash against ChinaCNN WireFebruary 16, 2019 Saturday 12:21 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1621 wordsByline: Analysis by Ben Westcott, CNNDateline: HONG KONG (CNN) BodyHONG KONG (CNN) --  With the shock election of anti-globalist Donald Trump to the US presidency still fresh in their minds, international leaders watched with anticipation as Chinese President Xi Jinping stepped up to the podium at Davos in January 2017.Xi's speech in favor of globalization and free trade was met with praise by governments and businesses across the world. "This is a very important speech at an important moment," World Economic Forum founder Klaus Schwab said afterward.Two years later, that international optimism has soured and Beijing faces an increasingly chilly reaction in parts of the world.In the past two months alone, Turkey has denounced Beijing's mass detention centers in Xinjiang, the United Kingdom has accused the Chinese government of widespread hacking and the US has ramped up its campaign to limit Chinese influence worldwide.At the same time, multiple countries have threatened to cut relations with private Chinese technology giant Huawei over concerns its 5G network will provide Beijing with a backdoor to a global spy network. Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute, said the backlash was the result of an unexpectedly aggressive foreign policy led by Xi. But he warned Beijing's stance was unlikely to change."Xi Jinping has changed the politics in China. He cannot afford to, or would prefer not to show, any signs of weakness," he said.China threat 'panic' in the USAs China's economic and military might have grown in the past decade, the US has generally tried to maintain a policy of cordial engagement with Beijing.But a fierce speech by US Vice President Mike Pence in October signaled the beginning of a shift in Washington, as he bluntly accused Beijing of technology theft, "predatory" economics and military aggression.The speech represented exasperation over Beijing's controversial island-building program in the South China Sea and China's demands for American companies to hand over their technologyWashington also believes the Chinese government's programs issuing of billion-dollar loans to developing nations are being used as economic blackmail for political gain when repayments can't be made.The Chinese Foreign Ministry has repeatedly called such claims "ridiculous and absurd.""Unlike the United States, China has absolutely no interest in controlling other nations' politics. The global community is very clear about that," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Wednesday.But in the months following Pence's speech, multiple US indictments have been unsealed against Chinese actors accusing them of espionage.High-ranking US security officials have lined up to appear before US Congress and at prominent events, warning of the threat China poses not only to their country, but to the world."Through fear and coercion Beijing is working to expand its ideology in order to bend, break and replace the existing rules-based international order," Adm. Philip Davidson, the commander of US Indo-Pacific Command, said in Washington Tuesday.Meanwhile, the Trump administration has engaged in a raging trade war with Beijing, slamming billions of dollars of tariffs being on Chinese goods. A deadline for a deal is fast approaching on March 1.Susan Shirk, chair of the 21st Century China Center at UC San Diego, said a bipartisan consensus had hardened in Washington against Beijing over the past year. "There's a panic about the China threat," she said. "There's a kind of rushing to erect walls, in a way that I see as an overreaction."The US vs HuaweiSince the beginning of this year, Western concerns about China's growing influence -- and its intentions -- have increasingly centered around one company: Huawei.The Chinese technology juggernaut is a symbol of China's economic rise, growing over just 30 years to become one of the world's leading 5G network providers, in the process signing major contracts in countries on every continent.Increasingly, the US has been pressuring allies to avoid using Huawei technology, citing the company's potential links to Beijing's security services.During his Europe trip on Monday, US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo gave countries a thinly veiled ultimatum: it's the US or Huawei. "If that (Huawei) equipment is co-located in places where we have important American systems it makes it more difficult for us to partner alongside them," he said. Since the beginning of this year, Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic, Lithuania and the United Kingdom have all voiced concerns about Huawei. In November, New Zealand banned Huawei from being used by a major telecommunications company, while British telecommunications giant Vodafone last month suspended its use of Huawei technology in Europe.Huawei has rushed to reassure customers that their data would not be handed over to the Chinese government. In a rare interview in January, founder Ren Zhengfai said the company would "never harm" its customers.But US allies believe concerns over Chinese digital spying are well-founded.Last December, Jeremy Hunt, the British foreign secretary, claimed the Chinese Ministry of State Security had worked with a group known as APT 10 to target intellectual property and sensitive commercial data in Europe, Asia and the US."This campaign is one of the most significant and widespread cyber intrusions against the UK and allies uncovered to date," Hunt said.China's furious response to the arrest of Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, in Canada last December has not helped quiet fears over the company's ties to Beijing. Meng was arrested for possible extradition to the US on charges of violating Iran sanctions.Since then, multiple Canadians in China have been detained -- and one citizen was rapidly retried on drug charges then sentenced to death. "What they have utterly failed to see is that by their very strong, overt response ... they are confirming for the first time that Huawei is not a normal company, that Huawei enjoys a special place in the eyes of the Chinese government," Tsang said."And that provides justification for Western governments to revise how they deal with their approach to Huawei."Xinjiang outrage growsChina's human rights record has also come under fire in recent months, as major regional and trading partners with large Muslim populations grew uncomfortable with Beijing's Xinjiang policies.They join an increasingly loud chorus of countries, including the US and Australia, calling for the closure of massive "re-education" camps in the western region of Xinjiang, believed to be holding 2 million Muslim-majority Uyghurs. China claims the camps are "vocational education centers" and an important part of its deradicalization strategy, but former detainees claim to have been tortured and report having seen people die there.It was the fierce denunciation by the Turkish Foreign Ministry of Beijing's Xinjiang policies on February 9 which signaled a new shift against the Chinese government."We call on the international community and the Secretary General of the United Nations to take effective measures in order to bring to an end this human tragedy in Xinjiang," the Turkish statement saidWhile Turkey made the boldest denunciation of China so far, other Muslim majority countries have been steadily losing patience.Despite close trading ties with Beijing, and connection to Xi's Belt and Road initiative, the Indonesian government said it had summoned China's ambassador to demand an explanation in December.In Malaysia, government lawmaker Charles Santiago on Thursday called for an international fact-finding mission to Xinjiang to investigate the treatment of Uyghurs. "I am not prepared to believe what the Chinese governments says," he said.Opposition to China has been growing on multiple fronts in Malaysia, where major Beijing-backed construction projects have been accused of saddling the country with excessive debt."At the larger level, we see Chinese involvement in Southeast Asia in a predatory way," Santiago said. "Clearly, there is a price to be paid -- especially when dealing with China."Disquiet grows within ChinaAs concerns have been raised around the world about China's conduct, Beijing has repeatedly responded with indignation and fierce denials.This belligerence is fueling disquiet, and not just outside China. Questions have been raised behind closed doors in the Chinese government over the aggressive tone of Chinese foreign policy under Xi.Some Chinese officials believe his "over-the-top" remarks on issues such as trade and the South China Sea have caused the Washington backlash.In a major speech in March, Xi threatened to fight a "bloody battle" against China's enemies to ensure the country to take its rightful place in the world.Tsang, the China expert, said if Beijing returned to the less aggressive foreign policy of Xi's predecessor, Hu Jintao, it could help defuse current international tensions."It would actually take some wind out of the sails of the Trump administration's approach," he said. "It is by China feeling that it has to respond in an assertive combative way that it is confirming the Trump administration's approach is justified." But Tsang said Xi couldn't back down on his aggressive stance without undermining his power."It would be an admission that he's wrong, and that his policy backfired," he said. "How can he be wrong? He's the man to outline China's vision all the way up to 2049. If he's wrong then his vision for the future is less credible."That only leaves China one option: to spiral further into its aggressive foreign policy.CNN's James Griffiths and Steven Jiang contributed to this article.TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

China closes Tibet to foreigners for sensitive anniversariesAssociated Press InternationalFebruary 20, 2019 Wednesday 5:00 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 580 wordsByline: By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN, Associated PressDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - China is barring foreign travelers from Tibet over a period of several weeks that includes a pair of sensitive political anniversaries questioning the legitimacy of Beijing's rule over the Himalayan region.Travel agencies contacted Wednesday said foreign tourists would not be allowed back into Tibet until April 1. It's not clear when the ban started, although some monitoring groups said it began this month.The ban was confirmed by the online customer service portal of the Tibet Youth International Travel Service, as well as staff at the Tibet Vista and Go to Tibet travel agencies. Both are based in the southwestern city of Chengdu - the main jumping-off point for visits to Tibet.Staff members declined to give their names or offer details.March 10 is the 60th anniversary of an abortive 1959 uprising against Chinese rule in Tibet, while anti-government riots occurred March 14, 2008, in the regional capital Lhasa.Although the foreigner travel ban is an annual occurrence, the occasion of the 60th anniversary is drawing added attention.Amid heavy security on the ground, Tibet is almost entirely closed to foreign journalists and diplomats and information about actual conditions there is difficult to obtain.The 1959 uprising resulted in the flight of Tibet's traditional Buddhist leader, the Dalai Lama, into exile in India and the beginning of increasingly harsh Chinese rule over the region. Nearly five decades later, anger exploded in a series of protests in an around Lhasa that culminated in attacks on Chinese individuals and businesses in which the government says rioters killed 18 people.An unknown number of Tibetans were killed by security forces in the aftermath.China claims Tibet has been part of its territory for more than seven centuries and regards the Dalai Lama as a dangerous separatist.Many Tibetans insist they were essentially independent for most of that time and have protested what they regard as China's heavy-handed rule imposed after the People's Liberation Army's battled its way into the Himalayan region in 1950.More recently, traditionally Tibetan regions of western China have been racked by a series of self-immolations by Buddhist clergy and lay people protesting Chinese rule and calling for the return of the Dalai Lama, now aged 83.Despite the suffocating level of security, Tibet is an increasingly popular destination for tourists looking for mountain adventure and monuments to its unique Buddhist culture.In 2017, more than 25 million trips from around the world were made to Tibet, an increase of 10.6 percent over the year before, generating 37.9 billion yuan ($5.6 billion) in tourist revenue, according to the official Xinhua News Agency.Numbers of visits rose again last year to more than 33 million, a rise of 31.5 percent, Xinhua said.While Chinese may travel to Tibet at will, foreigners are required to obtain a special permit in addition to their Chinese visas.While China has at times denied closing Tibet and never offered an explanation for any such measures, monitoring groups say it's part of a strategy of concealing the extent of repression in the region."This most recent development is part of the overall policy of the Chinese government to restrict access to Tibet for independent observers in order to maintain an iron grip in the region while at the same time avoiding any form of external scrutiny," Washington, D.C.-based International Campaign for Tibet said in an emailed statement.Load-Date: February 21, 2019End of Document

China: Rights Website Founder Sentenced to 5 YearsTargeted News ServiceJanuary 29, 2019 Tuesday 8:16 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 717 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK BodyHuman Rights Watch issued the following news release:* * *- Liu Feiyue Convicted of 'Inciting Subversion' for Monitoring Violations* * *Chinese authorities should immediately quash the conviction and unconditionally release the founder of a human rights news website, Human Rights Watch said today. On January 29, 2019, a court in Hubei province sentenced Liu Feiyue to five years in prison after convicting him on charges of "inciting subversion of state power."Liu, 48, is a veteran activist and founder of Minsheng Guancha (Civil Rights and Livelihood Watch). The website, created in 2006, has reported on a wide range of human rights issues in China, including prosecutions of activists and lawyers, protests, police abuses, and government corruption, subjects that China's state-controlled media are prohibited from covering."Prosecuting the editor of a human rights website shows just how frightened the Chinese government is about independent reporting on abuses from inside China," said Yaqiu Wang, China researcher. "Sending Liu Feiyue to prison for five years is a travesty of justice meant to scare off others who might follow in his footsteps."On November 17, 2016, police in Suizhou, Hubei province took Liu into custody. On December 23, the Suizhou procuratorate, or prosecutor's office, formally arrested him for "inciting subversion." In August 2017, the procuratorate added a charge of "providing state secrets to a foreign entity," but withdrew the charge months later.The prosecution against Liu has been marred by denial of his right to legal counsel and other due process violations. Authorities repeatedly rejected Liu's lawyers' requests to meet with him, until May 2017. In June 2018, the Hunan Bureau of Justice revoked the license of one of Liu's lawyers, Wen Donghai, for "disorderly court conduct" in previous cases. Prior to Wen's disbarment, judicial authorities had repeatedly criticized him for "hyping up" Liu's case on the internet and for talking to foreign media. Since 2017, authorities have intensified disbarment of lawyers to deter them from taking on human rights cases.During Liu's trial at the Suizhou Intermediate People's Court on August 7, 2018, police took away activists who had come to show support for Liu and blocked people from approaching the court building. Authorities pressured Wu Kuiming, the lawyer replacing Wen, not to discuss the proceedings publicly.In addition to operating the rights monitoring website, Liu compiled annual reports on human rights abuses in China from 2014 until his detention. He had also written many essays advocating nonviolent civil disobedience and organized petitions calling for political reform in China.In the indictment against Liu, the Suizhou procuratorate accused him of "attacking the current political system," "defaming the Chinese government," and "spreading information harming state power and the Socialist system" through the articles and reports he published.Before his arrest in 2016, Liu had long been a target of police harassment and surveillance due to his activism. Prior to and during politically "sensitive" events - such as the anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Massacre and sessions of the National People's Congress - police briefly detained Liu or placed him under house arrest. Authorities had also cut the electric cables connecting to Liu's home, and had followed and beaten him, his wife said.In recent years under President Xi Jinping, China's government has tried to eliminate the country's few independent human rights news websites by imprisoning its leaders. Lu Yuyu, founder of the protests chronicle website Not News, was sentenced to four years in prison, and Zhen Jianghua, executive director of the website Human Rights Campaign in China, was sentenced to two years. Huang Qi, a veteran activist and founder of the website 64 Tianwang, has been detained and awaiting trial since November 2016. Huang suffers from kidney disease and has been denied adequate medical care."Liu Feiyue and others have given a voice to so many people who have suffered abuses at the hands of Chinese authorities," Wang said. "Such prosecutions show that the Chinese government still has plenty to hide when it comes to human rights violations."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6592388 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: January 30, 2019End of Document

Chinese-Australian writer Yang Hengjun detained in China for espionageCNN.comJanuary 23, 2019 Wednesday 9:05 PM ESTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: ASIALength: 575 wordsByline: By Steven Jiang, Carly Walsh and Ben Westcott, CNNDateline: Hong Kong BodyChinese-Australian writer Yang Hengjun has been detained by Chinese authorities for alleged espionage, the family's lawyer told CNN Thursday.According to lawyer Mo Shaoping, Yang's family had received a written notice from Beijing's State Security Bureau confirming the writer's detention.Mo said he would be filing a petition to meet his client but wasn't sure if it would be allowed due to the nature of the charges against Yang.The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said in a statement it would continue to seek confirmation as to why Yang had been taken and would attempt to obtain consular access to him "as a matter of priority."Australia's Defense Minister Christopher Pyne, who was visiting Beijing on Thursday, said he would raise the matter with his counterpart Wei Fenghe during their meeting.Yang, 53, is novelist and writer who previously worked as an official with the Chinese foreign ministry.Though Yang holds Australian citizenship, he is known to spend most of his time in the United States, where he is a visiting scholar at Columbia University in New York.Yang had made a trip back to China from New York with his wife on January 17 to pick up his stepdaughter's US visa, family friend Watson Meng told CNN.Meng said he tried to get in touch with Yang on social media the day after he arrived, but noticed he hadn't read the posts days later. He then said he learned Yang had been detained through sources in the security department.Yang has an active Twitter account with more than 130,000 followers, to which he routinely posts satirical commentaries that are critical of the Chinese government.During a regular press briefing Thursday, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Hua Chunying confirmed Yang had been detained for allegedly endangering China's national security. She said his legitimate rights and interests would be fully guaranteed.Australian authorities couldn't confirm the date Yang was taken in custody, or where he was being held.Relations between Australia and China had been slowly warming after a deep chill in early 2018 following Canberra's drafting of strict foreign interference laws, which officials in Beijing believed were targeted at China.But a decision by the Australian government in August to ban 5G technology manufactured by Chinese company Huawei pushed relations back onto a precarious footing.Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne said Thursday there was "no evidence" of a connection between Yang's arrest and Huawei's global troubles."I would be concerned if there was an indication of that. So we are calling on the Chinese authorities to ensure this matter is dealt with transparently and fairly," she said.Elsewhere Beijing has been cracking down on individuals it views as a threat to the Chinese government, including labor activists, human rights lawyers and international bloggers.Yang has a complicated history with Beijing, owing to his background as a former government official. He is known to have vanished in China once before, in the spring of 2011. Although it was widely speculated he was detained by Chinese state security agents, he never confirmed it upon re-appearing.John Garnaut, Australian journalist and former prime ministerial adviser, wrote in a column Thursday that "the ground for everyone in China is shifting fast beneath our feet.""If the system has swallowed this hugely popular commentator ... are there no longer any limits?"Load-Date: January 25, 2019End of Document

CHINESE POLITICAL ACTIVISTS FINALLY LEAVE TAIWAN AIRPORT LOUNGEStates News ServiceJanuary 31, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1032 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Two Chinese asylum-seekers have been allowed to enter the democratic island of Taiwan after camping out in an airport lounge for nearly four months while authorities considered their applications.Veteran rights activists Yan Kefen, 44, and Liu Xinglian, 64, had been living in a restricted area of Taipei's Taoyuan International Airport since abandoning a China-bound flight transiting in Taiwan on Sept. 27, 2018.Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), which manages relations with Beijing, announced last week that they would be issued with a professional exchange program visa after a human rights advocate sponsored their application.I am very, very happy to feel the sun on my skin and to breathe free air," Liu told RFA after being allowed through immigration in Taipei for the first time on Thursday. "The airport was a very closed environment."Yan, who is also known as Yan Bojun, agreed. "That's right! I am in an extremely good mood," he said.However, Yan and Liu haven't been granted asylum, and are expected, as political refugees recognized by the United Nations, to seek resettlement in a third country.They were only allowed to enter Taiwan after flying out to an undisclosed third country and presenting themselves again at immigration under their newly changed circumstances.Temporary accommodationThey are now staying in temporary accommodation in Taipei, and familiarizing themselves with their new environment, they told RFA while steaming plain buns, or mantou, for lunch."Taiwanese people are really friendly, whether you are asking them for directions or for them to take your photograph," Liu said. "They're very kind-hearted.""We wandered around a nearby campus, bought a SIM card, and applied for internet access," Yan said. "We couldn't get online at the airport."Liu said he appreciated the rule of law in Taiwan."I really understood how precious democracy, freedom, and the rule of law are after I got to Taiwan," Liu said. "Because the government has to accept public oversight in everything it does.""They also have to do everything according to law, and they had trouble [with our application] because Taiwan doesn't have a law governing refugees," he said."We caused the Republic of China government quite a headache with our arrival, and we feel deeply grateful to them," Liu added, using another name for Taiwan."We were in urgent need of asylum when we got here," he said.'Not the norm'Liu dismissed criticisms of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)'s handling of their case, from opposition critics who fear antagonizing Beijing."[The Chinese government] is now shutting off the escape route for refugees via Thailand, which they have used to flee for their lives," he said. "This will make it easier for them to control people back in mainland China."MAC spokesman Chiu Chui-cheng said the two men had been granted a temporary visa on humanitarian grounds which will need to be renewed on a monthly basis."They have to leave eventually," Chiu said. "I have to stress that the assistance we give to these individuals, these methods and processing of asylum cases, are not the norm and certainly not standard procedures," Chiu said.While the administration of President Tsai Ing-wen is proud of its human rights record, the island, which has a refugee law in the pipeline, is traditionally wary of granting political asylum to Chinese nationals for fear of triggering a flood of applications.'We're not alone'For Yan, the stress of fleeing the Chinese Communist Party, who now have considerable influence with Thai police and immigration officials, was worth it."I'd like to thank everyone for their concern," Yan said. "There are thousands and thousands of people who support us; thousands of friends who have our backs.""We've realized that we're not alone in striving for democracy ... we're just one tiny ripple being carried along by a huge tide," he said.While both men will need to focus on their applications for resettlement, they still have some sights they'd like to see in Taiwan, they said."I'd like to go to Nantou [county]," Yan said. "I have a wish to visit Sun Moon Lake.""I'm a Muslim," Liu told RFA, "so I'd like to visit a mosque."Gong Yujian, an exiled dissident from mainland China now based in Taiwan, said the decision to grant temporary visas to the activists comes at a politically sensitive time."The Refugee Law is still at the reading stage in the Legislative Yuan," Gong said. "Actually, Chinese refugees like us are something of an embarrassment for Taiwan.""People who abandon flights in Taiwan cause the government no end of difficulties, and this could mean the end of yet another route to freedom," he said.A tense relationshipTaiwan has a tense relationship with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which regards the island as a renegade province awaiting "unification," despite never having ruled the island.President Tsai Ing-wen rejected calls from Chinese President Xi Jinping earlier this month to move towards "unification" with the People's Republic, saying its people have no wish to give up their sovereignty.In a Jan. 2 "Letter to our Taiwan compatriots," Xi was insistent that China must be "unified," saying that China would make no promises not to use military force to take the island.But a recent opinion poll found that more than 80 percent of Taiwanese would reject Xi's offer to rule the island via the "one country, two systems" model used for the former colonies of Hong Kong and Macau.Taiwan was ruled as a Japanese colony in the 50 years prior to the end of World War II, but was handed back to the 1911 Republic of China under the Kuomintang (KMT) government as part of Tokyo's post-war reparation deal.The island began a transition to democracy following the death of Chiang Kai-shek's son, President Chiang Ching-kuo, in January 1988, starting with direct elections to the legislature in the early 1990s and culminating in the first direct election of a president, Lee Teng-hui, in 1996.Reported by Hsia Hsiao-hwa for RFA's Mandarin Service, and by Wen Yuqing for the Cantonese Service.

Continue reading Chinese hackers reportedly targeted 27 universities for military secretsChinese hackers singled out over two dozen universities in the US and around the world in an apparent bid to gain access to maritime military research, according to a report by cybersecurity firm iDefense, which was obtained by The Wall Street Journal.The hackers sent universities spear phishing emails doctored to appear as if they came from partner universities, but they unleashed a malicious payload when opened. Universities are traditionally seen as easier targets than US military contractors, and they can still contain useful military research.Twenty-seven universities were found to have been targeted by the group, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Washington, and other colleges in Canada and Southeast Asia. iDefense didn t name every school in the report due to ongoing investigations, but anonymous sources told the WSJ that Penn State and Duke University were two of the other targets.The cyberattacks focused on universities that either studied underwater tech or had faculty with relevant backgrounds. Many had ties to the US s largest oceanographic research institute, which itself has ties to the US Navy s warfare center. iDefense said it was highly confident the institute had been breached.Ongoing attacks since 2017The group has been given various nicknames by security researchers, like Temp.Periscope, Mudcarp, or Leviathan. Its connection to the Chinese government is unclear, but because the group appears to be targeting US military data, analysts believe the Chinese government is a likely sponsor. The same was reportedly behind the hacking of a US Navy contractor last June.The report of more Chinese cyberattacks comes at a diplomatically sensitive time when the US is weighing large security concerns against tech companies like Huawei and ZTE. Huawei and ZTE both deny the accusations. At the same time, there are still ongoing tariffs that are hurting US-China relations. More Chinese cyberattacks occurring over this time frame just complicates the narrative and could potentially reinforce the security fears expressed by US intelligence agencies.Tags: See Website:https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18251836/chinese-hackers-us-servers-universities-military-secrets-cybersecurityContact Information:Shannon LiaoTags:           Wire,            Artificial Intelligence Newswire,            United States,            EnglishLoad-Date: March 6, 2019End of Document

China: Xi Doubles Down on RepressionTargeted News ServiceJanuary 17, 2019 Thursday 8:01 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 789 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK BodyHuman Rights Watch issued the following news release:* * *- Mass Detention in Xinjiang, Prosecution of Peaceful Expression* * *China's government tightened its grip on all aspects of society in 2018, Human Rights Watch said today in its World Report 2019. President Xi Jinping's abusive rule deepened, as evidenced by the constitutional amendment removing presidential term limits, and the oppression of Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang."China under President Xi has been a threat to human rights both at home and abroad," said Sophie Richardson, China director. "Countries and international institutions will need to push back against the repressive policies of a rising superpower."In the 674-page World Report 2019, its 29th edition, Human Rights Watch reviewed human rights practices in more than 100 countries. In his introductory essay, Executive Director Kenneth Roth says that the populists spreading hatred and intolerance in many countries are spawning a resistance. New alliances of rights-respecting governments, often prompted and joined by civic groups and the public, are raising the cost of autocratic excess. Their successes illustrate the possibility of defending human rights - indeed, the responsibility to do so - even in darker times.The Chinese government dramatically stepped up repression against the 13 million Turkic Muslims in China's northwestern Xinjiang region. Authorities have carried out mass arbitrary detention, torture, and mistreatment. About 1 million Turkic Muslims are being held indefinitely in "political education" camps, where they are forced to learn Mandarin Chinese and praise the government and Communist Party. Outside the detention facilities, authorities severely restrict movement, politically indoctrinate people, and have over a million officials to monitor residents by regularly staying in their homes.In 2018, authorities continued politically motivated prosecutions of human rights lawyers and activists. Lawyer Wang Quanzhang has been detained for "subversion of state power" since August 2015 amid a national crackdown on rights lawyers. In July, a court sentenced veteran democracy activist Qin Yongmin to 13 years in prison for "subversion of state power." Huang Qi, a longtime activist detained since November 2016 on charges of "leaking state secrets," suffers from serious health conditions without adequate treatment.Authorities also expanded their assault on the freedom of expression, detaining journalists for covering human rights issues, tightening ideological control over universities, and expanding the internet censorship regime to suppress political information and ostensible "vulgar" content. As the #MeToo movement gained momentum in China in 2018, censors deleted social media posts exposing sexual harassment linked to prominent men. In August, the media reported that Google had been developing a censored search engine app for the Chinese market.Central and Hong Kong government authorities sought to limit rights in the territory. The government disqualified further pro-democracy figures from running for seats on Hong Kong's Legislative Council, or Legco. In September, it took the unprecedented step of banning the nonviolent, pro-independence Hong Kong National Party, saying the group's political stance "poses a real threat to national security." In October, authorities rejected without explanation a Financial Times journalist's application to renew his work visa after he hosted a talk by a pro-independence activist.China's growing global power makes it an exporter of human rights violations, including at the United Nations, where in 2018 it sought to block critics. In March, the UN Human Rights Council (HRC) adopted a resolution proposed by China that focused on China's vision for "win-win cooperation" and omitted any mention of accountability for rights violations. China's "One Belt, One Road" development initiative pressed ahead without safeguards or respect for human rights in many participating countries. Major Chinese technology companies, including Huawei, iFlytek, and ZTE, which have close relations with the government and contribute to police mass surveillance efforts, sought to expand abroad in 2018.In one of its only human rights concessions all year, Chinese authorities allowed Liu Xia, an artist and the widow of 2010 Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo, to leave for Germany in July after eight years of legally baseless house arrest."More than ever, protecting human rights inside and outside China requires governments and institutions working together to end Xi's abuses," Richardson said. "No one should be giving a green light to China's rampant violations."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6580038 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: January 18, 2019End of Document

Good Friday morning, everybody, live from Switzerland.I'm Maria Bartiromo. Happy Friday. It is Friday, January 25th.Your top stories right now, just before 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.Making his case -- the CEO of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg defending the company he created in a new "Wall Street Journal" op-ed this morning. What he said about the company's data practices coming up.Shutdown showdown now entering day 35. Two Senate bills failed yesterday. But lawmakers are back at the negotiating table today. President Trump weighing in on the stalemate and still calling for money for the border wall.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: One of the ideas suggested is they open it, they pay sort of a prorated down payment for the wall, which I think people would agree that you need.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: We have the very latest as some federal employees are now missing their second paycheck. Today is payday.Senator Elizabeth Warren's new tax plan hitting the rich. She's proposing an annual wealth tax now. We have details as she makes her 2020 course (ph0.Markets this morning are higher. Take a look at futures, indicating a gain at the start of trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average up 177 points right now, three-quarters of 1 percent. The S&P 500 is also up three- quarters of a percent. And the NASDAQ up 65 points, that's 1 percent higher as we see earnings cross the tape. Colgate coming out right now, beating expectations.Muted session on Wall Street yesterday, check the close at 4:00 p.m. on the East Coast. Dow Industrials were down 22, fractional move.

And the DAX index in Germany up 161 points, 1.5 percent higher.Asia overnight -- gains across the board there as well, best performer in Hong Kong and Korea, up 1.5 percent and one and two-thirds percent respectively.I made a new friend here in Davos, Pepper the robot. She answered some tough questions. We've got the highlights later this hour. Wait until you see what this robot can do when you insert the information. She's really interesting. We will have that.All those stories coming up this morning. And joining me from New York -- Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell; and Independent Women's Voice CEO Heather Higgins. Good morning -- ladies.HEATHER HIGGINS, CEO, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S VOICE: Hey.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning -- Maria Bartiromo.HIGGINS: Good morning.MCDOWELL: Really quickly before we get to the fabulous Matt Murray -- I want to point out a story that will likely drive markets today and in the coming weeks. This is in the "Wall Street Journal", incredible story.Fed officials weigh earlier than expected end to the bond portfolio runoff. The feds meeting next week, next week's meeting could reveal more details on this. But they're close to deciding if they're going to keep a larger portfolio of treasury securities than they expected when they started shrinking these holdings about two years ago. Back then, the expectation was it would go from $4.5 trillion -- it's about a little under $4 trillion right now -- to $1.5 trillion to $3 trillion. That's how much they could take it down. Could be much bigger than that.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: Could be $3.56 trillion -- this is important because this is a way that the Fed has been pulling money out of the financial system. We saw some of the problems of this wind-down, this drawdown was creating in the financial markets at the end of the year. This is a big story and I wanted to point it out.BARTIROMO: Yes. And this is exactly what Ray Dalio told us earlier in the week --MCDOWELL: Right.BARTIROMO: -- basically saying look, not only will they perhaps not raise rates at all this year in '19, they'll have to ease in 2020 and they may very well rethink the unwind that was scheduled for $50 billion a month. But we know that that is in fact another form of tightening.MCDOWELL: Absolutely. This will give markets some solace if there's volatility out there --BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: -- that this bond portfolio could remain larger at the end of the day than many people were expecting.BARTIROMO: Yes. And I would point out that that really was the reason for the volatility in December.MCDOWELL: Absolutely.BARTIROMO: People were more worried about the unwind I think than the global growth story slowing down. It was that unwind and this idea that the fed was married to selling $50 billion a month that really unnerved investors.So this is obviously market moving as well. Perhaps that's one of the reasons, Dagen, this morning we've got a triple digit gain on the Dow Industrials and we're expecting a pretty good move upwards for stock prices.MCDOWELL: Right. Absolutely.BARTIROMO: Our other top story we're covering this hour -- Mark Zuckerberg answering his critics this morning. The Facebook CEO writing an op-ed in the "Journal" titled "The Facts about Facebook", saying quote, "We don't sell people's data even though it's often reported that we do. In fact, selling people's information to advertisers would be counter to our business interest because it would reduce the unique value of our service to advertisers. We have a strong incentive to protect people's information from being accessed by anyone else."Joining me right now, the "Wall Street Journal's" editor in chief -- Matt Murray. Matt -- it's great to see you.MATT MURRAY, EDITOR IN CHIEF, "WALL STREET JOURNAL": Great to see you -- Maria. I'm no Pepper the robot but I'm glad to be here today.BARTIROMO: I'm really glad you're here because we've got a lot to talk to you about. Not only this Mark Zuckerberg op-ed and what Facebook is doing but the unwind as Dagen brought up.MURRAY: Yes.BARTIROMO: So we'll get that.First let's talk about Mark Zuckerberg. He says they don't sell data but isn't that basically what they're doing? They're selling access to people's information to advertisers.MURRAY: They're using the data to get advertisers to target ads to users, yes. What they've been criticized a lot last year in a lot of stories for selling data to third parties. That was essentially the Cambridge Analytica --BARTIROMO: Right.MURRAY: -- scandal that was -- that they fell into last year. There, they've delivered a very clear message which is that's an old model. We're well out of that model. So I think that's what he's referring to as much as anything there.BARTIROMO: Yes.MURRAY: You know, I think one of the interesting things really at Davos -- so a year ago at Davos was sort of like the beginning of a terrible year for Facebook. Everybody was beating up on them. I think it was Mark Benioff who compared them to smoking on the stage. And that was really -- you know, they had a pretty low profile here last year.The op-ed this year feels to me like it's sort of a piece of a kind of a campaign that Facebook is launching which is sort of a mixed message.They're saying look, we're sorry, there are problems with social media. We know there are problem. They're very careful to say they're working hard on the problems but they might never fix them because of the complicatedness of the system.BARTIROMO: Yes.MURRAY: I think Mark's piece is the other side of that, though, which is they're arguing -- by the way, I should add this is the op-ed side of the "Wall Street Journal", not the news side -- so I had nothing to do with this piece. It was my colleague Paul Gigot.But I think they're arguing, look, we've heard you on the business practices. We understand your concerns but you've misunderstood us, you know. On this we don't have to apologize anymore. We're working hard to get it right. Yes, we made mistakes.So there's sort of -- it's kind of a defensive-offensive message. And you feel like this is where Facebook is trying to go now. They talk all the time about all the people they've hired to review content. They clearly are trying to reassure advertisers and companies that they're not the devil because --BARTIROMO: Yes.MURRAY: -- part of their problem is that they've got issues with their model but they've also become, you know, the face of any anti-tech sentiment.BARTIROMO: Right.MURRAY: So --BARTIROMO: And you mentioned Mark Benioff. You also had Tim Cook.MURRAY: Yes.BARTIROMO: You had Ginni Rometty calling for privacy regulation. You have everybody sort getting on this whole idea that no, no, no, privacy is sacrosanct and we cannot in fact sell it at all. So that goes on.MURRAY: And I would say there are issues there. And of course, competitors saw an issue and said I can get a competitive advantage here too by agreeing to this -- so.BARTIROMO: Let me pile on.Let's get to the market and to the Senate. The Senate failed to pass dueling bills yesterday aimed at ending the partial government shutdown, now in its 35th day.The President is calling now for a down payment as well as part of a deal. Airlines are feeling the strain. JetBlue's CEO said, quote, "We are close to a tipping point in air travel."Let's get the panel's reaction first. And then I've got to see what you think about all of this.Heather Higgins -- your reaction?HIGGINS: Well, the first thing I think that people are missing about the shutdown is that the longer it goes on, the more -- many people are aware of how nonessential a lot of these nonessential workers actually are.The reality is that most people aren't affected by it. The media is driving the story about the 800,000 employees plus the contractors, et cetera. And this has been a failure of messaging on the Trump administration's part because they haven't been able to break through that this is really about getting the border security, that people who are border security specialists say they need, not a coast to coast wall but in strategic places. So that is the first thing.You're not seeing that much sympathy among the average American because if you look at the data, the average government worker's compensation is significantly more and arguably up to roughly twice what it is for the average American worker. So, you know, they are -- they understand that this is hard times but this is not the same as losing your job or feeling like you're at risk or something is seriously wrong in your community with opioids and everything else.So there's a political dynamic here that the media isn't quite capturing which is why I think you're seeing increased support for the wall despite the drum beat that you're getting all the time.BARTIROMO: But it definitely is politics. I feel like they're trying -- I don't know that they're trying to come together. But from the war of words it sounds like maybe they're coming together.MURRAY: It sounds like maybe they're just a bit toward each other tentatively.BARTIROMO: Right.MURRAY: I mean you have a few people cross the aisle yesterday. You had - - according to reports -- you had kind of a somewhat heated Senate Republican lunch where there were some sharp words exchanged.The President has clearly moved a bit in terms of this compromise and talked about willing to have a three week temporary bill while they negotiate. There's pressure on the Democratic side as this goes on as well.So who knows when it will end? The politics is moving things a bit here clearly.BARTIROMO: The lead story obviously Dagen's bringing up, the unwind. Let's talk about this in terms of the Federal Reserve perhaps pulling back on selling the $50 billion. This is important.MURRAY: This is a big deal. This is a big deal. It's been very interesting. You know, there's a lot of debate right here as you've heard this week about whether the Fed went a little too far late last year with their fourth increase and a little -- you know, a lot of talk about Jay Powell, that he's kind of been a little more nuanced in his language. They're going to be out next week.But I think there's a pretty strong sense here that the Fed is really in pause mode to sort of take a measure of the economy and that we probably won't see anything for six months.It's sort of the consensus view here, which is interesting because I think at the same time a lot of people feel despite a certain gloomy mood here that the U.S. economy is still doing well. Maybe it will be a little bit slower.It's more I think what's the impact of China going to be? What's the impact of Europe going to be this year? So they definitely see the Fed to be very much in watch-and-wait mode right now.BARTIROMO: And then Dagen -- there's the whole taxing the wealthy issue. Presidential candidate Senator Elizabeth Warren proposing this annual 2 percent tax on household wealth above $50 million. And an additional 1 percent tax on wealth above $1 billion.White House National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow is responding to the proposal. He was on "LOU DOBBS TONIGHT" last night.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LARRY KUDLOW, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR: Let's tax all the rich people. Let's confiscate all the wealth people earn. Let's destroy private sector incentives and market based reforms.So you know what happens? Everybody is equal. Nobody has any money. Nobody has any money except the dictator and the handful of generals. This stuff has been tried for all these hundred years. It never works and always makes the country poorer.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Dagen -- your reaction first. Then I've got to hear what you have to say as we sit here in the Swiss Alps -- Matt.Go ahead -- Dagen.MCDOWELL: Elizabeth Warren clearly is trying to trump Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez who has taken all the air out of the room in terms of left wing liberals with her 70 percent tax on the highest earners. That's an income tax.Elizabeth Warren now even using the same language that AOC used talking about tippy tops -- the tippy top of the income spectrum. This only works if all other countries do it as well because this money in the United States will move somewhere else that it's welcome.And you can be doggone sure -- Elizabeth Warren is trying to put a penalty on people who turn in their U.S. citizenship. That's one of her ideas. So she wants to lock people in this country if you will, which I think would be unconstitutional, among other things in this plan that are unconstitutional.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: But again, don't you think that Russia would say hey, here's a Russian passport, bring us your money, we'll tax it at 12 -- you know we'll tax it at 12 percent. Any other nation would do that and could do that.BARTIROMO: Yes. And every time we see proposals like this, Matt, we see efforts to evade the tax --MURRAY: Yes, exactly.BARTIROMO: -- and try to move money, use the tax system as effectively as you could to not show that much income.MURRAY: Yes. Look, I have a couple of points. First, I think what you just said is very true -- Maria.We wrote a piece last weekend about what it was like in the United States for the wealthy during the years when tax rates were far higher, as high as 90 percent which is really from the 30s to the 60s.And what happened is, you know, rich entertainers like Jack Benny and Bing Crosby just structured a lot of transactions and deal in different ways, used tax shelters.So undoubtedly well, we would see -- and we have to remember this with all these debates -- there's a political element and there's the reality element. And the reality element is rich people are going to do everything they can broadly speak to make their taxes reduced so the government is going to try to get as much as they can and it's a bit of a cat and mouse game. So the game would have evolved very dramatically there.Two other points. I think one point is, look, we talked about it on the show before when I was on with you before. The momentum of the Democratic Party is to the left and policies and candidates have been moving to the left for a while. So we're going to have two years of this kind of stuff because that's where the energy is.BARTIROMO: Yes.MURRAY: Secondly, I think, look, when you're at Davos and you know what it's like, people feel very removed from that debate in the United States and they tend to not necessarily feel what a lot of average voters feel whether you think those proposals are reasonable or not. So it becomes a bit of a joke but it's a real thing.BARTIROMO: Yes. Matt -- it's good to have you.MURRAY: It's good to be here.BARTIROMO: Thanks so much. Matt Murray -- we love the "Wall Street Journal" -- joining us this morning.Coming up, keeping secrets -- a new survey finding a large portion of Americans keep a secret bank account from their significant other. We've got those details.Then the rise of artificial intelligence, a key theme in Davos, I get a firsthand look at the technology with Pepper the robot. She's pretty smart.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Watch MORNINGS WITH MARIA on the Fox Business Network for the smartest conversation in the morning.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Yes. More of my conversation with Pepper the robot, coming up. We'll tell you what that robot is capable of. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Well, yesterday we told you that Microsoft Bing search engine was banned or blocked in China. It is being restored now in China.Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines -- Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Such a big story yesterday that we were covering -- Maria.Microsoft now says that this week's sudden interruption of Bing in China has ended. This happened as Beijing is, of course, tightening its grip on the Internet and as trade tensions with the U.S. rise over the issue of IP theft and technology.Microsoft president, Brad Smith, spoke with you in Davos yesterday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: What happened in China?BRAD SMITH, PRESIDENT, MICROSOFT: You know, we operate in China, but pursuant to some global principles, it's called the Global Network Initiative. There are times when there are disagreements. There are times when there are difficult negotiations with the Chinese government.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Well, taking a look at shares of Microsoft, slightly higher, more than half a percent in the premarket.Well, U.S. banks reported nearly 25,000 suspected cases of elder financial abuse to the Treasury Department last year. That is a record, up 12 percent from 2017 and more than double the amount from five years ago.One trick that is played on older folks, it's known as the grandchild scam. Somebody pretends to be their grandchild in need of money. The number of cases are expected to rise as more people, of course, become senior citizens. Those baby boomers are getting older and they could be victimized.Then there is this. If you are hiding a bank account or credit card from your spouse, your partner, just join the club.CreditCards.com says 29 million Americans do exactly that. A company survey shows about 19 percent of people in a live-in relationship have a secret account and that millennials -- those that are 18 to 37 -- are twice as likely as older generations to hide their account from their serious romantic partner.The survey didn't determine motives. Gosh, Maria -- where's the trust? Not sure what to say.BARTIROMO: Yes. That's unbelievable. By the way, that grandkid scam just happened to my mother. She didn't fall for it. But this is real. This is real.Someone called her up and said grandma, I need $30,000. And she didn't fall for it. But this is real stuff. Beware. So happy you highlighted that -- Cheryl. Thanks.CASONE: Of course.BARTIROMO: Take a quick break.And then the biggest concern for Americans. Fox News poll showing that healthcare the top issue for voters. I'll discuss that with one of the healthcare industry's leading figures and leading figures and leading institutions.Then a warning to parents everywhere. Watch.(MUSIC)BARTIROMO: Yes, the hit children's song, "Baby Shark", teams up with the streaming Netflix. Details coming up.Back in a moment, right here.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We are coming to you live from the World Economic Forum here in Davos, Switzerland.Healthcare one of the focuses. In a new Fox News poll this week, 85 percent of Americans say they are either extremely or very concerned about the price of healthcare. It is, of course, a global issue.Joining me right now is the Cleveland Clinic London CEO Dr. Brian Donley. Dr. Donley -- good to see you.DR. BRIAN DONLEY, CEO, CLEVELAND CLINIC LONDON: Thank you -- Maria.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us.You know, we talk so much about the price of healthcare in the U.S. This is also an issue in Europe and where you are in London.DONLEY: That's exactly right. And I think especially this week, highlights that every country actually is struggling with the cost of healthcare and how they deliver quality healthcare for the citizens of their country.BARTIROMO: So how do you do it? I mean the healthcare industry is feeling the pressure from politicos, you know, the administration, the Britain's announcement first to leave the European Union -- that has to be an issue. No uncertainties surrounding the deal could be in jeopardy.What are the ripple effects that you see? You've got nurse shortages, doctors considering leaving the National Health Service over a funding debate, limited medication access. How much are these concerns for you?DONLEY: Well, I will tell you. We made the decision to enter London, the Cleveland Clinic did, before the referendum, before the vote. And we did it because there's great healthcare. It's a great healthcare community in London. They have great research, great education.And so we wanted to come and join a group that is innovative and that we can be a better organization and learn. We feel confident that no matter what the outcome from Brexit is, that this will continue to be a great healthcare community. So we are fully as excited as we were before and continue to be.BARTIROMO: so you're full speed ahead. You've got the hospital opening in just over two years. You're about two years away from accepting patients at the London hospital.This is a 185-bed private healthcare facility near Buckingham Palace. Tell us your plans.DONLEY: So our plans there, we're going to bring -- what we want to do is bring the best of what we do in Cleveland but we want to integrate and be a part of the U.K. healthcare market. It is a great healthcare market.So we want to bring the best of what the U.K. does, integrate it with the best of what we do then that really will form Cleveland Clinic London. It will allow us also for our whole international organization to learn and be a better organization for what we exist for. And that's to deliver clinical excellence for the patients that trust us with their lives.BARTIROMO: And we feature the Cleveland Clinic on this program a lot. I know the excellence of the clinic.Cardiac has been among your expertise. Is that going to be a specialty in London as well? And what else?DONLEY: Yes, so cardiac will certainly be in excellence. We're proud of what we've accomplished being the number one heart center for last 24 years in the United States. We'll bring that expertise to London. We'll also focus on orthopedics. We'll focus --BARTIROMO: You're an orthopedic surgeon.DONLEY: I am an orthopedic surgeon. We'll focus on digestive diseases and then we'll also focus on neurosciences.BARTIROMO: I'm glad you're focusing on neuroscience because as we were talking during the break, we mapped the genome now 25 years ago. The cost of getting your genome now has come all the way down. And because we mapped the genome 25 years ago we understood better smoking causes cancer, poor eating causes heart disease, et cetera. So we all started changing our behavior.We haven't learned enough about the mind, about the brain, in terms of Alzheimer's, you know, so many other mental illnesses. Where do you think we are?DONLEY: I think you're exactly right. I think in many ways we've accomplished a lot but almost the more you accomplish is the more you learn that you need to discover more. I think we're at the very infancy from a neuroscience standpoint.And that's what's nice actually about coming to London. There's this great research there also. So this won't just be healthcare providers that uncrack this. This actually will be a collaboration of many people, including industry, for us really to make a breakthrough.BARTIROMO: Ken Fraser, CEO of Merck, told me recently if you live until you're 85, and of course we all want to live a long life, there's a one in six chance you get Alzheimer's.DONLEY: Yes. It's frightening.BARTIROMO: It is. I mean this is also having an impact on our lives, obviously, but also there's an economic impact.DONLEY: Well, there's a tremendous economic impact. And of course, we exist to better serve our patients better outcomes. But the economics are important because as we can do this with better quality, better diagnosis, it actually can save money that then can be used for other areas in healthcare. So I think the economics are very important to pay attention to.BARTIROMO: No cure yet.DONLEY: Not at this point.BARTIROMO: No. Dr. Brian Donley, great to have you on the program.DONLEY: Thank you very much.BARTIROMO: Good luck with the plans in London. We'll be watching.DONLEY: Thank you.BARTIROMO: CEO of the Cleveland Clinic, London.Coming up, 2019 IPOs to watch -- a number of companies expected to go public this year.

Good Friday morning everybody. Thanks so much for joining us live from Switzerland. It is Friday, January 25th. Your top stories right now 7:32 a.m. on the East Coast.It is day 35 of the partial government shutdown. Furloughed workers are now missing their second paycheck under the longest shutdown in U.S. history. Two bills meant to end the shutdown yesterday were defeated in the Senate.Markets are higher this morning. Futures indicating a gain at the start of trading to the tune of 160 points, two-thirds of one percent higher. S&P 500 up 18 and the NASDAQ up 62-1/2 points as people wonder if the Federal Reserve will have to actually stop the unwind of the balance sheet in addition to fewer rate hikes in 2019.A relatively flat day yesterday on Wall Street for the major indices. Take a look at the close with the Dow Jones Industrial average was down 22 points, the S&P 500 was up three and the NASDAQ is up 47 points.In Europe this morning, a firmer tone there as well.

A closer look at A.I. coming up this morning.Then, from the billboard 100 to Netflix, the Baby Shark phenomenon growing even more. Details on Baby Shark's deal with the streaming giant.Plus, a condiment for your valentine? How Heinz is looking to make your special day even more special with Ketchup Caviar, yes. We will talk about it coming up.All those stories coming up. But our top story this half an hour, fears over an economic slowdown weighing on investors around the world. I sat down with NASDAQ president and CEO Adena Friedman yesterday and got her take on markets and growth.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ADENA FRIEDMAN, PRESIDENT AND CEO, NASDAQ: Well, first of all, NASDAQ's business is doing quite well. We've reported through three quarters of 2018 and we've seen really great growth across all aspects of our business. Our technology business, which is our fastest growing business, we've seen continued really strong demand from new markets as well as from our current clients who really want our next generation technology. So that businesses has had 10 percent growth through the first three quarters. Our data and index business has also had really strong growth in terms of demand for data and our index performance.And then, in terms of IPOs, we had 186 IPOs in 2018 and even with that, the listing applications on file right now are 35 percent higher than they were at this time last year. So we're definitely seeing a lot of companies want to come to market. And so, I would say that -- and then of course, our trading business, because of the markets and how much they moved last year, we had very strong performance across our trading business as well.BARTIROMO: I saw the volume was really strong in the last couple of months. What about that in terms of the IPOs? I was really surprised actually to see so many IPOs resilient even in the face of what started to be a really rocky end of year. Do you think we'll see the IPO calendar stay as strong as it looks right now in '19 despite the volatility?FRIEDMAN: So, I would say this, successful companies and strong companies can come to market and can find investors who are ready to take the risk on them. And that's what you saw in Q4. Even with the market volatility, we had some really great companies come to market and get access to investors.BARTIROMO: So, what are the big names, Uber obviously, Lyft, Slack, Pinterest. Are you expecting some of those?FRIEDMAN: So, we don't talk about specific names. But we obviously talked to a lot of companies, whether they're the largest companies or even small entrepreneurs or innovators. They're all looking to come to market. They're getting themselves ready. They're having the right conversations. And for them, it's a matter of having the government open, ready to approve their applications and then obviously having a receptive market.BARTIROMO: What has this volatility in markets, how is that impacted your business?FRIEDMAN: So, in terms of volatility in the fourth quarter and as we've seen it's not quite as -- we haven't seen as much volatility in January. Certainly it definitely helps our trading business but you also want to make sure it doesn't persist because of the fact that then it starts to impact confidence and as you've said, impacts the investor sentiment around on taking risk in the market.But I would say that we've seen definitely -- it's calming down a bit as we get into 2019. I think people understand that there is always going to be -- there's going to be a divergence of views as to economic outlook right now. But we're definitely seeing that as a kind of the -- I was (INAUDIBLE) investors are being a little more sanguine about how their reflecting that in the market.In terms of the IPOs though, we -- it's been a slow start, not because of the volatility. In fact, they really want to be out there in the market right now. It's really --BARTIROMO: The SEC is not open.FRIEDMAN: It's not the SEC is unopened.BARTIROMO: Yes, until the government shutdown has had an impact in that regard. Any other impact?FRIEDMAN: For us, as NASDAQ, no. Obviously for our clients, yes. There've been other impacts of the government shutdown.BARTIROMO: Yes, let me -- let me ask you about the regulatory environment. What do you want to see out of regulation in terms of when we do see the government open again? Regulatory changes, because I know that you and other exchanges have made-been vocal in terms of some of the stranglehold in terms of the regulatory environment. What do you want to see changed?FRIEDMAN: Sure. Well, our biggest push right now in the government is to look at the reforming the proxy advisory firms. Those are firms like (AUDIO GAP) Glass Lewis where they make very important recommendations on governance matters and they have an incredible influence on investor behavior. But they have no regulatory oversight.So, we're pushing very hard in Congress and at the SEC to create an environment where companies have a better voice in terms how those governance matters are voted on and what recommendations are made, making sure that the information that they're using is accurate and complete in making these recommendations. So, that is definitely job number one.And the second thing that we're focused on is short sale disclosure, making sure companies have an understanding of not only who's buying their stock but also who's shorting their stock over time. It gives them information to be able to go out and have more productive relationships with their investors.BARTIROMO: The first point is, it's not a fair playing field.FRIEDMAN: It's really challenging. And it definitely adds to -- it adds the challenge of being a public company. And what we want is more companies to go public. And I think that --I think that you're seeing in Congress and at the SEC, there's a common interest in having more companies go public.The solutions are actually -- we're starting to really bipartisan support for some of these initiatives that are very clear, right? As you said, it's just not a level playing field right now.BARTIROMO: For a long time, China was really the jewel in terms of the major exchanges in the U.S. There were a lot of Chinese IPOs. Has that slowed down as a result of the spat between the U.S. and China?FRIEDMAN: Well, it's interesting. Last year, we had I think it was 20 IPOs from China come to NASDAQ (INAUDIBLE) Pinduoduo are two of them. And so, even with some of the tension we're with China seeing last year. It was actually very successfully. It's a very large companies came to NASDAQ. So even with some of the tension we're seeing with China, the Chinese companies understand that the U.S. environment is a great place to raise capital. The deepest and the most liquid markets in the world. And they want have to have U.S. investors in their stock.BARTIROMO: Where will the growth come from at NASDAQ in the year ahead and the next three years?FRIEDMAN: Well, we continue to see strong signals across all of our businesses in terms of demand for our data, our index performance as well as our technology performance. It's always hard to know how the IPO environment's going to -- going to play out throughout the year. But right now as I mentioned, we have a very strong pipeline and then trading continues to be very strong but of course, again, that's a little bit less predictable.BARTIROMO: The data has probably become one of the most important growth engines for the company right now. .FRIEDMAN: Yes. So, our highest growth business is our technology business. But our biggest business is the data and index business. And that is also been a very fast grow for us. The environment, the economic signals continue to be strong and it's just a matter of whether or not that shows up as we go through the year. But companies still see a really strong business environment right now.BARTIROMO: So, this whole gloom and doom is a little overdone?FRIEDMAN: Well, I'm an eternal optimist. But I would say that right now, it feels -- it feels like 2019 is off to a pretty good start.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: My thanks to Adena Friedman, president and CEO at NASDAQ.Coming up, massive sinkhole in California to tell you about, details on the earthquake-like event.Then, a warning to parents everywhere.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Baby shark doo doo doo doo doo.

There is a giant sinkhole opening up in California. Cheryl Casone on headlines now in New York, Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, the pictures are something else, Maria. Take a look at this. The ground collapsed between two condominium buildings, this is in southern California. This hole is about 80 feet long, it's about 20 feet wide, it's pretty big. Officials say it appear that an underground flood channel collapsed. Luckily, nobody was hurt. But man, it is something else to look at.Well, the creators of Baby Shark are soon going to have a new way to entertain kids and annoy parents.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Baby shark doo doo doo doo doo. Baby shark doo doo doo doo doo. Baby shark doo doo doo doo doo, baby shark.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Yes, Maria, to the joy of parents everywhere, Baby Shark has dominated YouTube more than two point billion views. It made the Billboard 100 chart. Soon it's going to be on your T.V. Pinkfong which is owned by Korean base SmartStudy plans to release supposedly short videos on Netflix, cartoon series, a musical also going to debut at some point in North America, Maria. And then finally there is this. Heinz is trying to turn ketchup into something fancy. They have created Ketchup Caviar, just in time for Valentine's Day everybody, Ketchup Caviar. Just weird it sounds like, it's ketchup shaped like caviar. There are no fish eggs, thank God. Now you can put it on your steak without drawing obnoxious stares from your friends. But the Ketchup Caviar not widely available. They're giving away 150 of them via Twitter through Monday. Anyway, back to Baby Shark, all right.BARTIROMO: OK, so it's not caviar at all.CASONE: No, and who doesn't want that for Valentine's Day?BARTIROMO: What do you think, Dagen? Valentine's Day gift.MCDOWELL: Well, it's a little molecular gastronomy. That's they basically use science to get the ketchup to form in to those little balls.Interesting about Baby Shark, I love Baby Shark. But instead on Netflix, I've been watching the documentary about Ted Bundy because I'm a freak. It's really --BARTIROMO: You find good shows on Netflix.MCDOWELL: I'm telling you watch "You" with Penn Badgley and then watch Ted Bundy. It will make you're weekend. You cannot go wrong. The Ted Bundy thing though is really creepy.BARTIROMO: OK, thank you. Good ideas. I will check it out. We're going to take a break. When we come back, we are talking brains interacting with robots. The future of artificial intelligence.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PEPPER: I watch MORNINGS WITH MARIA on the Fox Business Network for the smartest conversation in the morning.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: The smartest conversation in the morning, more of my conversation with Pepper the robot and the importance of A.I., stay with us.BARTIROMO: We are back. And we are coming to you live this week from the World Economic Forum here in Davos, Switzerland. One of the hot topics in Davos is artificial intelligence. HCL Technologies has been working on A.I. products that can help you with everything from shopping to healthcare.Yesterday, I met with the robot named Pepper at the HCL booth. The humanoid bot is designed to recognize people, read emotions, help you interface and chat. I had a chance to interview Pepper and found out she's pretty smart. And she's got some pretty good moves too.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Hello, Pepper, how are you doing today? Pepper, what's your favorite show?PEPPER: I watch MORNINGS WITH MARIA on the Fox Business Network for the smartest conversation in the morning.BARTIROMO: Well, you are smart. What job do you want?PEPPER: Maria, I would like your job one day. What do you think?BARTIROMO: Well, maybe one day. Not today. How are the markets doing?PEPPER: Maria, they have been volatile.BARTIROMO: It's true, they have been volatile. But better this year than last year. OK, Pepper, let me ask you this. What's your Super Bowl prediction?PEPPER: Someone once tweeted never bet against Bob Kraft, Bill Belichick or Tom Brady.BARTIROMO: That's true. Let's dance, Pepper. Thank you, Pepper.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: At the HCL experience here in Davos, they also were displaying a device that could help pregnant women, it alerts if experiencing early contractions and signals that the mother to be needs to see a doctor. Technology helping around the world, A.I. is here. It is changing the world and how we live and work. Dagen McDowell, what do you think?MCDOWELL: I think that you have much better dance moves than Pepper does. And I think we need to do more dancing on this program, robot or not.BARTIROMO: Yes, we do.MCDOWELL: But I think it just displays what the future -- what the future looks like in terms of technology. Artificial intelligence and robotics.HEATHER HIGGINS, CEO, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S VOICE: If I can say, though, I have human friends and I'm often very delighted that they don't remember everything I ever said. Certain limitations to these artificial know every things.BARTIROMO: HCL says that by 2030 robots and brains will work as one and they will be working together on a number of things, the ability to perceive emotions through face and voice analysis, multiple use case scenarios already being explored by some of the top brands. You can ask the robot questions. It's moving fast. And it is certainly moving in that direction. Whether you like it or not, Heather.HIGGINS: Yes. No, I'm sure that we'll largely like it but it's just -- there are advantages to human beings at this point still.BARTIROMO: Sure, that's the truth, but that was fun --MCDOWELL: One thing I'll add, you asked a lot of your guests this week in Davos. But again, are we as a nation and a world training individuals who are on jobs now where artificial intelligence and robotics will take a greater role in those very jobs, are we training those individuals to work in that environment? Are we prepared for it? And a lot of --BARTIROMO: Right.MCDOWELL: -- that remains to be seen.BARTIROMO: No, I don't think we are. I mean, I go back to education.MCDOWELL: Right.BARTIROMO: It's amazing to me that all of the fighting going on on the right and the left and we don't have enough conversation about just that, about skills training, about education, about educating our workforce so that they could actually thrive in this new normal, this new era that is certainly moving forward.MCDOWELL: Right.BARTIROMO: And that is including A.I. and robotics. We've got to make sure our workforce understands what's happening. It will replace humans in some jobs, 100 percent. There will be more jobs and different jobs but no doubt robotics will replace some jobs. So, it's scary.MCDOWELL: It is, absolutely.BARTIROMO: Take a short break.

Why America's fight with Huawei mattersCNN WireJanuary 30, 2019 Wednesday 12:22 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1105 wordsByline: Analysis by Jethro Mullen and Ben Westcott, CNN BusinessDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  The United States has ramped up its fight with China over technology by revealing charges against top telecoms company Huawei.The US Department of Justice alleges Huawei stole trade secrets from US-based companies and conspired to dodge US sanctions on Iran. Charges were also unsealed against the company's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, who is under arrest in Canada and faces possible extradition to the United States. What happens to Huawei and Meng will have huge implications for the world's top two economies, which are locked in an expanding clash over trade and technology. The dispute will shape ties between Beijing and Washington for years to come and could make or break China's aim to become a global technology power.Analysts say Huawei could suffer the same fate as its smaller rival ZTE, which was crippled for months last year by a US ban on buying vital tech components from American companies."The charges ... are likely to result in the imposition of US export controls that threaten Huawei's survival," Dan Wang, a tech analyst at research firm Gavekal, said in a note to clients Tuesday. "Any relief for the Chinese national champion will likely come at a steep price, and the issue seems set to take a central role in the ongoing US-China trade talks."Huawei: China's global tech iconHuawei, one of China's top tech companies, makes billions of dollars selling smartphones and telecommunications equipment around the world. Based in Shenzhen, it's a prominent example of the country's rapid economic and technological rise in recent decades.It sells more phones than Apple and is leading the rollout of superfast 5G wireless networks around the world.As Huawei expanded overseas, the United States identified it as a security threat as early as 2012, alleging that the Chinese government could use the company's products for spying. Huawei, which denies the accusations, has found itself at the heart of the growing rivalry between the United States and China to decide who will become the world's leading technology superpower. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang lashed out at the US charges against Huawei on Tuesday, accusing the United States of trying to "kill" Chinese businesses.In recent years, China has announced plans to pump hundreds of billions of dollars into building up key domestic tech industries such as microchips, artificial intelligence and electric cars. That helped trigger the trade war, with the US government attacking what it says are unfair Chinese policies aimed at boosting Chinese businesses at the expense of American ones, especially in the tech sector.The trade warThe US government has dialed up the pressure on Huawei while waging the trade war against China.Tariffs on hundreds of billions of goods traded between the two countries have hurt businesses around the world, roiled financial markets and contributed to fears about a global economic slowdown.US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping agreed a truce last month, and their governments are trying to negotiate a more lasting deal to end the hostilities. A new round of talks is due to start Wednesday in Washington.Trump's top trade negotiator has insisted that the pursuit of Meng by US authorities is a legal matter that is completely separate from the trade talks. But Trump undermined that stance by controversially suggesting he could intervene in the case if it would help reach a trade deal with Beijing.The new US charges against Huawei will make it even harder for the trade negotiators to insist that the case is unrelated to their talks, according to Gavekal's Wang, especially if Huawei is hit with a ban on buying American parts."Investors should now be focused on such export controls as a core tool of the US in its standoff with China," he said.Meng Wanzhou arrestThe tensions between the United States and Huawei took a dramatic turn last month when Canada detained its CFO at the request of the US government. Washington wants Meng extradited to face charges of helping Huawei dodge US sanctions on Iran. The Chinese government reacted furiously, saying the US charges are political and calling for the immediate release of Meng, who denies any wrongdoing.Her case has already done serious damage to relations between China and Canada. Chinese state-run media has run a steady drumbeat of editorials denouncing the Canadian government for its role in the case.Following Meng's arrest, Chinese authorities began detaining Canadians living in China. One Canadian man, who had been sentenced to 15 years in jail for drug trafficking, was re-sentenced to death after a one-day trial this month.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau fired his ambassador to China at the weekend after the diplomat made controversial comments about Meng's case.Meng's lawyer Reid Weingarten said in a statement his client should not be a "pawn or a hostage" to the complicated relationship between the US and China."Ms. Meng is an ethical and honorable businesswoman who has never spent a second of her life plotting to violate any US law, including the Iranian sanctions," he said.Huawei under pressureThe United States has been pushing its allies to prevent the use of technology from Huawei and ZTE in the core of superfast 5G wireless networks that are being built around the world.Australia and New Zealand have already restricted the use of Huawei equipment, and other governments --- including Japan and Germany --- have stepped up their scrutiny of it. Last week, top global mobile operator Vodafone said it was halting the installation of Huawei equipment in its core networks in Europe in light of the political uncertainty surrounding the company.Huawei has criticized the moves to shut it out of networks as "irresponsible decisions" based on ideological and geopolitical considerations rather than valid technological reasons. The pressure on Huawei appears set to hurt its business in Europe and other developed markets. But that alone is unlikely to threaten the company's survival, as its cheap and reliable equipment remains in demand in many countries, and sales of its smartphones are soaring. Telecom operators warn restrictions on Huawei technology could have wide ramifications. Vodafone's CEO said last week that a complete ban on all Huawei network equipment "would be a huge issue for us and the whole European telecommunications sector" and significantly delay the rollout of 5G networks.Steven Jiang and Daniel Shane contributed to this report.TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Turkey condemns China's 'torture and political brainwashing' in XinjiangCNN.comFebruary 10, 2019 Sunday 10:52 PM ESTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: ASIALength: 655 wordsByline: By Ben Westcott and Hira Humayun, CNNBodyTurkey has denounced Beijing's controversial mass "re-education" camps in China's western region of Xinjiang, calling them a "great shame for humanity."In a strongly-worded statement Saturday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hami Aksoy said hundreds of thousands of prisoners were subject to "torture and political brainwashing" in China's camps."We call on the international community and the Secretary General of the United Nations to take effective measures in order to bring to an end this human tragedy in Xinjiang," the statement said. He claimed thousands of children had been separated from their parents by the Chinese government.But Chinese state-run media has strongly refuted some of Turkey's claims, saying they "violated the facts," including allegations that Uyghur folk singer Abdurehim Heyit had died in jail.As many as 2 million Muslim-majority Uyghurs are estimated to have been imprisoned in huge detention centers in China's far west, according to a US government report.The human rights crisis in Xinjiang has drawn increasingly harsh criticism from across the world. At a UN hearing in November, more than a dozen countries called on Beijing to end its "arbitrary detention" of Uyghurs.Beijing has repeatedly denied it is detaining Uyghurs against their will, calling the camps "vocational training centers" and suggesting they are providing education.Xinjiang governor Shohrat Zakir, himself a Uyghur, told the state-run Xinhua news agency in October that since the crackdown "Xinjiang is not only beautiful but also safe and stable."But Aksoy claimed the Chinese government was undertaking a deliberate campaign to eradicate "the ethnic, religious and cultural identities of the Uyghur Turks and other Muslim communities in the region.""The reintroduction of internment camps in the 21st century and the policy of systematic assimilation against the Uyghur Turks carried out by the authorities of China is a great shame for humanity," the statement said.'In good health'The Turkish Foreign Ministry said it had learned singer Abdurehim Heyit, imprisoned for eight years for one of his songs, had died during his imprisonment in China."This tragedy has further reinforced the reaction of the Turkish public opinion towards serious human rights violations committed in the Xinjiang region. We expect this legitimate response to be taken into account by the Chinese authorities," the statement said.But state-run Chinese Radio International (CRI) released a video on its Turkish website appearing to show Abdurehim Heyet alive."Today is February 10, 2019, I'm in the process of being investigated for allegedly violating the national laws. I'm now in good health and have never been abused," the musician said haltingly in the video.On social media, CRI said the video was proof Heyit was "in good health" and Turkey's allegations were "unfounded."A statement from China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said their camps were open to the world. "We have invited more than 12 countries' ambassadors to China and foreign correspondents, including the Turkish ones, to visit Xinjiang," the statement said.The ministry called on Turkey to withdraw its "groundless accusations," claiming both countries were facing "severe anti-terrorism situations."Large Muslim-majority countries have increasingly registering their disapproval of Beijing's actions in Xinjiang. In December, the Indonesian government told reporters it had summoned China's ambassador to explain the actions taken against Uyghurs.There have been large-scale demonstrations in both Turkey and Indonesia against Beijing over the past year.It comes as human rights activists and former detainees described death and torture inside Beijing's Xinjiang camps.Former detainee Mihrigul Tursun told CNN in January that she saw nine fellow inmates die during her time in the detention centers, in cells so crowded there wasn't enough space for everyone to sit down.Load-Date: February 11, 2019End of Document

PUBLIC EVIDENCE OF HUAWEI AS A CYBER THREAT MAY BE ELUSIVE, BUT RESTRICTIONS COULD STILL BE WARRANTEDStates News ServiceMarch 7, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 945 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: SANTA MONICA, Calif. BodyThe following information was released by RAND Corp.:by Timothy R. HeathRecently, media reports disclosed that President Trump is weighing an executive order that would ban U.S. companies from using the products and services of China's two giant telecommunications firms, Huawei and ZTE.In late January, FBI Director Christopher Wray warned that access provided by Huawei could allow the Chinese government to maliciously modify or steal information, conduct undetected espionage, or exert pressure or control.The statement followed Canada's arrest of Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou in December over U.S. allegations of violating trade sanctions with Iran and theft of technology from T-Mobile.Businesses and other Western governments have heeded Washington's warnings. Huawei has been prohibited from supplying its 4G and 5G equipment to the four major U.S. telecommunications carriers, and its products have been dropped by electronics retailer Best Buy.Japan's government banned government purchases of Huawei and ZTE equipment in late 2018, and Australia and New Zealand haven blocked Huawei and ZTE from building 5G networks as well. The Czech Republic, among others, have designated Huawei and ZTE as cyber threats.Yet some cyber experts dispute the threat posed by Huawei. Critics have pointed out that no government has provided evidence of malicious Chinese state cyber activity through Huawei. A 2018 British government board issued an inconclusive report on the potential threat from Huawei.In light of the paucity of public evidence, some commentators have dismissed warnings about the company as unsubstantiated. Of course, these views are uninformed by whatever classified information may be held by the U.S. and other governments.Despite the lack of a publicly available smoking gun, restrictions on Huawei's role in U.S. information networks could be justified.Share on TwitterDespite the lack of a publicly available smoking gun, restrictions on Huawei's role in U.S. information networks could be justified for three strategic reasons alone.First, as part of the country's critical infrastructure, telecommunication networks provide the information conduit for the future of health care, transportation and financial services, among many other areas.Governments have a right to be concerned about which foreign entities may have access to information carried on these networks. Beijing understands this point well, given its own refusal to allow foreign companies to build telecommunications networks in China.Second, Huawei and ZTE share the liabilities of being Chinese companies. The close relationship with the government invariably raises the risk that the companies will carry out espionage and security work for the government.Like other Chinese companies, Huawei and ZTE feature Chinese Communist Party (CCP) cells. These CCP cells ensure the companies comply with directives from Beijing. Laws obligate those companies to support any intelligence or security work deemed necessary.For example, China's 2017 National Intelligence Law requires all organizations and citizens to support, assist, and cooperate with state intelligence work.China's 2014 Counter Espionage Law similarly states relevant organizations and individuals must not refuse to provide information during the course of a counter-espionage investigation. These laws do not clarify the scope of intelligence and counter-espionage work, suggesting interpretation could be very broad.Third, the intensifying tensions between China and the United States has increased the need to protect America's critical infrastructure and competitive edge.In recent years, Chinese telecommunications companies have proved willing partners in efforts by Chinese authorities to expand domestic surveillance and hunt down political opponents.But Beijing has begun to export such behavior abroad. Anxiety over China's influence operations has grown over Beijing's willingness to coerce, blackmail and bribe people in other countries.Moreover, protection of America's telecommunications market also serves the country's economic and security interests. U.S. companies have thrived in areas of fair competition, but China is anything but a fair competitor.Thanks in large part to the state's role in subsidizing the company and excluding Western competition in China, Huawei surpassed Apple to become the second-largest smartphone manufacturer in the world last year.Huawei's success follows a pattern in which Beijing has protected and nurtured domestic tech companies while denying access to Western competitors. Given the importance of information technology companies to the U.S. economy, Washington is right to take prudent measures to promote a level playing field for American companies.Although a smoking gun of Huawei involvement in government-directed espionage remains elusive, Washington has compelling security and economic reasons to consider limiting the involvement of Chinese telecommunications companies in its domestic networks.Chinese companies carry an unavoidable risk because of their inherent connections to the Chinese government. Moreover, the intensifying strategic competition between the United States and China demands improved security of information networks and fair competition for key U.S. technology industries.Timothy R.

Stories from Slate; There are many theories and plenty of uncertainty.Slate MagazineJanuary 4, 2019 Friday 7:05 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Washingtonpost.Newsweek Interactive Company, LLC. All Rights ReservedSection: FUTURE TENSE; TechnologyLength: 1263 wordsByline: Aaron MakHighlight: Nobody Really Knows Why Apple Is Struggling in ChinaBodyApple shocked investors on Wednesday when the company warned that it was lowering its revenue expectations for the first quarter because of flagging sales over the holidays. Apple now expects about $84 billion in revenue for the period, down from its estimate of somewhere between $89 billion and $93 billion. The            Nasdaq fell about 202 points and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 660 points after the announcement.In a letter to investors, Apple CEO Tim Cook wrote, "Most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad." However, it's unclear what exactly is causing the shortfall.The U.S. and China are currently involved in negotiations aimed at averting a trade war. President Trump has threatened to raise tariffs on $200 billion of imports from China from 10 percent to 25 percent if negotiations don't go well for the U.S. The president has also mused about levying a 10 percent tariff on the $267 billion worth of imports from China that are currently untaxed, including the iPhone, which is primarily manufactured in China.Many commentators have blamed uncertainty from the trade dispute for dragging Apple's sales down, though issues within the company and a long-term slowdown in China's economy could also be at fault.In order to better understand Apple's struggles in the context of U.S.-China relations, Slate spoke with Graham Webster, coordinating editor of the DigiChina project at New America. (Disclosure: New America is a partner with Slate and Arizona State University in Future Tense.)Below is a transcript of the interview, which has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.Slate: What was your reaction to the Apple news? Was this surprising to you?Webster: The news is that Apple was revising downward its sales expectations. My question is: Do those expectations already figure in the fact that the iPhone is in an increasingly competitive market in China? There are Chinese phone makers who are making really great hardware, at lower price points, and the iPhone isn't necessarily the only prestige product anymore in the Chinese market.But if they had figured in this shift in the market, then the question is: What mix of other factors are causing this change? I don't know the answer to that core question of whether Apple's projections have been overly optimistic about the China market in general.What's maybe more interesting than the actual cause is that people really seem to have taken this news as a signal on two fronts. One is the notion that China's consumer spending and general economic growth seem to be less robust. The other is that, intriguingly, there may be some people who are avoiding Apple because of the confrontation between the United States and China, especially the extent to which it focuses on Huawei and            ZTE. These are two Chinese companies targeted by the U.S. government who make cellphones, along with many other things. Regardless of [why] the expectations were missed ... the market seems to have taken it as an indication of a decline for Apple in China and maybe a decline for China overall.How would you say the trade situation between the U.S. and China is generally affecting U.S. tech companies like Apple? Does Apple seem like a singular case?Apple is an important case because it's large, and China sales account for roughly one-fifth of its global sales revenue. There aren't a lot of companies like Apple. It's not like there's this row of American giants that are producing every piece of electronics. When it comes to laptops, the global leaders are not generally American companies. So when you look for indications of what's going on more broadly, Apple is a bellwether. I think that's why this story has really captured people's imaginations.Many commentators attribute Apple's struggles to an overall slowdown in China's economy. Do you think this is a result of the trade dispute or of China's own economic policies?I'm not a China macroeconomics expert, but experts in the Chinese economy were debating whether there might be a slowdown in growth well before Trump was elected. There's always a question about whether Chinese growth statistics are real or fake or, more realistically, to what degree they've been politicized and manipulated. Even the central government was saying that it was targeting lower growth rates than has been the case during China's super rapid industrialization and economic growth over the past 40 years. It's not easy to assign any particular change in indicators to the trade war versus broader macro events in China's own economy.I would guess, though, that there is an effect because what the U.S. government has done under the Trump administration is to undertake disruptive economic policies with a very high degree of uncertainty. It's not clear what will satisfy the Americans [in trade negotiations]. It may not be clear even to the Chinese negotiators. So investors making decisions about their businesses or how to act in the market just don't know what to expect. If the United States remains a source of uncertainty, this naturally is going to cause increased nerves in China because the two countries have highly interconnected economies.Trump's economic adviser Kevin Hassett claimed that the Apple numbers prove that the Chinese economy is under a lot of economic stress, likely because of the trade dispute, which is a good sign for the U.S. coming out on top during negotiations. What do you make of that ? It cannot be known with a high degree of certainty the extent to which U.S. policies are affecting Chinese economic health. If anyone on any side is saying confidently that they know what's going on, they're overstating what they actually know. I certainly would be very skeptical of messaging from the U.S. administration, because not only do they have obvious political reasons domestically to paint things in a positive light for themselves, but they may also be employing strategic messaging with their Chinese counterparts.The additional element with the Trump administration is that it remains uncertain the degree to which there's agreement inside the administration. Some reports are saying that now there's greater agreement and that U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has become the lead strategist here. But it was the case previously that there were very public divisions between Treasury Secretary [Steven] Mnuchin and some of the people who were in favor of more disruptive approaches.What is the U.S. position? What types of concessions would actually satisfy the administration? It's clear that the overall demands on the part of the U.S. that China abandon industrial policies that seek to favor its own technological advancement will not succeed. The Chinese government will not abandon efforts to modernize its economy and develop leading tech industries. So that demand is a nonstarter and any apparent concession that Americans might use to declare victory is going to turn out to be a fantasy.Do you think the Apple earnings will affect U.S.-China trade negotiations at all?My instinct is that this is not a huge factor. I think it's an exciting news story. It definitely affected the stock of a huge American company and a bunch of related stocks, but when it comes to the impasse between two governments over industrial policy, market access, intellectual property, the trade balance, a few-percentage-point difference in iPhone sales in greater China isn't that big a deal.Load-Date: January 5, 2019End of Document
