Demand from Huawei tense plus the China-US relationshipCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 8, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 647 wordsBody The Asian telecommunications giant is seeking to challenge a law that prevents it from selling its products in North America.  Everything happens in the middle of a denunciation of espionage and the battle for tariffs.  The telecommunications equipment manufacturer Huawei has announced a lawsuit against the US government for having banned its products amid accusations of espionage against the Chinese company, which also claimed that Washington hacked its servers.  Huawei's rotating president, Guo Ping, reported in a press conference about the legal actions taken by the company with the objective of challenging section 889 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which prevents to US government agencies purchasing Huawei products.  "This ban is not only illegal, it also restricts Huawei from participating in fair competition and, ultimately, harms US consumers," Guo said in the southeastern Chinese city of Shenzhen, the company's headquarters.  Given this situation, he explained, the largest manufacturer of telecommunications equipment and the second smartphone in the world has been forced to file a lawsuit in a court in Texas, where the headquarters of Huawei is located in the United States, the agency reported. EFE.  The lawsuit comes after the arrest of Huawei's financial director, Meng Wanzhou, in Canada last December, at the US request, after being accused of violating the trade sanctions imposed by Washington against Iran. US pressure On bail, the board is still waiting for his extradition hearing to the United States, in a case that, according to his defense and the Chinese Government, is politically motivated.  A month later, in late January, the US Department of Justice charged the company with 13 counts, including industrial espionage and bank fraud.  Amid this crisis, US diplomacy is pushing allied countries and their Internet and wireless services providers to avoid Huawei, arguing that Beijing could force him to spy on or deactivate their networks.  "Given that the United States never presented any evidence to justify its claims, we questioned its intention not to let other countries use Huawei's products," Guo said, adding that the government of President Donald Trump "spares no effort in manipulating the public opinion to discredit Huawei. "  The spokesman of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Lu Kang, considered "totally legitimate and understandable" that Huawei "tries to defend its own interests" and assured that it has no record of possible legal actions regarding the Government.  Accusations about the security of the 5G technology developed by the Chinese company were always rejected. It insists that it does not have "back doors" to access any device and control it without the user's knowledge.  "Nor will we allow others to do so with our equipment," Guo warned, and publicly accused US authorities of attacking the company's servers.  "The US government has long called Huawei a threat. He has hacked our servers and stolen our mails and our codes, "he said.  In his view, Washington "fears that other countries will overtake it by adopting the most advanced 5G technologies" and "wrongly believes that it would benefit from the repression against Huawei."  Serious complaint  Sexual attack  A senator said that she was raped in theAir Force.  US Senator Martha McSally, the first woman in the country to handle a fighter in combat, reported that she was raped during her service in the Air Force by a senior officer. "I stayed silent for many years, but, later in my career, while the military was dealing with scandals and their totally inadequate responses, I felt the need for them to know that I was also a survivor," McSally said in a hearing at the Senate on sexual assaults in the Armed Forces. He argued that he did not file the complaint then because "he did not trust the system."  Advertising       Load-Date: March 8, 2019End of Document

TOP NEWS: Trump Optimistic For US-China Trade Deal, Expects To Meet XiLive Briefs PRO Global MarketsFebruary 23, 2019 Saturday 6:14 AM ESTCopyright 2019 MT Newswires All Rights ReservedLength: 498 wordsBody US President Donald Trump said Friday a trade deal with China is likely and indicated he is open to extending his March 1 deadline in order to reach it."It's probably more likely that a deal does happen," Trump said, speaking to reporters at the White House, but added: "It doesn't mean it's going to happen."Trump met earlier with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, who joined him in the Oval Office for an informal press conference afterwards.Liu also said there was a very good chance that a deal will be struck."We believe that it is very likely and we hope that we will have a deal and the Chinese society is ready to make the utmost effort," he said through an interpreter.Trump said he expects to meet with President Xi Jinping, possibly next month, to "work out the final points" of a deal."Ultimately, I think the biggest decisions and some even smaller decisions will be made by President Xi and myself," he said.He noted after meetings Thursday and Friday at the White House between US and Chinese negotiators, the Chinese delegation decided to extend their stay because the talks were going well.The two sides plan to keep meeting throughout the weekend, with Chinese negotiators now planning to leave Washington on Sunday night or Monday.The high-level talks come after the latest round of negotiations in Beijing last week ended inconclusively.Since July, the US has imposed tariffs of 25% on USD50 billion worth of Chinese goods and 10% on another USD200 billion, with China retaliating in kind.The US has threatened to raise the 10% tariff to 25% on March 1 if no agreement is reached.Trump and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, who was also in the Oval Office for the briefing, said the two sides had reached what Trump termed a "final agreement" to stabilize currency. Trump declined to elaborate when asked about it during the briefing.He also confirmed that while the two sides are not discussing the possibility of dropping criminal charges against an executive of the telecommunications company Huawei, the topic would be raised with Attorney General Bill Barr in the coming weeks.The Justice Department last month accused Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's chief financial officer, of violating trade sanctions against Iran and stealing trade secrets. The US is seeking Meng's extradition from Canada, where she was arrested in December at the request of US authorities.Huawei has denied US accusations that its telecommunications equipment facilitates Chinese spying.Trump said he doesn't want the potential trade deal to block any companies out of the US market when it comes to the development of future high-speed telecommunications networks."I want to have competition with China, fair competition," Trump said. "We've always done well when we have open competition."The US has been considering a ban on Huawei even as it encourages its allies to sever ties to the company, pointing to its close relationship with the Chinese government and concerns over spying.By Gretel Johnston, dpaLoad-Date: February 24, 2019End of Document

THERMO FISHER'S NECESSARY, BUT INSUFFICIENT, STEP IN CHINA US COMPANY CEASES SALE OF 'HUMAN IDENTIFICATION TECHNOLOGY' IN XINJIANG REGIONStates News ServiceFebruary 22, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 428 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, N.Y. BodyThe following information was released by Human Rights Watch:Sophie RichardsonChina Director SophieHRWThermo Fisher Scientific, a large US-based medical technology manufacturer, announced this week it would stop selling human identification technology in China's Xinjiang region. After more than a year of unanswered questions from Human Rights Watch, members of the US Congress, and others culminating in a damning New York Times expose of its sales in Xinjiang Thermo Fisher chalked the decision up to "fact-specific assessments."Xinjiang, in northwestern China, has been synonymous with gross human rights violations for decades. Since late 2016, the Chinese government has accelerated abuses under its "Strike Hard" Campaign, which entails mass arbitrary detention of Turkic Muslim minorities, Orwellian surveillance, and harsh restrictions on cultural, religious, and linguistic rights.Thermo Fisher's decision leaves many key questions unanswered: What about sales of that technology to Chinese police in other parts of the country? The police's abusive collection of DNA materials from people unconnected to crimes is not confined to Xinjiang. What about other companies' technology that has been misused? Will the numerous other companies that may wittingly or not be enabling China's surveillance state rethink their business? And what will Thermo Fisher do to prevent these types of sales from happening again?In the past two years, Human Rights Watch has documented Chinese authorities' alarming enthusiasm for facial and voice recognition technology, compulsory collection of biometric data, "big data" platforms, the social credit system, QR codes, and apps used by security forces to monitor people's everyday life, and many other high-technology tools all in a context where people enjoy virtually no privacy rights or ability to challenge government violations. Companies operating in China should be under no illusions that the authorities might deploy technology to commit serious abuses. As Thermo Fisher now notes: "[W]e recognize the importance of considering how our products and services are used or may be used by our customers."International companies across China would do well to urgently evaluate how their products and services are being used, and who their customers are. Any firm that cannot show it has assessed the human rights impact of its commercial activities and mitigated harm in what United Nations experts have labelled a "no rights zone" should do so now even if that might mean not doing business with Chinese authorities at all.Load-Date: February 23, 2019End of Document

Mark Warner, D-Virginia, issued the following statement:U.S. Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-VA), Vice Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, issued the below statement after the Department of Justice charged Huawei with the theft of trade secrets, sanctions violations and obstruction of justice:"There is ample evidence to suggest that no major Chinese company is independent of the Chinese government and Communist Party - and Huawei, which China's government and military tout as a 'national champion,' is no exception. It has been clear for some time that Huawei poses a threat to our national security, and I applaud the Trump Administration for taking steps to finally hold the company accountable."This is also a reminder that we need to take seriously the risks of doing business with companies like Huawei and allowing them access to our markets, and I will continue to strongly urge our ally Canada to reconsider Huawei's inclusion in any aspect of its 5G infrastructure."This action further underscores the need for a coordinated, whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach to dealing with the threat posed by an increasingly forceful China. I will continue to urge the Trump Administration to make China's rampant IP theft a top priority in ongoing trade negotiations, and will continue pressing for a more coherent, cohesive national strategy to protect U.S. technology and ensure U.S. technological competitiveness."Sen. Warner, a former telecommunications executive and entrepreneur, has long expressed concerns about the risks to our national security posed by Chinese-controlled telecom companies.Earlier this month, Sen. Warner and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) introduced bipartisan legislation to create an Office of Critical Technologies &#38; Security at the White House responsible for coordinating across agencies and developing a long-term, whole-of-government strategy to protect against state-sponsored technology theft and risks to critical supply chains.On October 12, 2018, Sen. Warner and Sen. Rubio sent a letter to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau urging his country to reconsider Huawei's inclusion in any aspect of Canada's 5G development, introduction, and maintenance.In September, Sen. Warner joined several colleagues to introduce the ZTE Enforcement Review and Oversight (ZERO) Act. The bipartisan bill would enforce full compliance by ZTE--a Chinese state-directed telecommunications firm that repeatedly violated U.S. laws - with all probationary conditions outlined in a Commerce Department deal with the company that lifted a denial order banning the export of U.S. parts and components.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6592894 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: January 30, 2019End of Document

It has been clear for some time that Huawei poses a threat to our national security, and I applaud the Trump Administration for taking steps to finally hold the company accountable."This is also a reminder that we need to take seriously the risks of doing business with companies like Huawei and allowing them access to our markets, and I will continue to strongly urge our ally Canada to reconsider Huawei's inclusion in any aspect of its 5G infrastructure."This action further underscores the need for a coordinated, whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach to dealing with the threat posed by an increasingly forceful China. I will continue to urge the Trump Administration to make China's rampant IP theft a top priority in ongoing trade negotiations, and will continue pressing for a more coherent, cohesive national strategy to protect U.S. technology and ensure U.S. technological competitiveness."Sen. Warner, a former telecommunications executive and entrepreneur, has long expressed concerns about the risks to our national security posed by Chinese-controlled telecom companies.Earlier this month, Sen. Warner and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) introduced bipartisan legislation to create an Office of Critical Technologies &#38; Security at the White House responsible for coordinating across agencies and developing a long-term, whole-of-government strategy to protect against state-sponsored technology theft and risks to critical supply chains.On October 12, 2018, Sen. Warner and Sen. Rubio sent a letter to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau urging his country to reconsider Huawei's inclusion in any aspect of Canada's 5G development, introduction, and maintenance.In September, Sen. Warner joined several colleagues to introduce the ZTE Enforcement Review and Oversight (ZERO) Act. The bipartisan bill would enforce full compliance by ZTE-a Chinese state-directed telecommunications firm that repeatedly violated U.S. laws - with all probationary conditions outlined in a Commerce Department deal with the company that lifted a denial order banning the export of U.S. parts and components.

China lashes out at the US after Huawei got caught in a security firestorm that's getting worse by the dayBusiness Insider USJanuary 18, 2019 Friday 06:29 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 792 wordsByline: feedback@businessinsider.com,  (Jake Kanter)Highlight: Chinese tech giant Huawei is having a nightmare week.BodyReuters• Chinese tech giant Huawei is having a nightmare week.• Huawei is reportedly facing a criminal investigation in the US over suspicions it stole trade secrets, lawmakers are trying to stifle the firm, and it is being blocked from helping build 5G networks.• China is lashing out, accusing the US of "McCarthyism" and saying it is "using every possible state apparatus to suppress and block" Chinese tech firms.• Reclusive CEO Ren Zhengfei said this week that Huawei has had "no serious security incident."China is lashing out the US as the firestorm of security concerns around technology giant Huawei grew in intensity over the past week.Following the arrest of CFO Meng Wanzhou, international fears are growing that Huawei is a Chinese state spying tool and it is facing attacks on numerous fronts. In the past few days alone:• The Wall Street Journal reported that the US Department of Justice has launched a criminal investigation into Huawei over suspicions it stole trade secrets from firms like T-Mobile. The investigation was sparked in part by civil lawsuits, including a claim that Huawei misappropriated robotic technology from T-Mobile. Huawei later settled with the US firm.• A bipartisan group of US lawmakers introduced bills on Wednesday attempting to ban the sale of American microchips to Huawei. China called the idea "hysteria."• Germany is considering is blocking the company from helping build its 5G cell phone network, according to the Financial Times. It follows similar moves in the US, Australia, and New Zealand, while the UK has also raised concerns.• The FT also reports on warnings from US lawmakers that Huawei's solar equipment could be hacked to disrupt America's electricity supplies. Tom Marino, a Democratic representative from Pennsylvania, said in a letter to Energy Secretary Rick Perry that he was "concerned that the company's entrance into large-scale and residential solar markets may pose a threat to our nation's infrastructure."• The University of Oxford said it has stopped accepting funding from Huawei, citing public concerns over security."The decision has been taken in the light of public concerns raised in recent months surrounding UK partnerships with Huawei," it said in a statement, according to Reuters.China has been consistently robust in its defence of Huawei, and on Thursday Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, went on the offensive again."People around the world all know very well the true intention of the US using every possible state apparatus to suppress and block Chinese high-tech companies," she said. "What the US side is doing is not the normal thing a normal country will do, still less a proper behavior for the number one power in the world."On the threat of a trade secrets investigation, Hua added: "We are concerned over the reports that the US federal prosecutor is conducting criminal investigation into this case, which is rather abnormal. We particularly doubt it real motives."Read more: Huawei's CEO called Trump a 'great president' in an extraordinary plea to end America's war with his companyElsewhere, Hu Xijin, the editor of the state-run Global Times newspaper, accused America of "McCarthyism," a political tactic of levelling serious allegations without significant evidence."By escalating its crackdown on Huawei, the US sets a bad precedent of applying McCarthyism in high-tech fields. It deprives a high-tech company of the rights to stay away from politics, focus on technology and market," he tweeted this week.Such is the crisis engulfing Huawei, reclusive CEO Ren Zhengfei spoke to the press for the first time since 2015 this week. He attempted to calm security fears around the company and called Donald Trump a "great president." Ren said Huawei has had "no serious security incident" and there is "no law in China [that] requires any company to install mandatory backdoors."Business Insider has contacted Huawei for comment. In remarks to other press, it declined to comment directly on the potential DOJ investigation, but said: "Huawei and T-Mobile settled their disputes in 2017 following a US jury verdict finding neither damage, unjust enrichment nor wilful and malicious conduct by Huawei in T-Mobile's trade secret claim."NOW WATCH: 7 science-backed ways to a happier and healthier 2019 that you can do the first week of the new yearSee Also:• Microsoft President Brad Smith says these are the 10 biggest challenges facing tech in 2019• Demand for new smartphones is in free-fall and this chart shows that the bottom is not yet in sight• A 2nd Huawei executive has been arrested - this time in Poland on suspicion of spying for the Chinese governmentSEE ALSO: Here's why it's so hard to buy Huawei devices in the USLoad-Date: February 11, 2019End of Document

The previous goal was "about" 6.5%. In preparation for a "tough economic battle ahead," Keqiang also promised tax cuts worth 2 trillion yuan ($298 billion) for the year.Annual GDP growth of 6% would be the slowest rate of Chinese expansion in almost three decades, according to Bloomberg. The website linked the potential slowdown to Chinese officials' efforts to reduce debt risks, preserve the environment and combat poverty.Analysts noted that the news was not a huge surprise, which in turn helped mute the reaction in the stock market."This was in fact expected and so the market reaction has been balanced by Beijing pledging support for the economy, amid growing pressure from high debt and the US-Sino trade dispute," said Jasper Lawler, Head of Research at London Capital Group."As more details over the economic package are released over the coming days, we could see Chinese shares extend their rally."Here's the roundup:• US futures rose on the news, with those underlying the S&P 500, the Dow Jones, and the Nasdaq rising at least 0.2% as of 9:20 a.m. in London (4:20 a.m. in ET).• China's benchmark, the Shanghai Composite Index, gained about 0.9%; Japan's Nikkei fell 0.4%; and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong was flat.• In Europe, the broad Euro Stoxx 50 climbed 0.25%, Germany's Dax rose 0.12%, and the UK's FTSE 100 was 0.3% higher.NOW WATCH: Here's how North Korea's Kim Jong Un became one of the world's scariest dictatorsSee Also:• China's superrich are losing faith in the country's economy, with some even worried it will turn into the next Venezuela• South Korean stocks are getting pounded after the sudden breakdown of Trump and Kim's summit• Global markets are jittery as India-Pakistan tensions hit a near 50-year highLoad-Date: March 5, 2019End of Document

Huawei says 2018 sales top $100B despite US pressureAssociated Press Financial WireMarch 29, 2019 Friday 4:13 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 380 wordsByline: By JOE McDONALD, AP Business WriterDateline: SHENZHEN, China BodySHENZHEN, China (AP) - Chinese tech giant Huawei's deputy chairman defended its commitment to security Friday after a stinging British government report added to Western pressure on the company by accusing it of failing to repair dangerous flaws in its telecom technology.Guo Ping's comments came as Huawei Technologies Ltd., the biggest global maker of network equipment for phone and internet companies, reported its 2018 sales surged past $100 billion despite U.S. pressure on American allies to shun it as a security threat.Accusations that Huawei might facilitate Chinese spying threaten to hamper its access to global markets as carriers prepare to invest billions of dollars in next-generation technology.Thursday's report by Britain's National Cyber Security Center accused Huawei of "poor software engineering," but said it saw no indication that was due to Chinese government interference. It said Huawei failed to repair flaws that might make its systems vulnerable to cyberattacks.Guo said Huawei was ready to work with foreign regulators to improve security. He noted the company has promised to invest $2 billion over five years to improve its software engineering."We prioritize cybersecurity and privacy protection even above our commercial targets," said Guo at a news conference.Huawei's U.S. market evaporated after a 2012 congressional report labeled the company a security threat, but its business elsewhere has grown rapidly. Huawei passed Apple last year as the No. 2 global smartphone brand behind Samsung and earlier passed Sweden's LM Ericsson as the No. 1 network equipment seller.Last year, global sales rose 19.5 percent over 2017 to 721.2 billion ($105.2 billion), according to Guo. That was driven by double-digit gains for its consumer and enterprise units, while sales of network gear to phone and internet carriers were unchanged at 294 billion yuan ($62.3 billion).Guo blamed weak network gear sales on a temporary lull in investment by phone carriers. He expressed confidence shipments of fifth-generation, or 5G, technology will take off this year.Huawei has announced sales of 5G networks to a handful of foreign mobile phone companies and has contracts with major carriers in Britain, South Korea, Germany and other countries for field testing.Load-Date: March 30, 2019End of Document

The more recent major platform to be blocked was            Facebook's WhatsApp in 2017.China has blocked many of the popular social media platforms, including Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, WhatsApp, Tumblr, and Reddit. China also restricts citizen access to several news outlets, including the New York Times, Bloomberg, BBC, Reuters, the Wall Street Journal, and Time.Read more: China's 'Great Firewall' is taller than ever under 'president-for-life' Xi JinpingGoogle's search engine has been unavailable in China since 2011, according to censorship-tracking group Greatfire.org. For many, Bing was one of the last remaining foreign search engines accessible to Chinese citizens. Google at one point was helping to build a censored search engine for China. However, the project - named Dragonfly - was reportedly shuttered after facing severe backlash from Google employees.Under China's president Xi Jinping, the government has implemented several policies to increase online censorship. Censorship of online platforms has soared in the seven years since Xi took office, human rights organization PEN America wrote in a 2018 report on China's control over social media.A Microsoft spokesperson confirmed Bing was "currently inaccessible in China" in a statement to the Financial Times.

China ex-internet czar sentenced to 14 years for corruptionAssociated Press InternationalMarch 26, 2019 Tuesday 10:47 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 437 wordsDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - China's former internet censor, who once held high-profile meetings with industry leaders such as Apple CEO Tim Cook and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, was sentenced to 14 years in prison on corruption charges Tuesday.The Intermediate People's Court in the eastern city of Ningbo said Lu Wei had confessed to accepting 32 million yuan ($4.6 million) in bribes. It said he expressed remorse and vowed not to appeal his sentence.Lu helped lead the ruling Communist Party's tightening of controls over domestic cyberspace and championed Beijing's stance that governments have a right to filter and censor internet access.China has 700 million people online, but authorities impose heavy controls on political content and sites related to gambling and pornography. Social media sites such as Facebook and Google also are blocked.In its ruling, the Ningbo court said Lu had abused his authority in various positions, including as a deputy propaganda minister and as head of a government internet security advisory body, accepting gifts in return for favors.Lu took a hard line in demanding tough security checks on imported foreign tech products and censoring foreign internet companies and social networks like Facebook in the name of preserving social stability.He worked his way up the ranks of China's official Xinhua News Agency from a reporting job in the southern city of Guilin in the early 1990s to become the agency's vice president from 2004 to 2011. He was vice mayor of Beijing from 2011 to 2013.A report by the government broadcaster CCTV gave few details. But earlier reports said Lu also had had engaged in factionalism and "selectively enforced" the party's "strategic arrangements on internet work."President Xi Jinping has carried out a wide-ranging crackdown on corruption that observers say is calculated to strengthen party control while bringing down potential challengers to his authority.One of the officials and military leaders ensnared in the anti-graft campaign was the former president of Interpol, Meng Hongwei, who vanished after traveling to China from France, where the global anti-crime body is headquartered.The government says Meng is under investigation for graft and possible other crimes. There are heavy suspicions he had fallen out of political favor with Xi.Lu's sentencing also comes as China is locked in a trade war with the U.S. and competition over leadership in next-generation 5-G internet technology.The U.S. has sought to block usage of equipment from Chinese internet giant Huawei, saying its links to the Chinese government and military pose a security threat.Load-Date: March 27, 2019End of Document

CANADIAN POLICE PROBE ONLINE ABUSE OF ETHNIC TIBETAN STUDENT UNION PRESIDENTStates News ServiceMarch 8, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 781 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Canadian police are investigating whether a torrent of online abuse and harassment of a Tibetan woman studying at the University of Toronto last month constitutes a crime."The Toronto police are currently investigating the threatening online messages sent to Chemi Lhamo," police spokeswoman Jenifferjit Sidhu told reporters."The investigation began on Feb. 26, and is still ongoing," she said. "We won't be able to take the next step yet, as we are still gathering more evidence."Chemi Lhamo, who was born in India and is a vocal supporter of Students For a Free Tibet, started getting hate mail after being elected President of Scarborough Campus Students' Union (SCSU) on Feb. 9.One comment read: "China is your daddyyou better know this," while another threatened her, saying "we will make sure things get done so u won't survive a day. Peace RIP."Meanwhile, a petition calling on Lhamo to step down garnered nearly 10,000 signatures, and screenshots calling Lhamo a "Tibetan separatist" were shared via social media.Lhamo issued a statement saying she wouldn't be influenced by the hate mail, and blaming the abuse on on Chinese government infiltration of Canadian universities.Now, Toronto police are scrolling through around 15,000 comments in different languages on various social media sites, to determine whether any of the messages broke Canadian law.Lhamo is also reporting to campus police on an hourly basis to ensure her safety, the National Post newspaper reported.China denies involvementThe Chinese consulate in Toronto has denied any involvement in the mobilization of Chinese students against Lhamo, saying the online comments were spontaneously generated by "objective facts and patriotic enthusiasm."Canadian lawyer Richard Lee said police could be looking for messages that constitute harassment under Canadian law."Part of the law on harassment defines harassment as using communications in a way that could constitute threats or cause a person anxiety," Lee told RFA. "If such actions occur repeatedly, then this could constitute the crime of harassment.""If criminal charges are proven, then they can result in a fine or a prison sentence," he said.The maximum sentence in severe cases is 10 years' imprisonment, while less serious charges could result in a C$5,000 fine and six months' imprisonment, Lee said.'Deeply concerned'An independent group of overseas Chinese students last month hit out at Chinese Communist Party-backed student groups on overseas campuses, following reports that they threatened and harassed Chemi Lhamo, among other activists campaigning against Beijing's human rights violations.The Independent Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars in USA (IFCSS) said it was "deeply concerned" about reports that have emerged from universities in the United States, Canada, France, Ireland, and the Netherlands of the coordinated targeting of activists campaigning against China's treatment of ethnic minorities.It said that "apparently organized pro-CCP (Chinese Communist Party) students harassed, abused and threatened Uyghur and Tibetan students, concerned scholars and activists," in incidents at McMaster University and the University of Toronto in Canada, and Duke University in the U.S.Uyghur activist Rukiye Turdush, whose lecture on the mass incarceration of Uyghurs and other ethnic minority Muslims in China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) was disrupted by Chinese students at Duke University, said Chinese students had discussed locating her son, while screenshots emerged suggesting the students were liaising with the Chinese embassy or consulate.Routinely targetedMeanwhile, the University of Toronto student newspaper Varsity published an opinion piece from the president of the Students For a Free Tibet group on Scarborough Campus, saying that its members are routinely targeted by mainland Chinese students."Our members have been a constant target of ire from certain sections of the international Chinese student community at our events on campus," Dechen Tenzin wrote."It is not uncommon for Chinese students to show up at our tables to mock, question, and demean our displays and our objective of spreading awareness about the ongoing Tibetan struggle.""It would not be entirely surprising if the international Chinese students campaigning against Lhamo were receiving direct support from the Chinese government," Dechen Tenzin said."It would not be the first time that questions over the Chinese government's interference through student groups have surfaced."Reported by Liu Fei for RFA's Mandarin Service.

BLOGGER TRIED FOR 'DEFAMING' CHINESE LEADERS PAST AND PRESENTStates News ServiceJanuary 31, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 691 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Authorities in the central Chinese province of Hubei have tried a prominent blogger for insulting the country's president and late supreme leader Mao Zedong, RFA has learned.Former bank employee and blogger Liu Yanli, 44, stood trial at the Dongbao District People's Court in Hubei's Jingmen city on Thursday, on charges of "picking quarrels and stirring up trouble," her sister said.A member of the Independent Chinese PEN Center, Liu was initially detained in September 2016 for sending out around a dozen tweets on the popular WeChat social media platform relating to late supreme leader Mao Zedong, late former premier Zhou Enlai and current President Xi Jinping.The prosecution based its case on those tweets, which they said defamed the leaders concerned."They said what she wrote was anti-communist and off-message with regard to Mao and Zhou ... as well as Xi Jinping," Liu's sister said."[The posts] were on hot topics such as Xi Jinping's policies, as well as the tainted vaccines scandal.""They said that her posts on QQ, Sina Weibo and WeChat reached more than 10,000 people, because she had more than 160 people in the group chat, as well as more than 1,000 followers," she said. "They said she caused serious damage to public order.""They read out a long list of group chat members who had seen [her posts] and those who had liked them," Liu's sister said.Liu's blog was often critical of the Chinese government and of local-level authorities and police, according to PEN America.The group said Liu had been harassed by the authorities since 2009, who had summoned her for police questioning and confiscated her computer.Liu's sister, who attended the trial, said the prosecution had pressed for a jail term of 3-4 years."This has been going on for more than two years now," she said. "If they find her guilty, there could be two outcomes. The first could be that she doesn't get any punishment, and the second would be that they sentence her to the same amount as time already served."A source close to the case said Liu was initially released on bail following her 2016 detention, under residential surveillance at her home.But she broke some of her bail restrictions by contacting "the outside world," and the police rearrested her, initially charging her with "defamation."The charge was later amended to "picking quarrels and stirring up trouble," the source said."It was confusing, how they changed the charges against her," the source said. "One minute it was one thing, and the next they had changed the charge.""There was no explanation or evidence [to support this]," the source said. "There were huge problems with the legal process in this case."China's rubber-stamp parliament, the National People's Congress (NPC), passed a law last year criminalizing anyone deemed to have smeared the "reputation and honor" of the ruling party's canon of heroes and martyrs.The law, which came into effect on May 1, 2018 aims to "protect the reputation and honor of heroes and martyrs."It bans "insults or slander" of heroes and martyrs, as well as any damage to memorials of revolutionary martyrs or heroic deeds.The government's move is part of a much broader range of measures being rolled out under President Xi Jinping, which some analysts say hark back to the ideological controls of the Mao-era Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution (1966-1976).Earlier this month, a court in the Chinese capital sentenced citizen journalist Ding Lingjie and two petitioners to jail for making a video 'mocking' President Xi Jinping during a holiday season crackdown on dissent.Ding was tried alongside petitioners Li Xuehui and Wang Fengxian by the Shijingshan District People's Court in Beijing on Dec. 28.All three were handed 20-month jail terms after being found guilty of "picking quarrels and stirring up trouble."The case against the three hinged on a video clip shot by Li that the authorities said had "insulted a national leader" by mocking Xi.Reported by Gao Feng for RFA's Mandarin Service, and by Wong Lok-to for the Cantonese Service.

LONDON MARKET OPEN: Stocks Down As China Forecasts Slower GrowthLive Briefs PRO Global MarketsMarch 5, 2019 Tuesday 3:54 AM ESTCopyright 2019 MT Newswires All Rights ReservedLength: 1062 wordsBody Stocks in London opened lower on Tuesday after China cut its growth targets and predicted weaker economic growth ahead amid its trade spat with the US, while the pound was flat ahead of the UK services PMI reading.Chinese Premier Li Keqiang promised various reforms meant to stimulate China's economy as he set an economic growth target of 6.0% to 6.5% for 2019 at the opening of the annual parliamentary session on Tuesday.The range would mark China's slowest economic growth in almost three decades. Last year, the economy grew 6.6%, bogged down by a trade war with the US and rising government debt.Li warned of the "many difficulties" facing the economy as he addressed the 2,948 delegates gathered at the cavernous Great Hall of the People in Beijing. The parliamentary session, known as the National People's Congress, will last until March 15."A set of pro-growth measures are planned despite positive progress in US-China trade talks, which makes us think that either China doesn't have full confidence in a trade truce or that the damages from the trade conflict cannot easily be undone," said analysts at ING. "The Chinese government is presumably cautious about the development of the trade war. And businesses are also likely to be careful about making big investment decisions until it is very clear that business risks from the trade war have ended," ING's analysts added. The FTSE 100 was 5.31 points lower, or 0.1%, at 7,129.08. The FTSE 250 was down 22.14 points, or 0.1%, at 19,389.29, while the AIM All-Share index was 0.1% lower at 915.19.The Cboe UK 100 index was down 0.1% at 12,102.74, while the Cboe UK 250 was 0.1% higher, at 17,355.34.

Senate Armed Services Subcommittee Issues Testimony From Defense Innovation UnitTargeted News ServiceMarch 12, 2019 Tuesday 7:31 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 3456 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Senate Armed Services subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities issued the following testimony by Michael Brown, director of the Defense Innovation Unit, at a hearing entitled "Artificial Intelligence Initiatives within the Department of Defense":"Chairman Ernst, Ranking Member Peters, and distinguished Members of the Subcommittee on Emerging Technologies and Threats, thank you for inviting me to appear before you today to discuss the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) and our efforts in artificial intelligence (AI) alongside my colleagues at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the newly formed Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC)."AI is fundamentally redefining how we live, work, and fight wars. Within the Department of Defense (DoD), AI has the potential to transform how the Department operates at all levels, from business to the battlefield. In the face of competition from China and Russia, DoD aims to maintain its technological edge through establishing a more decentralized, experimental procurement approach: cultivating a leading AI workforce, engaging academic, commercial, and international allies and partners, and developing ethical and lawful guidelines for AI use.1"China and Russia have recognized the enormous commercial and military potential of AI and are investing heavily to become dominant in the field. In its 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020) and subsequent industrial plans, the Chinese government has outlined a comprehensive, whole-ofgovernment strategy to become the global leader in AI.2 In July 2017, the State Council released the Next-Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan that laid out a 2020 target for Chinese AI technology and applications to match international developments and create a $22.3 billion (Renminbi [RMB] 150 billion)3 domestic market.4 By 2025, China will aim to achieve major breakthroughs in AI and increase its domestic market to reach $59.6 billion (RMB 400 billion).5 To achieve these targets, China's National Development and Reform Commission (China's industrial policy-making agency) funded the creation of a national AI laboratory, and Chinese local governments have pledged more than than $7 billion in AI funding.6 In addition, Chinese firms and the Chinese government are leveraging U.S. talent and ecosystems through the establishment of research institutes in the United States, investment in U.S. AI-related startups and firms, recruitment of U.S.-based talent, and commercial and academic partnerships.7"Russia is similarly focused on building its AI capacity but is behind the United States and China in terms of overall AI investment, research, and startups.8"Underscoring the potential magnitude of AI's impact on the whole of society, the breadth of its applications, and the urgency of this emerging technology race, President Trump signed the executive order, Maintaining American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence, on February 11, 2019, launching the American AI Initiative. This was immediately followed by the release of DoD's first-ever AI strategy.9 These documents emphasize the essential role of research and development (R&#38;D) across the Federal Government, business, and academia to maintain U.S. leadership in AI, bolster national security, and safeguard the values shared by the United States, its allies, and partners."To increase intergovernmental coordination, DIU will engage with DARPA and JAIC, among other DoD entities focused on AI, as well as make its commercial knowledge and relationships with potential vendors available to any of the Services and Service Labs. For example, DIU will be working with the Services and Defense Agencies as DoD customers for the projects it undertakes. AI projects today include work with the Air Force, Army, Navy, and components as well as the Joint Chiefs of Staff. DIU also works with the Defense Innovation Board and the newly established Congressional Commission on AI to leverage the best practices and learnings from the commercial software industry executives who participate on the Board."In particular, we anticipate a close partnership with JAIC, the outlines of which DIU has already agreed upon with Lieutenant General Jack Shanahan. As JAIC matures, we anticipate that DIU will be at the leading edge of the Department's National Mission Initiatives (NMIs), proving that commercial technology can be applied to critical national security challenges via accelerated prototypes that lay the groundwork for future scaling through JAIC. DIU looks to bring in key elements of AI development pursued by the commercial sector, which relies heavily on continuous feedback loops, vigorous experimentation using data, and iterative development, all to achieve the measurable outcome, mission impact.Reinvigorating Outreach to Commercial Technology Companies:Defense Innovation Unit"DIU is focused on accelerating commercial technology into the hands of men and women in uniform. Its staff is comprised of active duty military from every service, civilians, and individuals with extensive private sector experience and deep ties into venture capital and startup communities. DIU partners with the Services, Combatant Commands, and component organizations to seek out and rapidly prototype advanced commercial solutions - spanning AI, autonomy, cyber, human systems, and space - to address military challenges ranging from the tactical level to the defense enterprise. Within OUSD(R&#38;E) and the broader DoD, DIU is unique in its focus on developing and fielding commercial hardware, software, and methodologies within an approximately 24-month timeframe."Accessing R&#38;D and mature AI-driven technologies advanced by the commercial sector is an essential component of the strategic approach defined by the 2018 Department of Defense Artificial Intelligence Strategy and the paradigm shift from "defense industrial base" to "national security innovation base" prescribed by the 2018 National Defense Strategy. Senior leaders in the Department understand that DoD no longer holds a monopoly on emerging technologies like AI that will sway strategic, deterrent, and battlefield advantage in future wars.10 U.S. businesses began outspending the Federal Government in R&#38;D in the 1980s, and now, industry-funded R&#38;D represents approximately 67 percent of total U.S. investments.11"Moreover, venture capital funding for AI-related companies reached record highs in 2018, increasing 72 percent from 2017 totaling $9.3 billion.12 With offices in Silicon Valley, Boston, Austin, and Washington, D.C., DIU is embedded in the core innovation ecosystems where these deals are taking place, AI startups are thriving, and top tech companies and universities are conducting groundbreaking research.13 DIU's location not only facilitates deeper ties with leading edge companies but allows the Department to establish a closer relationship with venture firms as they scout the horizon for their next big bets and take into consideration clear demand signals from DoD."DIU seeks to lower barriers to entry into the defense market by more closely matching commercial terms and contracting speeds via its Commercial Solutions Opening (CSO) solicitation process, which leverages Other Transaction (OT) authority. Traditional acquisition pathways overburden technology companies operating with little or no prior DoD contracting experience and runways that are often shorter than the typical time to award a contract under the Federal Acquisition Regulation. Shaping the DoD into a better customer through new processes allows the Department to acquire the best commercial technology faster and cheaper than the traditional system. Furthermore, new acquisition pathways create more opportunities for national security service, making DoD a more competitive employer of AI and other sought-after tech talent through commercial contracts."While cultural divides and ethical differences are often blamed for the lack of closer cooperation between DoD and Silicon Valley, more often than not, the true deterrent is misaligned economics.14 Since DIU opened its first competitive solicitation using the CSO process in June 2016, there has been no shortage of top-performing companies interested in working alongside our DoD partners to solve some of the toughest military challenges. DIU has awarded contracts to 103 of these companies, 43 of which are first-time, non-traditional DoD contractors.15DIU's AI Strategy &#38; Projects"Commercial AI companies are active across a wide range of sectors and the opportunities for dual-use applications within DoD are vast. The DIU AI portfolio focuses on understanding, tracking, and vetting these commercial companies' ability to solve high-impact problems identified by our military leadership and DoD partners. The portfolio team combines depth of commercial AI, machine learning, and data science experience from the commercial sector with military operators. As a foundational technology, AI-driven solutions appear across a number of DIU projects administered by other portfolio teams, however, the AI portfolio specifically prioritizes projects that address three major impact areas where AI is proven to excel:"Computer vision: AI and machine learning adds automation to object recognition and infrastructure assessment; for example, DIU is prototyping computer vision algorithms in humanitarian assistance and disaster recovery scenarios."Large dataset analytics and predictions: AI and machine learning can help make sense of massive datasets and patterns more efficiently and cost-effectively than human analysts; for example, DIU is prototyping predictive maintenance applications for Air Force and Army platforms."Strategic reasoning: AI and machine learning has the capacity to inform top-down planning in environments characterized by uncertainty, missing information, and speculation; for example, DIU is prototyping an application that leverages AI to reason about high-level strategic questions, map probabilistic chains of events, and develop alternative strategies."Furthermore, DIU has a strategic partnership with JAIC wherein DIU's prototype AI applications "pull" on commercial capabilities, prove and measure their applicability to mission imperatives, and (if successful) are transitioned to JAIC to be scaled and integrated into their NMI. In previous testimony before the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, Dr. Lisa Porter, Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, discussed the need to rigorously assess AI performance against quantitative metrics tied to specific mission needs.16 DIU's partnership with JAIC aims to institutionalize the rigor Dr. Porter spoke of -- the AI portfolio's prototype projects are designed to drive metrics, establish benchmarks, and contribute infrastructure towards a common foundation as described by the 2018 Department of Defense Artificial Intelligence Strategy.17"Following are three specific use cases and projects which employ AI technology:"Applying Computer Vision to Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief In 2018, DIU hosted the xView Challenge to test computer vision and the use of algorithms to automatically identify objects from images. The competition attracted more than 4,000 submissions from 100 participants from around the world including companies, universities, and individuals. The top performing algorithms were 300 percent more accurate than the government produced baseline, which helps advance computer vision proficiency across four core elements of overhead imagery analysis. The winning algorithm was then used to automate post-disaster assessments in the wake of Hurricane Florence, assisting emergency personnel to quickly identify flooded areas and impassable roads. This use of AI holds the potential to automate postdisaster assessments and accelerate search and rescue efforts on a global scale.Scaling Predictive Maintenance to Improve Readiness and Cut Costs"DIU's predictive maintenance prototype project provides a specific example of the synergy that we plan to foster between OUSD(R&#38;E) and JAIC. DIU identified a leading commercial airline industry supplier of predictive maintenance solutions and launched a six-month prototype for E-3 Sentry aircraft maintenance. The prototype began with testing predictions at the part and sub-part level against historical actuals to establish the robustness of the AI and its relevance to operational decision-making. This methodology effectively assesses the accuracy of the AI predictions, how much they matter, and in which areas the most impact can be expected (as defined by cost and/or platform availability). Early results of Air Force applications indicate a potential 28 percent decrease in unscheduled maintenance on the E-3 across six sub-systems and more than 32 percent reduction on the C-5 across ten sub-systems. DIU is partnering with JAIC to scale this solution across multiple aircraft platforms, as well as ground vehicles beginning with DIU's complementary predictive maintenance project focusing on the Army's Bradley Fighting Vehicle. This is one of DIU's highest priority projects for FY19 given its enormous potential for impact on readiness and reducing costs.Automating Cyber Vulnerability Detection &#38; Remediation"DoD's current vulnerability discovery process for weapons systems software lacks the capability to scale because it relies on time and labor-intensive human search and analysis. According to an October 2018 GAO report, $1.66 trillion of weapon system development is at risk due to the scale of unmitigated cyber vulnerabilities.18 One of the tools to address these vulnerabilities is DIU's Project VOLTRON, which is an active prototype project that has demonstrated artificially intelligent detection of previously unknown vulnerabilities in classified weapons systems. The project seeks to demonstrate autonomous exploitation and patching; development of an application programming interface (API) for extensibility; and integration into DoD software development environments. This would give the DoD an end-to-end capability that goes from writing software free of vulnerabilities to remediating vulnerabilities in compiled mission software for which source code is not available. The products from Project VOLTRON help make DoD owned systems more resilient to cyber attacks and inform program offices of configuration errors faster and with less errors than humans. An initial capability demonstration of the commercial technologies leveraged by VOLTRON yielded previously undiscovered bugs within the first few minutes of testing against representative aircraft software provided by a defense contractor. In addition, previously unknown vulnerabilities have already been discovered in currently fielded aircraft systems. Integration into software development pipelines will ensure that most vulnerabilities can be found and remediated before future systems go into production and/or deployment.Tremendous Opportunity for DoD/Commercial Collaboration"Commercial industry is breaking ground on AI applications supporting a wide range of business areas and there is a tremendous opportunity to re-establish and grow the ties between the user communities in DoD, commercial entrepreneurs, and partners in universities and labs dedicated to performing the basic research that provides a foundation for future advances. While DIU has found the vast majority of high-tech companies focused on AI to be willing and enthusiastic partners, there is work yet to be done to provide and encourage an open dialogue with the private sector and researchers about applications and principles of use for this powerful tool. DIU will continue to solve DoD problems with commercial AI solutions to bring the Department new capabilities and encourage non-traditional technology firms to work with DoD to grow the national security innovation base."* * *Footnotes:1 U.S. Department of Defense, Summary of the 2018 Department of Defense Artificial Intelligence Strategy: Harnessing AI to Advance Our Security and Prosperity, (February 12, 2019), https://media.defense.gov/2019/Feb/12/2002088963/-1/-1/1/SUMMARY-OF-DOD-AI-STRATEGY.PDF.2 Central Committee of the Communist Party of China Central Compilation and Translation Press, The 13th Five- Year Plan for Economic and Social Development of the People's Republic of China (2016-2020), (March 17, 2016), 64.3 For this testimony, the exchange rate is: $1 = 6.72 RMB.4 PRC State Council, Xinyidai rengongzineng fazhan guihua de tongzi [Next-Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan], PRC State Council-2017-35 (July 20, 2017).5 Ibid.6 "2017 Annual Report to Congress," (U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, November 15, 2017), 525-527; Michael Brown and Pavneet Singh, "China's Technology Transfer Strategy: How Chinese Investments in Emerging Technology Enable a Strategic Competitor to Access the Crown Jewels of U.S. Innovation," (Defense Innovation Unit, January 2018).7 Ibid.8 Alina Polyakova, "Weapons of the Weak: Russia and AI-driven Asymmetric Warfare," (Brookings Institution, November 14, 2018); "Artificial Intelligence - A Strategy for European Startups: Recommendations for Policymakers," (Asgard and Roland Berger, May 14, 2018).9 Maintaining American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence, Exec.

Uighurs to China: Post a video of my missing relatives, tooAssociated Press InternationalFebruary 12, 2019 Tuesday 8:25 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 539 wordsByline: By YANAN WANG, Associated PressDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - Members of the Uighur Muslim ethnic group are calling on China to post videos of their relatives who have disappeared into a vast system of internment camps.The social media campaign, launched Tuesday under the hashtag #MeTooUyghur, follows the release of a state media video showing famed Uighur musician Abdurehim Heyit, who many believed had died in custody."China, show us their videos if they are alive!" Halmurat Harri, a Finland-based Uighur activist, wrote on Twitter. He urged the government to also release videos to prove that others believed detained are in good health amid reports of neglectful and sometimes brutal conditions in the camps.China has come under increasing scrutiny for the camps, which hold an estimated 1 million minority Muslims in its far west Xinjiang region. Former detainees who fled overseas say that while they were held captive, they were ordered to renounce their faith and pledge loyalty to the ruling Communist Party through indoctrination tactics reminiscent of the Cultural Revolution.Beijing, which long denied the existence of such facilities, now says they are vocational training centers where Uighurs, Kazakhs and others receive free skills education. Surveillance cameras, security checkpoints and riot police have become ubiquitous in Xinjiang in recent years, but the government maintains that such measures are necessary to combat separatist violence and latent religious extremism.In a rare show of public criticism from a majority Muslim nation, Turkey on Saturday called China's treatment of Uighurs "a great cause of shame for humanity." Citing reports of Heyit's death, the Turkish foreign ministry condemned "concentration camps" and "systematic assimilation" to which Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang are subject.At a regular news briefing on Tuesday, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said of the #MeTooUyghur campaign, "China has more than 1 billion people, do we need to release a video of everyone?"Hua on Monday called Turkey's statement "a very bad mistake." She said the video of Heyit, released by the state outlet China Radio International, showed that claims of his death were an "absurd lie." She said the renowned musician and poet was being investigated for allegedly endangering national security.The video shows Heyit in a gray sweater against a nondescript gray wall. He states his name and gives the date as Feb. 10, 2019, then says that he is in good health and has not been abused.The authenticity of the video could not be verified, and it was not clear where and by whom it had been filmed.Many Uighurs outside of China have said they are unable to contact relatives still in Xinjiang . Fearing that their loved ones have been ensnared by the security dragnet, they say they do not even know whether their family members are dead or alive.The mere act of communicating with someone overseas could spur detention, Uighurs say, and as a result many of their relatives in China have blocked them on social media. On Twitter, Uighurs abroad posted photos of themselves holding up images of their missing parents, children and siblings.If they are still alive, the posts said, the Chinese government should release videos of them too.Load-Date: February 13, 2019End of Document

Huawei sued the US government for banning their products and "stealing mail"CE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 7, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 435 wordsBody The telecommunications equipment manufacturer Huawei on Thursday announced a lawsuit against the US government for having banned its products amid accusations of espionage against the Chinese company, and also said that Washington hacked its servers.  The Huawei rotating president, Guo Ping, informed in a press conference about the legal actions taken by the company with the objective of challenging section 889 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that prevents to government agencies to purchase Huawei products.  "This ban is not only illegal, it also restricts Huawei from participating in fair competition and, ultimately, harms US consumers," Guo said in the southeastern Chinese city of Shenzhen, the company's headquarters. Huawei accuses the US to orchestrate geopolitical campaign against him Given this situation, he explained, the largest manufacturer of telecommunications equipment and the second of smartphones in the world has been forced to file a lawsuit in a court in Texas, where Huawei headquarters is located in the United States.  The lawsuit comes after the arrest of Huawei's financial director, Meng Wanzhou, in Canada last December at the US request after being accused of violating the trade sanctions imposed by Washington against Iran. China condemns to death of a Canadian and tension rises after the arrest of the Huawei executive "The US Congress has not presented evidence to support its restrictions on Huawei's products," Guo was quoted as saying by news agency EFE.  Amid this crisis, US diplomacy is pushing allied countries and their Internet and wireless service providers to avoid Huawei, arguing that Beijing could force him to spy on or deactivate their networks. Global deployment of 5G: USA press, but Europe does not want to leave Huawei out "Given that the United States never presented any evidence to justify its allegations, we questioned its intention not to let other countries use Huawei products," said Guo, who said that the government of President Donald Trump "spares no effort in manipulating the public opinion to discredit Huawei. "  The spokesman of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Lu Kang, considered today "totally legitimate and understandable" that Huawei "tries to defend its own interests", while claiming to have no record of possible legal actions in this regard by the Chinese government.  Meanwhile, Huawei's financial director, released on bail in Canada, is still waiting for her extradition hearing to the United States, in a case that, according to her defense, has political and non-legal motivations.  Advertising       Load-Date: March 7, 2019End of Document

Soros attacks China in Davos: Xi is "the most dangerous opponent of open societies"CE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 25, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 466 wordsBody       The billionaire of Hungarian origin argued that the United States should stop the disputes with the other countries and focus on China.  Billionaire investor George Soros used his annual address at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, to launch a closed attack on China and its president Xi Jinping.  The investor warned of the dangers of using artificial intelligence and automatic learning by Beijing to exercise totalitarian control in the country, a scenario that poses "unprecedented risks."  "China is not the only authoritarian regime in the world, but it is the richest, the strongest and the most technologically advanced," Soros said, adding that "it makes Xi Jinping the most dangerous opponent of open societies."  George Soros, one of the biggest donors in the Democratic Party of the United States, did not go along with the trade war promoted by the Trump administration, and used his speech to criticize the US government's position on China.  The billionaire argued that the United States should stop trade disputes with a number of countries and focus only on China, the only one that in its view actually poses a threat.  "Instead of waging a trade war with virtually everyone, the US should focus on China," he said, noting that Washington should crack down on Chinese technology companies such as Huawei and ZTE that pose "an unacceptable risk to rest of the world".  More broadly, Soros warned that repressive regimes could use technology to control their citizens, in what he called "a deadly threat to open societies."  The 88-year-old billionaire used the social credit system being studied in China as an example of the instruments the country is using to subjugate the population and totally control society.  "The social credit system is not yet fully operational, but of course its objective. It will subordinate the fate of people to the interests of the state in a way that is unprecedented in history," he said.  Announced for the first time in 2014, the government-run system will monitor people's behavior and determine some privileges or penalties based on individual punctuation.  China is testing the system in several locations with the goal of extending it to the whole country by 2020. China says Soros' criticism "has no meaning" The Chinese government has already reacted to criticism of George Soros, saying that his comments have no "meaning".  Asked about the issue, the Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said comments from certain individuals who "reverse right and wrong" make no sense "and do not deserve to be refuted."  "We hope that the important American can correct his attitude, not be myopic and have an objective, rational and correct opinion on the development of China," Hua added in remarks to reporters, quoted by Reuters. Load-Date: January 28, 2019End of Document

Huawei sales director nicked in Poland on suspicion of 'spying'The Acorn: Drew UniversityJanuary 12, 2019 SaturdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 475 wordsBodyIf found guilty they could face 10 years in jail.An official says Poland's Internal Security Agency has arrested a Chinese businessman and a Pole on suspicion of espionage.The Chinese government said it was "highly concerned" over reports of the arrest of a Chinese businessman for alleged espionage. Chinese authorities then detained two Canadians - a former diplomat and a business consultant - on suspicion of endangering national security. The company said it abides by applicable laws wherever it operates and expects employees to do the same.According to media outlet TVP, the other was a Polish national who used to work at the country's internal security agency (Agencja Bezpieczenstwa Wewnetrznego, ABW) and more recently Orange.The move is the latest setback for Huawei, which saw the arrest of the daughter of the firm's founder in Canada and USA efforts to blacklist the company internationally over security concerns.Security services have also searched the Polish offices of Huawei and telecoms firm Orange, according to state public TV channel TVP.In December, a Czech cyber-security agency warned against using the software and hardware of Huawei and fellow Chinese company ZTE, saying they posed a threat to state security.USA intelligence agencies allege Huawei is linked to China's government and that its equipment could contain "backdoors" for use by government spies.Countries like the United States, Australia and Japan have blocked Huawei from building their next-generation, super-fast 5G internet networks.He said "both carried out espionage activities against Poland", but did not identify them.National media reported that two people had been arrested, one of whom is reported to be a sales director at the Chinese hardware supplier.Huawei has come under intense scrutiny in recent months as countries including Australia, New Zealand and Japan have followed USA moves against the company, citing security concerns.Orange Poland told the AP on Friday it was cooperating with Polish security services in the case and had "handed over belongings of one of our employees" in Tuesday's search of its offices. "We have no comment for the time being".Orange said in a statement that the Polish security services had gathered material related to an employee, but it did not know if the investigation was linked to the employee's professional work.The Polish announcement comes weeks after Canada arrested Huawei vice-president Meng Wanzhou, who is accused of violating Iran sanctions. She was granted bail but remains in Vancouver under 24-hour surveillance.Authorities also arrested a former Polish government official on similar charges. The company has been blocked in the US since 2012 over fears that its equipment is a security risk, and past year Australia, New Zealand and Japan instituted their own bans against using Huawei.Load-Date: January 12, 2019End of Document

UYGHURS IN EXILE LAUNCH CAMPAIGN CALLING ON CHINA TO RELEASE VIDEO OF MISSING FAMILY MEMBERSStates News ServiceFebruary 12, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 905 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:More than a dozen ethnic Uyghurs living in exile have called on China to release video of family members held in political "re-education camps" in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) after Chinese state media published what it said was a proof of life video of a Uyghur musician who was thought to have died in prison.Over the weekend, Turkey's Foreign Ministry issued a rare statement of criticism against China by a majority Muslim nation, demanding that authorities close the camp network, where more than 1 million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities accused of harboring "strong religious views" and "politically incorrect" ideas are believed to have been held in the XUAR since April 2017.Foreign Ministry spokesman Hami Aksoy said the statement had been prompted, in part, by reports of the death in prison of prominent Uyghur musician Abdurehim Heyit, who had served two years of an eight-year jail sentence "for one of his songs."On Sunday, Chinese state media published a video online that purportedly shows Heyit alive, and in which the musician claims he is "in the process of being investigated for allegedly violating the national laws."The subject of the video goes on to say that he is "in good health and have never been abused," although experts have said his body language and choice of words suggest he is being held under duress.By Tuesday, the Uyghur exile community had launched a social media campaign under the hashtag #MeTooUyghur, calling on Chinese authorities to release video of their relatives who are missing within the XUAR and believed detained in the vast camp network."China, please immediately release a video of my sister Dr. Gulshan Abbas, who you abducted five months ago," U.S.-based Uyghur activist Rushan Abbas said in a video she posted to Facebook and Twitter on Tuesday."I need to know if she is alive or not. Please release a video just like you did with Abdurehim Heyit."Adile Mijit, the Turkey-based daughter of prominent Uyghur comedian Adil Mijit, also posted a message on Twitter under the same hashtag, demanding information about her father, who is believed held in a re-education camp in the XUAR."Show me that my father is alive and well! Release my father immediately!" she wrote.Halmurat Harri, a Uyghur activist based in Finland, posted a message as part of the campaign urging China to "show us their videos if they are alive," referring to all missing Uyghurs in the XUAR.Abbas, Mijit and Harri join at least a dozen other exiled Uyghurs around the world who posted similar requests on Tuesday under the same hashtag, holding up photos of their loved ones and calling for information on their health and well-being.Responding to the social media campaign during a regular press briefing on Tuesday, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Hua Chunying said that as a country of more than 1 billion people, "do we need to release a video of everyone?"Hua slammed Turkey's statement and said the video of Heyit showed that reports of his death amounted to an "absurd lie."Though Beijing initially denied the existence of re-education camps, Shohrat Zakir, chairman of the XUAR, told China's official Xinhua news agency in October 2018 that the facilities are an effective tool to protect the country from terrorism and provide vocational training for Uyghurs.Reporting by RFA's Uyghur Service and other media organizations, however, has shown that those in the camps are detained against their will and subjected to political indoctrination, routinely face rough treatment at the hands of their overseers, and endure poor diets and unhygienic conditions in the often overcrowded facilities.Pressuring ChinaDolkun Isa, president of the Munich-based World Uyghur Congress exile group, on Tuesday welcomed the #MeTooUyghur social media campaign as a way of pressuring China to divulge information about those held in its arbitrary and extrajudicial detention system."Most Uyghurs in exile are not sure if their loved ones are alive or dead since China began arbitrarily detaining more than 1 million Uyghurs in [re-education] camps two years ago," he told RFA's Uyghur Service."I personally don't know what happened to my father and other loved ones. We have learned of many deaths in the camps, including that of my mother. Therefore, I call on the Chinese government to reveal the whereabouts and the health conditions of all Uyghurs in the camps."Adrian Zenz, a lecturer in social research methods at the Germany-based European School of Culture and Theology, has said that some 1.1 million people are or have been detained in the campsequating to 10 to 11 percent of the adult Muslim population of the XUAR.In November 2018, Scott Busby, the deputy assistant secretary in the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor at the U.S. Department of State, said there are "at least 800,000 and possibly up to a couple of million" Uyghurs and others detained at re-education camps in the XUAR without charges, citing U.S. intelligence assessments.Citing credible reports, U.S. lawmakers Marco Rubio and Chris Smith, who head the bipartisan Congressional-Executive Commission on China, recently called the situation in the XUAR "the largest mass incarceration of a minority population in the world today."Reported and translated by Alim Seytoff for RFA's Uyghur Service.

Huawei Sues U.S. Government, Says Ban on Company is UnconstitutionalUSNEWS.comMarch 7, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 U.S. News & World Report All Rights ReservedSection: CIVIC; Politics; Vol.; No.Length: 371 wordsByline: Alexa LardieriHighlight: The Chinese tech company claims that America's ban on Huawei violates the Constitution's due process clause.BodyChinese tech giant Huawei is suing the U.S. government over a law that bans federal agencies from buying and using its products. The company announced on Thursday that it filed suit in a district court in Plano, Texas to challenge the constitutionality of part of the National Defense Authorization Act. Signed into law by President Donald Trump, the            NDAA bans federal agencies and their contractors from using the services of Huawei and its rival ZTE. SEE: [The Week in Cartoons for March 4-8]The company is seeking "a declaratory judgment that the restrictions targeting Huawei are unconstitutional and a permanent injunction against these restrictions," the company said. Guo Ping, the company's rotating chairman, said the ban is illegal and prevents the company from "engaging in fair competition," which harms American consumers. The lawsuit states that section 889 of the NDAA violates the bill of attainder clause and the            due process clause of the Constitution because it bars government agencies from employing Huawei "without any executive or judicial process." Song Liuping, Huawei's chief legal officer, said the NDAA "is based on numerous false, unproven and untested propositions." "Contrary to the statute's premise, Huawei is not owned, controlled, or influenced by the Chinese government," Song said. "Moreover, Huawei has an excellent security record and program. No contrary evidence has been offered." Similarly, John Suffolk, Huawei's global cyber security and privacy officer, said the company is "the most open, transparent and scrutinized company in the world." MORE: [5 of 2019's Greatest Security Threats]The lawsuit is the latest action in the ongoing back-and-forth between China and the U.S. In addition to imposing tariffs on billions of dollars of goods, the U.S. requested that Huawei's chief financial officer be arrested. Meng Wanzhou was arrested last year in Canada. Huawei states that with the NDAA restrictions lifted, the company can bring advanced 5G capabilities, something Trump has called for, to America. Alexa Lardieri is a reporter and digital producer at U.S. News & World Report.

Uighurs to China: Post a video of my missing relatives, tooAssociated Press InternationalFebruary 12, 2019 Tuesday 4:54 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 517 wordsByline: By YANAN WANG, Associated PressDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - Members of the Uighur Muslim ethnic group are calling on China to post videos of their relatives who have disappeared into a vast system of internment camps.The social media campaign, launched early Tuesday under the hashtag #MeTooUyghur, follows the release of a state media video showing famed Uighur musician Abdurehim Heyit, who many believed had died in custody."China, show us their videos if they are alive!" Halmurat Harri, a Finland-based Uighur activist, wrote on Twitter. He urged the government to also release videos to prove that others believed detained are in good health amid reports of neglectful and sometimes brutal conditions in the camps.China has come under increasing scrutiny for the camps holding an estimated 1 million minority Muslims in its far west Xinjiang region. Former detainees who fled overseas say that while they were held captive, they were ordered to renounce their faith and pledge loyalty to the ruling Communist Party through indoctrination tactics reminiscent of the Cultural Revolution.Beijing, which long denied the existence of such facilities, now says they are vocational training centers where Uighurs, Kazakhs and others receive free skills education. Surveillance cameras, security checkpoints and riot police have become ubiquitous in Xinjiang in recent years, but the government maintains that such measures are necessary to combat separatist violence and latent religious extremism.In a rare show of public criticism from a majority Muslim nation, Turkey on Saturday called China's treatment of Uighurs "a great cause of shame for humanity." Citing reports of Heyit's death, the Turkish foreign ministry condemned the "concentration camps" and "systematic assimilation" to which Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang are subject.At a regular press briefing Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying called Turkey's statement "a very bad mistake."Hua said the video of Heyit, released by the state outlet China Radio International, showed that claims of his death were an "absurd lie." She said the renowned musician and poet was being investigated for allegedly endangering national security.The video shows Heyit in a gray sweater against a nondescript, gray wall. He states his name and gives the date as Feb. 10, 2019, then says that he is in good health and has not been abused.The authenticity of the video could not be verified, and it was not clear where and by whom it had been filmed.Many Uighurs outside of China have said they are unable to contact relatives still in Xinjiang . Fearing that their loved ones have been ensnared by the security dragnet, they say they do not even know whether their family members are dead or alive.The mere act of communicating with someone overseas could spur detention, Uighurs say, and as a result many of their relatives in China have blocked them on social media. On Twitter, Uighurs abroad posted photos of themselves holding up images of their missing parents, children and siblings.If they are still alive, the posts said, the Chinese government should release videos of them too.Load-Date: February 12, 2019End of Document

Huawei CEO: US scare tactics will frighten off investorsCNN WireMarch 13, 2019 Wednesday 12:20 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 989 wordsByline: By Matt Rivers and Sherisse Pham, CNN BusinessDateline: SHENZHEN, China (CNN Business) BodySHENZHEN, China (CNN Business) --  Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei says the US government's campaign against the Chinese tech company risks damaging America's international reputation."If this US administration always treats other countries, companies or individuals in a ferocious way, then no one would dare invest in the United States," Ren said in an interview Wednesday with CNN at Huawei's headquarters in the city of Shenzhen.The US government has stepped up its efforts in recent months to persuade allies to block the use of Huawei's telecommunications equipment in 5G wireless networks, alleging that the Chinese government could use it for spying. Huawei has denied any of its products pose a security risk and called on the Trump administration to provide evidence to back up its claims.Ren, who is also Huawei's CEO, was full of praise for the US economy, describing it as a driver of innovation. But he said his company, the world's biggest telecommunications equipment maker, was being treated unfairly. That's why it decided to make its most aggressive move yet to combat the American pressure. It filed a lawsuit against the US government last week challenging a recent law barring federal agencies from using Huawei products."We chose to have our voice heard at this moment because the US government considers us a threat to national security," Ren said. "They have to have evidence. Everybody in the world is talking about cybersecurity and they are singling out Huawei.""What about Ericsson? What about Cisco? Don't they have cybersecurity issues?" he asked, referring to top Western makers of networking equipment. "Why is Huawei being singled out?"Ren, 74, has built Huawei up over three decades into a company that makes more than $100 billion in annual revenue and sells about as many smartphones around the world as Apple. Its success has made him a billionaire.He rejects any suggestion that the company is under the control of the Chinese government, insisting it's a private company that's owned by its employees. Ren said he would rather shut down the business than submit to demands from Beijing to use Huawei equipment for spying.Trump's 'tactics are all wrong'Huawei's pushback has failed to deter the Trump administration from pursuing its campaign against the company. Shortly after Huawei filed its lawsuit last week, the US Ambassador to Germany sent the German government a letter warning that the United States would limit Berlin's access to American intelligence if Huawei is allowed to help build 5G networks in the country.Those are the kind of moves that Ren says will hurt the United States' image with international investors as a great place to do business. He described President Donald Trump as a great leader for cutting US taxes for businesses, but urged him to rethink his approach toward foreign countries and businesses."His tactics are all wrong," Ren said. "If he intimidates a country today, threatens a company tomorrow or wantonly arrests someone, then no one would dare invest in the United States."US prosecutors have indicted Huawei and its finance chief, Meng Wanzhou, on charges including sanctions evasion. Meng, who is also Ren's daughter, was arrested in Canada and is fighting extradition to the United States. Huawei and Meng deny the charges, while the Chinese government has demanded her immediate release."Trump should be more open-minded and willing to accept all types of investments," Ren said. "If he becomes more tolerant of the world, then all the US-bound investments would ensure another century of American prosperity."Huawei at the heart of US-China tensionsThe stakes in this dispute are high. Huawei is one of China's most successful global companies and is set to play a key role in the building of 5G networks around the world. Those next generation networks are expected to connect everything from smartphones and robots to self-driving cars and internet-enabled traffic signals.Huawei has found itself at the heart of a broader clash between the United States and China over the technologies of the future. In its trade war with Beijing, the Trump administration has challenged the Chinese government's use of aggressive subsidies to build heavyweight players in key industries.Huawei has been largely shut out of the US telecommunications equipment market for years. Ren said that makes the US government ill placed to judge its products."There is no Huawei equipment in the US networks --- has that made the US networks totally safe?" he said. "If not, how can they tell other countries that your networks would be safe without Huawei? That's why we want to make clear our stance by suing the US government."Ren claimed that the US attempts to get other Western countries like Germany and the United Kingdom to block Huawei weren't a big concern."If they don't buy from us, then we sell to others," he said. "We can downscale a little. We are not a public company, so we don't have to worry about lower profits leading to collapsing stock prices. We can reduce our staffing and costs a bit, but we can still survive."He also insisted he's "very calm" about his daughter's legal plight."Meng Wanzhou is not guilty of any crime, therefore as long the law is transparent, fair and just, I believe her problem will be solved sooner rather than later," he told CNN.US prosecutors have also alleged that Ren himself lied to the FBI in 2007 about Huawei's business dealings in Iran, although they haven't charged him with any wrongdoing.Asked on Wednesday whether he would be nervous about traveling to the United States following Meng's arrest, Ren said he has no reason to go."The US market is relatively minor for us," he said. "I don't see the value of me going to the United States. We're better having the lawyers handle the cases."Steven Jiang contributed to this report.TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

China data disappoints; Facebook's outage; Boeing recoversCNN WireMarch 14, 2019 Thursday 10:17 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 617 wordsByline: By Rishi Iyengar, CNN BusinessDateline: NEW DELHI (CNN Business) BodyNEW DELHI (CNN Business) --  1. China's troubles deepen: Chinese stocks fell on Thursday after more data that suggested the world's second biggest economy got off to a rocky start this year.The Shanghai Composite closed down 1.2% after official statistics showed output from China's huge industrial sector grew by just 5.3% in January and February, the weakest rate of growth in 17 years.The Chinese economy has struggled in recent months amid a damaging trade war with the United States and a government crackdown on lending.Other metrics like exports have also fallen recently, and China is taking steps to ensure the slowdown is not too sharp. The Chinese government slashed business taxes earlier this month after warning that its economy would grow between 6% and 6.5% in 2019 --- the slowest in more than three decades. Other major Asian markets like Hong Kong's Hang Seng index and Japan's Nikkei were flat on Thursday, while European markets posted modest gains. US stock futures were edging higher. 2. Facebook's big outage: Facebook and its various platforms continued to face some outages on Thursday, with the issues stretching beyond 14 hours --- believed to be the social network's biggest-ever interruption. Some users of Facebook and other platforms owned by the tech giant --- including Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp --- reported intermittent problems accessing the services and posting content. The problems began Wednesday afternoon, forcing Facebook to use Twitter to provide an explanation.At 12:41 a.m. ET Thursday, Instagram posted a tweet that said, "Anddddd... we're back" with a gif of Oprah Winfrey. Users in Asia and Europe still appeared to be having issues with Facebook on Thursday morning. The lengthy disruption is likely to upset advertisers that spend large amounts of money to reach potential customers on Facebook platforms. The company's flagship social network has more than 2.3 billion users, and Instagram has more than 1 billion.Facebook stock fell more than 1% premarket. 3. Boeing bounces back: The plane maker's stock staged a late recovery on Wednesday, ending the day 0.5% higher even after the United States became the latest country to ground its 737 Max jets. Boeing shares fell 3% in afternoon trading after President Donald Trump announced the US ban on the 737 Max 8 and Max 9, but recouped their losses later in the day. The stock was little changed premarket on Thursday. Several other countries including Canada, China and the United Kingdom have grounded the jets, after one flown by Ethiopian airlines crashed earlier this week. It's the second crash in less than six months involving the 737 Max 8.Despite Wednesday's recovery, Boeing's stock has fallen 10% since the crash, wiping more than $25 billion off the company's market value. Grounding all 737 Max planes could cost Boeing up to $5 billion over three months, according to estimates from Wall Street firms Melius Research and Jefferies. 4. Earnings and economics: Dollar General plans to release earnings before the open Thursday. Meanwhile, Adobe Systems and Oracle are set to release earnings after the close.Etihad, Abu Dhabi's global airline, posted a loss of $1.28 billion for 2018, its third consecutive annual loss. Germany's Lufthansa posted a slight fall in annual profit and said it would reduce growth in peak summer capacity.The Census Bureau plans to release its January New Home Sales report at 10 a.m. ET.5.

Canadian ambassador says detained Huawei CFO has strong caseCNN.comJanuary 23, 2019 Wednesday 3:00 AM ESTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: ASIALength: 642 wordsByline: By Ben Westcott, CNNDateline: Hong Kong BodyRemarks made by US President Donald Trump may have strengthened China's hand in fighting a US extradition request for detained Chinese telecoms executive Meng Wanzhou, according to Canada's top diplomat in Beijing.Meng, chief financial officer of Chinese tech giant Huawei, was arrested by Canadian authorities acting on behalf of the United States in Vancouver on December 1.The US government alleges that Meng helped Huawei dodge US sanctions on Iran and has indicated it will file a formal extradition request by the January 30 deadline.The Chinese government has repeatedly and furiously called for her release, labeling the charges political.Speaking at press conference in Beijing, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum appeared to hint at strained relations between the US and Canada over the continued fallout from case."I think she has quite good arguments on her side," said McCallum. "One, political involvement by comments from Donald Trump in her case. Two, there's an extraterritorial aspect to her case, and three, there's the issue of Iran sanctions which are involved in her case, and Canada does not sign on to these Iran sanctions."Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Thursday the case against Meng had "never been a normal legal case.""We have noted Ambassador McCallum's remarks. I think anyone with normal judgment can see through this issue. We hope the Canadian side will do so as well and make a correct choice," she said at her daily press briefing.Since Meng's arrest, China has detained two Canadians on suspicion of "activities that endangered China's national security." Another Canadian was sentenced to death after a Chinese court convicted him of drug smuggling, prompting Canada to issue a travel warning to its citizens over "the risk of arbitrary enforcement of local laws" in China.McCallum said relations had been strong between Ottawa and Beijing before the arrest, adding he knew it had "angered China.""I know this has angered China but we have a system of extradition treaty a system of rules of law which are above the government, the government cannot change these things," he said.US President Donald Trump complicated the situation in December by suggesting he may intervene in the legal saga if it would help his pursuit of a trade deal with China."If I think it's good for what will be certainly the largest trade deal ever made ? which is a very important thing ? what's good for national security ? I would certainly intervene if I thought it was necessary," Trump told Reuters.That helped fuel the widely held view in China that Meng's arrest was a political move by the Trump administration to gain leverage in the clash between the two countries over trade and technology rather than a law enforcement matter.At the time, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland reprimanded Trump. "Our extradition partners should not seek to politicize the extradition process or use it for ends other than the pursuit of justice," she said.On Wednesday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he was committed to making sure "that the rule of law is properly and fully followed," adding that would include the opportunity for Meng "to mount a strong defense."When pressed on the ambassador's comment, Trudeau said his government would ensure the independence of Canada's justice system was "properly defended and properly supported."McCallum's comments were met with dismay in parts of Canada, however, with Canadian conservative opposition leader Andrew Scheer calling for the ambassador's dismissal."We can't on the one hand go and defend our actions to the Chinese government by saying these decisions are made at arms length ... if then on the other hand the government is using our ambassador to China to interfere in the process to obtain a desired outcome," Scheer told CBC on Wednesday.Load-Date: January 25, 2019End of Document

"Our extradition partners should not seek to politicize the extradition process or use it for ends other than the pursuit of justice," she said.On Wednesday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he was committed to making sure "that the rule of law is properly and fully followed," adding that would include the opportunity for Meng "to mount a strong defense."When pressed on the ambassador's comment, Trudeau said his government would ensure the independence of Canada's justice system was "properly defended and properly supported."McCallum's comments were met with dismay in parts of Canada, however, with Canadian conservative opposition leader Andrew Scheer calling for the ambassador's dismissal."We can't on the one hand go and defend our actions to the Chinese government by saying these decisions are made at arms length ... if then on the other hand the government is using our ambassador to China to interfere in the process to obtain a desired outcome," Scheer told CBC on Wednesday.TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Huawei connects rural America. Could it threaten the country's most sensitive military sites?CNN.comMarch 9, 2019 Saturday 8:21 PM ESTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICSLength: 1744 wordsByline: By Alex Marquardt and Michael ConteBodyOutside Malmstrom Air Force Base in central Montana, spread across 13,800 square miles of open plains, more than 100 intercontinental ballistic missiles stand at the ready, buried deep underground in missile silos. These Minuteman III rockets are capable of delivering nuclear warheads at least 6,000 miles away and are part of the U.S. Strategic Command, which oversees the country's nuclear and missile arsenal.Nestled among these silos are clusters of cell phone towers operated by a small rural wireless carrier. According to FCC filings, those cell towers use Chinese technology that security experts warn could allow China to gather intelligence while also potentially mounting network attacks in the areas surrounding this and other sensitive military installations.Huawei, the Chinese company that makes the tower technology, is shunned by the major US wireless carriers (including AT&T, which owns CNN parent company WarnerMedia) and the federal government over national security concerns. Yet its technology is widely deployed by a number of small, federally-subsidized wireless carriers that buy cheaper Chinese-made hardware to place atop their cell towers. In some cases those cellular networks provide exclusive coverage to rural areas close to US military bases.In congressional testimony last year, the heads of six major US intelligence agencies -- including the FBI and CIA - warned Americans against using Huawei devices and products. Security experts say that having its technology deployed so close to the nation's arsenal of ICBMs could pose a far greater threat."We know the Chinese are engaged in a massive espionage campaign against the US," said James Lewis, director of the Technology Policy Program at the DC-based think tank The Center for Strategic and International Studies. "We know that the Chinese engage in massive surveillance against their own population. You put two and two together and say, how comfortable do I feel having Huawei on the phone systems around my most important military bases?Potential threatsHuawei is engaged in a pitched battle with the US government. The company is banned from bidding on US government contracts, and federal employees are forbidden from using its products. On March 7, Huawei sued the US government, arguing the ban is unconstitutional.Huawei has extensive US and international operations and has vowed that it would never install or allow others to install so-called 'backdoors' into its equipment.But experts fear the company, whose founder and CEO served in the Chinese military, could be susceptible to influence from Beijing. If China chooses to weaponize Huawei's radio transmitters and receivers placed on towers in sensitive areas, there's a long list of possible scenarios and types of information they could glean. Even if the military installations themselves aren't vulnerable, personnel working on or around them could be."It's a way to suck in data and carry out ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance)," says a former senior Pentagon information security official. "It's quite intrusive actually. I have no evidence [the Chinese] are doing it. But the potential, the opportunity, wow.""What the overall status of the missile fields are, which are active, which are in maintenance status," he continued, "it may seem like innocuous data but this is a big deal."A weaponized cell tower could shut down service, send out malign text messages and launch a denial of service attack, security experts tell CNN."The Chinese could decide to interfere with ICBM command and control, or with ICBM personnel, the people manning the missile silos," said Lewis from CSIS. "That's not a risk that you can dismiss. You have to say, it's a new strategic capability for China. Not one we expected. It's not military. It's not a weapon. It's not your traditional attack."As scary as it sounds, Lewis admits it's unlikely that an outside radio transmitter would be able to penetrate the closed encrypted systems that control the missile installations."ICBMs are supposed to be pretty hard. That might not be easy to do," said Lewis, a former Foreign Service officer who was an adviser to the military. "But that doesn't mean our opponents won't try and figure out if they can do it."Lewis points to a national intelligence law China passed in 2017 that gives the government sweeping powers under the pretext of national security. "If they ask Huawei, turn off the phones, tell us what people are doing, scramble the data going over it, block calls, make random phone calls, there's nothing we could really do to stop that," said Lewis.Huawei says that law doesn't apply to telecom equipment providers that operate outside China, such as itself. "It doesn't allow the Chinese government to willy nilly put backdoors in products," said Andy Purdy, chief security officer for Huawei in the US.In addressing the broader concerns, Purdy pointed to the extensive security measures they take to safeguard their clients' system. "Huawei does not operate or maintain the equipment and networks of our customers," said Purdy, while allowing that, "Nearly all networks and systems around the world are subject to penetration efforts, sometimes successfully, by sophisticated, well-resourced malicious actors such as a nation state."Still, to some, having any Huawei technology operating in the US is too much."It would be great if there wasn't a shred of Huawei anywhere in the United States," said Marcus Sachs, the former vice president for National Security Policy at Verizon who also served on the Defense Department's Joint Task Force for Computer Network Defense. He said the use of Huawei presents "critical national security implications.""In theory, any piece of equipment could have the capability to do 'man in the middle.' It will know about every call placed, track all the internet traffic, what's going where," Sachs said. "The unencrypted information would be intercepted and sent back to China."Rural WirelessAcross the US there are vast, rural expanses where signals from the country's major wireless carriers do not reach. In their place residents and visitors rely on smaller independent carriers.Those federal dollars used to subsidize those carriers come out of the multi-billion dollar Universal Services Fund, which helps fund wireless and broadband connectivity to poor and rural communities. Last year, FCC chairman Ajit Pai proposed a rule that would prohibit carriers from using USF funds to buy equipment from Huawei and other companies deemed to be national security threats.The company operating the towers among the Montana missile fields is called Triangle Communication Systems. Their FCC filings make clear that part of their towers' radio network is manufactured by Huawei. At least five cell phone towers operated by Triangle in Montana are less than three miles from ICBM silos as well as, in at least one case, a launch control center, according to the FCC filings and data from the Federation of American Scientists (FAS).More than 600 miles to the south, the F.E. Warren Air Force Base oversees ICBM fields that cover parts of Wyoming, Nebraska, and Colorado. In southeastern Wyoming, portions of the silo field are covered by a carrier called Union Wireless. The company operates two sites around the 12,000-square mile silo field in addition to at least 53 other towers across Wyoming. At least one of those sites is less than six miles from two missile silos, according to FCC filings and FAS data.In a public statement to the FCC last June, Union's Chief Technical and Operations Officer Eric Woody said that Huawei manufactures "approximately 75%" of Union's equipment. It's unclear whether Huawei gear is used at Union towers that are close to the silos.Neither Triangle nor Union responded to requests for comment. Both companies are members of the Rural Wireless Association, a trade group of small wireless carriers with fewer than 100,000 subscribers each. A quarter of RWA's roughly 60 member companies use Chinese technology, the groups says. A Huawei official, US vice president of sales William Levy, sits on the RWA board of directors.RWA says there has been no direction from the Pentagon over how to mitigate any risk posed by the carriers' Chinese technology. Nor has there been any offer to help replace the gear, which is up to 40 percent cheaper and could cost as much as $1 billion to switch out, the group says."My members are concerned and they want to do the right thing. So, to the extent that there's information that could be shared with them they'd like to do what's right," RWA's general counsel Carri Bennet told CNN. "Ripping the equipment out from their perspective isn't really going to be in the cards because these networks will not be functional.""If anyone pointed out to them that this is harmful, they would comply, they would get rid of it," she continued. "They would hope the government wouldn't throw the baby out with the bathwater and try to come up with something to fix it."A spokesman for STRATCOM declined to go into detail about its relationship with the rural carriers, or what precautionary measures are taken, saying only: "As a part of our force posture, we maintain a concerned awareness of activities within proximity of our installations and sites."The Department of Defense would not clarify its relationship or what if any conversations it has had with rural carriers around the issue of Huawei. Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan told CNN in a statement that the Pentagon "is working closely with our industrial and research partners to develop comprehensive and innovative solutions for both the Department and commercial industries. The United States and our allies and partners must demand nothing less than robust, trusted, and secure next-generation communications systems."The issue over Chinese technology being deployed near military installations has come up before. In 2012, the Obama administration blocked a Chinese company, Sany Group, from building a wind farm near a naval facility in Oregon out of concerns for national security. At the time, President Barack Obama said there was "credible evidence" that the Chinese group "might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States."Said Lewis, "The Pentagon knows that using Huawei creates risk. And they are struggling over how best to deal with that." This story has been updated.Load-Date: March 12, 2019End of Document

The stakes are high   nothing less than preserving our edge in innovation and maintaining our security,  he plans to say.The CEO plans to say that the US is  falling behind  China on 5G, which he says  has taken a global lead in the race.  He says in the remarks that only a newly merged T-Mobile will be able to compete. The stakes are high A representative for the Rural Wireless Association, which represents small carriers and counts Chinese company Huawei as a member, plans to say that T-Mobile and Sprint  have significant ties  to Chinese companies. In prepared remarks, Legere disputed that connection, saying that T-Mobile, like other major carriers, doesn t use Huawei equipment in its network.  And we will never use it in our 5G network,  his remarks read.Sprint s executive chairman does not mention Huawei in his prepared remarks, although he makes a similar case about 5G in the United States, saying the merger  is about ensuring that the United States leads in the next generation of innovation, which will rely on the massive capacity that 5G can unleash. Chinese telecommunications companies like Huawei have faced increasing scrutiny in recent months, as US lawmakers have branded them security threats. Huawei has repeatedly denied that it would spy for the Chinese government.The planned testimony tomorrow will also focus on what the deal will mean for consumers. The merger will require approval from the FCC and Justice Department, but some consumer advocates have fought against the idea, pitched by T-Mobile and Sprint, that a merger will benefit consumers. A representative for Public Knowledge, a group critical of the deal, plans to call the merger  a bad deal for consumers, competition, and America s wireless future. Tags: See Website:https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/12/18222545/t-mobile-sprint-merger-china-5g-john-legereContact Information:Colin LecherTags:           Wire,            Artificial Intelligence Newswire,            United States,            EnglishLoad-Date: February 17, 2019End of Document

Huawei CEO Denies Claims Company Provides "Back Door To Chinese Intelligence."The FrontrunnerFebruary 21, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 Bulletin News Network, Inc.Section: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 344 wordsBodyOn the CBS Evening News (2/20, story 8, 1:05, Glor, 7.65M), Bianna Golodryga interviewed Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei, who refuted US claims that the company provides "a back door to Chinese intelligence," saying it is "absolutely not possible." Said Ren, "We never participate in espionage, and we did not allow any of our employees to do any act like that." Asked if the US is trying to put Huawei out of business, Ren said, "I don't think Huawei will collapse because of this. Maybe the pressure from the US can be used as an important driver to make sure we work even harder."UK Not Ready To Ban Huawei Equipment.The AP (2/20, Chan) reports that Ciaran Martin, the CEO of the UK National Cyber Security Centre, says Britain "can handle the security risks involved with using mobile networks made by China's Huawei," which "has faced rising scrutiny over US allegations that it could be forced by the Chinese government to provide access to consumer data on its networks." According to the AP, "Since 2010, the British government has operated a cybersecurity evaluation center for Huawei equipment, which Martin said was part of 'the toughest and most rigorous oversight regime in the world' for the company."The New York Times (2/20, Satariano, 17.89M) reports that while the Administration "has spent a year trying to convince America's allies in Europe that...Huawei is a grave threat to their national security and should not be allowed any role in developing new wireless networks," but Martin indicated "that the aggressive campaign may not be working."The Washington Post (2/20, Nakashima, 14.71M), however, reports that "top British cybersecurity officials on Wednesday said...Huawei has yet to fix 'serious' engineering problems that could leave civilian networks vulnerable to compromise." Ian Levy, technical director of Britain's National Cyber Security Center (NCSC), said, "Last year we said we found some worrying engineering issues. As of today, we have not seen a credible plan [to address the issue]. That's the reality of the situation, unfortunately."Load-Date: February 21, 2019End of Document

Grassley: Lighthizer Says No Progress Towards US-China DealThe FrontrunnerJanuary 16, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 Bulletin News Network, Inc.Section: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 265 wordsBodyBreitbart (1/15, Carney, 1.39M) reports Sen. Charles Grassley (R-IA) said Tuesday that the US "has seen no progress on crucial issues in trade talks with China," and "said his information was based on a report from United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer." Said Grassley, "He said that there hasn't been any progress made on structural changes that need to be made. ... Let's say that would include intellectual property, stealing trade secrets, putting pressure on corporations to share information with the Chinese government and industries." Breitbart notes that it is "the halfway mark in the 90-day trade truce agreed to over a December dinner between Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping and their top aides."USTR: Exclusions Will Be Granted If Tariffs On Chinese Imports Are Increased.Bloomberg News (1/15, Wasson, Leonard, 5.74M) reports the USTR's office "has promised two senators that the administration will set up a system of exclusions for the next round of proposed tariffs on Chinese goods." Bloomberg notes that "if trade talks with China don't produce a deal by March 1, the White House has scheduled an increase in tariffs to 25 percent from 10 percent on $200 billion of Chinese goods." According to Bloomberg News, Sens. Pat Toomey (R-PA) and Doug Jones (D-AL) "have pressed" the USTR "to develop a process whereby some importers can apply for exclusions from the new tariffs, similar to what's already in place for tariffs on about roughly $50 billion worth of Chinese imports," and the USTR "responded...with a promise that exclusions will be allowed."Load-Date: January 16, 2019End of Document

Courtrooms to canola fields: Huawei-US tensions span globeAssociated Press Financial WireMarch 11, 2019 Monday 10:06 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 1030 wordsByline: By JOE McDONALD, AP Business WriterDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - Chinese tech giant Huawei's tensions with Washington, which says the telecom equipment maker is a security risk, stretch across four continents from courtrooms to corporate boardrooms to Canadian canola fields.In the latest twist, Huawei Technologies Ltd. is asking a court in Texas to strike down a legal ban on the government using its equipment or dealing with any contractor that does.Washington is trying to persuade European and other allies to shun the biggest maker of network technology as their phone carriers invest billions of dollars in upgrading to next-generation communications.The company denies accusations it might facilitate Chinese spying or is controlled by the ruling Communist Party. Chinese authorities say the United States is exaggerating security concerns to block a potential competitor.Meanwhile, U.S. prosecutors are trying to extradite Huawei's chief financial officer from Canada to face charges she lied to banks about dealings with Iran.SECURITY CONCERNS: U.S. authorities say Huawei might facilitate Chinese spying by installing "backdoors" in its equipment for eavesdropping or sharing secrets about customers. The company's U.S. sales plunged after a congressional panel in 2012 labeled Huawei and Chinese rival ZTE Corp. security risks and told phone carriers to avoid them. Huawei denies it is a risk and complains Washington has released no evidence or details of its accusations. Australia, Japan, Taiwan and some other governments have imposed curbs on use of Huawei technology over security concerns. The company operates testing centers in Britain, Canada, Germany and Belgium for governments to examine its technology.US LAWSUIT: Huawei is asking a U.S. federal court in Texas to strike down part of this year's military appropriations bill that bars the government from using the Chinese vendor's equipment or dealing with any contractor that does. The company says the measure improperly singles out Huawei for punishment without trial and amounts to a "death sentence." American legal experts say Huawei's claims will be hard to prove but the company has few other options.US ALLIES: American officials are lobbying European and other allies to avoid Huawei, with limited success. That threatens to block Huawei, a leading developer of fifth-generation technology, from major markets where carriers are preparing to invest billions of dollars in upgrading networks. European governments have balked at banning Huawei outright. Germany says it won't exclude any suppliers in advance and instead will set "data protection" standards vendors must meet. Despite U.S. pressure, Huawei has announced contracts with American allies including the United Arab Emirates to supply network technology.SHARING SECRETS: The United States is warning Germany that allowing untrustworthy companies to supply equipment for its 5G networks could jeopardize sharing of sensitive information among allies.The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that the U.S. ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, sent a letter to German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier specifically naming Chinese tech firm Huawei.Washington has been trying to dissuade its allies from allowing Huawei to provide equipment for fifth-generation cell networks, claiming it could facilitate digital espionage by the Chinese government.U.S. embassy spokesman Joseph Giordono-Scholz declined to comment on the contents of the letter, but said the U.S. position is that if allies use "untrusted vendors" this could raise questions about the confidentiality of sensitive communications and "jeopardize nimble cooperation and some sharing of information" in futureCHINA-CANADA: Huawei's chief financial officer is fighting U.S. efforts to extradite her from Canada to face charges of lying to banks about dealings with Iran in violation of trade sanctions. Meng Wanzhou, who is the daughter of Huawei's founder, was arrested Dec. 1 at the Vancouver airport. The arrest strained Chinese-Canadian relations. Beijing has arrested two Canadians, a former diplomat and a businessman, in what is widely seen as an effort to pressure Canada to release Meng. She is free on bail and living in a Vancouver mansion she owns, while the Canadians arrested in China are barred from seeing relatives or lawyers. Chinese authorities have meanwhile slowed imports of Canadian canola, an oilseed crop, by imposing more stringent inspections. A court in Vancouver is to set a date on May 8 for an extradition hearing. Meng has filed a lawsuit accusing Canadian authorities of violating her rights by questioning and searching her before telling her she was under arrest.CRIMINAL CHARGES: Huawei is accused of stealing technology behind a robot T-Mobile USA, Inc. uses to test smartphones. The Chinese company pleaded not guilty this month in federal court in Seattle. Two Huawei subsidiaries face 10 counts including theft of trade secrets and conspiracy. Prosecutors say a Huawei employee removed a robot arm from T-Mobile's lab and sent measurements and photos to China. Huawei says the employee acted on his own and was fired. A federal jury in Seattle awarded T-Mobile $4.8 million in damages in 2017.TECHNOLOGY COMPETITION: Huawei is at the center of U.S.-Chinese tension over Beijing's technology ambitions and complaints the communist government steals or pressures foreign companies to hand over know-how. The United States and other trading partners complain Chinese support for technology development violates Beijing's market-opening obligations. Huawei, founded in 1987 by a former military engineer, is the most successful of a group of emerging competitors Beijing hopes will make China a creator of profitable technologies.BUSINESS IMPACT: Huawei says the U.S. criticism so far has had little impact on sales outside the United States. The company's global revenue forecast for 2018 is $100 billion and its founder, Ren Zhengfei, says this year's target is $125 billion. However, Huawei's chief legal officer, Song Liuping, says the American legal restrictions are hurting the company's reputation abroad.___Associated Press Writer Frank Jordans in Berlin contributed to this report.Load-Date: March 12, 2019End of Document

America's fight with Huawei is messing with the world's 5G plansCNN WireFebruary 14, 2019 Thursday 11:13 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1395 wordsByline: Analysis by Michelle Toh, CNN BusinessDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  The US-led offensive against Chinese tech firm Huawei is creating big problems for mobile operators as they start building the next generation of wireless networks.The United States is trying to persuade other countries not to allow Huawei equipment into new superfast 5G networks because it claims the gear could be used by the Chinese government for spying. Huawei strongly denies the accusations. And it has already built up such a strong lead in 5G technology that it's practically irreplaceable for many wireless carriers that want to be among the first to offer the new services."Banning Huawei will create a vacuum that no one can fill in a timely fashion and may seriously impair 5G deployments worldwide," said Stéphane Téral, a mobile telecom infrastructure expert at research firm IHS Markit. The uncertainty is particularly problematic for Europe, where Huawei was expected to play a key role in building 5G networks that the region's leaders say are vital for its economic future. The international rollout of 5G has become a front line in the broader clash over advanced technology between the United States and China that is reshaping the relationship between the world's top two economies.The United States doesn't have a heavyweight global competitor to Huawei in telecommunications equipment. The Chinese firm's biggest rivals are Ericsson of Sweden and Nokia of Finland. But they have struggled for years with losses and job cuts while Huawei has powered ahead, generating annual revenue of more than $100 billion, building a strong base in China and amassing intellectual property that will help determine the future of 5G. Unhappy mobile operatorsSome top international mobile operators are warning that by shutting Huawei out of 5G networks, countries risk undermining their own tech capabilities. The new wave of wireless communications is expected to increase internet speeds as much as 100 times compared with 4G networks, and help power emerging technologies like smart cities and connected vehicles. Vodafone's CEO Nick Read cautioned last month that a complete ban on all Huawei gear would substantially delay the availability of 5G. The mobile carrier has suspended the installation of the Chinese company's equipment in core networks in Europe while it speaks with authorities and the company.In August, Vodafone slammed the Australian government's decision to ban Huawei from providing 5G technology for networks there, saying the move "fundamentally undermines Australia's 5G future."UK telecom group BT's chief architect, Neil McRae, put the situation in stark terms late last year. "There is only one true 5G supplier right now, and that is Huawei," he said at an industry event in London. "The others need to catch up."BT said in December that it won't include Huawei equipment in the heart of its planned 5G network, but will continue to use it for areas that are considered "benign," like the radio masts that connect wireless devices with the core network. The head of BT's consumer brands told CNN Business last week that Huawei had given him no "cause for concern" over the years.But British officials have security concerns, and Huawei has promised to spend $2 billion to address them. In a letter last month to UK lawmakers, the Chinese company warned that the process will take three to five years to have tangible results, likening it to "replacing components on a high-speed train in motion."Huawei's rivals may be a year behind The situation should have Ericsson and Nokia cheering, but experts say the two companies may not be very well positioned to capitalize on Huawei's difficulties."It goes without saying that other leading vendors stand to benefit in the short-term," according to analysts at Dell'Oro Group, a market research firm that specializes in telecoms infrastructure analysis. Ericsson and Nokia both declined to comment on their competitors. Instead, they touted their advancements on 5G in statements to CNN Business. Nokia claims it holds "the industry's only end-to-end 5G portfolio that is available globally," while Ericsson said it has publicly announced more 5G contracts with operators "than any other vendor."But Huawei claims its 5G technology is at least a year ahead of its rivals --- and many experts agree. "From my conversations with carriers, they've found that Huawei is far more advanced than the other two right now," said Dexter Thillien, a senior tech analyst at research firm Fitch Solutions. The battle for EuropeExecutives at Nokia and Ericsson may also be treading carefully in public for fear of angering the Chinese government and being cut off from its vast market. Nokia, in particular, employs about 15,000 people in China, more than double its headcount of 6,000 in its home country of Finland. "Their presence there is very, very important for them," Thillien said. "So I don't think they'll go publicly and go and say things like, 'Pick us, because we're European and we're more secure.'"Even if governments don't block Huawei outright, the possibility of restrictions is casting a shadow over the Chinese company as mobile operators make investment decisions."It's probably better technologically --- but technology's only one side of the argument," Thillien said. He pointed to Europe as "the big battle right now" for Huawei.German Chancellor Angela Merkel said last week that "there are big discussions about Huawei" in her country. "We need to talk to China to ensure that companies do not simply give up all data that is used to the Chinese state," she said, adding that "safeguards" were needed."This situation has created a big bump in Europe's 5G roadmap, while other regions like the Middle East, Africa and Latin America are watching closely," Téral said. "In the meantime, China and the US are chugging along" with their own rollouts, he added.The race for 5GResearchers have good reason to believe in Huawei's technical prowess. It's one of the world's biggest holders of 5G patents and has contributed most to the effort to establish an international standard for 5G, according to IPlytics, a market intelligence firm that tracks tech trends.Experts at the Eurasia Group say the standard-setting process "will determine not just how 5G networks are built, but also how money flows between participants." Companies that contribute heavily to developing the standard will receive royalty payments from other telecom players, which "in turn, will help fund future innovation," the analysts wrote in a November report.Some experts, however, caution that it's too soon to say who's really leading on 5G, mainly because definitions of the technology have yet to be finalized."5G is still at the trial stage," said Zhenshan Zhong, who specializes in emerging technology in China for research firm IDC. "Before the test results come out, I don't think anyone can say for definite whether one vendor is actually going to be stronger than the other."Huawei's financial muscleHuawei's size and financial firepower enable it to dwarf its rivals' spending on efforts to come up with new tech.In 2017, it invested more than $13 billion in research and development, topping Microsoft and Apple, according to consulting firm PwC. In comparison, Nokia says it spent $5.6 billion on research and development that year, while Ericsson typically allocates around $4.4 billion each year. Ericsson and Nokia's "financial troubles and strategy troubles over the last few years" may have weakened their focus on 5G, Thillien said. Huawei has the added advantage of being the key player in its vast home market. Worldwide spending on 5G will balloon from $660 million in 2018 to $70.9 billion in 2022, according to IDC. China alone is expected to account for nearly half of all global 5G expenditure this year, it said.Huawei's ability to offer more than just network equipment gives it another advantage. It's one of the world's top three smartphone makers, and it also provides cloud computing services and makes artificial intelligence chips. "Given how all-encompassing 5G is going to be, this 'total-telecom' approach is powerful," said Peter Richardson, a director of tech strategies at research firm Counterpoint.

And it has already accumulated such a strong advantage in 5G technology that it is virtually irreplaceable for many wireless service providers who want to be among the first to offer new services.  "Banning Huawei will create a vacuum that no one can fill in a timely manner and that could seriously harm 5G deployments around the world," said Stéphane Téral, an expert in mobile telecommunications infrastructure at the IHS Markit research firm.  Uncertainty is particularly problematic for Europe, where Huawei was expected to play a key role in the construction of 5G networks that, according to regional leaders, are vital to its economic future.  The international launch of the 5G has become a front in a wider battle for advanced technology between the United States and China, which is changing the relationship between the two major economies of the world.  The United States does not have a global heavyweight competitor for Huawei in telecommunications equipment. The main rivals of the Chinese firm are Ericsson from Sweden and Nokia from Finland. But these companies have struggled for years against losses and job cuts, while Huawei has advanced, generating annual revenues of more than 100 billion dollars, building a solid base in China and accumulating intellectual property that will help determine the future of 5G .  Dissatisfied mobile operators  Some of the leading international mobile operators are warning that, by removing Huawei from 5G networks, countries risk weakening their own technological capabilities. The new wave of wireless communications is expected to increase the speed of the Internet up to 100 times compared to 4G networks, and help boost emerging technologies such as smart cities and connected vehicles.  Vodafone Chief Executive Nick Read warned last month that a complete ban on all Huawei equipment would substantially delay the availability of 5G. The mobile operator has suspended the installation of the Chinese company's equipment in the central networks of Europe while talking to the authorities and the company.  In August, Vodafone criticized the Australian government's decision to ban Huawei from providing 5G technology for networks there, and said the measure "fundamentally undermines the future of Australia's 5G."  The director of architecture of the British telecommunications group BT, Neil McRae, presented the situation in absolute terms at the end of last year.  "At the moment there is only one true 5G provider, and that is Huawei," he said at an industry event in London. "The others need to reach it."  BT said in December that it will not include Huawei's equipment in the heart of the planned 5G network, but will continue to use it for areas that are considered "benign," such as the radio masts that connect the wireless devices to the core network.  Last week, BT's consumer brands director told CNN that Huawei had not given him any "cause for concern" over the years.years.  But British officials have security concerns, and Huawei has pledged to spend $ 2 billion to address them. In a letter sent to lawmakers in the United Kingdom last month, the Chinese company warned that the process will take between three and five years to deliver tangible results, comparing it with "replacing components in a high-speed train in motion."  Huawei rivals may be one year behind  The situation should have the support of Ericsson and Nokia, but experts say the two companies may not be well positioned to capitalize on Huawei's difficulties.  "It goes without saying that other leading suppliers will benefit in the short term," according to analysts at Dell'Oro Group, a market research firm that specializes in analyzing telecommunications infrastructure.  Ericsson and Nokia declined to comment on their competitors. Instead, they promoted their advances in 5G in statements to CNN.  Nokia says it has "the only 5G end-to-end portfolio in the industry that is available worldwide," while Ericsson said it has publicly announced more 5G contracts with operators "than any other provider."  But Huawei says its 5G technology is at least a year ahead of its rivals, and many experts agree.  "In my conversations with operators, they have discovered that Huawei is much more advanced than the other two at the moment," said Dexter Thillien, a technology analyst at research firm Fitch Solutions.  The battle for Europe  Nokia and Ericsson executives may also be speaking cautiously in public for fear of angering the Chinese government and being cut off from its vast market. Nokia, in particular, employs about 15,000 people in China, more than twice its 6,000 workforce in their home country, Finland.  "Their presence there is very, very important to them," Thillien said. "So I do not think they're going to publicly say things like: Choose us, because we're Europeans and we're more secure."  Even if governments do not block Huawei completely, the possibility of restrictions is creating a gloomy climate for the Chinese company as mobile operators make investment decisions.  "It's probably better technologically, but technology is just part of the argument," Thillien said. He pointed to Europe as "the great battle at this time" for Huawei.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel said last week that "there are great discussions about Huawei" in her country. "We need to talk to China to make sure that companies do not simply hand over all the data that is used to the Chinese state," he said, adding that "safeguards" were needed.  "This situation has created a big bump in the trajectory of 5G in Europe, while other regions such as the Middle East, Africa and Latin America are watching carefully," said Teral.  "Meanwhile, China and the United States are moving forward" with their own launches, he added.  The race for 5G  The researchers have good reason to believe in Huawei's technical prowess.  It is one of the largest 5G patent holders in the world and has contributed more than anyone to the effort to establish an international standard for 5G, according to IPlytics, a market intelligence firm that tracks technology trends.  Eurasia Group experts say that the standard setting process"It will determine not only how 5G networks are built, but also how money flows between participants."  Companies that contribute greatly to developing the standard will receive royalty payments from other telecom operators, which "in turn, will help fund future innovation," the analysts wrote in a November report.  However, some experts warn that it is too early to say who is really leading in 5G, mainly because the definitions of the technology have not yet been finalized.  "The 5G is still in the test stage," said Zhenshan Zhong, who specializes in emerging technology in China for research firm IDC.  "Before the results of the tests come out, I do not think anyone can say with certainty if one provider will be really stronger than the other."  The financial strength of Huawei  The size and financial strength of Huawei allow it to make small the cost of its rivals in their efforts to create new technology.  In 2017, it invested more than 13,000 million dollars in research and development, surpassing Microsoft and Apple, according to the consultancy PwC.  By comparison, Nokia says it spent $ 5.6 billion on research and development that year, while Ericsson generally allocates about $ 4.4 billion each year.  The "financial problems and strategic problems of Ericsson and Nokia in recent years" may have weakened their focus on 5G, Thillien said.  Huawei has the additional advantage of being the key player in its vast internal market.  Global spending on 5G will increase from 660 million dollars in 2018 to 70,900 million dollars in 2022, according to IDC. China alone is expected to account for almost half of all global expenses at 5G this year, he said.  Huawei's ability to offer more than just network equipment gives it another advantage. It is one of the three leading smartphone manufacturers in the world, and also provides cloud computing services and produces artificial intelligence chips.  "Because of how comprehensive 5G will be, this 'total telecommunication' approach is powerful," said Peter Richardson, director of technology strategies at research firm Counterpoint. "No other industry participant is doing something similar." Load-Date: February 18, 2019End of Document

The White House, Pentagon, and US intelligence agencies "are deeply concerned" that "China's government, working in concert with leading state-tied telecommunications giants such as Huawei, wants to use the coming global implementation of fifth-generation wireless networks as an opportunity to steal information, eavesdrop, and unleash crippling cyberattacks on an unprecedented scale."Load-Date: January 4, 2019End of Document

The global race on AICE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 11, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 600 wordsBody By: Álvaro Calero  Nowadays, artificial intelligence (AI) is the latest technology. We have learned to communicate with devices. We succeed in directing the machines to perform tasks using their intelligence. The machines are performing activities using cognitive intelligence, in contrast to the natural intelligence (NI) shown by humans and animals, and the IIA is used in many sectors such as medicine, education, agriculture, among others. We know of successful projects as autonomous vehicles and many examples of robotics.  However, in recent years the AI has taken a strategic relevance for the world powers or for those who want to remain relevant in the future. The Government of China, for example, has announced its goal of becoming the world leader in artificial intelligence by 2030. Using its political and economic power to support Chinese companies in the development of AI.  Given the different applications in AI, each country has its reasons for investing in this resource, for some countries its interest is economic, for others it is military, such is the case of Russia, which aims that 30% of its military equipment is robotic by 2025. Other countries such as India are betting on agriculture, Japan on automation due to aging of its population and Israel on computer security.  China has traditionally dominated manufacturing, but now claims to be a leader on many fronts. According to "Times Higher Education", which lists the best universities of higher education, in the period between 2011 and 2015, China published more than 41,000 articles on AI. The Chinese Government is firmly behind the adoption of AI. Additionally, companies such as Tencent, Alibaba and Baidu are global players from e-commerce to autonomous cars and search engines. Combined they are worth around US $ 1 trillion.  The United States is the second undisputed place. In fact, both China and the United States are miles away from other countries. Between 2011 and 2015, almost 25,500 articles on AI were published in the US. The USA is also the country with the largest number of AI companies and US $ 10 billion in seed capital. Companies such as IBM, Microsoft, Google, Facebook and Amazon not only publish a significant number of articles, but also lead private investment in AI. The United States' body of scientific knowledge combined with its power in the business market allows it to stay on top.  The United Kingdom is a leader in "machine Learning", between 2011 and 2015, the number of articles on AI was 10,100. The famous program AlphaGo of DeepMind, now owned by Google, which beat the world champion of Go in 2017 is a British company world leader in artificial intelligence. It employs 250 researchers, from mathematicians to neuroscientists.  Finally, Japan and Germany fight fourth and fifth place. Both are experiencing a decrease in the active population and therefore are mainly developing their automation potential. Given their high industrial capacities, combined with a solid academy, they make them a fertile ground for AI. Between 2011 and 2015 in Germany almost 8,000 articles in AI were published. The Max Planck Society, an NGO dedicated to research and development, has partnered with companies such as Porsche, Daimler and Bosch on AI projects. Cyber Valley is the result of this and is one of the largest research cooperations in Europe in the field of AI. It is located in the Stuttgart-Tübingen region and is financed by the state. Amazon has announced the opening of a laboratory there.  Copyright Grupo de Diarios América - GDA / La Prensa Gráfica / El Salvador Load-Date: February 11, 2019End of Document

China: Huawei 'refusing to be victimized like silent lambs' with U.S. suitUPIMarch 8, 2019 Friday 8:19 AM ESTCopyright 2019 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 290 wordsByline: NICHOLAS SAKELARISDateline: Dec. 31 BodyThe Chinese government on Friday backed a lawsuit by Huawei against the United States, which challenges a ban on federal employees owning products made by the company.Huawei filed the suit Wednesday, arguing the U.S. government has not shown proof that Huawei products pose a security risk. The National Defense Authorization Act last year barred devices from Huawei and fellow Chinese phone maker ZTE."China has and will continue to take all necessary measures to resolutely protect the legitimate and lawful interests of Chinese businesses and citizens," Beijing diplomat  said Friday. "At the same time, we support the company and individual in question in seeking legal redress to protect their own interests and refusing to be victimized like silent lambs."The "company and individual" refers to Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou, who was arrested in Canada in December and is open to extradition to the United States on fraud charges.Wang said U.S. actions against Huawei and its executives are "by no means a pure judicial case, but a deliberate political move to bring them down."Meng's attorneys are suing Canadian authorities, saying her constitutional rights were violated."People can tell right and wrong, justice will have its day," Wang said Friday. "What we're standing up for is not just the interests of a company, but also a country or nation's legitimate right to innovate."Cybersecurity experts have warned the Huawei equipment could have "back doors" that Beijing could use for spying purposes.Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei has given several rare interviews lately to defend the company, and the firm last month took out a full-page advertisement in The Wall Street Journal titled, "Don't believe everything you hear.

China expected to be No. 1 retail marketUSA TODAYJanuary 24, 2019 ThursdayFIRST EDITIONCopyright 2019 Gannett Company, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: MONEY; Pg. 2BLength: 314 wordsByline: Paul Davidson, USA TODAYBodyChina is expected to top the U.S. as the world's largest retail market this year, a new report says, underscoring the Asian country's growing middle class and shift to a consumer-driven economy.Retail sales in China are forecast to grow 7.5 percent to $5.6 trillion in 2019, according to eMarketer's worldwide retail and e-commerce forecast. Meanwhile, U.S. retail sales are projected to increase 3.3 percent to $5.5 trillion. While growth is slowing for both countries, China is expected to outpace the U.S. through 2022, the report says."In recent years, consumers in China have experienced rising incomes, catapulting millions into the new middle class," says Monica Peart, senior forecasting director at eMarketer.China is already the world's leader in e-commerce sales, with 35.3 percent of the country's retail sales set to take place online this year, eMarketer estimates, compared to 10.9 percent in the U.S. China's ecommerce sales are projected to grow 30 percent to $1.9 trillion in 2019. By the end of the year, China will comprise 55.8 percent of the world's online retail sales, the report says.While Alibaba will account for 53.3 percent of China's ecommerce sales this year, its share has been declining as smaller players like social commerce platform Pinduoduo grow, eMarketer says.For the past decade or so, the Chinese government has been trying to shift the underpinnings of the country's economy from factory exports and commercial and residential investment to consumption."It has really picked up in the last three to five years," Peart says, a trend highlighted by China's expected rise.Millions of Chinese workers have moved from rural to urban areas and realized significant wage increases.The U.S., however, still far outpaces China in per capita retail spending annually, with projected 2019 sales of $16,661 in the U.S. and $4,056 in China, the study says. Load-Date: January 24, 2019End of Document

US lawmakers say Trump has taken 'no meaningful action' over China's treatment of MuslimsCNN.comMarch 4, 2019 Monday 7:29 PM ESTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICSLength: 598 wordsByline: By James Griffiths, CNNBodyA bipartisan group of US lawmakers said the Trump administration's response to China's alleged abuses of the largest Muslim Uyghur ethnic minority in Xinjiang was inadequate and urged it to hold Beijing to account."The administration has taken no meaningful action in response to the situation in (Xinjiang)," lawmakers wrote in a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, four months after they originally called on him to take action on this issue.CNN has reached out to the State Department for comment.As many as two million Uyghurs are estimated to have been imprisoned in huge detention centers in China's far west, according to a US government report.The human rights crisis in Xinjiang has drawn increasingly harsh criticism from across the world. At a UN hearing in November, more than a dozen countries called on Beijing to end its "arbitrary detention" of Uyghurs.A former detainee told CNN she witnessed abuse and torture, and lost one of her sons during her time in the camps.Beijing has repeatedly denied it is detaining Uyghurs against their will, calling the camps "vocational training centers" and suggesting they are providing education.In their letter Monday, the US lawmakers, led by House Committee on Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel, said that "over a million Uyghurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities have been interned in 'political re-education camps' without due process as part of a broader attempt to wipe out their separate identity, language, and history.""Global responses to these abuses have been insufficient. Of particular concern are reports of US companies that may be contributing to Beijing's persecution of Uyghurs through their support or commercial ties to Hikvision and Dahua -- two Chinese tech giants that have profited from the surge of security spending in Xinjiang," the letter added.It also pointed to plans by Frontier Services Group, a Hong Kong-based company that counts former Blackwater CEO Erik Prince among its investors, to build a "training center" in Xinjiang."These examples demonstrate not just the need to increase public awareness of human rights issues in (Xinjiang), but also impose consequences on PRC officials responsible and those who enable their abuses," the letter said. "Rhetoric without action will only embolden Beijing."Lawmakers requested information on whether the US monitors the use of American technology in facilitating the surveillance and detention of Muslim minorities in Xinjiang, and details of "any US companies that are allegedly providing technology transfers, sales, or security training for Chinese government officials or closely associated entities that operate in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region."They also called on the Trump administration to reveal its plans, either unilaterally or with allies, for "holding Beijing accountable."The letter comes as Beijing is facing a growing global backlash over the situation in Xinjiang, as reports of alleged abuses their stack up. Last month, Turkey -- which has a large Uyghur population -- said the detention camps were a "great shame for humanity."In a strongly-worded statement, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hami Aksoy said hundreds of thousands of prisoners were subject to "torture and political brainwashing" in China's camps, and called on the UN and the international community "to take effective measures in order to bring to an end this human tragedy in Xinjiang."Lawmakers in Indonesia and Malaysia have also expressed alarm over the alleged abuses in Xinjiang, and called for a full accounting of the "re-education camp" system.Load-Date: March 5, 2019End of Document

The performance of smart city initiatives significantly varies from one initiative to the other. There is a strong financial and institutional support from the central and local government for making smart city initiatives. Along with the population push and need of rapid urbanization, environmental pollution is also the key driver for the development of smart cities in China. On the other hand, the smart cities initiatives are not only driven by technical rationalities but also by political rationalities.Browse Adjacent Markets:Software and Services Market ResearchReports & ConsultingAbout MarketsandMarkets(TM) MarketsandMarkets(TM) provides quantified B2B research on 30,000 high growth niche opportunities/threats which will impact 70% to 80% of worldwide companies' revenues.

EU Ministers will address challenges in the relationship with China and the crisis in VenezuelaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 17, 2019 SundayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 570 wordsBody The Foreign Ministers of the European Union will address in their Council on Monday the challenges in the relationship with China, at a time when the EU asks for more reciprocity to that strategic partner, and will review the latest diplomatic efforts to achieve a solution to the conflict In Venezuela.  The ministers' discussions on China will pave the way for the debate that community leaders will hold at their meeting on Thursday and Friday and at the summit between the EU and that country on April 9 in Brussels, community sources said.  The State Councilor and Foreign Affairs Minister of China, Wang Yi, will participate in the meeting.  One of the references of the ministers will be the communication (non-legislative document) presented this week by the European Commission and the High Representative of the EU for Foreign Policy, Federica Mogherini, in which it is proposed to identify this year the harmful effects caused in subject of competition for Chinese government funding and ownership in Europe.  In addition, the document advocates to apply more forcefully the bilateral agreements and existing financial instruments and calls on Beijing to fulfill the joint commitments acquired to achieve a "more balanced and reciprocal" economic relationship.  "China is a partner, but sometimes behaves like a competitor," said diplomatic sources, who acknowledged in any case the particular interest of several member states for Chinese investments and called for the EU to "stay united in the face of these challenges."  In particular, foreign officials will discuss how to deepen relations with China in areas such as multilateralism, climate change, non-proliferation, peacekeeping or regional security challenges, such as the situation in Afghanistan.  Another issue that could touch, according to community sources, is the "key" messages that the EU has been sending to China on human rights, respect for international law including the law at sea (with the context of the tension in the sea of South China) and cybersecurity.  On the other hand, Mogherini is expected to inform the ministers about the latest efforts in the EU response to the crisis in Venezuela.  The EU has promoted an international contact group with European and Latin American countries that is expected to hold its second ministerial meeting later this month in Quito.  After a first technical mission to contact all parties to the conflict, two more will be held, according to diplomatic sources.  The main objective of this initiative is to provide the conditions for democratic and fair presidential elections and, at the same time, to support the access of humanitarian aid to the country.  The sources recalled that all possibilities are on the table, including the punishment of Venezuelan officials, although they insisted that all decisions taken must be focused on supporting an electoral advance and that new restrictive measures are not at this time the priority.  Despite the majority support of the EU countries to the head of the National Assembly, Juan Guaidó, as president in charge of the country, diplomatic sources pointed out that, although they consider it legitimate to call new elections, it does not have the control of the administration and from the police.  The entry EU Ministers will address challenges in the relationship with China and the crisis in Venezuela was first published in La Tercera. Load-Date: March 17, 2019End of Document

Regent Cancels China Calls on 2020 Itineraries Due to Berthing ConflictsTravel Agent CentralMarch 29, 2019 12:12 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Questex Media Group LLC All Rights ReservedSection: ARTICLELength: 374 wordsByline: Adam LeposaHighlight: The cruise line has replaced China calls on some 2020 itineraries with a number of calls in Japan. Get the details here. BodyRegent Seven Seas Cruises has cancelled a number of port calls in China on itineraries scheduled for March 1 and March 13, 2020, a spokesperson for the cruise line has confirmed to .While guests on the public group had speculated that the stops were cancelled for political reasons, a cruise line spokesperson tells Travel Agent that the changes were due to berthing conflicts.In the latest on the political situation being discussed on that Facebook group, CNNreports that its sources at the U.S. State Department say that U.S. citizens or people with legal status in the United States are being held in detention camps in Xinjiang, China. In an earlier report, the State Department had estimated that China had “arbitrarily detained 800,000 to possibly more than two million Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, and other Muslims in internment camps designed to erase religious and ethnic identities." The Chinese government says that the camps are "vocational and educational training centers for counter-terrorism and de-radicalization purposes."“We worked to enhance these voyages with additional ports of call including Tokyo, which is always one of our most popular destinations,” a Regent Seven Seas Cruises spokesperson tells Travel Agent. “Updating these itineraries a year in advance allows guests the flexibility to change their voyage if they prefer to sail on another cruise.”The State Department's travel advisory regarding China, last updated January 3, rates the country at Level 2: Exercised Increased Caution on the four-point travel advisory scale. That rating puts China at the same level as a number of other popular international tourist destinations, such as the UK, France, Italy and Mexico.The State Department's advisory specifically warns that travelers in China should exercise increased caution due to arbitrary enforcement of local laws, special restrictions on dual U.S.-Chinese nationals, and the prevention of U.S. citizens from leaving China using “exit bans.”State Department Updates Method for Issuing Travel WarningsMexico Travel Advisory: What the State Department's Updates Mean for TravelRoyal Caribbean to Buy Grand Lucayan, Develop Freeport HarbourRegent Seven Seas Cruises Previews New Seven Seas Splendor SuitesLoad-Date: April 3, 2019End of Document

Tech education in China transitions to new siteThe Technique: Georgia TechFebruary 17, 2019 SundayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 605 wordsByline: Jonathan JeffreyBodyA new building brightly colored in red, gold, gray and white stripes marks the next he Georgia Tech Tianjin University Shenzhen Institute marks the most recent endeavor - and by far the largest in scope - that Tech has made to establish a base of educational opportunities in China."We've been involved in China with educational programs, and some research programs, but largely educational programs, for some time," Rafael Bras, provost and vice president for Academic Affairs.As two examples, Bras mentioned a former master's degree program held at Shanghai Jiaotong Univeristy that "went on successfully for many years," and a joint biomedical Ph.D. program with Peking University in Beijing, which is "very strong, but is very few people."The GTSI was born out of conversations with Tianjin University, a university in north China city of Tianjin that has a long history that Bras says paralleled Tech."That's why it was very attractive to us," Bras said. "It started with a science and technology focus, and now it other does other things, but that's its core."The GTSI campus itself will be in the suburbs of Shenzhen, a city in the southern province of Guangdong that in recent years has skyrocketed to the technology and innovation hub of China.The Board of Regents has so far approved five Master of Science (M.S.) programs to be offered in Shenzhen: Analytics, Computer Science, Electrical and Computer Engineering , Environmental Engineering and Industrial Design. In addition, one Ph.D. program has been approved: the Ph.D. in ECE.While GT Shenzhen has offered the M.S. in ECE since fall 2014, the other programs are waiting for approval from the Chinese Ministry of Education, which requires educational programs to reach certain space requirements that must be reached before being offered.That's where the new building comes in: for the next few years - Bras estimates about three - GTSI will operate out of a transitional building while the main campus, covering 40 acres and complete with dormitories, is being constructed. On that campus, Tianjin University will also host undergraduate classes for students working toward a Tianjin University degree."It's a beautiful site," Bras said. "Not too far from the action of where the city is, and good public transportation to it. It will be easy to move into it. And this is going to have dorms, it will have classrooms, it will have cafeterias, it will have the whole facilities."Tech is putting no money into the construction of the campus in China - authorities in China are financing the construction of both the temporary building and the final campus.The ECE master's program is immediately moving into the transitional space, and after approval comes from the Chinese government, the other master's program and one Ph.D. program will be launched and also housed in the building.The GTSI transitional building will see usage besides just graduate students - and that's actually what Bras is most excited about: a home base for study abroad and international programs in China that will serve to enrich the experience of scores of undergraduate students.Tech currently offers the China Summer Program , an annual study abroad program for that previously was housed in different universities across China. In summer 2018, CSP was for the first time held completely in Shenzhen, in the Southern University of Science and Technology. In summer 2019, CSP will move into the transitional building, offering nine different courses to students over the summer.Bras says the overall vision is to have a program with similar reach and impact for GT students as GT Lorraine.Load-Date: February 17, 2019End of Document

Tencent can finally start making money on new games in China againCNN WireJanuary 25, 2019 Friday 8:32 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 452 wordsByline: By Sherisse Pham, CNN BusinessDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  Tencent is back in the game in China.After a nine-month freeze that hammered Tencent's stock price, Chinese authorities have started allowing the internet company to make money off new mobile games again.China's State Administration of Press and Publications began issuing new game licenses late last month, wading into an estimated backlog of more than 7,000 titles that had built up during the epic halt on approvals. But the first three lists of approved titles featured none from Tencent, the world's largest gaming company. Its break came with the announcement Thursday of the latest batch of licenses, which included two of its games.Investors welcomed the news, pushing Tencent shares up 4.1% in Hong Kong on Friday. The stock has lost about 25% of its value in the past year.The company is still waiting for licenses for some of its most popular mobile games. Those approvals, rather than the ones announced Thursday, will make the real difference for its earnings.Jefferies analyst Karen Chan said in a research note that she expects Tencent's revenue growth from mobile games to accelerate in the second quarter as it gets permission to launch more and more titles.NetEase, another leading Chinese gaming company, also received its first new approval for one title on Thursday. The Chinese government stopped approving licenses that allow companies to make money from new mobile games last March. Since the freeze was lifted in late December, regulators have approved fewer than 400 new games, leaving thousands more in limbo. The freeze came amid an increasingly restrictive environment for China's gaming industry. In August, the Education Ministry announced plans for new rules to control the number of games and limiting the time children spend playing them.Tencent was hit hard by the crackdown. Gaming accounts for more than 40% of the company's revenue. Last year, the regulatory pressures contributed to a rare quarterly profit decline and helped wipe billions off its market value. Tencent is still waiting for approval for some of its most highly anticipated mobile games like "PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds."Titles like that were probably left off the first few batches of licenses because they "are more sophisticated in design and therefore have to go through a longer review period," Tony Cheung, an analyst with stock broker CFSG in Hong Kong, wrote in a note to clients this week. China is the world's largest gaming market, accounting for a quarter of global revenue, according to market research firm Newzoo. It expected China's total gaming revenue to reach $38 billion in 2018.TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Thursday.Dunford, Google execs to meetChina is a competitor to the United States. The Trump administration even revamped the military's National Defense Strategy last year to make maintaining a military advantage over China and Russia its top priority.Dunford said Thursday that the Chinese typically require companies doing business in China to have members of the ruling Communist party in that company, a requirement he says will allow the Chinese military access to the companies' intellectual property."It is a distinction without a difference between the Chinese Communist Party, the government and the Chinese military," Dunford said.The top general plans to meet with Google representatives next week to discuss his concerns.Google respondsA Google representative told VOA the company is "committed to continuing to partner with the U.S. government, including the military, both on specific projects and on broader policy around AI" that are consistent with Google's principles.The representative added that Google deeply respects the U.S. military and is working with them to solve problems in areas such as cybersecurity, logistics, transportation and planning.Dunford warned that Google's venture in China will ultimately allow China to take advantage of U.S.-developed technology and help an authoritarian government assert control over its people."We ought not to think that it's just about business when we do business in China," he said.Load-Date: March 22, 2019End of Document

China's exports plunge; Apple supplier hit; Detroit Auto ShowCNN WireJanuary 15, 2019 Tuesday 12:07 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 520 wordsByline: By Ivana Kottasová, CNN BusinessDateline: LONDON (CNN Business) BodyLONDON (CNN Business) --  1. China's economy: China's huge export industry just suffered its worst month in two years but still managed to rack up a record trade surplus with the United States in 2018.The value of goods shipped from China to the rest of the world fell by more than 4% in December, compared to the same period a year ago, Chinese government data published Monday showed.That represents the worst monthly performance for China's export sector in more than two years. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast that exports from China would rise slightly in December.Despite last month's gloom, China for the second year running racked up a record trade surplus with the United States in 2018, according to Chinese data. The $323 billion gap in value between how much China sells to the United States and how much it buys from it has been at the heart of the trade dispute between the two countries. President Donald Trump has previously said that trade with China is unfair.The United States had an even larger estimate of that gap, with the latest figures from the census bureau showing a $345 billion trade deficit with China in 2018.2. Rotten Apple: European Apple supplier Dialog Semiconductor (DLGNF) warned Monday that its fourth quarter sales will be at the bottom of the range it gave in October.It's the latest sign that weak iPhone sales in China are having an effect on Apple (AAPL) suppliers that rely on the tech giant for orders. Apple warned earlier this month that it would miss its sales target for the last quarter of 2018 by at least $5 billion, because of slower than expected sales in the world's second largest economy. Dialog Semiconductor shares listed in Frankfurt increased 2.8% despite the warning.3. Detroit Auto Show: The United States' preeminent auto show kicks off Monday in Detroit, and a slew of hot cars are expected to make their debuts.The biggest industry news may come on Tuesday, however, when Ford (F) and Volkswagen (VLKAF) are expected to formalize their widely expected partnership.Ford plans to spend $11 billion on new technologies and reshaping the focus of the company in the next three to five years. Finding someone to share those kinds of costs with will be crucial to its success. 4. Global market overview: US stock futures were pointing lower.European markets opened down, following a negative trading session in Asia.The Dow was flat on Friday, ending its five-day winning streak. The S&P 500 was little changed and the Nasdaq closed 0.2% lower.5. Earnings and economics: Citigroup (C) will release earnings before the open. It's the first big American bank to report this earnings season.6.

The company has continued to claim that the project was only exploratory.More than 60 NGOs signed the document, as well as individuals including Edward Snowden, saying they were  disappointed  by a previous letter from Google. By implementing the project, codenamed Dragonfly, the groups and individuals write, they  fear that the company may knowingly compromise its commitments to human rights and freedom of expression, in exchange for access to the Chinese search market.  Actively aiding China s censorship and surveillance regime is likely to set a terrible precedent for human rights and press freedoms worldwide,  the letter continues.The letter was only one source of pressure on Monday. A group of Tibetan rights groups and consumer advocates announced that they had received more than 50,000 signatures calling on Google to cancel its plans for China.Google employees, meanwhile, have continued to pressure the company internally, with hundreds signing on to an open letter protesting the project.  It s time for Google to uphold its own principles,  Jack Poulson, a former Google senior research scientist who resigned over Dragonfly, said during a media briefing.Pichai is expected to face a bipartisan grilling in front of the House Judiciary Committee tomorrow, and while the scheduled topic is Google s collection and filtering of data, Dragonfly will almost certainly be on the agenda for many lawmakers.Tags: See Campaign:https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/10/18134563/human-rights-amnesty-google-dragonfly-china-searchContact Information:Colin LecherTags:,            Wire,            Artificial Intelligence Newswire,            United States,            EnglishLoad-Date: January 1, 2019End of Document

THE CASE FOR A CYBER DETERRENCE PLAN THAT WORKSStates News ServiceMarch 5, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1648 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Center for the National Interest (former the Nixon Center):If America narrows its focus to China and Russia, then it encourages belligerence by other actors. This increased aggressiveness will create new opportunities in cyberspace for the Chinese and Russians.by Sandeep Baliga Ethan Bueno de Mesquita Alexander WolitzkyU.S. strategy has not kept pace with the evolving cyber threat. Recent proposals ignore key strategic features of the cyber domain, resulting in overly narrow policies. We must take a global approach to cyber-deterrence, and we must blend aggressive retaliation when the origins of attacks are clear with forbearance when they aren't.Here's a scenario that should trouble America's political leaders:Top-secret plans for a next-generation fighter jet are stolen from a U.S. defense contractor's computer. It appears the intrusion originated in China. Then again, it's easy for other actors to make it look as if the culprit is China. Also, some signs point to North Korea. Ultimately, the United States blames China. It launches a retaliatory cyber strike that paralyzes Chinese military computer networks for a week. U.S. diplomats tell their counterparts that they've been warned against future incursions, but the move backfires.It turns out the initial attack came from Iranian Revolutionary Guard operatives routing the attack through a server in China and using North Korean coding techniques. Chinese leaders are incensedviewing claims about misattribution of an Iranianattack as mere pretext for U.S. aggression. They respond with a cyberattack on the electrical grid in the Washington, DC area, causing rolling blackouts amid a summer heat wave. Several people die. As the dust-up becomes public, U.S.officials feel pressure to retaliate further. The president orders a missile strike against a Chinese military computer facility. Two-dozen Chinese coders are killed. What started as a limited cyber-intrusion now threatens to turn into a full-fledged military conflict.Each element of this hypothetical has occurred in the recent past in one form or another. And it shows how complicated the strategic landscape has become in the cyber age. Unfortunately, our strategic thinking has not kept pace. The United States needs a new strategy for deterrence in cyberspace.Attribution problems are the chief strategic complication. As former U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense William Lynn put it: "Whereas a missile comes with a return address, a computer virus generally does not." In congressional testimony , former NSA Director Michael Hayden warned that "[c]asually applying well-known concepts from physical space like deterrence, where attribution is assumed, to cyberspace, where attribution is frequently theproblem, is a recipe for failure."During the Cold War, game theory played a key role in helping policymakers formulate strategies appropriate to the challenges of the nuclear age. Following this tradition, we have taken up General Hayden's challenge by developing a new game theoretic analysis of deterrence appropriate for the cyber age, one that takes the problem of attribution seriously.Our analysis yields four key insights:- Deterrence in cyberspace is fundamentally global and interconnected, notbilateral.- Optimal cyber-deterrence blends aggressive retaliation when attacks are clearlyattributable with forbearance when they aren't, rather than across-the-boardaggressiveness.- Retaliatory efforts should be focused on our most deterrable, rather than mostaggressive, adversaries.- Technological improvements in attribution will not always improve deterrence.A Global LandscapeOur call for a new cyber strategy comes in the context of other schemes we view as dangerously simplistic. The latest Department of Defense Cyber Strategy focuses on our most belligerent and capable cyber adversaries: China and Russia. The 2018 National Defense Strategy acknowledges North Korea and Iran as rogue nations to contend with and notes the emergence of threats from non-state actors. Nonetheless the 2018 DOD Cyber Strategy emphasizes America's two biggest rivals. "Our focus will be on the States that can pose strategic threats to U.S. prosperity and security, particularly China and Russia," it reads . But we cannot be effective in the cyber domain, which contains a much larger number of cyber-capable adversaries, if we narrow our lens in this way.Consider a country weighing how to respond to a cyberattack. That country will only retaliate if it is sufficiently confident in its assessment of which adversary is responsible. Of course, it is the anticipation of such retaliation that creates deterrence. This means that an adversary will be more aggressive in cyberspace when it believes the defending country is less likely to reach theconfidence threshold necessary for retaliation.One important input to blame assessment concerns features of the attack itselfe.g., the location of servers, the language and style of malicious code, or the identity of likely beneficiaries. Another input concerns the more general strategic environment. Adversaries believed to be particularly active or capable in the cyber domain will be more suspect following any hard-to-attribute attack. It is this latter fact that makes cyber-deterrence fundamentally global, rather than bilateral.Suppose some adversary, say China, is believed to have become more aggressive in thecyber domain. Then China is now more suspect whenever a hard-to-attribute cyberattack occurs. China is thus more likely to face retaliation. But if China becomes more suspect, other adversaries, say North Korea, Russia or Iran, must become less suspect. And so these other adversaries are less likely to face retaliation. This reduced risk of retaliation tempts these adversaries to become more aggressive. And so, in cyberspace, if we become worse at deterring any one adversary, we become worse at deterring them all.This interconnectedness is reflected in several recent cyberattacks. According to American authorities , a Russian cyberattack disrupted the opening ceremony of the PyeongChang Winter Olympics. The GRU routed the intrusion through North Korean IP addresses to deflect blame. The North Koreans were an attractive target for this "false flag" operation precisely because they were already highly suspect due the Sony Pictures hack and other cyber operations. Or consider the "GhostNet" plot, a worldwide infiltration of government and commercial networks, originating in China. A report by the Information Warfare Monitor identifies the Chinese government and military as leading suspects. But it notes that another plausible explanation is "a state other than China, but [operating] physically within China...perhaps in an effort to deliberately mislead observers."Here we see why attribution problems mean we must think and act globally. If we narrow our focus to China and Russia, then we encourage belligerence by other actors. And this increased aggressiveness will create new opportunities in cyberspace for the Chinese and Russians.Toward a More Effective Cyber Deterrence StrategyIn any deterrence setting, the optimal response after an attack may not be the same asthe threat that optimizes deterrence prior to an attack. This familiar problem of credible commitment necessitates that governments articulate and commit to a deterrence doctrine. Serious discussions are underway about how countries might pre-commit in cyberspace.But, for such pre-commitment to be of use, we must know what the optimal doctrineis. Recent arguments call for a more aggressive retaliatory regimefor instance by declaring governments responsible for cyberattacks originating in their territory, regardless of theperpetrator. Such calls are consistent with the general theory of deterrence: heightened retaliatory aggressiveness deters more attacks.But our analysis shows that matters are less clear-cut in the cyber domain. There is avanishingly small chance that we will engage in, say, nuclear retaliation against the wrong adversary. As William Lynn reminds us, missiles come with a return address. But cyberattacks do not. As such, cyber-deterrence doctrine must balance a fundamental trade-off. Committing to a more aggressive retaliatory policy deters more attacks. But it also entails greater risk ofmistaken retaliation. Thus, in cyber warfare, where attribution problems loom large, full deterrence is infeasible. And increased aggressiveness across-the-board is unlikely to be optimal.The optimal deterrence doctrine for cyber warfare is more nuanced. We should commitourselvesthrough policy declarations, treaties, and standing military ordersto retaliating more aggressively than we otherwise would following clearly attributable attacks. But we should also commit ourselves to retaliating less aggressively following attacks whose attribution isparticularly ambiguous. Such forbearance will reduce the risk of erroneous retaliation and dangerous escalatory spirals, with only limited costs for deterrence and security. And let's return to the global nature of cyber conflict. Despite the 2018 Department of Defense Cyber Strategy's focus on Russia and China, the optimal cyber doctrine doesn't call for increased aggressiveness against our most aggressive adversaries. Rather, it calls for increased aggressiveness against our most deterrable adversaries. An adversary is deterrable if its attacks are particularly easy to attribute (e.g., it is technologically limited, other countries aren't trying to mimic it) and if it is particularly responsive to retaliation (e.g., because of its own cyber vulnerability or because ofdomestic political considerations). When we improve deterrence against these adversaries, we improve deterrence against all our adversaries, who will have fewer other cyber aggressors to hide behind.Load-Date: March 6, 2019End of Document

Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Tuesday, March 12th.Your top stories right now 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.Mixed market performances this morning. Take a look at futures, mostly higher. Although the Dow Industrials once again being weighed down by Boeing. The Dow futures down 34 points. S&P 500 futures up 1.25 points. And the Nasdaq up 8.5 right now.This after gains across the board yesterday. Stocks staging a late day rally yesterday driven by technology. Check out those moves. Dow Industrials up 200 points at 4:00 on Wall Street yesterday. S&P 500 was up 40. And the Nasdaq, very powerful move there, up 150 points at the close yesterday, better than 2 percent as a big rally in tech stocks really fueled things.Global markets this morning are mostly higher, although European indices are mixed. FT 100 is struggling to stay positive, up just one and two- thirds points. The CAC 40 in Paris is now negative by a fraction. And the Dax index in Germany up eight and two-thirds points right now.In Asia overnight, gains across the region. As you see, best performer was Japan. Nikkei average up one and three-quarters percent.The groundings of Boeing 737 Max 8 jets are expanding around the world. Nearly half of all of the jets that have been delivered since May of '17 are now parked -- half of those jets. The fallout coming up. As you see Boeing shares down another 2 percent right now and that's weighing on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi not interested in impeachment of President Trump she says. Yesterday she said it's not worth it. But not every body in her party feels that way.Closer to an exit, British Prime Minister Theresa May making some progress on her deal to leave the European Union as she faces a key vote today.And a Bugatti fit for a baby? Luxury automaker unveiling a small scale car -- not a small price tag. We'll tell you all about that beauty for your children.All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning. And joining me to break it all down -- Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, "Love Your Enemy" author Arthur Brooks here, and the CFRA investment strategist Lindsey Bell. Great to see you this morning.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning.LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA: Good to be here.ARTHUR BROOKS, AUTHOR: Good morning.MCDOWELL: I want to point something out really quickly. This is front page of the "Wall Street Journal" today, that the U.S. is telling Germany to drop Huawei or see intelligence sharing -- the pact on intelligence sharing pared back -- a warning sent to Berlin, a story that you were way ahead of.When was the Secretary of State Pompeo interview? February 21st?BARTIROMO: Yes. February 21st.MCDOWELL: You would have known this story. You didn't need to wait for it to be on the front page of the "Wall Street Journal" if you watch this program every day.So again, really far ahead on the concerns about the theft by China of our intellectual property. You've been talking about it for literally years.BARTIROMO: Yes. And you know, when he was in on that day, February 21st, I knew that when he said it, it was incredible news.MCDOWELL: Right.BARTIROMO: For him to stand there and say yes, we're going to share less information with our European partners if they have Huawei telecom, that's just an enormous story. Because obviously the Five Eyes they've got real partnerships that they should be able to trust your telecom systems. But that's how threatening this Huawei story really is.MCDOWELL: This is -- I know this working with you. You have these incredible instincts about what is right and wrong. And you can see what will be an important story way before many other people see it. So --BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for that.MCDOWELL: Major kudos, Maria Bartiromo.BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean I was looking at the story and I'm like, well yes, we did this a month ago, February 21st.And this is a major issue, Arthur.BROOKS: Yes.BARTIROMO: The Chinese and Huawei telecom systems being deployed across the world gives the Chinese an ability to tap into everybody's data.BROOKS: Yes. I mean, when you're talking about a big American, private American company, you wouldn't say that that's tapping into the information by the American government. The problem is that there's a distinction, without a difference in China between state-owned enterprises and those that aren't.BARTIROMO: Right.BROOKS: They share information with the government. And you know, this is a back door when we're sharing information with our allies, if there's a Chinese partner involved, until the Chinese change the way that they do business, until they're more democratic and more transparent.MCDOWELL: Once we share it with our allies, we lose control of that information, we really -- we don't have any -- much control over how that partner would then use that information or protect it.BROOKS: That's right.BARTIROMO: By the way, this is not just data about, hey, I went to the store yesterday. You could track our soldiers. This is data about the military. This is data about plans that the U.S. has in place with our partners.BROOKS: Yes. And this has been -- it's just the new age of actually how we conduct warfare effectively without shooting each other. You have to have information on each other. You can have breaches in security like crazy. Who knows what the implications of this are.The United States has to protect itself. And you know, in China when there's no distinction between the private sector and the public sector, we can't trust. And this is a big problem -- this is a big problem for China, quite frankly.MCDOWELL: And I just want -- it's our defense, our intelligence and also our financial system. They're all interconnected. I think it was really important that the Fed chief, Jay Powell, said in that interview on Sunday, that this is the one thing that he worries about more than anything else and that is cyber attacks and attacks on our financial system by state actors --BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: -- and so it's all inextricably linked together.BARTIROMO: And apparently, we get thousands of cyber intrusions attacks a day.BROOKS: For sure. Oh, for sure.BELL: And so Germany's been put on notice here officially but Britain and Italy have been two that really have been also kind of pushing back on this, not no use of Huawei's technology. Britain is -- they have a test lab analyzing some of their stuff and they're saying that there are no back doors.But there is a lot of really sophisticated intertwined spaghettified code that runs their network that could change at any time. This is software that can really --BROOKS: Yes. It means no back doors that we know of.BARTIROMO: Right. Well, and it's Huawei telecom. So you push a button and all of the data take goes back to the Chinese government.BROOKS: Right.BARTIROMO: I mean that's the bottom line. And that's what Secretary Pompeo was telling us when he was here in February and he did tell us that the U.K. In particular was pushing back on not using Huawei, because it's expensive. They use this and they use this Chinese telecom because it was cheap. So did African countries.So this is a real issue. We'll keep following it for sure.The White House unveiling a $4.7 trillion budget proposal meanwhile. That budget includes $8.6 billion to build the President's long-promised border wall and another $750 billion for national defense of which $718 will go to the Pentagon amount for the military.A $33 billion increase for the military budget. It would also cut $818 billion from projected Medicare spending over 10 years.Press Secretary Sarah Sanders laid out a blueprint for the budget at yesterday's briefing -- watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: President Trump's 2020 budget which was released today builds upon incredible success and keeps his promises to the American people.It continues the President's pro job creation policies, keeps taxes low, combats the opioid epidemic, protects our veterans, defends our nation and secures our borders.This budget demonstrates the President's vision to restrain Washington spending and reach a balanced budget by 2034. This is a clear road map for a more fiscally responsible future.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is California Congressman, Armed Services Committee member John Garamendi. Congressman -- it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.REP. JOHN GARAMENDI (D), CALIFORNIA: Good to be with you -- Maria.BARTIROMO: Your reaction to the budget proposal.GARAMENDI: Doesn't work. It simply doesn't work. Doesn't take into account the extraordinary deficit that we have. Doesn't take into account the real needs that we have. And by the way, that's American taxpayer money, not Mexican money that's going to be building that wall.And at the same time he's cutting about the same amount of money out of the flood protections that Americans need all across this nation.BARTIROMO: What do you say to those people who continue to bring up the lines of people, thousands of people who are trying to get to America over the border, porous borders? What do you say about all of the threats that the military, the U.S. faces today, not just the obvious threats like ISIS and the issues around Syria, Afghanistan, et cetera; but also China and these quieter things that are not in your face every day but we know that they're real threats like Huawei telecom, all of these things that the U.S. is trying to combat.GARAMENDI: Well, that's precisely the problem with this budget. It's putting the money exactly where we don't need it. We do need to recognize that most of those people that are coming across the border now are families escaping from the Central American countries and they're coming through the ports of entry. They're not coming across the open borders.So the problem really lies at the ports of entry which need to be beefed up and in fact some of that money is for that purpose and that's a good thing.But to spend that money on a wall that most everybody says is not particularly useful isn't the best place to spend it.We clearly have problems with technology. Huawei is definitely a problem. Your previous section on that was right on point. So we need to deal with cyber security. A good portion of that military budget has to go into the cyber security issue.BARTIROMO: Right.GARAMENDI: So there are many different things we need to do. And we don't need to cut education. We don't -- the healthcare, you did mention Medicare, but take a look at Medicaid. Over the next 10 years it will be $1.5 trillion reduction in Medicare --BARTIROMO: Yes.GARAMENDI: -- 60 percent of that goes to seniors.BARTIROMO: The spending didn't just happen over the last two years, right. I mean this has been an issue now for a decade or more in terms of this deficit. Here's Arthur Brooks from AEI.BROOKS: Hi, Congressman. One of the things that you would think that Republicans would be worried about is deficit spending but apparently they're not at this point. I realize it's an aspirational budget. Are Democrats now for the first time in a long time worried about deficit spending now that the Republicans apparently are not?BARTIROMO: Let's not forget that the debt was doubled under President Obama from $10 trillion to $20 trillion.GARAMENDI: And let's not forget that most of that occurred as a result of the great collapse in 2008.But leaving that aside, the tax cut that occurred in December of 2017 really amped up the deficit. The deficit hawks simply left Washington. My guess is, that they're going to return and there's going to be a mighty battle that will include the deficit.I know the Democrats, we were very, very concerned about the deficit and remain concerned about it because ultimately, it is not sustainable. The notion that we're going to have a balanced budget 14, 15 years out from now ignores the fact that we're probably going to wind up doubling the amount of money that we have to spend on interest payments over that period of time and it assumes over a 3 percent annual growth rate in the American economy.BARTIROMO: So let me ask you this -- Congressman. How do you explain all of these sky in the pie --GARAMENDI: Sky in the pie.BARTIROMO: -- you know, pie in the sky -- yes, pie in the sky ideas like a $93 trillion Green New Deal or a $32 trillion Medicare for all deal when you've got $22 trillion in debt?GARAMENDI: Doesn't work.BARTIROMO: Right. But these are coming from -- these are coming from your colleagues, obviously, right on the Democratic side. If the Dems are so interested and worried about debt, how come they have no problem bringing forth these expensive ideas?GARAMENDI: Well, let's start with the Green New Deal. If you take a look at it, we really do have a climate crisis. We have to deal with it. The Green New Deal speaks to many of the issues.BARTIROMO: You think the climate crisis is a bigger crisis than the crisis at the border?GARAMENDI: Absolutely it is. No doubt about it. And anybody that thinks otherwise isn't looking at what's happening around the world. Sea level rise.This week I'm going to be holding a hearing in my subcommittee, the readiness subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee. Right now we've got a $3 billion problem at Camp LeJeune because of the flooding that took place last summer. And we have an equal problem down at Tindall Air Force Base in Florida. It was basically wiped out by a hurricane. We've got to deal with the reality of the climate change just with the military alone.BARTIROMO: So then we should spend the $90 trillion then?GARAMENDI: No, I didn't say that, did I? You may have said it. But I didn't say it.BARTIROMO: No.GARAMENDI: No. Let's get real here. The Medicare for all is an issue that's been out there for a long time, clearly Medicare works. The Medicare for all legislation that's been proposed isn't Medicare. It's really something quite different than that. And we do need to deal with climate change.You take a look at your city there in New York. New York has extraordinary expenses, just to protect itself from the rising sea level and the inevitable hurricane that will come up the East Coast.MCDOWELL: If New York cared about climate change then why doesn't our mass transit system work? That's my biggest issue. The mayor's talking about meatless Monday to save the planet. And there's one thing that can save the planet and we have the largest city in the country and the subways don't work and the commuter rail system is an abomination. I just had to say that.(CROSSTALKING)MCDOWELL: -- because I get angry. Do not take the subway.GARAMENDI: I hope you feel better now. Yes, it is a problem. And we do need mass transportation all across this nation. That's a great place to spend our money.Also, if you take a look at the President's budget, his transportation program is exactly what he put together last year which is no new money.So we've got to really focus here.BARTIROMO: Congressman -- apparently your colleague Nancy Pelosi says she does not want to impeach President Trump.GARAMENDI: Well, let's see what happens. All of the investigations are incomplete. When those investigations get complete, then the question of impeachment is really on the table. Right now, it's not.BARTIROMO: All right -- Congressman. it's good to see you this morning, sir.GARAMENDI: Always a pleasure.BARTIROMO: Thanks so much.John Garamendi -- back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.The list of countries and airlines grounding the Boeing 737 Max 8 jet is growing this morning. Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines -- Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Maria -- this is interesting.Australia has become the latest country to suspend the aircraft from its airports due to the deadly crash in Ethiopia on Sunday. The country following similar moves by China, South Africa, Singapore, Indonesia, Brazil, even Mexico.Here in the United States, though, the FAA still says it has no plans to ground the aircraft for now but it has ordered Boeing to make urgent improvements to it. Boeing has confirmed it will deploy a software upgrade to -- software upgrade to the 737 Max 8.Two airlines that fly that aircraft certainly not a (INAUDIBLE); and American, stock fell more than 5 percent yesterday. It's lower again in the premarket today, 2 and a quarter percent to the downside.Well, customers of United Healthcare are getting a new discount. The insurance says that all of its Optum Pharmacies are going to pass drug maker rebates directly to the customers. The policy takes effect in January. This is the latest effort by the insurers to pass along more prescription drug savings to customers in the face of intense criticism from the Trump administration.And then there's this, Apple announcing a major event this month. It's going to take place on March 25th.Apple is expected to debut its long-anticipated streaming service that will compete with Netflix and Hulu and Amazon Prime. As far as the hardware, Apple has traditionally brought out new iPads in March and the next version of air pods might make an appearance. There's talk that it might be a wireless air pod charging situation.Shares of Apple are higher -- slightly higher in the premarket. Apple actually has been paying some big name celebrities to develop television shows which Variety has been reporting on Maria? So this is all kind of making sense.BARTIROMO: they're spending big money. Everybody's got to keep up with Netflix I guess -- to compete, in terms of original content.Thank you -- CherylBARTIROMO: Coming up, artificial intelligence in healthcare, how A.I. could improve your future checkups.And then a baby Bugatti, the auto maker rolling out a new kids' ride with an adult price tag. The cost coming up.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Artificial intelligence transforming medicine. Healthcare is seeing an increased use of A.I. but some are worried about its continued impact on the industry.Joining us right now is Scripps Research executive vice president, the author of "Deep Medicine", Eric Topol. Eric -- good to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.ERIC TOPOL, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, SCRIPPS RESEARCH: Great to be with you.BARTIROMO: You know, you say the U.K. is ahead of the U.S. In terms of A.I. being implemented in healthcare. How, specifically?TOPOL: Well, I spent the last year and-a-half as -- commissioned as a review for the government for the NHS. And I learned that they're started implement A.I., like, for example, getting rid of keyboards, so doctors don't do any typing, in emergency room settings, no less. Patients love that because they have eye contact.And reading scans, medical scans so that it revs up what a radiologist can do and then the leader in the world of genomics. So they're taking the sequence and all the data that we've been talking about for years and they're actually implementing it into day-to-day practice.BARTIROMO: That's exactly one of the jobs Dagen that Kai Fu Lee said would go away -- radiologists. Because reading the radiology -- the reading can be done quicker and easier by a machine, by A.I.MCDOWELL: How long will that be before that happens?BARTIROMO: In the U.S.TOPOL: That's happening in China right now.BARTIROMO: It's happening in China right now.TOPOL: More accurate than a lot of radiologists and of course a lot faster and a lot less expensive. But, you know, there is a concern that you want to have these algorithms at perfection level because if they're making a mistake, that's at scale. They can't tolerate that.So there's skepticism about implementing that in this country and I understand that but --BARTIROMO: Yes. Because there's implicit bias.TOPOL: Yes. The bias is mainly the human side because the machine, once you put in the learning network, it's clean of bias. But it's what we put in that's a problem.At any rate we can get some accuracy, productivity, work flow improvement. It's remarkable. But we have to get on it and we don't have any resources.We're talking about cutting the NIH budget when it actually is a way to invest to get A.I. to the point where it will be ready to implement and people are comfortable about it.BROOKS: One of the questions that we often have, you know, a lot of people watching us when they think about A.I. and, you know, machines taking over our healthcare system, they're not going to be able to talk to their doctor.And this is actually pretty important for people because they feel better cared for when they're talking to a human.TOPOL: Right.BROOKS: What can you tell me about this? Are you saying that the A.I. is going to enhance the human to human experience or are we going to be all talking to a computer and have that assess our health.TOPOL: That's the theme of deep medicine. And that is, that we flip this, that little time we have with patients, which is average on seven minutes in an appointment, we now can augment that time because so much of the work is outsourced to machines.And so with that gift of time, it gives that human touch, the bond. We bring back the past. Decades ago when this was a precious relationship, we can restore that now because we have machines and algorithms to get us back there.BELL: What about the cost? You sort of alluded to that, budgets being cut for healthcare. What about policy costs? How do we get to where the U.K. is?TOPOL: Well, we have to dedicate resources like they have, put tens of billions of pounds into this A.I. implementation. We haven't done that. I hope we will because this is -- double down on this, it's going to be a great investment for saving costs in the future.But more importantly I think is the care. We've lost the care. It's eroded because of the business of healthcare.MCDOWELL: And you're saying that the care in the socialized medical system in Britain is better than ours. The outcomes are better than ours?TOPOL: That's been shown by the Commonwealth Fund which is a U.S. based --BARTIROMO: I find that so hard to believe.TOPOL: I thought I was too. When I when there to do this review, I had the same impression that it was going to be a very different look. In fact, the NHS is the most revered institution in the U.K., above the royal family and the BBC. And in the Commonwealth Fund, which is U.S.-based, it ranked U.K. first and out of 17 countries, you the U.S. 17th. That's a U.S. neutral, very in depth review. o it isn't what it seems.MCDOWELL: In outcomes across all diseases and medical conditions?TOPOL: That's right. In fact, the U.S. is worse, I think you know, for not only life expectancy, infant mortality, childhood mortality, material morality. we're the worst of 37 countries. We've got to do better.BARTIROMO: This California hospital is facing backslash after the robotic telemedicine device told a family that their loved one is dying. The machine displayed the video of a remote doctor who gave the family information about the appropriate amount of morphine to ease the patient's suffering. Is this what we're talking about?TOPOL: This is pathetic, lack of care.BARTIROMO: Totally pathetic.TOPOL: And it's not a robot. It's a human doctor who is saying to a person you're going to die. This is not the way to convey news, on a video. So this thing about the robot, there's nothing about that. That's not A.I.BARTIROMO: So you're saying A.I. In the U.K. is superior to the U.S., not the healthcare system in terms of insurance, because we've got umpteen stories of those people who waited forever to get in, to get a procedure done, it was all done by bureaucrats. But you're saying the A.I. input is superior, not necessarily the system and the way it works.TOPOL: The outcomes are and we're talking about one-third of the cost. Instead of $11,000 per person, $13,000 in the U.S., we're talking about $4,000 in the U.K. per person in healthcare. Some of the outcomes across the board are better -- not just A.I.BARTIROMO: All right. Eric -- great to have you on the program.TOPOL: Great to be with you.BARTIROMO: Thanks for the info.Eric Topol joining us there.Coming up, Britain's crucial vote, Prime Minister Theresa May's plan to leave the E.U.

Luxury automaker unveils a small scale car but not a small price tag. We've got it for you.But first, our top story this half an hour, Britain's exit from the European Union, Prime Minister Theresa May just left Downing Street minutes ago. There she is leaving her office. Lawmakers are set to vote today on her withdrawal deal nearly two months after it suffered the largest ever commons defeat. This as Theresa May says she has secured last minute concessions ahead of the vote.Joining us right now, Fox Business reporter Ashley Webster who's been in London following this for several months now. Ashley, good morning to you.ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Groundhog Day. Good morning to you Maria and everyone here. Listen, did you see that the prime minister wasn't exactly smiling as she was getting into her car outside number 10. Last night, there was euphoria. She gone to Strasbourg, spoken with the new leaders. We have concessions, this is the deal that can get through, and then about 10 minutes ago the U.K. attorney general Geoffrey Cox basically looked at the document, the new concessions and said, legal risk remains unchanged of the U.K. being trapped or stuck in that Northern Ireland backstop, in other words nothing is really changed from the vote that they took on this plan back in January that was defeated by 230 votes.So, things have changed a little bit. I do not believe she can get this plan through today. There's going to be a vote 07:00 p.m., U.K. time on this deal and I don't think it's going to go through, based on what the attorney general has said.BARTIROMO: Wow, people want a resolution, they want another resolution.WEBSTER: They do. And you know, we were just saying, there is tremendous --BARTIROMO: And then it will never go through, right?WEBSTER: Well, if it gets knocked down tonight, which it probably will, I think based on this legal opinion, that the next thing will be a vote tomorrow on a no deal. That will be defeated because 77 percent of M.P. voted to remain in the E.U. anyway. They have no desire to drop out of the E.U. with no deal.So, that means date on Thursday they'll have a vote on a delay of article 50, the Brexit deadline of March 29th. And that could indeed go through. So, how long will the delay be? Who knows? Three months, six months? But the problem with that is that during that period of time you can expect an even softer Brexit than what Theresa May is offering now.ARTHUR BROOKS, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE: Ashley, what does it mean for her government? What does it mean for Theresa May --WEBSTER: It's not good at all. She has been -- this is -- this has been her entire premiership has been dealing with this. So it will be three years in June since this vote was taken. And if she can't get this across the line, I think her time in number 10 is up, t be honest with you.She said she was going to quit before the next general election next year. But if she can't get this through and we're left in chaos, she could very well see a general election called and I think she may be out.LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA RESEARCH: Well, if they do ask for an extension, how is the E.U. going to respond? Because you saw Jean- Claude Juncker say, like, you're not going to have a lot of options out of this.WEBSTER: Right, but they've said this is it, you're not getting another deal. And that's a good question, all 27 E.U. countries have to agree to the extension, I can't see them not. But then the question becomes what can you achieve in the next three or six months that you couldn't achieve in the last three years?So, you know, it just leaves the uncertainty. If you watched Sterling last night, in a 22 month high against the E.U. as their announcement came from Strasbourg 10 minutes ago, immediately dropped and is now down considerably against the Euro and the U.S. dollar because it's clear that this deal is not going to happen.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Can I pivot back to the conversation we were having about the British healthcare system. This notion that it's some sort of gold standard on the world stage. Because I know that you would disagree with that.BROOKS: Yes, I know I would. I mean, --BARTIROMO: We were all shocked at what he was saying. I was like, how is this possible?MCDOWELL: The mortality rates in the United States are higher than comparable countries in across a number of different causes of death. I will (INAUDIBLE)WEBSTER: I lived with the NHS for a long time. And I was saying, my experience was good. But I lived next to a hospital that was very highly rated. I was an accident prone kid. I was in and out all the time with broken collar bones and God knows what. And it was very, very good.MCDOWELL: But, what about the cost of it?BROOKS: Well, the cost is overwhelming. And it's basically, there's danger that it's going to be a central factor in cratering the British economy in the next 10 years. I mean, it's just the cost per patient is enormous.WEBSTER: It is.BROOKS: Not to mention the fact that the U.S. system, the fact we have bad outcomes on average is driven by the bottom 25 percent of the population which is where we needed to take care of things that we've been trying to deal with. So the idea that --MCDOWELL: We're talking about smoking, opioids, obesity.BROOKS: Type two diabetes.WEBSTER: It's not free. NHS is not free. It comes out under your -- on your paycheck, you'll see national insurance. Everyone pays for it. You just don't get a bill when you go to the hospital.BROOKS: Right.WEBSTER: It's just, they treat you, you go home, there's no bill. But you do pay for it. Everybody pays for it through their salary.MCDOWELL: And it's a much smaller country in terms of the attempted application about which is fully socialized medicine indeed.WEBSTER: Right. Anyone who can afford private insurance in the U.K., gets private insurance.BARTIROMO: Righ. Well, they were all in in Obamacare.WEBSTER: Right.BROOKS: But the idea that we could scale that to a country of 330 million people, it's just insane.WEBSTER: Absolutely.MCDOWELL: So, it's all about the economy and Britain and so. That's a looming tsunami that Theresa May will have to deal with or one of the next prime minister or the one after that.WEBSTER: I mean, God bless her. She stood up very well with arrows raining down on her every day. But I think time is ticking and I think she could be out in the near future.BARTIROMO: Wow, what does that mean? Like in days?WEBSTER: General election, could we have a Jeremy Corbin prime minister? God, I hope not. But I don't think so. I don't think Corbin has a lot of support. He certainly in the labor party, maybe, but I don't know. There's a lot of uncertainty which is hurting the economy, hurting business, and it's continuing.MCDOWELL: And the rise of anti-Semitism in that party are hurting labor as well.WEBSTER: It's awful. Awful. People are bailing out of that party.BARTIROMO: It's incredible the level of anti-Semitism, the level of anti- Americanism as well.WEBSTER: Oh, yes.BROOKS: We'll watch that space by the way, if you want to see what can happen on the American left, watch what's happening on the British left.WEBSTER: Absolutely. There's a lot of parallels right now.MCDOWELL: But what would that be?BROOKS: Well, I mean, when you see people saying overtly anti-Semitic things, whether they're anti-Semitics or not, I mean there's no reason to charge people of that. But if they're saying anti-Semitic things, this is originating in leftist parties all around the world. We have to take and to keep an eye on this. This is the way that the worldwide left is moving and we see it actually taking over a party in Great Britain. Maybe this is something we should pay attention to in the United States as well.MCDOWELL: And what you've seen here with Nancy Pelosi kind of dismissing Omar's comments (INAUDIBLE)BARTIROMO: Why can't she denounce Omar?MCDOWELL: And I've said this, that trivializes and ultimately normalizes a hatred bigotry that lead not that long ago to the murder of six million Jews.BARTIROMO: Yes, you're right.MCDOWELL: So, again, you have to be very careful because silence is accepting the unacceptable and making excuses for what are clearly anti- Semitic remarks is really beyond the pale.BARTIROMO: Yes, it really is. And why is she still on the Foreign Affairs Committee?MCDOWELL: Right.BARTIROMO: If she cannot be fair to Israel and the Jews, she needs to step off. But Nancy Pelosi refuses to do this. It's an incredible story.MCDOWELL: She doesn't understand and just doesn't know how to express herself well. Well, you know what, there were some anti-Semitic tropes she was putting out in Twitter back in 2012.BARTIROMO: Yes, exactly. Ashley, thank you.WEBSTER: My pleasure.BARTIROMO: Ashley Webster.Coming up, keeping your kids safe, care.com, overhauling the vetting of babysitters after an alarming investigation, the caregiver controversy coming up.And then, Bugatti's new ride. The automaker unveiling a car for kids, but it has a real expensive price tag, more adult than that. We will tell you all about it. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The U.S. is pulling all of its staff from its embassy in Venezuela. Cheryl Casone with the details now in headlines, Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Maria, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted last night about this. He said the U.S. will withdraw all remaining personnel from at U.S. Embassy V.E. this week. This decision reflecting the deteriorating situation in Venezuela as well as the conclusion that the presidents of U.S. Diplomatic staff at the embassy has become a constraint on U.S. policy.Now, as the country's crisis continues, opposition leader Juan Guaido was on "TRISH REGAN PRIMETIME". He said he will seek foreign military help.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JUAN GUAIDO, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL ASSEMBLY OF VENEZUELA (through translator): It is part of article 187 of our national constitution, which is not only for Venezuela, but it allows for an outside country to cooperate or to assist the Venezuela in this sense, as we -- as stated in this article of our constitution, which empowers me as the person-in-charge to employ whatever measures are necessary to enact this cooperation and this assistance for Venezuela.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Well, socialist President Nicolas Maduro maintains support right now from Russia, China, and Cuba.All right, care.com unveiling new policies to improve its vetting system and background checks after a Wall Street Journal investigation. Care.com says it's going to also take steps to remove fake day-care center listings. This is the country's largest marketplace for baby-sitters and other caregivers, 32 million members. The Journal investigation showed that the company's limited vetting of caregivers on its site well, frankly, was a problem.OK, here is this, a magical new mobile game from the creators of Pokemon Go, it is Harry Potter: Wizards Unite. It lets players interact with monsters and rival wizards using augmented reality. This is very similar to Pokemon Go, which generated over $2 billion in revenue since it launched in 2016. Harry Potter: Wizards Unite is set to come out later this year. Harry Potter will never go away.Then there is this, the famous Bugatti baby is being reborn. The French car maker is giving the car a modern makeover for its 110th birthday. The limited edition Baby II, it is mainly for kids, yes, it is much smaller than the original. Top speed, 12 miles per hour in child mode. All electric vehicle, Maria, $34,000. Because what child doesn't need their own Bugatti? Every child in America needs a Bugatti.BARTIROMO: Oh, my God. That is crazy.CASONE: Jesus, I don't think I could afford that.BARTIROMO: Thank you, Cheryl.BROOKS: Maria, I don't know. Maria, when -- you know, I'm so against socialism. I'm so against it, but when I see the baby Bugatti, I'm thinking maybe socialism.BARTIROMO: That's funny.MCDOWELL: $34,000 is a bargain though. Because a real Bugatti is deep in the seven figures if you can ever get one. So, you can't even get -- even if you had the coin, it's hard to get one.BARTIROMO: But you don't really want your 5-year-old driving around in that, right? or 10-year-old.MCDOWELL: Maria, if I dropped some lbs, I could fit into it. You know, it would be a good way to get around New York City maybe.BARTIROMO: You could fit into it right now -- you could fit into it right now.MCDOWELL: Less annoying -- less annoying than a man with a pony tail on a scooter at age 50.BARTIROMO: That's true. Oh God, what a vision.All right, quick break and then more savings than credit card debt, the solutions for a better financial future coming up. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Debt concerns are rising. A new survey from Bankrate finds that 29 percent of Americans have more credit card debt than emergency savings. 39 million Americans have carried credit card debt for at least two years.Joining us rights now is Ramsey Solution's financial expert, author of Everyday Millionaires, Chris Hogan. And I know this is a real important one for you. You're a stickler for debt, Chris.CHRIS HOGAN, FINANCIAL EXPERT, RAMSEY SOLUTION: Well, I really am, Maria, because debt is a thief. It steals from your income. It prevents you from taking care of the people that you love the most but also preparing for your financial future. And so I want Americans to wake up and see debt for what it is. A lot of people see it as a friend but in reality, it's an enemy, it's a preventer of your dreams.BELL: Hi, Chris, Lindsey Bell here. So, what do we do if I've got a heck of a lot of debt and I've got no savings, what do I do with my paycheck? How much of it do I put towards the debt versus savings?HOGAN: That's a great question, Lindsey. I think the first thing is is budgeting. Budgeting allows us to have control over our money. So sit down, understand your income but also understand your expenses.Now, the next step in attacking debt is to list your debt out. Sit down, write it down, list it from smallest to biggest.You see, I want you to attack the little one first because getting out of debt, it's about momentum. It's not about interest rate. So attack the little one while making minimum payments on the others and then you'll really begin to see progress. But as you pay off one debt, take what you were paying there and move it to the next one. It's the called the debt snow ball and I'm telling you, it's helped millions of people get out of debt.MCDOWELL: I look at this increased income, Chris. You always talked about getting a second job but if somebody's got a family and working 45 hours a week, 50 hours a week, not 80, which is what Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said, it's very hard to get a second job. How do you increase your income outside of that?HOGAN: Well, Dagen, I think the first way to increase your income is by budgeting to have control over it. The next step is to attack debt to get the debt out of your life. When you get out of debt, you give yourself a raise.But again, take a look around the house. We all have so much stuff. And Dagen, I know you do. You can sell stuff to make extra money and take that money and send it to our debt. Think of the talents that you have. Maybe you could tutor, maybe you could do some things on the weekend. Jobs are out there and they're available. I just want people to realize, they've got to take control.MCDOWELL: That's selling your stuff though is some Marie Kondo magic. You get --BELL: Really?MCDOWELL: You go through your home and you window everything down to I only need four shirts, I only need X number of pairs of shoes. There are so many places that you can sell things nowadays. It's kind of astonishing. And I'm a real reel person.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: I've sold so much stuff.BARTIROMO: The real reeal.MCDOWELL: Right, I have sold so much stuff. You're right, Chris.HOGAN: No, it will --BARTIROMO: There's also gold, like old gold necklaces. I mean, gold is selling at good prices.MCDOWELL: Jewelry, you'd be surprised. You would be surprised.BROOKS: And by the way, everybody's talking about how when you simplify your life, you get happier. So, maybe you get happier when you're actually getting yourself out of debt, right?MCDOWELL: Look at Chris, he's never not smiling.HOGAN: I'm going to tell you right now, you get out of debt, you're going to be a whole lot happier because you don't have this thief stealing out of your pocket. And so, you will be happier. You'll improve the quality of your life, but you'll also give yourself a raise. So, I want people to get out of debt and build up an emergency fund.BROOKS: Hi Chris, I've got a -- I've got a quick question for you. And I know this is not what you're talking about but I've got to move you to one thing that we're about to talk about on the show which is the national debt and the deficit that we're talking about. You said that debt is a thief, it's a preventer of our dreams, it steals from our children and our future. Look what's going on with the U.S. debt, Chris. I've got to have you weigh in. We're going to want to --BARTIROMO: 22 point --BROOKS: $1.1 trillion in deficit spending in 2020. Are we in your view -- are we -- are we empowering a thief? Are we stealing from our future? What say you?HOGAN: Oh, I think without a doubt, we're out of control in how we view debt. We're looking at it as a tool from a government standpoint and so I want Americans to take back control. Each and every household, take control of your money and then -- you know, the government needs to follow suit. This trillions of dollars of debt, it's not going to go away by itself. We've got to do something different to get a different result.BARTIROMO: All right, give the appropriate as a caller in Washington, Chris. Thank you so much. Good to see you.HOGAN: Thank you all, thank you.BARTIROMO: Chris Hogan. Still ahead, the worldwide web turns 30 years old as Google doodle celebrates, the man who helped create the internet issues a warning. That's next on MORNINGS WITH MARIA, right here, stay with us.Load-Date: March 12, 2019End of Document

Last year, authorities in Beijing and elsewhere launched a crackdown on student Marxist organizations.Alumni and students from Peking and Renmin universities have been detained in the past six months after organizing to support striking workers at a factory in Shenzhen.Footage also reportedly emerged this week of apparently staged confessions by a number of prominent student activists, including Yue Xin and Shen Mengyu, both of whom disappeared late last year.While the full anime has yet to be released, trailers for "The Leader" are noticeably quiet on some of Marxism's central tenets, such as class struggle, and seem more in line with the ideology espoused by Chinese President Xi Jinping.For some young Chinese, the apparent ideological aims of the anime undercut any potential enjoyment."The political element is too obvious," said 19-year-old Yi Shuhan, a liberal arts student at Grinnell College, Utah. "The main theme is the party line. It would be the same as a Japanese anime based on Japan's imperial history, it's just ridiculous."Load-Date: January 26, 2019End of Document

Continue reading Democrats ran influence campaigns in at least three states during the midterm electionsGood evening and happy New Year! To the hundreds of you who signed up of the break, thank you and welcome to The Interface. My goal is to offer you the best daily liveblog of a tumultuous era in technology and government, in convenient newsletter format. If the past few weeks were any indication, we ll have plenty to talk about in 2019.What did you miss over the break? Lots more scrutiny of Facebook, for starters. The New York Times published a fusillade of stories examining the company s historically lax oversight of its data-sharing agreements with third parties; its problematic efforts to aid suicidal users; the political ramifications of its content-moderation regime; and the reluctance of the Federal Trade Commission to weigh in on any of it.To some journalists and critics, this coverage offers a necessary corrective to years of blithe utopianism from the tech press. To others both inside and outside Facebook, but reportedly including Mark Zuckerberg   it feels like overkill. To me, the Times story that resonated the most over the break was the investigation into data-sharing practices   I did a bonus newsletter about it, which you can find here.What else?Facebook s stock price declined so sharply over the past quarter that Zuckerberg stopped selling his shares. Sheryl Sandberg called Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and told him that if he only read some materials that her office would send him, he would change his mind about Facebook being bad for the world. Benioff claimed that the materials never arrived, which seems preposterous.A report commissioned by the Senate Intelligence Committee found that Instagram played a much bigger role in Russia s 2016 information operation than was previously known, and will likely play an even bigger one in 2020. BuzzFeed s analysis of misinformation on Facebook in 2018 found that the top 50 fake posts got only a little less engagement than the top 50 did last year   and more than the top 50 got in 2016.Predictions for social networks this year generally leaned negative. The Guardian asked a range of people about what Zuckerberg s big project for the year should be, and their opinions ranged from  he should probably resign  to  he should definitely resign.  Behold the magnificent self-regard of Anti-Social Media author Siva Vaidhyanathan, who wrote:Zuckerberg could take a two-year sabbatical from Facebook, enroll at the University of Virginia, and finish his bachelor s degree under my direction. That would serve him   and his company and all its users   better than just about anything else he could do.As a serious proposal I find Vaidhyanathan s idea laughable   but I do think it has legs as a sitcom premise.Instagram tested a horizontal feed, causing momentary panic. Amnesty International   or was it Supremely Obvious Magazine   announced that women face serious abuse on Twitter. On YouTube, stars promoted a dubious form of gambling, which was the worst thing they did until a few days later, when they put on blindfolds for the spectacularly ill-conceived Bird Box Challenge.For more links that caught my eye over the break, keep reading. First, though, I want to talk about Reid Hoffman.Project BirminghamThere are two basic ways of thinking about Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election. One is that the misinformation campaign was a historical anomaly enabled by social networks  naivete, which will be prevented from recurring through a combination of additional tech security personnel, artificial intelligence, and government intervention. The other is that the 2016 revealed vulnerabilities in social platforms so fundamental that they cannot effectively be contained   leaving an opening for any interested parties who wish to sway politics.In Project Birmingham, we have compelling evidence for the latter view. A coalition of groups working to support Democrats and progressive causes has been caught employing Russian-style information operations on Facebook. Funded in part by LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman, the operations have now been found to have taken place in Alabama, Texas, and Tennessee. And while no one involved seems to think the operations proved decisive in the 2018 midterm elections, they contribute to a general diminishment of trust in social networks as a platform for honest political discussions.Scott Shane and Alan Blinder described the first set of operations, which were discovered in Alabama, on December 19th:The project s operators created a Facebook page on which they posed as conservative Alabamians, using it to try to divide Republicans and even to endorse a write-in candidate to draw votes from Mr. Moore. It involved a scheme to link the Moore campaign to thousands of Russian accounts that suddenly began following the Republican candidate on Twitter, a development that drew national media attention. We orchestrated an elaborate  false flag  operation that planted the idea that the Moore campaign was amplified on social media by a Russian botnet,  the report says.Who s behind all this? Everyone involved has attempted to distance themselves from the work. The Washington Post has done a heroic job attempting to sort through the various donors, nonprofits, researchers, and cybersecurity firms that are involved. Hoffman said he had no knowledge that the groups he funded were going to use Russian-style tactics, and apologized for his negligence. The firm that most people involved say was responsible for the campaign   the cybersecurity firm New Knowledge   swears it was not.In any case, somebody s lying. (Facebook has suspended five user accounts so far, including that of New Knowledge CEO Jonathon Morgan.)But to underline just one of the points from that Times piece: one strategy here was to have thousands of apparent Russian bots follow Republican candidate Roy Moore, generating media coverage suggesting that Moore was the favored candidate of the Russians   and that Russia might be working to promote his candidacy.It s a head-spinning bit of information warfare   a legitimate false-flag operation. And it was only the start. Organizers also worked to promote a write-in candidacy for another Republican candidate in hopes it would siphon votes away from Moore.And in a separate effort, they created a fake campaign for a  Dry Alabama  attempting to link Moore to the return of Prohibition. In a follow-up piece today, Shane and Blinder talked to one of the latter campaign s organizers:Matt Osborne, a veteran progressive activist who worked on the project, said he hoped that such deceptive tactics would someday be banned from American politics. But in the meantime, he said, he believes that Republicans are using such trickery and that Democrats cannot unilaterally give it up. If you don t do it, you re fighting with one hand tied behind your back,  said Mr. Osborne, a writer and consultant who lives outside Florence, Ala.  You have a moral imperative to do this   to do whatever it takes. Elsewhere, campaigns in Texas and Tennessee worked to undermine Republicans and promote Democrats using misleading pages that attempted to grow audiences around nonpartisan subjects and then flooded them with political content. Here s Tony Romm, Elizabeth Dwoskin, and Craig Timberg:Some of News for Democracy s pages inserted Democratic messages into the feeds of right-leaning voters, according to a review of Facebook s ad archive. News for Democracy ran ads touting Texas Democrat Beto O Rourke on  The Holy Tribune, a Facebook page targeted to evangelicals, the archive shows. Another page called  Sounds like Tennessee  focused on local sports and news, but also ran at least one ad attacking since-elected GOP Sen. Marsha Blackburn. People start to trust the content emanating from the page, because it appeals to their interests, and once there is a certain degree of trust, you can start to pivot by slowly adding in kernels of disinformation or overly-politicized information that lacks context,  said Benjamin T. Decker, research fellow at the Shorenstein Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, who called such tactics an  intentional act of deception,  that mimicked strategies of Russian operatives around the 2016 presidential election.To the extent that any of these efforts had an impact on the 2018 elections, it appears to be small. But it s clear that groups across the political spectrum now believe that these tactics are effective enough to warrant spending significant resources. The tactics are certain to evolve   and the cynicism embodied in Osborne s ends-justify-the-means language suggests this battle will head to some dark new places in 2020.DemocracyFacebook, Google to pay Washington $450,000 to settle lawsuits over political-ad transparencyFacebook will no longer accept political ads in Washington due to disclosure requirements that go beyond what the company currently offers.Inside the Nasty Battle to Stop Amazon From Winning the Pentagon s Cloud ContractNaomi Nix reports on shadowy mudslinging involved in winning a large Pentagon contract these days:Allegations of a corrupt procurement process have been directed at Pentagon officials and company managers, primarily at Amazon.com Inc., the front-runner for the contract, which involves transitioning massive amounts of Defense Department data to a commercially operated cloud system. Microsoft Corp., International Business Machines Corp. and Oracle Corp. are the biggest names jockeying against Amazon, though there s no evidence they are behind the mudslinging.In Project Maven s Wake, the Pentagon Seeks AI Tech TalentZachary Fryer-Biggs reports on soul-searching at the Pentagon in the wake of Google abandoning Project Maven:Inside the Pentagon, Google s withdrawal brought a combination of frustration and distress  even anger   that has percolated ever since, according to five sources familiar with internal discussions on Maven, the military s first big effort to utilize AI in warfare. We have stumbled unprepared into a contest over the strategic narrative,  said an internal Pentagon memo circulated to roughly 50 defense officials on June 28. The memo depicted a department caught flat-footed and newly at risk of alienating experts critical to the military s artificial intelligence development plans.The Histories Of Today s Wars Are Being Written On Facebook And YouTube. But What Happens When They Get Taken Down?Megha Rajagopalan writes about the tension between taking down graphically violent content and preserving evidence of war crimes:The way investigators document human rights abuses is undergoing a fundamental shift. Once researchers depended heavily on diaries, physical records, and interviews with witnesses to atrocities that sometimes took place years after the fact. Now, investigators at international bodies like the United Nations and the ICC are also cataloguing and analyzing millions of photos, posts, and videos from social media in an effort to hold human rights abusers accountable in court, working alongside nongovernmental organizations, researchers, and digital detectives. Holding perpetrators of human rights abuses accountable, researchers say, increasingly depends on access to content posted on social media platforms.But this shift in how war crimes are being investigated comes at the same time that social media companies are facing unprecedented criticism for failing to police their platforms, allowing neo-Nazis and other extremist groups to spread their messages online.India Wants Platforms Like Facebook, Google, WhatsApp, And Twitter To Take Down  Unlawful  Content And Break EncryptionIn the wake of a similar law being passed in Australia, Pranav Dixit reports on a move to break encryption in India:India s government wants to make it mandatory for platforms like Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, and Google to remove content it deems  unlawful  within 24 hours of notice, and create  automated tools  to  proactively identify and remove  such material.It also wants tech companies to build in a way to trace the source of the content, which would require platforms like WhatsApp to break end-to-end encryption.Vietnam: How Facebook is being abused to silence critics in GermanyReporters Without Borders reports that the Vietnamese government is successfully getting posts from an activist removed even though he s based in Germany. Our research shows that the Vietnamese government is apparently using digital space to suppress critical voices outside the country as well,  said RSF Germany s Executive Director Christian Mihr.  Those responsible must end these attacks and respect press freedom. Twitter in China: Authorities crack down one user at a timeGerry Shih reports on Chinese censors going door to door telling people to delete their tweets:In Beijing and other cities across China, prominent Twitter users confirmed in interviews to The Washington Post that authorities are sharply escalating the Twitter crackdown. It suggests a wave of new and more aggressive tactics by state censors and cyber-watchers trying to control the Internet.Twitter is banned in China   as are other non-Chinese sites such as Facebook, YouTube and Instagram. But they are accessed by workarounds such as a virtual private network, or VPN, which is software that bypasses state-imposed firewalls.Censoring China s Internet, for Stability and ProfitSpeaking of Chinese censorship, Li Yuan went inside one of the country s censorship factories:Mr. Li works for Beyondsoft, a Beijing-based tech services company that, among other businesses, takes on the censorship burden for other companies. He works in its office in the city of Chengdu. In the heart of a high-tech industrial area, the space is bright and new enough that it resembles the offices of well-funded start-ups in tech centers like Beijing and Shenzhen. It recently moved to the space because customers complained that its previous office was too cramped to allow employees to do their best work. Missing one beat could cause a serious political mistake,  said Yang Xiao, head of Beyondsoft s internet service business, including content reviewing.LinkedIn Censored A Pro-Democracy Activist s Profile In China But Then Said It Was A MistakeMegha Rajagopalan reports on an unlikely case in which LinkedIn became a political battleground. Fun 2019 goal: get your LinkedIn page banned, but only in China.LinkedIn censored, and then quickly restored, the profile of a New York based Chinese human rights activist on its Chinese platform after a wave of negative publicity.Zhou Fengsuo, one of the founders of a nonprofit organization that aids political prisoners and other vulnerable groups in China, is best known as one of the student leaders of the pro-democracy protests at Beijing s Tiananmen Square in 1989, which ended in a bloody crackdown by the Chinese government. He was forced into exile in the United States over his role in the student movement, which landed himon a most-wanted list in China.How Artificial Intelligence Will Reshape the Global OrderThe debate over the effects of artificial intelligence has been dominated by two themes.

The other is the worry that a new industrial revolution will allow machines to disrupt and replace humans in every or almost every area ofElsewhereFacebook s Lonely Conservative Takes on a Power PositionDeepa Seetharaman profiled Joel Kaplan, perhaps the most influential conservative voice at Facebook:This summer, Mr. Kaplan pushed to partner with right-wing news site The Daily Caller s fact-checking division after conservatives accused Facebook of working only with mainstream publishers, people familiar with the discussions said. Conservative critics argued those publications had a built-in liberal bias.Mr. Kaplan argued that The Daily Caller was accredited by the Poynter Institute, a St. Petersburg, Fla.-based journalism nonprofit that oversees a network of fact-checkers. Other executives, including some in the Washington, D.C. office, argued that the publication printed misinformation. The contentious discussion involved Mr. Zuckerberg, who appeared to side with Mr. Kaplan, and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg. The debate ended in November when The Daily Caller s fact-checking operation lost its accreditation.What Facebook knows about youIna Fried made an effort to round up all the different kinds of data that Facebook collects about its users.Facebook and Consumer PrivacyHere s a newly released market-research survey from Creative Strategies from April 2018, in the midst of the Cambridge Analytica fallout. Among other things, the data suggest that nearly a third of respondents planned to use Facebook less in the future.Why People Go to Instagram for the Comments SectionTaylor Lorenz reports that it s going down in the Instagram comments section:For years, comments on Instagram were secondary to the photo and video posts that make up the app s main feed. But recently, Instagram comment sections have begun to eclipse the photos they sit below.Over the past year and a half, the Instagram account @commentsbycelebs has ballooned to nearly 1 million followers by documenting celebrities  most notable Instagram comments. It has spawned a network of copycat comment accounts, many of which have thousands of followers. Part of the rise in comment culture on Instagram is due to product changes made by the platform. In August 2017, Instagram added threaded comments, making it easier for people to have coherent conversations. And in the spring of 2018, the company instituted an algorithm that surfaced noteworthy comments from celebrities, athletes, influencers, and verified accounts.Brands  waste  millions as extent of Instagram influencer fraud revealedHere s a report that says 11 percent of all engagement on sponsored influencer posts in 2017 came from fake accounts.Google picks up company behind Q&A appGoogle paid  less than $60 million  for a Q&A app I had never heard of, if you wondered whether the going rates for engineers had cooled off at all.LaunchesFacebook Is Developing a Cryptocurrency for WhatsApp Transfers, Sources SaySarah Frier and Julie Verhage had some good new details on Facebook s blockchain division:Facebook Inc. is working on making a cryptocurrency that will let users transfer money on its WhatsApp messaging app, focusing first on the remittances market in India, according to people familiar with the matter.The company is developing a stablecoin   a type of digital currency pegged to the U.S. dollar   to minimize volatility, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing internal plans. Facebook is far from releasing the coin, because it s still working on the strategy, including a plan for custody assets, or regular currencies that would be held to protect the value of the stablecoin, the people said.TikTok s quietly launched  Lite  app has reached over 12 million downloads since AugustHow is TikTok already so bloated it needs a lite version of itself?TakesA New Year s resolution for reporters: Be less technodeterministDaniel Funke tells writers like me to stop blaming tech for everything that goes wrong:It s nearly impossible to determine whether or not a misinformation campaign directly affected an event, so there s the question of accuracy. Second, blaming misinformation for acts of violence takes the burden off other actors, such as government and law enforcement, who have a primary responsibility to protect citizens. Third, it confers more legitimacy upon misinformers whose goal is often to get mainstream news coverage.In 2019, when tech platforms will continue to play an outsized role in the fight over misinformation, we would do well to be less technodeterminist in our reporting.Perspectives: The case for why Big Tech is violating antitrust lawsSally Hubbard, a former assistant attorney general, says US antitrust law should more closely resemble its European counterpart   focused less on price than on competition:The tech giants have  platform privilege    the incentive and ability to prioritize their own goods and services over those of competitors that depend on their platforms. By doing so, they contend they are improving their products and benefiting customers. An entrepreneur can create a superior product or service and still get crushed because Big Tech is controlling the game and playing it, too.This distorted playing field strikes at the heart of the American Dream. And it deprives consumers of the choice, innovation and quality that comes from competition on the merits.Washington must wake up to the abuse of software that killsJosh Rogan says the US government should regulate technologies are used by authoritarians to surveil and control their citizens:Israel-based NSO Group is only one in a growing group of companies that has put powerful spyware tools previously available only to a few governments out on the open market. Its Pegasus software, according to human rights groups and independent investigators, has been used in as many as 45 countries, often by authoritarian leaders to aid the persecution of dissidents, journalists and other innocent civilians.What hasn t been previously reported is that NSO is working with a group of Washington-based consultants and law firms to craft its export and ethics policies, including Beacon Global Strategies, a consulting firm run by former top U.S. intelligence and national security officials. But if recent reports of alleged continued abuse of the software are true, the system NSO and its consultants have devised for preventing abuse is clearly failing.Stop scaremongering about kids spending time on their phonesTom Chivers says we should stop freaking out about kids and screen time:The problem is that, while the headlines are really, really stark, the evidence is really, really weak. Those headlines, which one psychologist I spoke to described as  scaremongering , are based on studies that show small, ambiguous effects; they suggest that social media is the disease, when the research cannot show that it s anything but a symptom; and almost all the studies are weak and badly designed, so even what little they do show we can t take very seriously.PostscriptPerhaps the saddest story over the break was the sudden death of HQ Trivia co-founder and CEO Colin Kroll. Kroll played a vital part in the creation of two social platforms   first Vine, which was acquired by Twitter and is a cultural phenomenon to this day   and later the trivia app HQ, which is one of the only vaguely social apps to have any degree of success in the past few years.

Wendy s told him that the answer was 18 million, but relented after he earned a few million.Well, as of today, Wilkerson s tweet is relegated to the Wendy s trash can of history. Take it away, Hamza Shaban:The most retweeted tweet of all time now belongs to Yusaku Maezawa, a Japanese billionaire behind the e-commerce company Zozotown. His message to the Twitterverse promised 100 winners a chance to win a piece of 100 million Japanese yen, or about $920,800, if they retweeted him.Maezawa said his promotion on Twitter was a show of gratitude after Zozotown sold 10 billion yen worth of merchandise during its New Year s sale.

China and Russia Biggest Cyber Offenders Since 2006, Report ShowsUSNEWS.comFebruary 1, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 U.S. News & World Report All Rights ReservedSection: CIVIC; Best Countries; Vol.; No.Length: 803 wordsByline: Sintia RaduHighlight: A new study attributes more than 200 cyberattacks to the two countries over the past 12 years.BodyAs much as $600 billion is annually lost to cybercrime as attackers are becoming increasingly sophisticated in their approach, adopting new technologies and leveraging black markets and digital currencies. A few countries, however, stand out as the most active sources of attacks in cyberspace. [MORE:10 Countries With the Fastest Internet Speeds]According to a recent report produced by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a think tank based in Washington, 2018 was an active year for cyberattacks, with more than 100 significant incidents occurring in the past year. Looking at publicly available data on cyber-espionage and warfare but excluding cybercrime, the CSIS study reveals that            China and            Russia have been the largest source of attacks in cyberspace since 2006. In December of 2018 alone, four major incidents were reported involving China, while three involved Russia. From 2006 to 2018, China was involved in 108 cyber incidents with losses of more than $1 million each, compromising communications across Europe, conducting cyber-espionage spying on 12 countries and stealing information from hundreds of millions of customers of a U.S. hotel chain, according to the CSIS report. Another study labeled China as the biggest state sponsor of cyberattacks on the West. [MORE:China Expands Its Surveillance Model]Russia has been responsible for 98 major cyber incidents since 2006 with losses of more than $1 million each, the CSIS report said, and is accused of hacking Ukraine's government, NATO operations, the Czech security service and the German Parliament. The CSIS report examined data on China, North Korea, Iran,            India, Russia, the            United Kingdom, the            United States,            Germany,            Australia,            Japan,            South Korea,            Ukraine,            Israel and            France, with the rest of the world listed as a separate category. The study named the rest of the world as the third-worst offender, with 67 incidents. Next in the ranking came Iran with 44 incidents, and North Korea with 38. India was listed as guilty of 16 important cyber incidents from 2006 to 2018, while the U.S. was accused of nine. Just two countries were identified as having not been the source of cyberattacks in the past 12 years: Japan and Australia. "Cyberattacks are a global phenomena and it's only growing," says Kurt Baumgartner, principal security researcher in the Global Research and Analysis Team at Kaspersky Lab. "There are hot spots in the world that both source cyber activity and attract that activity, and (this) is only growing to the point that more and more nations are budgeting offensive cybersecurity operations." [MORE:China Annually Fakes Millions of Social Media Posts]The CSIS report found the "rest of world" category was the victim of no fewer than 165 incidents from 2006 to 2018, while U.S. government agencies, defense and tech companies, and other entities were the target of 117 cyberattacks with losses of more than $1 million each. There have been 35 major cyber incidents targeting India and 34 targeting South Korea. China was attacked 25 times in major cyber incidents from 2006 to 2018, according to the report, including one involving an Indian group hacking Chinese government agencies and research institutions. The United Kingdom also reported 25 important cyberattacks, including one reported in May 2018 that had targeted its electric utility networks since 2017. In Israel, 24 important cyberattacks have occured since 2006, while Ukraine saw 23. Russia was the victim 16 major cyberattacks in the past 12 years, the report said, with that figure including an attack by a state-sponsored Middle Eastern hacking group that targeted a Russian oil company with operations in Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and North America. [MORE:Chileans Most Worried About Internet Privacy]Experts warn that regardless of the type, cyberattacks come at a great cost economically and in public regard. Organizations that expose users to such attacks are more likely to lose their customer's trust, while cyber crimes may also deter those interested in investing in new technologies. "Over the past decade we've seen all sort of cybersecurity challenges and issues and they range anywhere from massive financial crime, sometimes performed on behalf of groups that are known to be sponsored and associated with state-owned groups, to events that affect people's daily lives," says Baumgartner. "It's a huge problem when money is just flushing around because of cybersecurity issues."Sintia Radu covers international affairs and technology for U.S. News & World Report.

Canada approves extradition process for Huawei executivePolitico.comMarch 2, 2019 Saturday 12:18 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 936 wordsByline: soverly@politico.com,  (Steven Overly)Highlight: Canadian officials conducted a 'thorough and diligent review of the evidence' and determined it was sufficient to present the case to a judge for extradition.BodyCanada said Friday it would launch proceedings to extradite a top executive of Chinese telecom giant Huawei to the United States - setting the stage for a lengthy diplomatic dust-up among the three countries and threatening to throw a wrench into U.S.-China trade talks.The Justice Department has accused Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, of violating U.S. sanctions against Iran by deliberately misleading banks about the company's business dealings there. Meng is the daughter of Huawei's founder, Ren Zhengfei.Canadian officials conducted a "thorough and diligent review of the evidence" and determined it was sufficient to present the case to a judge for extradition, the Canadian Justice Department said in a news release. The move does not reflect a judgment that Meng is either guilty or innocent, the government said.The case has stoked tensions among the U.S., Canada and China since Meng was arrested in December during a layover at Vancouver's international airport. The Canadian government's decision to move forward with the extradition process injects new drama into the U.S.-China trade talks at a time when the Trump administration is trying to wrap up negotiations on a deal."We are disappointed that the Minister of Justice has decided to issue an Authority to Proceed in the face of the political nature of the U.S. charges and where the President of the United States has repeatedly stated that he would interfere in Ms. Meng's case if he thought it would assist the U.S negotiations with China over a trade deal," David Martin, who leads Meng's defense team, said in a statement.Martin was referring to President Donald Trump's Feb. 22 suggestion that the Huawei charges could become a bargaining chip in the U.S.-China negotiations, sparking fears among national security hawks in Congress that he could set aside cybersecurity threats to advance his trade agenda. Trump's chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, tried to walk back Trump's comments a day later, though the president's ultimate strategy remains unclear.The South China Morning Post reported last month that a senior adviser to the Chinese Communist Party predicted that the Huawei charges would become part of the trade talks and that Meng would be released in the coming months.Martin also contends the extradition proceedings the Canadian government authorized is rooted in part in charges that would not be considered criminal in Canada - which would violate the country's extradition agreement with the U.S."Our client maintains that she is innocent of any wrongdoing and that the U.S. prosecution and extradition constitutes an abuse of the processes of law," he said.Meng is due back in court on March 6. Justice William Ehrcke of the Supreme Court of British Columbia previously released her on $7.5 million bail and required that she remain in Vancouver, where she owns two multimillion-dollar homes, while her case wends its way through Canadian courts.In late January, the U.S. Justice Department charged Meng and Huawei with deceiving international banks about a Huawei subsidiary's operations in Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions, along with related financial crimes. Huawei itself was also charged with wire fraud and stealing intellectual property from U.S. wireless provider T-Mobile starting in 2012; the company pleaded not guilty to those crimes in a federal court in Seattle on Thursday.The Meng case has put Canadian officials in a precarious spot, given that China is an increasingly important trading partner.As the legal situation has unfolded, the Canadian government has tried to keep a neutral stance. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau fired the country's ambassador to China in January for repeatedly commenting on the case in public, including suggesting that Meng has a strong argument against extradition.Meanwhile, China has been ratcheting up political pressure on Canada. Multiple Canadian citizens have been detained in China since Meng's arrest and senior government officials have demanded her immediate release. Ren, the Huawei founder, told CBS News in a rare interview on Feb. 20 that his daughter's arrest was "politically motivated."At a press briefing Friday in Beijing, a Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman hit at the Trudeau government's credibility, noting that the prime minister faces political peril within Canada over reports his administration pressured government lawyers to drop corruption charges against SNC-Lavalin, a construction company headquartered in his hometown. Some have used the case to question the country's judicial independence and whether the law is evenly applied to foreign and domestic companies."I believe fair-minded people can tell right from wrong," spokesman Lu Kang said. "In fact, it is not only the Chinese and Canadian people, but also people from all around the world that are very interested to see what the Canadian government is going to say about this."Huawei is the world's largest producer of telecommunications equipment and the second-largest maker of smartphones - but U.S. officials have grown increasingly concerned that its technology could be used to spy for the Chinese government.The U.S. has been urging its allies to restrict their use of Huawei technology, especially when building out next-generation 5G networks. Already, countries as varied as Japan, Australia and the U.K. have expressed doubts about the company. In January, Poland arrested a Huawei sales director on espionage charges.Wendy Wu at the South China Morning Post contributed to this report. Article originally published on POLITICO MagazineLoad-Date: March 4, 2019End of Document

Justice William Ehrcke of the Supreme Court of British Columbia previously released her on $7.5 million bail and required that she remain in Vancouver, where she owns two multimillion-dollar homes, while her case wends its way through Canadian courts.In late January, the U.S. Justice Department charged Meng and Huawei with deceiving international banks about a Huawei subsidiary's operations in Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions, along with related financial crimes. Huawei itself was also charged with wire fraud and stealing intellectual property from U.S. wireless provider T-Mobile starting in 2012; the company pleaded not guilty to those crimes in a federal court in Seattle on Thursday.The Meng case has put Canadian officials in a precarious spot, given that China is an increasingly important trading partner.As the legal situation has unfolded, the Canadian government has tried to keep a neutral stance. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau fired the country's ambassador to China in January for repeatedly commenting on the case in public, including suggesting that Meng has a strong argument against extradition.Meanwhile, China has been ratcheting up political pressure on Canada. Multiple Canadian citizens have been detained in China since Meng's arrest and senior government officials have demanded her immediate release. Ren, the Huawei founder, told CBS News in a rare interview on Feb. 20 that his daughter's arrest was "politically motivated."At a press briefing Friday in Beijing, a Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman hit at the Trudeau government's credibility, noting that the prime minister faces political peril within Canada over reports his administration pressured government lawyers to drop corruption charges against SNC-Lavalin, a construction company headquartered in his hometown. Some have used the case to question the country's judicial independence and whether the law is evenly applied to foreign and domestic companies."I believe fair-minded people can tell right from wrong," spokesman Lu Kang said.

Canada approves extradition process for Huawei executivePolitico.comMarch 1, 2019 Friday 9:50 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 936 wordsByline: soverly@politico.com,  (Steven Overly)Highlight: Canadian officials conducted a 'thorough and diligent review of the evidence' and determined it was sufficient to present the case to a judge for extradition.BodyCanada said Friday it would launch proceedings to extradite a top executive of Chinese telecom giant Huawei to the United States - setting the stage for a lengthy diplomatic dust-up among the three countries and threatening to throw a wrench into U.S.-China trade talks.The Justice Department has accused Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, of violating U.S. sanctions against Iran by deliberately misleading banks about the company's business dealings there. Meng is the daughter of Huawei's founder, Ren Zhengfei.Canadian officials conducted a "thorough and diligent review of the evidence" and determined it was sufficient to present the case to a judge for extradition, the Canadian Justice Department said in a news release. The move does not reflect a judgment that Meng is either guilty or innocent, the government said.The case has stoked tensions among the U.S., Canada and China since Meng was arrested in December during a layover at Vancouver's international airport. The Canadian government's decision to move forward with the extradition process injects new drama into the U.S.-China trade talks at a time when the Trump administration is trying to wrap up negotiations on a deal."We are disappointed that the Minister of Justice has decided to issue an Authority to Proceed in the face of the political nature of the U.S. charges and where the President of the United States has repeatedly stated that he would interfere in Ms. Meng's case if he thought it would assist the U.S negotiations with China over a trade deal," David Martin, who leads Meng's defense team, said in a statement.Martin was referring to President Donald Trump's Feb. 22 suggestion that the Huawei charges could become a bargaining chip in the U.S.-China negotiations, sparking fears among national security hawks in Congress that he could set aside cybersecurity threats to advance his trade agenda.

From Venezuela to China: Meet Johanna ArmstrongFergus Falls Daily Journal, MinnMarch 30, 2019 SaturdayCopyright 2019 Fergus Falls Daily Journal, MinnDistributed by Tribune Content AgencySection: ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLength: 593 wordsByline: Staff Reports, Fergus Falls Daily Journal, Minn.BodyMarch 30--     Mar. 30--By Johanna ArmstrongMy name is Johanna Armstrong and I'll be joining The Daily Journal as a daily news reporter and Lifestyle columnist. I was born in Caracas, Venezuela but my family moved to Houston, Texas when I was very young. I lived there for 10 years before moving to Clearwater, Minnesota. I went to Annandale Middle School, St. John's Preparatory School, and double-majored in Media and Cultural Studies and Chinese Language and Culture at Macalester College. I wrote for the St. Cloud Times as a monthly opinion columnist while I was in high school, and in college I did an internship with NBC News in Beijing during the 18th National Congress.After college, I became a sixth-grade teacher in ISD 742 for a year before I started graduate school with Concordia University Irvine studying International Studies with a focus on education. I then spent three years teaching fourth grade in Shanghai, China. Although I loved my experiences as a teacher, I really wanted to get back to my lifelong passion of writing and journalism and enrolled in the Syracuse University Newhouse School of Public Communication to study Innovative Journalism.In 2012, I started a website that followed the video game industry in China. At the time, it was a highly insulated industry with very little English-language coverage. Video game consoles were banned in Mainland China, and games imported from abroad had to undergo intense vetting by the Chinese government. My site sought to provide reporting on the industry, culture, and community of gaming in China to an English-speaking audience. In addition to news, I also did data-intensive reporting, coverage of events, interviews, and videos.Along with my love for writing, I also enjoy playing with my two corgis, Charlie and Arthur. I got them while living in Shanghai, and they made the trip back to Minnesota with me, including a layover at a doggy hotel in Amsterdam. They've adjusted well to living in America, and look forward to making new friends and exploring new places here in Fergus Falls.In addition to video games, I also enjoy reading and film. At Macalester, I learned to have a critical eye and analytical mind about media, so I enjoy watching sci-fi and horror films--two genres that I think do an amazing job of reflecting the inner thoughts and fears of contemporary culture and society and exploring the ramifications and representations of that fear. Sci-fi and horror are two avenues writers can use to safely explore sensitive topics in the news, in our history, and in our personal lives through the use of allegory and analogy.I really enjoy deep-dives and critical analysis of media, industries, and communities, and, considering my experience as an educator, I really enjoy teaching people new things about topics they might not have considered previously. For instance, why did Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft choose feminine representations for Siri, Alexa, and Cortana? There are a lot of little details in the things we consume that I think merit exploration and inquiry, and which teach us a little bit more about ourselves.I'm excited to be starting at the Daily Journal and look forward to meeting different community members through both my job and personal hobbies!Johanna Armstrong is The Daily Journal's Lifestyle reporter. Her column appears each Saturday.___ (c)2019 the Fergus Falls Daily Journal (Fergus Falls, Minn.)

US official: UK report confirms warnings of Huawei risksAssociated Press InternationalMarch 28, 2019 Thursday 9:16 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: WASHINGTON DATELINELength: 497 wordsByline: By SUSANNAH GEORGE, Associated PressDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) - A British government report issued Thursday detailing security risks posed by Chinese firm Huawei confirms U.S. government warnings of security risks associated with the telecom giant, according to a U.S. official.The report from a cybersecurity watchdog identified "significant technical issues" in Huawei's engineering and warned there is "only limited assurance" the risk can be managed.The U.S. official said those findings support similar American assessments that concluded Huawei's equipment cannot be "made safe from Chinese influence or disruption." The official spoke on condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to brief the media publicly.Huawei denies that its equipment could be used to facilitate spying and Chinese authorities have accused Washington of exaggerating security concerns to limit competition with Western vendors.Washington is campaigning in Europe and beyond for allies to ban the use of Huawei technology as they develop plans to build new high speed fifth generation, or 5G, mobile networks.The U.S. has experienced significant pushback from allies concerned about remaining competitive in the global race to develop 5G technology. Germany recently announced Huawei would be able to bid on 5G contracts there and the U.S. has issued warnings to Israel that Chinese investment could result in reduced intelligence sharing.The United Kingdom has previously said it believes Huawei's security risks could be managed. Thursday's report authored by British cybersecurity inspectors also said Huawei's plans to address security flaws "could in principle be successful."The U.S. argues Huawei could give the Chinese government backdoor access to snoop on internet users worldwide."Our intelligence community has made it abundantly clear Huawei and ZTE put the security of our communications at risk and it is concerning that allies like Germany are considering relying on their products," said Republican Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado in statement Thursday. "It is my hope all of our allies in Europe and around the globe hear us loud and clear."The U.S. accused ZTE Corp., a major supplier of telecom networks and smartphones based in southern China, of misleading American regulators after it settled charges of violating sanctions against North Korea and Iran. The company was blocked in 2018 from importing American components for seven years.Despite the security flaws identified in the report Thursday, British authorities said they do not believe the defects were a result of "Chinese state interference" and the report did not find that Huawei was giving the Chinese government backdoor access as the U.S. is warning.U.S. officials didn't expect to find dedicated backdoors, instead assessing its more likely the Chinese government would use what appear to be flaws in Huawei's code to gain access, according to the official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The official added that type of access can be just as damaging.Load-Date: March 29, 2019End of Document

Bloomberg Confirms China Inclusion To The Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate IndicesPR NewswireJanuary 31, 2019 Thursday 8:12 AM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 572 wordsDateline: BEIJING, Jan. 31, 2019 BodyPR NewswireBloomberg today confirmed that Chinese RMB-denominated government and policy bank securities will be added to the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index starting April 2019 and phased in over a 20 month period. The inclusion is a result of the completion of several planned operational enhancements that were implemented by the People's Bank of China (PBoC), Ministry of Finance and State Taxation Administration.When fully accounted for in the Global Aggregate Index, local currency Chinese bonds will be the fourth largest currency component following the US dollar, euro and Japanese yen. Using data as of January 24, 2019 the index would include 363 Chinese securities and represent 6.03% of a $54.07 trillion index upon completion of the phase-in."Today's announcement represents an important milestone on China's path towards more open and transparent capital markets, and underscores Bloomberg's long-term commitment to connecting investors to China," said Bloomberg Chairman Peter T. Grauer. "With the upcoming inclusion of China to the Global Aggregate Index, China's bond market presents a growing opportunity for global investors."The PBoC, Ministry of Finance and State Taxation Administration have completed a number of enhancements that were required for inclusion in the Global Aggregate Index in order to increase investor confidence and improve market accessibility. These include the implementation of delivery v. payment settlement, ability to allocate block trades across portfolios, and clarification on tax collection policies."It's a pivotal time in the development of China's markets and inclusion in our Global Aggregate Index is significant for facilitating Chinese market access for global investors," said Steve Berkley, Global Head of Bloomberg Indices. "Our phased approach to inclusion is designed to give investors ample time to prepare for what we believe will be a positive impact on the investment community."In addition to the Global Aggregate Index, Chinese RMB-denominated debt will be eligible for inclusion in the Global Treasury and EM Local Currency Government Indices starting April 2019. Bloomberg will create ex-China versions of the Global Aggregate, Global Treasury and EM Local Currency Government Indices for index users who wish to track benchmarks that exclude China. Bloomberg can also create customized versions of the indices as requested by investors.Bloomberg provides an independent, transparent approach to indexing for customers across the globe.

Huawei Sues the U.S. Government for Unconstitutional Sales Restrictions Imposed by CongressTargeted News ServiceMarch 7, 2019 Thursday 8:00 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 672 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: SHENZHEN, China BodyHuawei Technologies issued the following news:Today, Huawei announced that it has filed a complaint in a U.S. federal court that challenges the constitutionality of Section 889 of the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). Through this action, Huawei seeks a declaratory judgment that the restrictions targeting Huawei are unconstitutional, and a permanent injunction against these restrictions.Guo Ping,Rotating Chairman of Huawei(left five); Dr.Song Liuping,Senior Vice President and the Chief Legal Officer for Huawei(left four); John Suffolk, Senior Vice President and Global Cyber Security &#38; Privacy Officer(GSPO) for Huawei(left three); Glen D. Nager, Partner at Jones Day, Lead Counsel of this action(right two); Dr.Yang Chaobin, President of Huawei's 5G Product Line(right one); Li Dafeng, Executive Member of the Supervisory Board, Director of the ICT Infrastructure Managing Board Office(left one)."The U.S. Congress has repeatedly failed to produce any evidence to support its restrictions on Huawei products. We are compelled to take this legal action as a proper and last resort," Guo Ping, Huawei Rotating Chairman said. "This ban not only is unlawful, but also restricts Huawei from engaging in fair competition, ultimately harming U.S. consumers. We look forward to the court's verdict, and trust that it will benefit both Huawei and the American people."The lawsuit was filed in a U.S. District Court in Plano, Texas. According to the complaint, Section 889 of the 2019 NDAA not only bars all U.S. Government agencies from buying Huawei equipment and services, but also bars them from contracting with or awarding grants or loans to third parties who buy Huawei equipment or services, without any executive or judicial process. This violates the Bill of Attainder Clause and the Due Process Clause. It also violates the Separation-of-Powers principles enshrined in the U.S. Constitution, because Congress is both making the law, and attempting to adjudicate and execute it.Song Liuping, Huawei's Chief Legal Officer, stressed, "Section 889 is based on numerous false, unproven, and untested propositions. Contrary to the statute's premise, Huawei is not owned, controlled, or influenced by the Chinese government. Moreover, Huawei has an excellent security record and program. No contrary evidence has been offered.""At Huawei we are proud that we are the most open, transparent, and scrutinized company in the world," said John Suffolk, Huawei's Global Cyber Security &#38; Privacy Officer. "Huawei's approach to security by design development and deployment sets a high standards bar that few can match."From Huawei's perspective, the NDAA restrictions prevent the company from providing more advanced 5G technologies to U.S. consumers, which will delay the commercial application of 5G, in turn, impeding efforts to improve the performance of 5G networks in the U.S. Beyond this, network users in rural and remote regions of the U.S. will be forced to choose between government funding and high-quality, cost-effective products. This will impede the network upgrade process, thus widening the digital divide. Even worse, the restrictions on Huawei will stifle competition, leaving U.S. consumers paying higher prices for inferior products.Estimates from industry sources show that allowing Huawei to compete would reduce the cost of wireless infrastructure by between 15% and 40%. This would save North America at least US$20 billion over the next four years.Guo Ping added, "If this law is set aside, as it should be, Huawei can bring more advanced technologies to the United States and help it build the best 5G networks. Huawei is willing to address the U.S. Government's security concerns. Lifting the NDAA ban will give the U.S. Government the flexibility it needs to work with Huawei and solve real security issues."Below is the transcript of the conference: https://www.huawei.com/en/press-events/news/2019/3/huawei-sues-the-us-governmentCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6638601 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: March 8, 2019End of Document

INTERVIEW WITH BRIAN KILMEADE OF FOX AND FRIENDSStates News ServiceMarch 14, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 4145 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the U.S. Department of State:InterviewMichael R. PompeoSecretary of StateTreaty RoomWashington, DCMarch 14, 2019QUESTION: So, Mr. Secretary, great to see you.SECRETARY POMPEO: Brian, its great to be with you.QUESTION: Theres, like, four stories that happened on my way here to Washington to interview you, one of which was the testimony this morning in front of a Senate committee where the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Dunford made it clear that indirectly, Google is helping the Chinese military with their technology. This is the same Google that said no to a Pentagon contract back in 2018 and they testified to it today, much to the amazement of many on Capitol Hill. Whats your reaction to that?SECRETARY POMPEO: So I dont have much to add. I know what Chairman Dunford said this morning. Hes got it exactly right for sure. But Ill speak to this more broadly: We need global companies to come to the realization of the threat that China presents. Certainly American companies need to recognize that too. And when theyre working here in the United States, they certainly need to treat the United States at least as good as they treat the Chinese companies with which they interact, and I think thats what Chairman Dunford was getting to this morning.QUESTION: And I think also, keeping on the China topic, yesterday you went out of your way to point out that their human rights record is terrible. You said theyre in a class of their own --SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, a league of their own, yes.QUESTION: -- the way they treat the Muslims, the Uighurs, and everyone in their midst. And they responded saying the U.S. should worry basically about their own human rights record.SECRETARY POMPEO: So I hadnt seen that response, but its both unfortunate and pretty typical of the way they treat their fellow human beings there. This is one of the worst human rights countries that weve seen since the 1930s. The magnitude and the scale of this is truly of a global proportion. Whether its the Uighurs that are in one part of the country or Christians or other religions in other parts of the country, they dont honor that religious diversity, the religious freedom. And I must say Im incredibly proud of how we do it in the how we treat human beings here in the United States. We make mistakes, were imperfect, but theres no nation in the history of civilization that has had the human rights record that we have here today. We should be very proud of it. The Trump administration has continued in that tradition.QUESTION: Theres also a report coming here today that it looks like the President and President Xi, if they are to meet at Mar-a-Lago, its not going to happen until at the earliest mid-April. What could you tell us? I know trade is not your area, but youre very familiar with the magnitude of this event and what it could mean for overall these two superpowers to meet. Whats going on here?SECRETARY POMPEO: So real progress has been made. I think thats absolutely true. I think both leaders want to make sure that weve had enough progress so that the two seniors, President Xi and President Trump, can get together and close out any of the remaining items. I think they should do that. I think they should do it at a time when theyre both comfortable that they can get there. But Ive watched these trade talks progress. Theres real progress thats been made and Im hopeful, whether its the beginning of April, the middle of April, or if it even takes a couple weeks longer, we ought to get this right. These trade relationships matter. Thats why President Trump took them on. And Im very hopeful that the two leaders can come together to get a trade deal that will benefit not only America, but the rest of the world as well.QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, some have speculated and were Im on the outside that seeing you and the President walk away in Hanoi made them worry that they could come all the way out to Florida or Washington and walk away with nothing, which would be an embarrassment to the Chinese.SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, I dont know if thats true or not.QUESTION: What do you think?SECRETARY POMPEO: I can tell you from the experience in Hanoi the President was doing the right thing for the American people. He had Americas security, Americans interest at the core of his decision-making process. And so when a deal was presented that didnt make sense for America or, frankly, for our South Korean and Japanese partners, he walked away from it and made the decision not to take that deal. Im sure the rest of the world observed that and recognizes the seriousness with which President Trump takes protecting Americans.QUESTION: Because of the time change, we were on live, and next thing you know, youre on stage and its early and the itinerarys blown up. And Im watching you on stage. You do a great job keeping a poker face, but as the President spoke and talked about the deal you werent going to have, do you feel personally that you let him down?SECRETARY POMPEO: I dont. I think we made real progress even in Hanoi, even in a place where we didnt reach the final resolution of what weve been asking for all along. We didnt get an agreement for the full and final denuclearization in a verified way, but I think we made progress. In the weeks in the run-up, we learned a lot about the North Koreans position. In the days afterwards, I think weve learned a little bit more still. This is a long process. The Presidents always said if we can keep missiles from flying and keep nuclear tests from happening, thats a good first start. We know what the final objective is.QUESTION: And do you feel as though riding back on that plane, did you say to yourself, What is everyone going to say about this?SECRETARY POMPEO: I dont spend a lot of time worrying about what others say. Theyll critique. Theyll have their own views. Im confident that President Trump and our administration got this one right.QUESTION: Middlebury Institute has gotten everybodys attention, featured on various shows, for what theyve been able to reveal from satellite photos about the development of rockets and what the North Koreans were doing and not doing. And according to Jeff Lewis, they had indications even before Hanoi that they were beginning to rebuild some launching sites and testing engine sites. If that is indeed true, did that play into the fact that you felt as though perhaps the North Koreans werent serious about a deal and were playing delay of game? Did you have that same information?SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, Brian, I dont want to talk about the intelligence that we had, but I think the American people know we knew precisely what was going on inside of North Korea, not just at those sites youve referred to, but other places as well. We know whats been happening, saw the UN report talking about the fact that there are violations of the UN Security Council resolutions taking place. We went in there with full knowledge and eyes wide open. The Presidents decision, though, to take the offer, which was one part of their nuclear effort, the facility at Yongbyon, which would have left missiles and warheads and other elements where they could still enrich uranium all of those things were still going to be there. And in exchange for that, they asked for the near-total elimination of all the sanctions. That just wasnt something that made much sense and the President communicated that.QUESTION: And the fact is since that time, theres more indications theyre about to set up some rockets. If something like that happens, what would that do to relations? What other arrow do you have in your quiver to send a message that would maybe bring us back to where you were when you took over?SECRETARY POMPEO: Boy, I think were in a better place than when we took over, so I dont frankly want to go back to where we were.QUESTION: But what if the rockets go off? What if a missile goes over Japan again?SECRETARY POMPEO: I dont want to I dont want to forecast what we will do or what we might not do in the event that that happened. That would be most unfortunate and I think Chairman Kim understands that. He told President Trump in Hanoi that he wouldnt go back to that. He wouldnt go back to firing at firing rockets and missiles or conducting nuclear tests. We hope hell stay to his word.QUESTION: We also know that the Russians are cheating this video of them offloading cargo to a North Korean ship. So theyre breaking the sanctions. How can you get the message across to the North Koreans if the Chinese and Russians are ignoring the sanctions to a degree?SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah. So there are absolutely sanctions violations and we are absolutely determined to stop as many of them as we can.QUESTION: Have you expressed it?SECRETARY POMPEO: Oh my goodness, yes. Now, the Chinese know this, the Russians know this. Weve shared the things we know about the violations. I will say this: We have the best sanctions enforcement, even the Chinese and the Russians, that weve had at any time in the history of this problem set. Its been a global effort. These UN Security Council resolutions were voted on by every country. So while were not perfect and these sanctions arent being perfectly enforced, were in pretty good shape and were going to redouble our efforts.QUESTION: All I have to do is go on social media and I saw your message to the Venezuelan people and basically saying hey, I got your back, I understand what youre going through and be patient. How much more garbage do they have to eat before America gets more directly involved?SECRETARY POMPEO: Boy, it is Im pausing only because when I think about how bad it is today and what I know its going to be like tomorrow and the day after that, its going to get worse. The Maduro regime is truly evil, denying food to the hungry, denying medicine to the sick. Weve delivered the American people have been so generous 200 metric tons of food on their borders they wont let in. We are continuing to take efforts. We had our team land back in the United States just a few hours ago to get them safely out of Venezuela. Were committed to this effort. I dont want to forecast what the President may do, but hes been very clear that were considering every tool in the American arsenal to achieve victory for Venezuelan democracy and to get Maduro to leave.QUESTION: Have we put troops into Colombia ready to act, should they need to be need to act?SECRETARY POMPEO: Its a fine question and Ill let the Department of Defense talk about the movements of their soldiers.QUESTION: So youre passing the question?SECRETARY POMPEO: I am, yes.QUESTION: In Afghanistan, right now we understand that there is a draft agreement on two key issues: withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan and the Talibans pledge to cut ties with these terror with terror groups, al-Qaida. Can you confirm that?SECRETARY POMPEO: I cant. Theres no deal at this point. We dont have final resolution there. But we are working towards a political reconciliation. Weve been hard at it. Ambassador Khalilzad has been on the ground in Doha for six or eight days, back I think yesterday. Weve made some progress both with the Afghan Government and with the Taliban. We now need them to talk to each other. The Presidents made clear his objective here: He wants to end this endless war, but he wants to do it in a way that we dont increase risk to the United States from terror acts coming from Afghanistan. I believe we can achieve both of those goals.QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, he made clear he wants to get out. Didnt he help didnt he hurt the ambassador in trying to get a peace agreement knowing the objective is to get out?SECRETARY POMPEO: Weve made more progress since that story leaked than we have made in the nine years prior in getting towards reconciliation.QUESTION: Is it true that members of the Taliban Five that we let out of Gitmo not you, but the previous administration let out of Gitmo that are they are part of these peace talks right now, the ones who we exchanged for Bowe Bergdahl, many of which are described as the worst of the worst, many of which described their relationship with both bin Ladin and Mullah Omar? Is that true?SECRETARY POMPEO: Brian, I dont want to answer whos been showing up there. I will say this.QUESTION: Is that acceptable if they are?SECRETARY POMPEO: Ill say this. Weve negotiated with some really bad people. I was in Hanoi talking to a regime that has caused enormous harm to its own people. The State Department doesnt often get to choose exactly who it is. Were trying to achieve good security outcomes for the American people. Sometimes we end up talking to some really bad folks.QUESTION: And they would be okay to stay in that room with as far as youre concerned?SECRETARY POMPEO: If we can deliver security for the American people, well talk to just about anyone.QUESTION: But the Taliban have captured an entire Afghan force company of 50. They killed 70 the week before. Are we dealing from weakness?SECRETARY POMPEO: I dont believe that at all, and neither do the leaders on the ground, including General Miller, whos commanding Resolute Support. I believe were not dealing from weakness. Were not naive. We know precisely who it is were sitting across the table from, whether thats in Korea or Iran or in Afghanistan. We know who these people are and were picking points where America can be more secure.QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, youre a West Point guy. Youre a military guy with CIA experience post-Congress.SECRETARY POMPEO: That was a few years ago.QUESTION: But you have that military training that 99 percent of the country doesnt have, and you served. You know that Pakistan is the problem. You know theyre training, arming, and equipping, and without them the Taliban are vapor. How much longer are we going to put up with this?SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, weve taken actions against Pakistan that no other administration has taken. I do see this. I see this from Ive had friends killed. You have too, Im sure. Lots of New Yorkers were killed when those towers came down. Ive not forgotten the lesson from 9/11. We need Pakistan to do more. They have to stop harboring these terrorists. We saw what happened with India, the conflict that arose there as a result of terrorists that departed from Pakistan. We need the Pakistanis to step up. They need to stop harboring terrorists.QUESTION: You told going back to China for a second, you told the Poles, you told the Germans do not do a deal with Huawei. Its about 5G, its about security. It looks like theyre going through it anyway. What would happen if both of our allies decide to go with a Chinese company to lead the way on 5G? And can you tell the American people why that matters so much?SECRETARY POMPEO: I certainly can. Huawei and Chinese telecommunications equipment in ones network, in a nations network, presents a real risk that the Chinese Government will have access to data that no American wants them to have. And so when you talk about this happening in countries like Poland or Germany or the UK, were very concerned about that not only for American national security, because we have information stored there too, but for the security of their own peoples. We have urged these countries to reconsider those policies. We view this technology as being threatening to their security, and weve told them. If you put this technology in your equipment, it will make it incredibly difficult for the United States to work alongside you in some of these places.QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, theyre not listening because Angela Merkel says well handle our own intelligence, thank you, and they still have that natural gas pipeline coming from Vladimir Putin into their country. The President told them its not a good idea; youve told them its not a good idea. Why are our allies ignoring us?SECRETARY POMPEO: So theres more work to do. Weve made progress on lots of fronts. Weve had some places where we still have work to do, Brian. I agree with you. I wish Nord Stream 2 was something that the Germans would understand presented risk to the German people. While theyre asking America to support them, theyre handing resources and money to the Russians. They ought not to build it. Were using American power everyplace we can to push back against these challenges.QUESTION: Everyones talking about global warming and the threat to this country. When you look at the top five threats to this nation, where do you rank global warming or climate change?SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, I wouldnt put it in the top five.QUESTION: Why?SECRETARY POMPEO: Because I can count to five that get you to things that present more risk to the people I used to represent in Kansas and citizens all across America, whether its the threat that weve talked about today from China, the nuclear proliferation risk that extends from Pakistan, through all those folks who have these weapon systems places like North Korea where they can sell these weapons. I think Im at five already, but I could give you a whole list of threats that I think we can effect change on in a way that will really make a difference for the security of the American people.QUESTION: Before I came in here, it became clear the Republicans have jumped ship and decided to not vote on a vote with a piece of legislation that does not go along with the Presidents need for emergency money at the border. You used to be in Congress. What youre also a Harvard Law guy. So, constitutionally, was the President out of bounds? Do you side with the 59 that voted against the President or do you side with the 41 that voted with him?SECRETARY POMPEO: Count me in the 41.QUESTION: Why?SECRETARY POMPEO: Ive spent a lot of time with my Mexican counterparts. This challenge at our southern border is real. I believe its a crisis. But call it what you will, the challenge of not knowing whos coming in and out of our country and what drugs or people or illicit materials might be coming across our southern border is real and we need to take serious action against it, and the Presidents executive order does just that.QUESTION: Should you do more with the Guatemalan Government Jimmy Morales, who evidently has an affinity for the President, for this country to stop, to stem the tide? A lot most of these guys are coming from places like --SECRETARY POMPEO: That is right. These are mostly not Mexican citizens who are coming across today. Theyre coming out of the Northern Triangle countries, from Honduras and from Guatemala. Were working hard. Were trying to both convince them they have to take this seriously and help them develop the capacity to do so.QUESTION: As I walked in here, for the first time since 2014, if my stats are correct, Israeli the rockets came out of Gaza into Israel. Whats your reaction to that?SECRETARY POMPEO: Boy. I saw the reports as well. Ive not been able to confirm them other than I had an initial report that said that there were two rockets, that they came out of Gaza, and that there werent any injuries. The Israelis have the right to defend themselves. Im confident that they will be able to do that. I regret that the folks in the Gaza Strip probably Hamas, although I suppose we shouldnt speculate fired these rockets and put Israelis at risk. This only presents an increased risk of escalation, something that we hope doesnt happen, but you should know we will support the Israelis right to defend themselves.QUESTION: Do you worry how much the anti-Israeli, anti-Semitic language coming out mostly the Democratic side in Congress hurts long-term the Israeli-American relations?SECRETARY POMPEO: I do. Im worried about it for multiple reasons, not just the relationship between these two democracies, but I worry about it because it undermines where we began today, Brian the protection of the dignity and rights and the religious freedom of every human being. And so when I hear anti-Semitic remarks, it saddens me, and I know it undermines what is the greatest about the United States of America.QUESTION: So I viewed a story on you today. They talked about why is the Secretary of State doing so much traveling in the country, from Iowa to Texas to Kansas. Is he running for president, is he running for Senate? Why? With all the problems we have, why are you traveling --SECRETARY POMPEO: So, Brian, Ive seen these stories. I suppose everybody gets unhappy when I dont go to Marthas Vineyard like my predecessors did. They traveled domestically too. America is our first client, and I wanted to go out to Iowa to talk about China and trade and why it matters. I went to Texas this week to talk about energy and how American innovation and creativity have created enormous wealth for America and increased Americas geostrategic capacity because we now dont have to import as much energy. And Im going back to Kansas next week to talk about entrepreneurship. Im doing this on behalf of America. Im very focused on what Im doing here today.QUESTION: Are you ruling out running for Senate in Kansas?SECRETARY POMPEO: I have. Ive told folks Im not going to do that.QUESTION: Long-term, would I be surprised in 2024 if youre running for President?SECRETARY POMPEO: I dont know if youd be, but my wife would be shocked. (Laughter.)QUESTION: But your classmates probably wouldnt. And lastly, I understand youre making a trip to the Middle East.SECRETARY POMPEO: I am. Next week Ill be headed off to the Middle East.QUESTION: Whats the objective? Where are you going?SECRETARY POMPEO: So threefold set of objectives. Ill be traveling to Kuwait, Ill be traveling to Lebanon, and then Ill be traveling to Israel. In each of those places, a different mission set, but the common thing in each of those places is helping those countries bolster their efforts to push back against the Islamic Republic of Iran.QUESTION: And thats going to be the focus. Iraq and Iran meeting, forging relationships; Iraqs ignoring the sanctions, and Grand Ayatollah Sistani sat down with the president of Iran. It seems like in terms of soft power, diplomatic power, were getting our butts kicked over there. Whats happening?SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, I dont see it that way. America has been a strong supporter of Iraq. We still are working to take down ISIS in their country. I had a conversation with their prime minister just a couple days back. I think were making progress on developing a strong, independent, sovereign Iraq, but there is no doubt Iran has its eyes set on taking control of that country. I dont think thats good for the Iraqi people, I know its not good for the United States of America, and were going to continue to do the CT fight there and stand up an Iraqi Government thats free and less involved with whats going on in Iran.QUESTION: There is a parliament member that says we dont have a diplomatic game right now in Iraq.SECRETARY POMPEO: I disagree fundamentally. I know precisely what the diplomatic game is there, and if the Senate will confirm my ambassador, well step it up even more.QUESTION: That would help. Last question. Your predecessor famously basically admitted that he called the President a moron. You have a much different relationship with him. What does he not get that you get?SECRETARY POMPEO: You mean what does my what did my predecessor not get?QUESTION: Yeah.SECRETARY POMPEO: Ah, got it.QUESTION: What is it that you understand about the President?SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah. Boy, I dont know. My relationship with the President is one thats an effort on my part to execute his vision for Americas foreign policy. Hes the Commander-in-Chief. He provides the direction; I go out every day and work my tail off to try and execute it and implement it for him. We talk just about every day, either in person or on the phone, so that I know what it is hes thinking so that when Im out talking with my foreign counterparts, the world knows Im speaking a message that President Trump wants spoken.QUESTION: How did he win you over? You were originally with somebody else. What is it about President Trump that you said, Im all in?SECRETARY POMPEO: He won and was delivering on behalf of the American people an agenda that far outstripped any other opportunity. I was very proud to accept the offer to be his director of Central Intelligence, or the CIA director. I enjoyed my time there and Im enjoying being the Secretary of State as well.QUESTION: And youve taken a vow not to sleep or relax for at least four years?SECRETARY POMPEO: For a little while.QUESTION: All right. Thanks so much, Mr. Secretary.SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you very much, sir.QUESTION: Congratulations.SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you.(Break.)QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, thanks so much for your time. Thanks for a few minutes before youre off to another visit somewhere.SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you.Load-Date: March 15, 2019End of Document

What The Pros Are Saying After Apple's 'Darkest Day'Benzinga.comJanuary 4, 2019 Friday 5:17 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Accretive Capital LLC d/b/a Benzinga All Rights ReservedLength: 436 wordsByline: Jayson DerrickBodyWedbush's Dan Ives said in a Thursday note Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL)'s "jaw-dropping" guidance revision represents the "darkest day" in the company's history. Here's what some experts are saying as the dust begins to settle. Cramer: Chinese Government Deserves BlameOne of the more overlooked aspects of Apple's performance in China is the fact that the communist government doesn't want its people to buy iPhones and other products, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Thursday. China is supporting local hardware makers like Huawei, which has close ties to the government, he said. Has Apple Priced Itself Out Of China?It's unfair to draw any correlation between Apple's problems in China with the broader trade war between the U.S. and Chinese governments, MSA Capital managing partner Ben Harburg said during Thursday's "Bloomberg Technology" segment. The iPhone maker priced itself out of the Chinese market against cheaper rivals like Huawei, Vivo and Xiamomi, whose phones are "on par if not better" and cost of one-half to one-fourth the price of an iPhone, he said. Can The Street Trust Cook?Apple's attempt to "reassure" investors in November is inconsistent with the "terrible crushing news" the company released Wednesday, Yale School of Management's Jeffrey Sonnenfeld told CNBC Friday.CEO Tim Cook should have been aware in late 2018 of its problems and was likely "drinking the same Kool-Aid as the rest of us," Sonnenfeld said. Cook is an honest person, but was unable to foreshadow "bad news on so many levels," he said. Sonnenfeld named the following as issues with Apple:• Market saturation.• Channel inventory problems.• New iPhone lineups are not selling as well as hoped.• Cupertino no longer offers investors iPhone unit sales data.• Lack of progress in India and other markets.Product recalls in Germany and China stemming from the Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM) dispute.In China, it's clear the typical consumer doesn't rely on an iPhone to the same degree a Western consumer does, Sonnenfeld said. For example, Chinese consumers can use one app, WeChat, to manage many aspects of their lives, from booking dentist appointments to paying bills, he said. Related Links:Pros Talk Apple's Chinese Demand, Product Innovation After Guidance CutRBC's Mahaney: Tech 'Reckoning' Already HappenedPhoto courtesy of Apple. Latest Ratings for AAPLDateFirmActionFromToJan 2019CitigroupMaintainsBuyBuyJan 2019NomuraMaintainsNeutralNeutralJan 2019Canaccord GenuityMaintainsBuyBuyView More Analyst Ratings for AAPL           View the Latest Analyst Ratings© 2019 Benzinga.com.

Good morning, everyone. I'm Maria Bartiromo, Happy Monday. It is Monday, March 11th, your top stories right now just before 6 a.m. on the East Coast.The battle for border funding is on. President Trump will ask Congress for more than $8 billion for the wall as part of his 2020 budget proposal. That budget proposal out this morning. It is set to spark another showdown on Capitol Hill this morning. And then this, grounded China keeping all of its Boeing 737 Max 8 jets on the ground after the deadly Ethiopian Airlines crash yesterday. Boeing, the big company to watch this morning. The stock is down almost nine percent. That is really the story of markets this morning, dragging the down the Dow Industrials right now. We've got a lot on Boeing coming up.The risk of recession, where are we? Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell weighing in on the biggest threats to the U.S. economy in a new interview last night. What he said about global economy and President Trump coming up. And then Tesla doing a U-turn, the company says it will keep more stores open and raise prices. It comes as CEO Elon Musk faces a deadline today to explain why he should not be held in contempt of court over his tweets. MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.All right taking a look at futures this is morning, start of the week, take a look at where we stand. Dow Industrials down 150 points right now. That is our market impact of Boeing, shares down about nine percent. Our top story this hour is the border wall funding showdown. President Trump's budget proposal set to be released this morning. In -- and the president will ask for &8.6 billion of funding of barriers on the southern border. On "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES" I spoke with Wyoming Senator John Barrasso about about what the President decided on that number.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: How does he arrive at $6.8 billion?SEN. JOHN BARRASSO (R-WY), CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC WORKS: Well, you know, he's asked the experts what -- where should we be putting our best efforts and they've come up with 10 specific locations along the border and said these are the spots where if we could put barriers, it would make a fundamental significant difference in protecting the -- in protecting the border. You know, the border is about 2,000 miles and so the President's not asking for the full 2,000 miles, he's saying give us those 10 locations that the experts say are the key locations. That's where he's getting his numbers.(END VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is Texas Congressman and Border Security Caucus Co-Chair, Dr. Brian Babin. Good to see you, Congressman. Thanks so much for joining us.REP. BRIAN BABIN (R), TEXAS: Great to be with you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Lay out the case. I mean no President gets everything that he wants, right? But this is his proposal, largely about the border. How do you see it?BABIN: You know, this case is very easy to lay out. There's a -- there's an absolute disaster happening at the border right now. They are Quarantining 2,000 people because of 276 cases of 276 of mumps, 7,000 illegals across border of last month alone where we're headed to a million to come across by the -- by the end of this year, and we hear Ms. Pelosi saying there's a -- this is manufactured crisis so that we can't suppress the vote and last week they voted to allow illegal aliens so if you don't want illegal aliens voting, you're suppressing the vote. I think, you know, the cat's out of the bag. That -- the democrats don't even make a secret of it anymore. They want millions of illegal aliens to come in, give them the vote and then give them a leg up in every election from here on out.BARTIROMO: Yes,BABIN: And the President is doing exactly the right thing. There's a -- there's an emergency there, 8.6 billion is not way over the top, my goodness. You know, this is national security. He wants to repay what he's taken out of the military construction funds. He's asking for 3.6 billion there.BARTIROMO: Yes.BABIN: I think it's very reasonable, Maria.BARTIROMO: Well, what about the spending in the face of this $22 trillion debt that the country is facing? I know that the discretionary spending is expected to be down, but are there other areas that you can identify that you could cut back in spending while you raise money and raise spending for military purposes.BABIN: Absolutely. We can find plenty of that. There -- there's -- we have so many entitlement programs right now, it is -- it is -- you're talking about suppression, this suppresses the work force. We let millions and millions of people coming here illegally and suppresses the wages, suppresses jobs for Americans. This will be very easy to find, of course, the democrats are not going to agree with that. They want to continue the domestic spending bends that they're on in the $22 trillion dollar. Natural debt will continue to go upUnfortunately, we had real good opportunity over the last two years to secure this border and we were unable to get the votes. I voted for it every single time, Maria, but unfortunately we didn't have that now.BARTIROMO: Yes.BABIN: But now it's time to what we say -- how we say in Texas, fish or cut bait. We've got to make sure that we secure this border.BARTIROMO: All of the time that you've got to prepare for a potential surge. The Trump administration reportedly preparing for an increasing in crossings at that southern border, predicting 180,000 migrant families will cross the southern border into the U.S. by May, that's according to the Journal, Congressman.BABIN: Oh, absolutely. They're on track to have a million cross by the end of this year. And I've been to that border four times over the last several months to see from San Diego, California, through Southern Arizona, and twice into the southern border of Texas, and it is an absolute disaster down there. And, you know, for the -- for the Democrats to say it's manufactured, you know, you're either ignorant or you are just simply not telling the truth and I think, again, I'm going to say it right out, the -- they -- the Democrats want this to be happening.BARTIROMO: Well, I mean --BABIN: They want illegals coming in.BARTIROMO: -- they keep saying it's manufactured. Is it possible that they could continue ignoring this and tell a complete different story than their colleagues on the right?BABIN: Yes, I think so. You know, it's never been more apparent, Maria, the differences between the parties. I think Americans are -- they're not stupid. They can see the extremist positions --BARTIROMO: Right.BABIN: -- that these Democrats have taken, not just on open borders but the new -- the Green New Deal --BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.BABIN: -- socialism, our medical -- turning our medical industry into a, you know, a single payer and abolishing insurance.BARTIROMO: Right.BABIN: Everything that they have proposed is so far out there that I think the American people are going to -- there's going to be a day of reckoning in 2020.BARTIROMO: All right. We'll be watching. Congressman, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much.BABIN: Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Congressman Brian Babin joining us there. Meanwhile, Tesla reversing course this morning. The automaker announcing that it will keep more stores open and it will also raise prices. Plus, CEO Elon Musk facing a major deadline today. Dagen, good morning to you. What's the story?DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Well, remember, Maria, less than two weeks ago, Elon Musk announced that Tesla was closing it stores and cutting the price of all of its vehicles by six percent. Well, the sound that you're hearing is Tesla slamming on the brakes and throwing this baby in reverse because in a blog post and in an e-mail to employees, Tesla is now planning to raise the price of most of its vehicles by three percent and keep more of its stores open than previously expected.Here's the quote from the blog post, here's part of what they dumped overnight. "Over the past two weeks, we have been closing every -- we have been closely evaluating every single Tesla retail location and we have decided to keep significantly more stores open than previously announced as we continue to evaluate them over the course of several months. As a result of keeping significantly more stores open, Tesla will need to raise vehicle prices by three percent on average."In another words, this is what Elon Musk says in the blog post, "We'll close about half as many stores, but the cost savings are therefore only about, well, half." Here's the good news that prices only go up after March 18th so if you buy now, you get the lower price and there will be no price hike for the base Model 3 which stays at $35,000. Want to point that out. And then all -- of course -- all sales by the way will still be the online. You'll have to go into a store and order the vehicles online like on your phone even.And then today, March 11th, is the deadline for Elon Musk to prove to a federal judge that his tweets that he sent recently did not violate the terms of an October settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We'll see what Tesla has to say about that. But I would not expect any severe punishment if anything is handed down. Maria.BARTIROMO: Well, all right. Thank you, Dagen. Meanwhile, a major story this morning developing around Boeing after another major crash. Boeing's new 737 Max 8 jets have been grounded by several airlines and the Chinese Government. Cheryl Casone with the details in headlines now. Cheryl, welcome back.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, the 7 -- thank you, Maria. You know, the 737 is known as one of the workhorses in the aviation industry. Boeing, though, is now facing intense scrutiny, 157 people including eight Americans were killed yesterday when a 737 Max 8 crashed in Africa. Now it's unclear what caused that plane to go down just six minutes into flight. This is the same Boeing model that went into a nose dive in Indonesia back in October, killed 189 people.You've got China now grounding all 737 Max 8 planes. Ethiopian Airlines, Cayman Airlines also have grounded that aircraft. So far, this is affecting the Dow this morning in the premarket, Boeing in the premarket, as you can see, is down more than nine percent, and that is pressuring the Dow in the premarket this morning.Now, to this Venezuela's massive power outage has turned deadly. Opposition leader Juan Guaido says at least 17 people have died as hospitals are struggling to assist patients. Telecommunications networks were also wiped out. Experts say the blackout likely occurred because of a fire at high-voltage transmission lines after years of government neglect. Guaido is calling for a State of Emergency there.Well, a Japanese court has rejected a request from Former Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn to attend the company's board meeting tomorrow. There are reports that his attendance could put pressure on Nissan employees. Nissan dismissed Ghosn as its Chairman following his arrest in November. But he stills remain -- he still remains a board member. He was released from jail on $9 million just last week. That was the bail, Maria, so he's out. But still indeed struggling to communicate and to get his message out, Maria, as you know.BARTIROMO: Well, if he's still a board member and he's out, why wouldn't he be able to go to the meeting?CASONE: Again, another question mark as to how company has handled this scandal and the Japanese government as well.BARTIROMO: That's right. Cheryl, thank you.CASONE: Uh-hmm.BARTIROMO: All right. We'll take a short break. When we come back, Fed in focus this morning. Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell spoke out last night on the global economy, and the risk of recession in the U.S. What he said about President Trump coming up in that new interview. Then breaking up big tech, presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren reveals her plan to take on Amazon and Google among others. She wants to make them much smaller. That's all coming up right here. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We've got a big program this morning coming up right here. Former speaker of the house, FOX News Contributor and an author Of Trump America, Newt Gingrich is with us this morning. Former Reagan Economic Advisor, Chairman of Laffer Associates, Art Laffer, joining us this morning along with the author of the coming Collapse of China, Gordon Chang, is here. FOX news Senior Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano joining us.And AM 970 Radio Host "Saturday Night Live" Alum Joe Piscopo is here as well. Plus the CEO of Ctrip, Chinese company this morning joining us as well. We got a lot coming up. Do stay with us.Breaking up, big tech is where we kick it off right here with a plan for Massachusetts Senator and Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D), MASSACHUSETTS: The giant tech companies right now are eating up little tiny businesses, startups, and competing unfairly. Look at it this way, someone like Amazon runs a platform, you know, the place where you buy your coffeemaker and get it delivered in 48 hours? And that's great, but in addition to that, they're sucking up all that information about every purchase, every sale, and every one of the other little businesses that are offering their products on Amazon, and when Amazon sees one that's profitable, they say, "Hmm, think we'll go into business against them now that they've got all this extra information.So what I'm saying is we got to break these guys apart. You want to run a platform, that's fine. You don't get to run a whole bunch of the businesses as well.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Senator Warren also singled out Apple, telling The Verge that it either surrender control of the App Store or stop selling app on the App Store. Joining the conversation this morning with more and all of that, the Wall Street Journal Economics Editor, Jon Hilsenrath is here, along with Pollster and the President of maslansky + partners, Lee Carter. Great to see you this morning.LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS: Great to be here.BARTIROMO: Thanks for joining us. And, you know, this is an important topic because we talk a lot about the privacy issues with these companies and that these companies have gotten bigger than they ever have before, but you would like to see competition. Fix the problem and be the solution rather than Elizabeth Warren's big government ideals.JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Well -- but I think what some conservatives and liberals would say is that you might need the government to introduce competition that these guys are becoming so big and so dominant in their markets that the government has to get involved to, you know, to -- as she says, break them up to --BARTIROMO: Maybe.HILSENRATH: -- creak more competition. Now what I found really interesting about this debate is there's bipartisan concern about the way the big tech companies are behaving. That's different than the -- talk about breaking up big banks 10 years ago and it was mostly coming from the left and not the right. Now we have it from the right and the left so they better look out --BARTIROMO: So what's different in terms of the tech companies and the -- and the talk of breakup versus the banks?HILSENRATH: Well, I mean I think one of the things that's different is that the big tech companies, you know, Amazon, Facebook, they dominate their markets so exclusively.BARTIROMO: They really do.HILSENRATH: You know, I think there was -- we have to -- I think there was more competition in the banking space than there is in the tech space.CARTER: Yes.BARTIROMO: Yes, I think you're right.MCDOWELL: One thing government can do is -- and I think that this is coming, that they will stop allowing these very large tech companies to continue to buy up all of these small businesses in niche areas, say -- what Facebook has done is you buy up all of these companies just for talent then you shut them down so you're buying technology and then they control it. Ii think that it -- that sooner rather than later, you will see the government intervene and prevent anymore even small acquisitions by these large tech companies because if you look at, they've turned a blind eye to the growth in these companies through ac acquisition like Instagram and WhatsApp, just with Facebook. And now they're so big and it's kind of dawned on these dingbats down in Washington that these companies have gotten too large. I think that that is something that is going to happen.HILSENRATH: And you see this --BARTIROMO: Well, they all -- they all -- they all have investment arms as well. I mean --CARTER: Exactly.BARTIROMO: -- they have enormous funds that are -- I mean Amazon has an investment arm of the company that it's buying up these small companies --CARTER: That's right.BARTIROMO: -- and investing in.HILSENRATH: And this is what Elizabeth Warren was talking about. Amazon looks at how products are doing on its site and then -- and then goes and gets into those markets that it's watching.CARTER: But it's also --MCDOWELL: But it also give -- to the -- to be clear it gives an avenue to -- small businesses across the country to sell their goods through Amazon so where they wouldn't be able to grow otherwise.CARTER: You know, I think it's a really important fact to look at that, that they can -- they can to grow, but also a lot of the goals of companies now is to get acquired by companies Amazon, and that's, you know, success to a lot of folks. So, I think we have to be careful how we're going to look at this whole thing. The thing I'm worried about is that conservative solutions aren't coming out, the Democrats solutions are coming out and they sound good to a lot of people, "Let's brake this up, let's save the little guy." I mean that's a big narrative on the left and I think that we're going to, on the right, they need to come up with some plans that are going to address these concerns.HILSENRATH: But I think -- I think Dagen points to one where there is possibly some residents which preventing further growth through acquisition from some of these companies.BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm. Well, there's no doubt that they've become more powerful than ever before. And, you're hearing --CARTER: Uh-hmm.BARTIROMO: You're hearing this push back on the right and left. It's interesting to hear conservatives even believe that these companies are too powerful and would like government to step in.MCDOWELL: But if a company -- if --HILSENRATH: It's a total reversal for conservative free-market -- it's a total reversal for free-market conservatives, yes.BARTIROMO: Yes. That's what I'm saying.MCDOWELL: But if a company wants to sell out to a Macey's or an Amazon or whatever and it's your businesses and you founded it, that's my choice, that's my decision, not Elizabeth Warren's.CARTER: That's right.BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm. We've got a developing story with this Ethiopia crash, we're going to bring you the headlines on the screen right there. And, of course, Boeing is the big story as result of the impact from the 737 Jet. We'll talk about that. Coming up, investors are also waiting on a U.S.- China deal. A new report shows the global businesses are souring on President Trump's dealings, why National Security Advisor John Bolton says otherwise, what he told me yesterday coming up. And then going nuts for donuts, here how one tweet jumpstarted a Texas man's donut business and sent sales through the roof. All next. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. U.S.-China trade hanging in the balance. On "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES" yesterday, I spoke with National Security Advisor, Ambassador John Bolton about how enforcement in a deal is critical.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: What is the enforcement action that could be possible here to make sure that Beijing follows up with these promises?JOHN BOLTON, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR: They're going to be more talks next week. Certainly at the highest levels of the government, we're working as hard as we can to pursue the President's agenda here.BARTIROMO: Would -- I mean would you put tariffs back in the place if they -- if they fail to comply?BOLTON: Sure. That would be a -- sure. That would be a possibility, that's one way of doing it, that's one of the options that's out, and that's one of the reasons honestly -- look, I'm a free trader, but one of the reasons the President I think was right in imposing tariffs on China was that it got their attention.BARTIROMO: Right.BOLTON: And I think that's been all to the good.(END VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: Now growing skepticism on the President's trade policies weighing on global businesses. According to a Fidelity International survey, the research finds that 45 percent of Fidelity's analyst believe trade policies are the cause of any business gloom out there. That's up from last year's 13 percent. Joining us right now is Path Trading Partners Chief Market Strategist and intrades.com Head of Research and Principle, Bob Iaccino. Bob, it's good to have you on the program this morning.BOB IACCINO, HEAD OF RESEARCH, INTRADES.COM: And you agree that this China deal is important for markets? You're looking at copper as an indicator of where we are.IACCINO: Yes. As the trade deal sort of became both sides talking positively about it, you saw this run for copper. It was about seven weeks in a row where we were basically straight up and, copper not only being important part of Chinese economy, but it's used as currency when they're really up there with that eight, nine, ten, percent growth, they will actually trade copper as well as trading the currency and other things. So it becomes kind of a canary in the coal mine for how the deal is going.BARTIROMO: Right. Because copper is an economic indicator, goes in everything from making cars to a home to telecom, John.HILSENRATH: So I want to ask you about scenarios. So walk us through what happens in the copper market or any other market for that matter, if the -- if the -- a deal gets done in the next few weeks versus what happens if it -- if it doesn't get done, what's priced in right now?IACCINO: Well, priced in is a deal, that's for sure, I mean where copper has gone over say the last ten weeks, it's been down two over last three but it's been a very strong runoff of Lowe's. The Lowe's came when you saw that sort of -- I don't want to call it a false story, but whatever it was, where the -- supposedly the talks were, and then Larry Kudlow came out and denied that the talks were canceled. That's where copper made its low. So since then, there's been sort of a coordinated effort between the U.S. and China just speak mostly positively about how the trade talks are going, that's when copper took off. So when I see copper kind of slow down, it's almost as if there's radio silence between the two governments.HILSENRATH: How vulnerable are these markets if a deal doesn't get done? Do we see a big selloff or is it just a modest move?IACCINO: You know, what's interesting, the -- to me the geopolitical disaster of no deal has been priced in. So in other words, there's going to be a deal in the markets opinion. The last few days, what we've seen in the S&P for example, is a selloff where -- we had 70 percent of companies who reported guidance last earning season report negative guidance. That wasn't all the companies. But said -- but 99 S&P 500 companies. I think they need to get that deal sooner than later in order for analysts and companies to be about to ratchet their forward guidance back up, and I think that's the fact.BARTIROMO: Let me switch over to the Federal Reserve because Fed Chair Jay Powell was on "60 Minutes" last. He talked about the broader economy. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JAY POWELL, CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL RESERVE: We have high levels of employment, low levels of unemployment, wages are moving up. Consumer confidence aside, business confidence aside, we've seen a bit of a slowing, but I would say the principle risk to our economy now seem to be coming from slower growth in China and Europe, and also risk event such as Brexit.BOB SIMON, CORRESPONDENT, CBS: The overarching question is are we headed to a recession?POWELL: I think growth this year with will be slower than. Last year was the highest growth that we've experienced since financial crisis really in more than 10 years. This year, I expect that growth will continue to be positive and continue to be at a healthy rate.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: And Bob, in addition to the China news, this is the other big question for markets, right? What's going to happen to the economy given the weakness in Europe and the slowdown in China?IACCINO: Yes, I really like Jay Powell and I think what he said is a lot of what you have been saying all morning. He basically said the economy in the U.S. is strong and could be strong we are a china deal and even without. The length of time takes to get the deal I think that his way of commenting on that. We're going to see slower growth but there's going to be growth. U.S. and doing very, very well. The jobs numbers to me were great. Take that headline miss out, everything behind the headline miss was really, really strong. I was really positive about the jobs number.BARTIROMO: Positive. It's 20,000 jobs.IACCINO: Yes, but look at the 12,000 ratchet over the last two months, when you look at the wages, when you looked at labor force participation rate was steady with the unemployment rate dropping. Everything behind that headline number was really good which led me to believe that 20,000 number was more about companies not finding the people they wanted to rather than not wanting to hire.HILSENRATH: We're going to have an important indicator this morning at 8:30 when retail sales data come out. We had a really bad retail sales number out a month ago. What are you expecting to find out today?IACCINO: Well, I think there's going to be big revisions on that retail sales number, you look at the earnings of some of the retail that companies that we've seen. Everyone seem to do better. Not in terms of that holiday sales number, I'm not sure where that came from. I'd be really disappointed if we didn't get revisions of that number in the new release.BARTIROMO: A lot of people questioned it.IACCINO: Right. Yes, it just seemed strange. I mean, you saw a lot of positive comments out of the company outside of Black Friday.MCDOWELL: Kelly asked (INAUDIBLE) last night in that interview, by the way. It was interesting. I'm dying to hear what Jon think -- as we move on, what you thought about that interview because it was unprecedented for him to go out, I think, in a time of great growth and not a crisis and doing an interview on "60 Minutes."HILSENRATH: Maybe it'll send a message to President Trump in that interview, that he's got a voice, too.BARTIROMO: So, in the face of all of this, do you want to put new money to work in this market then? It sounds like you're fairly bullish.IACCINO: Well, it's kind of funny, we're underinvested and we have been all year. And part of that reason is because we don't have a deal. And even -- I think there's going to be a deal, I'm not on -- at the table signing it. So, until that actually happens, I'd rather play catch-up with the market. We buy discounted companies when we buy companies, so I'd rather continue to use that plan. And when we get a deal in place, then we just play catch-up and get some good companies.BARTIROMO: And on commodities?IACCINO: Commodities, yes, we are low on -- we're low on copper, we're low on crude oil. Those are the kind of things we look for. We think that the U.S. economy is enough to at least keep this stable.BARTIROMO: Bob, it's great to have you on the program.IACCINO: It's good to be here. Thank you.BARTIROMO: Thanks so much. Bob Iaccino joining us there. Quick break, and then dangerous selfie, a woman is attacked by a jaguar after crossing over a barrier at the zoo to take a selfie. Unreal. And then, politics at south by southwest, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez making more waves, drawing a huge crowd and a blasting FDR, Reagan, capitalism, and others, all next.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Monday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday, March 11th, your top stories right now 6:35 a.m. on the east coast. Markets are kicking off the week mixed. Take a look at Futures: Dow Industrials getting hit by a huge selloff in Boeing. Dow Industrials down 165 points right now. Futures are indicating the S&P and the NASDAQ will be up at the start of trading.But Boeing is the story certainly set to shave nearly 300 points at the opening of trading, following the Ethiopian Airlines crash, using a Boeing 737. Ethiopian state T.V. this morning is reporting that the black box has been recovered. Plus, Indonesia becoming the latest country to ground Boeing 737 Max 8 jets. China also doing the same.Markets are extending last week's declines, the major indices are all down better than two percent on the week last week, as you can see there. Global markets this morning look like this, the FT-100, the CAC Quarante, and the DAX Index are all higher. FT-100 up about one percent, and the CAC Quarante in Paris up a quarter of a percent. The DAX Index in Germany up 26 points, also a quarter of a percent higher. In Asia overnight, gains across the board. Take a look, best former is in China. Once again, the Shanghai Composite up almost two percent overnight.A big change coming for European travel, Americans will soon be required to register online and pass a fee. What you need to know before booking your next trip. A scary scene in an Arizona zoo, a visitor attacked by a jaguar, after she climbed over the fence to take a selfie. We have the very latest developments coming up this morning. And one doctor gets his wish, CVS is changing the hold music for the first time in 20 years after he complained. Plus, using social media for good, a post about a struggling donut shop in Texas leads to a sellout. The heartwarming story coming up this among.But we begin this half an hour with this, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez blasting capitalism this weekend. The freshman congresswoman appeared at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D), CALIFORNIA: Capitalism isn't -- to me is -- it's an ideology of capital. It means that we seek and prioritize profit and the accumulation of money above all else and we seek it at any human and environmental costs. And to me, that ideology is not sustainable and cannot be redeemed.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: AOC also said that FDR's new deal was racist and that moderate is not a stance. Joining us now is Democratic strategist Jason Nichols. Good to have you on the program, Jason, thanks so much for joining us.JASON NICHOLS, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Thanks, Maria.BARTIROMO: Excuse me. Do you agree with AOC?NICHOLS: I think it's much more complicated than the way she stated it. I think that capitalism and elements of socialism can actually coexist, and I think that's one of the things that people aren't talking about. We have elements of socialism in our society right now from Social Security to Medicare, and these are socialist programs that exist within a capitalist framework. So, I think that her statement is an oversimplification. I think it's an over simplification about FDR as well.We know that though there were elements of the new deal that did not work out very well for African-Americans, he also established what was called the "black cabinet" that had Mary McLeod Bethune, who was a really important figure in African-American history. So I think she needs to actually do a little bit of study, a little bit and tamper it down just a bit.BARTIROMO: You know, it just seems like this is going to be one of the major issues for the 2020 election. Socialism issues versus capitalism. And you know, you can't really sort of tiptoe around what she's saying. She says capitalism cannot be redeemed, so she might be confusing certain things, but she's blasting capitalism. And we have a capitalist society, not a socialist society. So -- I mean, you say she needs to study up here, but can she -- what are -- what are her colleagues going to do who have also endorsed many of her plans going into 2020 up against President Trump who is obviously a capitalist?NICHOLS: Yes. I mean, I think that some of her plans are not necessarily bad, there are some that obviously needs some work. And I think she would actually agree with that. I think the Green New Deal, for example, was something that was put out there, but obviously needs a whole lot of tweaking. I do think, again, what she calls socialism isn't really socialism. If she really understood that, you know, the Nordic model is actually social democracy. That's totally different than Democratic socialism, and that's one of the things that they don't even have an understanding of the term that they're using. But again, having Medicare, having health care for people, having a clean environment, those can exist within a capitalist framework, and I think we also don't have to be scared of socialism.BARTIROMO: No. You're mixing it up. I mean, she's got specific plans. This is a specific plan, Medicare For All that wipes out the private healthcare insurance industry.NICHOLS: Not exactly.BARTIROMO: Green deal, you know, $94 trillion, this is a specific plan, this is not just, oh, we can have some parts of this. You know, so at the end of the day, this are all socialist programs. Lee Carter.CARTER: Yes, I think that, you know, one of the things that is interesting to me about Ocasio-Cortez is that a lot of people are dismissive of her or saying she needs to read up, except underneath all of this, there's a movement, right? And we're seeing -- if you look at the polling right now, Bernie Sanders is right up there with -- the most recent polling is right up there with Joe Biden. Ocasio-Cortez -- her policies are capturing the hearts and minds of a lot of young people, a lot of voters out there. And so, I don't think that we can just be dismissive of them and say she's got to read up or say that they're totally and factually incorrect. I think we have to have alternative. And the strategies that she's using ...MCDOWELL: Well, the alternative is to basically encourage fossil fuel production in this country, of naturals gas and gasoline, because you know what, it's inexpensive, and it helps the poorest of the poor by keeping those costs low and it creates literally millions of jobs in this country. And with natural gas, it has reduced emissions out of power plants in this country. So, that's why we focus on the specifics, Lee.(LAUGHTER)CARTER: Well, I mean, I think what we've seen --BARTIROMO: It's true, though, you can't just say all of this and this broad strokes, and you know, she has the right idea and we have socialism already. These are specific plans that make no sense.CARTER: The -- but what -- really, what we're looking at is like bumper sticker politics. And by the way, that's how a lot of candidates win. And so, if you -- if you come up with terms that sound good, Medicare For All, that's going to be like me, I'm going to be able to go and get the same insurance that my grandmother has, everything is paid for, that sounds fantastic without realizing the implication part.MCDOWELL: And all you need to do is to say Medicare For All is the abolishment of all private insurance in this country. And that's all the people need to hear who are going out to vote. Maybe some other candidate comes up with a plan, but Bernie Sanders and the plan that most of these Democratic candidates have signed on to, it does abolish private insurance in this country, and that's not what Medicare is.CARTER: And it's wildly popular.MCDOWELL: No, it's not.BARTIROMO: How about some honesty.MCDOWELL: It's not. It doesn't poll that way. It polls 20 percentage points, almost 20 percentage points less when you actually tell people that it gets rid of private insurance.BARTIROMO: I mean, they're not giving the specifics, Jason.NICHOLS: It doesn't get rid of private insurance.MCDOWELL: It does, I've read it. I've read it. It absolutely abolishes it.NICHOLS: It doesn't get rid of private insurance. Medicare For All can certainly coexist with private insurance. Look, if you want a nose job or some sort of cosmetic things, you can certainly get -- you use your private insurance, pay your private insurance and get those kinds of things. Done. Medicare For All and private insurance can coexist. This is -- this kind of zeroes something that she's talking about.BARTIROMO: No, I'm saying is if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor, right?NICHOLS: Absolutely.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: That is a joke.MCDOWELL: But I've read the Bernie plan. Maybe somebody else comes along with another plan, but the Bernie Sanders bill that Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, and Kirsten Gillibrand have signed on to, it does make private insurance illegal in this country if it competes with the government plan. And that is chapter and verse. So, that's the way it stands now. And by the way, no insurance pays for plastic surgery, trust me on that, you have to pay out of your pocket.(LAUGHTER)HILSENRATH: Jason, I want to ask you, which way are Democrats going to be going in the 2020 primaries? Are they going to end up with someone very much on the left, or are they going to end up with a more moderate like Joe Biden, what's your prediction?NICHOLS: I think we're going to end up with somebody who is on the left who has strong ideals. I think Joe Biden is going to struggle, actually, if he gets into this thing. They say he's 95 percent in. I think he's going to struggle. He has issues that he -- that go back to the 90s. So, I think we're going to go with somebody on the left.BARTIROMO: So, you say it's going to be a radical, it's going to be somebody with one of these plans?NICHOLS: Somebody with one of these plans, yes, whether that's radical, that's up to interpretation.BARTIROMO: Jason, thank you so much. Jason Nichols. We'll be right back.NICHOLS: Thanks a lot.BARTIROMO: Welcome back new details this morning on Levi Strauss' plans to go public. Cheryl Casone with the details. A lot of interesting IPO's coming.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Really! And this is kicking off the season, think about this. You know, last month, Levi Strauss announced it was going to file their IPO. Now, we're getting some details about. They plan to offer nearly 37 million shares price between 14 and 16 bucks per share. After the offering, class b shareholders are going to hold about 99 percent of voting power. The 145-year-old company intends to list as yes, Levi -- we knew that was coming.All right, visiting Europe getting a little complicated for Americans. U.S. citizens are going to be required to undergo a registration process called the European travel information and authorization system. This will start in 2021. The new E.U. roll applies to 22 countries that includes France, Germany, Italy, and Spain that's going to cost about $8.00 for individuals over the age of 18 and it is e free for those if you're under 18. Travelers also needed e-mail and a debit or credit card to get approved. The authorization will be valid for three years. Doesn't allow multiple entries (INAUDIBLE).OK. And then, there's this -- the jaguar that attacked a woman trying to take a selfie will not be put down. Officials at the Wildlife World Zoo in Arizona are considering extra security after the jaguar clawed a woman's arm when she entered its enclosure -- as in she wasn't supposed to go past barrier and she did it anyway. Onlooker pulled the woman to safety as one distracted with a water bottle. She's going to be OK, and actually, she's already returned to the zoo to apologize for her actions.Then, there is this. This is a kind of a feel-good story about the power of socially media out of Texas. A man's newly opened Texas donut shop was empty. So, his son went to social media and he tweeted: "My dad is sad because no one is coming to his new donut shop," and he posted the donut shop's address. Well that tweet went viral; nearly a quarter million retweets droves the people lined up to try Billy's Donuts -- this was outside of Houston. The father and the son ended up selling out all of their donuts and pastries. It was a good day for the family.BARTIROMO: The power of promotion.CASONE: That's fun right?BARTIROMO: Thanks, Cheryl. Yes, that looks good. Coming up, 50-second career victory for Kyle Busch, plus a fistfight.

Hey, Jared.JARED MAX, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SPORTS REPORTER: Good morning, Maria. Two big wins: Kyle Busch hadn't won a race this year. This weekend outside of Phoenix, the drought ended.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Here comes the candy man. 50-second career cup victory, for Kyle Busch, Toyota -- get out the broom boy.(END VIDEO CLIP)MAX: Kyle Busch, who won Saturday's Xfinity Race yesterday, made it a weekend sweep at the ticket guardian 500, 199 career wins in NASCAR's top three series for Kyle Busch.Drivers Daniels Suarez and Michael McDowell got into a brew ha-ha this weekend. Took a bunch of crew members to separate the two. Suarez was mift over McDowell impeding his fastest lap on qualifier. But all is well, Sunday, they would ride together in a truck during a pregame race ceremony. Kumbaya.36-year-old Italian golfer, Francesco Molinari, played flawless golf, Sunday. He began the final round of the Arnold Palmer five shots back and the reigning British Open championship fired eight under 45-foot putt for final hole here to win it. Good for $1.6 million and then some for Molinari. Phil Mickelson was not a bay hill; he was at TPC Sawgrass.Mickelson tweeted this photo getting ready for the Players Championship along with his long-time business manager and his attorney. And also Sunday, we learned that Tiger Woods, who did not play the Arnold Palmer Invitational because of a strained neck will be playing this week at the Players Championship and that will be teeing off on Thursday. So, good to see Tiger back in the mix.BARTIROMO: Yes.HILSENRATH: Jared, how about this Antonio Brown trade to --MAX: To the Raiders?HILSENRATH: Who won? The Steelers or the Raiders?MAX: The Raiders win definitely and that they get somebody with a real talented wide receiver -- one of the best in the NFL when his head is kind of screwed on straight and he's playing and it's just all about football, not off the field stuff. And then Steelers also pay a lot to get rid of him. So, I think the Raiders are the big winners in this one.MCDOWELL: The Danny Suarez and Michael McDowell fight, that's what NASCAR need is not just fighting but passion. Danny Suarez, here's a quote -- by the way, what a take down and then Michael McDowell all you've got McDowell is tugging on his leg, he's pulling on his leg right there. How weak? You get somebody to hold him down and then you're tugging on his shoe?

Lawyer: Huawei arrest raises political motivation concernsAssociated Press Financial WireMarch 6, 2019 Wednesday 10:33 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 512 wordsByline: By JIM MORRIS and ROB GILLIES, Associated PressDateline: VANCOUVER, British Columbia BodyVANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) - The lawyer for a senior executive of Chinese tech giant Huawei arrested in Canada on a U.S. extradition warrant said Wednesday that comments by President Donald Trump suggest the case against her is politically motivated.Attorney Richard Peck referred to Trump's comments during a brief court appearance by Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou. Canada arrested Meng, the daughter of Huawei's founder, on Dec. 1. She is wanted in the U.S. on fraud charges.The U.S. and China have tried to keep Meng's case separate from their trade dispute, although Trump has said that he would consider intervening in the case if it would help forge a trade deal with Beijing.Peck called the case unique, saying there are "concerns about political characters, motivation, comments by the U.S. president."The lawyer said the case is complex and will take time, and as a result the defense and prosecution have agreed to wait until May 8 to fix a date for an extradition hearing.Peck said abuse of process motions will likely be brought. Meng is suing the Canadian government, its border agency and the national police force, claiming they detained, searched and interrogated her before telling her she was under arrest. She is free on bail in Vancouver and living in one of her two multimillion-dollar homes in the city.Meng's lawyers noted in a statement last week after Canada agreed to let the extradition hearings proceed that Trump "has repeatedly stated that he would interfere in Ms. Meng's case if he thought it would assist the U.S negotiations with China over a trade deal."Her arrest at the Vancouver airport set off a diplomatic furor that has severely strained Canadian relations with China.China detained former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and Canadian entrepreneur Michael Spavor on Dec. 10 in an apparent attempt to pressure Canada to release Meng. Kovrig and Spavor haven't had access to a lawyer since being arrested.A Chinese court also sentenced a Canadian to death in a sudden retrial on allegations of drug trafficking, overturning a 15-year prison term handed down earlier. China is also blocking some imports of the agricultural product canola from Canada in a development that could be related to Meng's case.Huawei is a focus of U.S. security concerns. Washington has pressured other countries to limit use of its technology, warning they could be opening themselves up to surveillance and theft of information.Outside the court, protesters gathered to support Meng while others criticized the Chinese government and called for the release of the two detained Canadians.Kuang Yang burned a small Chinese flag and said through a translator that he opposes the Communist government using the two detained Canadians as "political pawns.""The Chinese government is prosecuting ... the two Canadians as retaliation to Canada, but Canada is just doing its due process to extradite Meng to the U.S. to get a fair trial," he said.___Associated Press writer Jim Morris reported this story in Vancouver and AP writer Rob Gillies reported from Toronto.Load-Date: March 7, 2019End of Document

Stocks start 2019 on back foot after weak Chinese dataAssociated Press InternationalJanuary 2, 2019 Wednesday 11:37 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWS; Financial MarketsLength: 453 wordsByline: By JOE McDONALD, AP Business WriterDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - Stock markets started the new year with a tumble, as disappointing Chinese economic data on Wednesday renewed concerns that a global trade war is weighing on growth.KEEPING SCORE: In Europe, France's CAC 40 fell 1.6 percent to 4,653 and Germany's DAX retreated 0.2 percent to 10,531. Both had opened with losses in excess of 2 percent and 1 percent, respectively. London's FTSE 100 was down 0.9 percent to 6,667. On Wall Street, futures for the Standard & Poor's 500 and for the Dow Jones Industrial Average were both down 1.4 percent.ASIA'S DAY: The Shanghai Composite Index fell 1.2 percent to 2,465.29 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 2.8 percent to 25,130.35. Seoul's Kospi gave up 1.5 percent to 2,010.00 and Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 sank 1.2 percent to 5,557.80. India's Sensex shed 1.2 percent to 35,817.25 and Singapore and Taiwan also declined. Tokyo's markets were closed.CHINESE FACTORIES: A government survey and one by a major business magazine showed Chinese manufacturing weakened in December as global and domestic demand cooled. Forecasters said that could send shockwaves through other economies, particularly in Asia, that supply raw materials and components. Chinese export growth has held up as producers rushed to fill orders before possible new U.S. tariff hikes in Washington's trade battle with Beijing, but forecasters said that effect may be fading.ANALYST'S COMMENT: The Chinese slowdown "raises a few red flags," said Mizuho Bank's Vishnu Varathan in a report. The slide is "potentially symptomatic of far sharper underlying demand pullback," he said.US-CHINA TRADE TALKS: Investors are looking ahead to talks this month aimed at settling a U.S.-Chinese tariff battle that threatens to dampen global economic growth. Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping agreed Dec. 1 to a 90-day suspension of further tariff hikes in their fight over Beijing's technology policy but left in place penalties already imposed. No date has been announced but both sides have expressed interest in a settlement. Economists say the 90-day window is likely too small to resolve the full range of issues that bedevil their relations. Mihir Kapadia, CEO of Sun Global Investments, says the uncertainty in financial markets will "continue until further clarity emerges from the U.S. and China talks."CURRENCY: The dollar declined to 109.16 yen from Monday's 109.67. The euro retreated to $1.1430 from $1.1466.ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude lost 44 cents to $44.97 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract gained 8 cents on Monday. Brent crude, used to price international oils, slumped 55 cents to $53.25 per barrel in London. It added 59 cents the previous session.Load-Date: January 3, 2019End of Document

Trump: Economic Weakness Gives Beijing Incentive To Reach Trade DealThe FrontrunnerJanuary 7, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 Bulletin News Network, Inc.Section: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 677 wordsBodyReuters (1/6, Mason) reports President Trump said Sunday that trade talks with China "were going very well and that weakness in the Chinese economy gave Beijing a reason to work toward a deal." With US officials set to meet their Chinese counterparts in Beijing this week "for the first face-to-face talks since Trump and China's President Xi Jinping in December agreed to a 90-day truce," Trump said, "I think China wants to get it resolved. Their economy's not doing well. I think that gives them a great incentive to negotiate." Asked what he expected to come out of this week's talks, he said, "I really believe they want to make a deal."To the AP (1/6), "Trump is expressing optimism about trade negotiations with China," telling reporters Sunday, "I really believe they want to make a deal. The tariffs have absolutely hurt China very badly." According to the New York Times (1/6, Rappeport, Tankersley, 17.59M), "Chinese officials appear set to offer a mix of concessions, including reducing some tariffs on American goods, as they try to defuse trade tensions ahead of a March 2 deadline, when tariffs on $200 billion worth of imports will increase to 25 percent from 10 percent."Politico (1/6, Palmer, 4.04M), however, reports that "no agreement is expected this week, but the meeting is likely to set the stage for higher level talks next week between delegations led by US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He." The Washington Times (1/6, Boyer, 567K) reports Trump "is likely to hold talks with Chinese Vice President Wang Qishan at the World Economic Forum later this month in Davos, Switzerland."The Wall Street Journal (1/6, Wei, Subscription Publication, 6.23M) reports that China's economy is slowing faster than expected and Chinese officials are acknowledging privately that it is the result of trade tensions with the US.Shelby Calls For Fair Trade With China.Sen. Richard Shelby (R-AL), on Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures (1/6, 1.33M), briefly discussed US trade with China. Shelby said, "Well, we realize trade is a double-edged sword. We need to trade. We need to trade with China. Right now, we have some estrangement there as you well know I'm hoping it'll work out. It should be fair trade. It should be fair to all of us and I think that's the message the President has put out and I think he will bring the Chinese to the negotiating table."Chinese iPhone XR Demand Not Meeting Apple's Hopes.In a front-page article, the Wall Street Journal (1/6, Kubota, Subscription Publication, 6.23M) reports that while Apple hoped its iPhone XR, the cheapest of its three iPhone releases, would sell well in China, the world's largest smartphone market, people familiar with the matter say that demand has been weaker than expected, and the company has had to drastically reduce production of the phone. While analysts say the XR can't yet be called a flop, the sagging sales could upset Apple's strategy of selling premium smartphones at varying prices. Analysts say issues with XR sales in China include that status seekers aren't interested but price-conscious buyers opt for cheaper phones with the XR's touted features, including facial recognition and dual-SIM support.US Officials Warn Health Researchers They May Be Targets Of Chinese Spies.The New York Times (1/6, Pear, 17.59M) reports the Administration has "warned scientists doing biomedical research at American universities that they may be targets of Chinese spies trying to steal and exploit information from their laboratories." Scientists and universities receiving funds from the National Institutes of Health "need to tighten their security procedures and take other precautions, said a panel of experts commissioned by the agency" to investigate "foreign influences on research integrity." NIH Director Dr. Francis S. Collins and FBI Director Wray said that in some cases, "Chinese graduate students or visitors have taken intellectual property from American laboratories and given it to Chinese scientists or arms of the Chinese government."Load-Date: January 7, 2019End of Document

Credit Suisse's China Securities Joint Venture Launches the AES Algorithmic Trading PlatformTargeted News ServiceMarch 28, 2019 Thursday 7:48 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 519 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: ZURICH, Germany BodyCredit Suisse, a financial services provider, issued the following news release:Credit Suisse and its securities joint venture Credit Suisse Founder Securities (CSFS) announced today the launch in China of AES(R) (Advanced Execution Services), its next generation algorithmic trading platform. Through this partnership, CSFS will enable onshore institutional investors as well as Qualified Foreign Intuitional Investors (QFIIs) and RMB Qualified Foreign Intuitional Investors (RQFIIs) to trade China A-shares using the same suite of award winning algorithms on the AES(R) platform as international investors use for trading A-shares via the Stock Connect mutual access scheme."The launch of AES(R) for CSFS demonstrates the unique competitive advantage that we can create together by combining the synergies of Credit Suisse's best-in-class trading technology and CSFS' expertise in the China market. Through this partnership, we are now delivering our global standards in algorithmic trading and risk controls, to our clients trading in the onshore China markets," said Patrick Kelly, Head of Execution Services, Asia Pacific at Credit Suisse, at the 22nd Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference.The AES(R) platform incorporates data science, machine learning technologies and quantitative methods to optimize clients' trading performance. It comprises a comprehensive range of AES(R) algorithmic trading strategies, which can help clients to trade China A-shares efficiently and achieve best execution.The launch of AES algorithmic trading in China A-shares comes as China expedites reform and the opening up of its domestic capital market to international investors. In January 2019, the Chinese government announced it would double the investment quota of the QFII scheme from USD150 billion to USD300 billion. Last month, global index provider MSCI announced plans to quadruple the inclusion factor of A-shares into its global benchmark indices. Credit Suisse estimates there will be an inflow of close to USD50 billion of fresh foreign capital into the A-share market by November 2019."China remains at the heart of our focus in Asia," says Neil Hosie, Head of Equities Asia Pacific at Credit Suisse. "China's journey towards integrating the country's capital market with the international investment community has just begun. As China continues to open up its domestic financial market to allow greater foreign investor participation, traders will require highly sophisticated execution solutions to navigate these liquid markets. With the launch of AES in China, we are now strongly positioned to capture these opportunities for our clients."Credit Suisse owns 33.3% of the joint venture, which was established in 2008. The remainder is held by Founder Securities. CSFS launched its A-share brokerage business in October 2016, and is among the first global banks to operate an onshore brokerage business. CSFS has further expanded its client base by launching a new equity trading service that is tailored to domestic private securities investment funds.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6671667 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: March 29, 2019End of Document

THINKING EQUAL IN CHINA: JIN'S PATH IN DISABILITY RIGHTSStates News ServiceMarch 4, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 876 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the World Bank:Tell us about yourself.I'm an international cooperation editor at China Development Gateway, an online source of development information and tools in China. I'm also a mother to a 4-year-old boy. I was born with a genetic eye disease and lost almost all of my eyesight during my first year of university. After graduation, I received radio training from the One Plus One Beijing Disabled Persons' Organization and became a radio program producer. In 2015, with several other disabled women, I founded the Disability Affected Women Support Group (DAWS).What inspires you to get up in the morning? What drives you?I find lots of stuff interesting to learn and to explore. I subscribe to several WeChat public accounts and podcasts. Some teach English, some talk about different cultures, some share experiences and stories of being a mother or a person with disability. They answer my deeper questions; help me understand the world and myself more. They make clearer to me the kind of person I want to be and make me strive towards it.What set you on this path?The puzzles I encountered make me start to think and explore an answer. For example, what jobs can I as a visually-impaired person do to earn my living, what are my strengths and weaknesses, what games can I play with my son without eyesight, or what is the proper attitude to approach my disability with.What advice do you have for young women who want to take a similar path?Start to read, to communicate with people, to try different things when you feel puzzled about yourself, about your future. This will help you understand yourself more, or even open up a very new world to you.Do you have a favorite quote or saying?My favorite quote or saying varies in different stages of my life. I now love the saying of a WeChat public account that I subscribe to: "Dear, I cannot tell you how you should live your life, but I can tell you a story". Because the stories it shared provide me with a different way of viewing my past, my values and my future. Different people may have different feelings to a same story, but the experiences in it will help shape their value system.What are the biggest issues in China right now and how can they be addressed?I think China needs to continue enhancing international cooperation and integrate more into the world. Although different countries face different challenges, all countries are searching for solutions to common issues, such as poverty and disability. When I was studying in India, many of my classmates had asked me the same question what is China's development experience. I was curious about theirs too. We all found sharing contributed to solving our respective problems. After becoming an international cooperation editor at China Development Gateway, I am more aware of the importance of enhancing exchanges and knowledge sharing to solve the common challenges facing humankind.The Chinese government is implementing a series of policies to reduce rural poverty and revitalize its villages. I think this contributes a lot to one of my main concerns left-behind children, especially those with disabilities, because more and more people can earn a living without leaving their homes.Many organizations, both domestic and international, have also paid attention to this issue, searching for solutions and providing professional services. International cooperation not only brings new ideas and experiences to China, but also takes China's experience to the world. These are valuable assets to all.China also needs to further its efforts in accessibility, such as accessibility of physical facilities and information accessibility. Accessibility not only enables people with disabilities to participate more in society, but also makes life easier for the nondisabled. For example, ramps not only allow wheelchair users access to buildings, but also bring convenience to those who carry prams, luggage, or are riding a bike. However, not everyone understands the importance of accessibility. So advocacy, best practices, specific solutions are needed badly.Where do you see China in 25 years?I think China will link more closely with the world after 25 years. The public will be better educated and care more about public goods. Ideas such as environmental protection and accessibility will become common knowledge. China will become more beautiful, pollution free and comfortable to live in. People with disabilities will participate more in society. There will be more job opportunities in villages, more children will live with their families and receive more social support.What change would you like to see that could bring greater equality in China?I hope more and more people will understand and respect the rights of disability-affected women, i.e. women with disabilities and their female relatives, and give them more support to participate in the society. I hope they can be able to view themselves more positively, receive more professional support and services.If you could use one word to describe women in East Asia Pacific what would it be?Tenacious.--The views expressed in this article do not necessarily represent the views of the World Bank Group and its employees.Load-Date: March 4, 2019End of Document

HONG KONG TRADE UNIONS CALL FOR RELEASE OF JASIC ACTIVISTSStates News ServiceJanuary 18, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 906 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:A trade union body in Hong Kong has called for the release of more than 30 former workers at a factory in neighboring Guangdong province and the Maoist labor activists who were supporting them.The Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions (HKCTU) staged a protest outside the ruling Chinese Communist Party's liaison office in the city on Thursday, demanding the release of 34 people detained for campaigning for a labor union at Jasic Technology's factory in Shenzhen."Support the Jasic Workers - not guilty!" some 30 protesters shouted outside the Central Liaison Office in Hong Kong. "Condemn the shameless detentions!"According to the Jasic Workers' Solidarity Group, a loose coalition of Maoist social activists, many of whom have also been involved in China's #MeToo feminist movement, former Jasic workers Mi Jiuping, Yu Juncong, Liu Penghua, and Li Zhan have been in criminal detention since the initial wave of arrests began in July.Nongovernmental organization (NGO) workers Fu Changguo, Wang Xiaomei and He Xiumei and local trade union activists Zou Liping and Li Ao are also being held on criminal charges in Shenzhen.Dozens more students and recent graduates of China's top universities have been "disappeared" or criminally detained since the nationwide crackdown on the Jasic labor movement made further waves of arrests and detentions in August, September and November, the JWSG reported on its Github page.Among them are Sun Yat-sen University graduate and Jasic movement spokeswoman Shen Mengyu and Peking University #MeToo campaigner Yue Xin.The HKFTU said it is "especially enraged" at the authorities' treatment of Fu Changguo and Zhang Zeying, wife of Li Zhan.Zhang was detained on Jan. 2 for speaking out on social media about her husband's case, and the couple's newborn baby has been taken into state custody, it said.Fu was denied permission to attend his mother's funeral last week, the organization said in a statement on its website."He was arrested merely because he shared news of the Jasic labor struggle on various [social media] groups with his friends and associates," the statement said."Such restrictions are blatant violations of their basic human and legal rights that transgress all humanitarian standards," it said.'People as its enemy'HKFTU leader Lee Cheuk-yan said the body hopes to boost international support for the Jasic detainees."These workers and supporters exercised their basic and internationally recognized freedom of association," Lee said. "Any worker in the world has the right to organize independent trade unions without being subject to any interference or persecution, but the communist regime regards the people as its enemy."Beijing-based activist and political commentator Zha Jianguo agreed, but added that the Communist Party under President Xi Jinping is less and less likely to allow anyone to organize."The Chinese government won't allow anyone to break free of the control of the Chinese Communist Party, not now, and not in the future," Zha said."Any actions that are outside the scope of party control will be suppressed by the Communist Party, and there will be more and more instances of this kind of suppression, without a doubt," he said.Marxist and Maoist activists, many of them students, had flocked to Shenzhen to support the Jasic workers' cause, with some of them taking jobs in the factory.However, dozens of members of the Jasic Workers' Solidarity Group (JWSG) were themselves detained in a mass raid on their temporary accommodation on Aug. 27.The authorities responded with a clampdown on student activism on campus, banning Marxist study groups, and punishing students at Peking University, Renmin University and at universities in Nanjing.In November, a rare protest on the campus of Nanjing University in the eastern province of Jiangsu over the authorities' banning of a Marxist study group sparked beatings by the authorities.A similar fate has befallen the Marxism-Leninism Society at Peking University, while Cornell University recently withdrew from a partnership with Renmin University, citing the punishment of students who had supported the Shenzhen labor movement.No qualms about cracking downWang Dan, a former leader of the 1989 pro-democracy movement on Tiananmen Square, who now heads the Dialogue China think tank in Washington, said the Chinese government has had no qualms about cracking down on anyone using Marxism or Maoism to organize in any way."The Marxist fundamentals that the students believe in emphasize the sacredness of labor and the equality of all people," Wang said in a recent interview with RFA."But ... Marxism has become the theory of using state violence to maintain a one-party dictatorship. This is the Marxism of the Chinese Communist Party under the leadership of Xi Jinping."He said the emergence of a younger generation of politically and socially aware people has worried the government, because of the parallels with the student movements of the 1980s."The younger generation of college students have begun to care about social issues ... which will remind the Chinese authorities of the [protests] that took place 30 years ago," Wang said. "I think that's the main reason behind the crackdown on the students."Reported by Lee Wang-yam for RFA's Cantonese Service, and by Han Jie for the Mandarin Service.

RUBIO: TRUMP MUST HOLD OUT FOR A GOOD DEAL WITH CHINAStates News ServiceFebruary 13, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 365 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Florida Senator Marco Rubio:Trump must hold out for a good deal with ChinaBy Marco RubioAs American officials continue talks with their counterparts in Beijing to end the U.S.-China trade dispute, they should resist the temptation to cut a bad deal. At a minimum, they should strive to achieve the goals that President Trump outlined late last year: meaningful structural changes regarding forced technology transfers, intellectual-property theft, non-tariff barriers and cybersecurity. Bringing balance to America's relationship with the People's Republic of China is the geopolitical challenge of this century. That the United States is now in a position to deliver on the challenge is impressive. The opportunity shouldn't be wasted by focusing on a handful of individual trade matters that do little to address structural imbalances. An improved U.S. trade surplus in soybeans would not be enough. For nearly two decades, the communist Chinese government fooled the world into believing it would eventually embrace international norms. By welcoming China into the World Trade Organization in 2001, the United States and other nations hoped it would truly open its economy and markets to foreign companies and, someday, even allow for political liberalization. The hopes were mistaken. As China rises, seeking to become the dominant global superpower, it is violating the international rules of the past century while moving to write new rules for the new century in its mercantilist and authoritarian image. China has maintained its one-party political system's authoritarian character, including an utter disregard for human rights and the impartial rule of law. An increasingly aggressive Beijing poses a direct threat to U.S. national interests and to the nation's most deeply held values. Until recently, few thought the United States was willing or able to confront China. But in his recent State of the Union address, Trump put the world on notice that America is "now making it clear to China that after years of targeting our industries, and stealing our intellectual property, the theft of American jobs and wealth has come to an end."Load-Date: February 14, 2019End of Document

Fines Google $57M; Ghosn Bail Request Rejected; Global Growth OutlookMORNINGS WITH MARIA MORNINGS WITH MARIA 6:00 AM ESTJanuary 22, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved Section: NEWS; FinancialLength: 7133 wordsByline: Maria Bartiromo, Cheryl Casone, Dagen McDowellGuests: Ray Dalio, Hans Vestberg, Jeff Ubben, Lindsey BellBodyMARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good Tuesday morning from Davos, Switzerland. Hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, January 22nd. Your top stories right now, 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast. Markets back open after the holiday weekend and we are looking at declines to start things off. The shutdown showdown, part of the issue. The Dow Industrials down 145 points this morning, one- half of one percent. The S&P 500 is down 18, and the NASDAQ down 59 points right now.We are now in day 32 of the government shutdown. President Trump holding firm in his position to secure border wall funding. The stalemate Uncertainty preventing him from coming here to the World Economic Forum. He's not alone. Uncertainty across Europe forcing many leaders to stay home. I just got off the stage just a few minutes ago from my panel. We have highlights from that conversation, which we focused on the global economy, particularly China, as well as markets and the dollar all coming up later this hour right here.Then this, Google under fire, the technology giant fined by Europe under its new privacy law. How much it's paying up, coming up. Moments ago, I sat down in a first on FOX Business interview with Bridgewater Associates Founder and Co-Chief Investment Officer, Ray Dalio. We talked about everything from the slowdown in China to education in America. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: You made a lot of important points in fact, about what's going on in China today. Let's start there, because the implications of a slowdown in China and the implications of what China does with all of the debt that it holds of the United States' debt, the bond market have real implications on markets. Give us your assessment.RAY DALIO, FOUNDER AND CO-CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, BRIDGEWATER ASSOCIATES: China is going through two drags on its economy over the short term and that is it's dealing with a deleveraging. Deleveraging's a good thing. In other words, it's controlling and restructuring its debt that slows demand some, that's a factor. And then, the other short-term negative is the conflict with the United States, particularly as it pertains to debt. It went from a bit of a bubble to this particular adjustment.Longer term, it's making big reforms. It's continued to make dramatic reforms in ways that have over the last 40 years have raised its living standards by 20 percent, 20 times. And so, if you look at the longer-term productivity movements, very, very good, opening it up. So I think that people have got to realize it's going to be a negative of all things on growth. Europe has a negative growth. And the United States is going to have a negative growth environment. I don't mean absolute negative. I mean slowing of growth in a material way that could be close to between zero and two percent over the next 18 months.So, we are going to be in a slower growth environment and then of course that affects capital flows. In terms of then the issue that we have capital flows, we have to remember that the other side of the trade deficit is a capital deficit. In other words, they -- we bought -- they bought our goods and then at the same time they lent us a lot of money.And I think we should always be mindful that capital issues, capital flows have a very big effect on the world and the economy, because they can change things a lot.And so, I'm not saying that the Chinese are going to react by changing that but I do think they will change the mixes of their assets that they're holding. And I think that has implications. I think it particularly has implications as we're going for the next year or two or three when we have to sell a lot of U.S. dollar denominated debt because we have -- we'll have larger deficits as a result of the corporate tax cuts and as a result, we're going to have to sell an enormous amount of corporate debt into world markets.And so, that will be a pressure on those world markets and we have to think about who are the recipients of that and those capital flows will be a big deal.BARTIROMO: Yes, I think you make a really important point. Now, the regulator that we just spoke with, Dr. Fang, who was on our panel said, look, the U.S. bond market has been a good place to invest. We're not looking to change that very much. But this is something to watch, given just the sheer size of debt that the U.S. is going to be selling.DALIO: (INAUDIBLE) right. I think that -- you know, I think that there are diplomatic ways of saying that thing. If you were to say are you going to buy this same amount of bonds that you bought in the past or what is the best asset allocation or could it become politicized? I think those are the more delicate questions that really haven't inadequately explored.BARTIROMO: Really important subject here. Let me turn specifically to the U.S. economy now, because the U.S. economy gets impacted by all of this, of course. One of the big catalysts for growth in the U.S. certainly over the last two years has been the president's -- the administration's tax cut plan.We saw 4.2 percent growth in the second quarter, 3-1/2 percent growth in the third quarter, we're talking about maybe three percent, maybe a little lower in the fourth quarter. What is your assessment there? Because here, politics gets involved.We just heard a new proposal from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to tax the top rate after $10 million at 70 percent. How is all of this going to impact the economy and markets in the U.S.?DALIO: Yes, there's so many levels I can deal with that. The first, I suppose, is it creates a hump in growth, that stimulation. When there was a limited amount of capacity, it created the stimulation that you're referring to. It also creates larger budget deficits so that has to be sold in bonds. That hump passes through the economy, then you'll get a slowing, and that's what that's going to look like.But more fundamentally I think, we're talking about the political, social, polarity of the wealth gap and the like. So, I think that the wealth gap and the opportunity gap is the biggest issue of our time. I think that is the political issue. And with the politics becomes the economic policy. Do you have one type of policy or do you have another policy? This is very much like the late 1930s in terms of populism is can be born of the populism of the left import -- more of the populism of the right.I think -- I hope that there would be a national initiative to deal with those issues. I think that there's a question, justifiable question, of whether capitalism is working adequately for the majority of people. I think that there needs to be reformation. But when you're taking then income taxes, yes, there should be -- there needs to be redistribution but there needs to be a redistribution of opportunity.When you see what's going on in schools or school systems that don't have enough money to have adequate amount of books and you deal with the population different. It is the -- I think the predominant issue of our time.And so, when you go to a 70 percent marginal tax rate, that's going to have enormous implications. That implications -- by the way, something like 56, last survey I saw, 56 percent of Americans are in favor of that. 56 percent of Americans in the last survey are in favor of a 70 percent marginal tax rate above $10 million. That changes the nature of the economics in the same sort of way and probably even in the bigger way that the tax cuts changed.And so, as we come into the election cycle and so on, and those issues are going to play, they're going to play a greater role in terms of the capital markets. If you look at the behavior of capital markets, based on whether it's capital-friendly or an environment that's not capital-friendly, you could see how the capital flows move and change the marketplace. So these issues will be an important issue.What concerns me the most is the polarity and the anger behind all of that. You know, I think the country would do better to have a party of the middle and try to bring people together in terms of trying to find this in a common way. But I think we can expect much greater polarity and with that I think that will be a market-driving influence as we're moving ahead.BARTIROMO: I couldn't agree more. I mean, most people are hanging out in the middle, by the way. You might lean to the right to some issues and lean to the left on the other issues.But you make such an important point in terms of the impact of this. For example, the other day, Mayor de Blasio said there's a lot of money in the city, it's in the wrong hands. Now, you've given an enormous amount of money away. Steven Schwarzman has given an enormous amount of money away. You know, $100 million was just given by Ken Langone to NYU to give free medical school to students.DALIO: But it's a drop in the bucket.BARTIROMO: Does that change --DALIO: No, it's a drop in the bucket. I mean, if you look at --BARTIROMO: OK. (INAUDIBLE) change 70 percent tax rates?DALIO: If you know -- if you look at what it really means, like I broke the economy, so I'm linked in, if anybody wants to go, I broke the economy in to two pieces, the bottom 60 percent and the top 40 percent, because I wanted to see the parts differently. And when you look at the conditions of the bottom 40 percent, things like the amount of money that's spent on education, if you're in the top 40 percent and by the way, it's top 40 percent, it's really like the top five percent.The amount of money that is spent on education per child is four times what it spent in the bottom 60 percent of the economy. So you think about how you're going to educate.BARTIROMO: Wow.DALIO: Do we create something that approaches an equal education? Do we create something that is approaching that element? We don't create a bottom, I don't believe and because that popularity is taking place in with such a large percentage of the population.Also, look, I'm a capitalist, but at the same time, when we have technologies being wonderful technologies that work in ways to save labor and reduce labor and change the nature of the market and that's not properly dealt with in terms of that creating opportunity. I think our society does not look at the total cost of things like education. Let's include the social cost.Do you know that, for example, if a child completes high school education, not -- completing or not completing in that child's lifetime is estimated to be about $1 million in the cost effectiveness? The cost of putting people who don't get trained, often go on the streets. The state of Connecticut, very interesting, one of the richest states in the country, 22 percent the students -- high school students are either disengaged or disconnected. Disengaged means that they don't -- that they go to school but they don't study much. Disconnected means they don't know where they are.The issues of this become large issues and I think that because it doesn't work well in terms of that, that that is a basic issue. And the real question is, is that going to be a battle between different segments and will prudent moves take place.If you go to a 70 percent marginal tax break on that and you -- then you don't handle that correctly, it changes capital flows, it changes the nature of things in a profound way.So I think that if we were to take economic policies, the slowing effects and such things, and we were to take a two-year time horizon between now and the next presidential election and you think about what weakness might be and you think about how this issue is, I think that this issue is going to be the issue of our time.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: We're going to take a short break. Wait until you hear what he said about the Federal Reserve and raising rates this year. More of my interview with Bridgewater Associates founder, Ray Dalio. Right after this.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We are coming to you live this week from the World Economic Forum here in Davos, Switzerland. More now of my first on Fox conversation with Bridgewater Associates founder and co-chief investment officer Ray Dalio. Here's what he said about the Federal Reserve.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: You have suggested recently, you were on with me two months ago. And you said the Federal Reserve is not going to be able to raise interest rates. You were right, that was way before the market actually understood that. Do you think the Fed won't be able to raise rates at all this year?DALIO: I don't think they'll be able to raise rates and I don't think they should raise rates at all. And I think that I'm very glad that they learned, OK, there was a change and now --BARTIROMO: There was a pivot.DALIO: There was a pivot. And now we're on a situation where I think they're attuned to those issues. And so, I think that that's much better.I think you will see a slowing that is more than they would expect. And I think it will be a global slowing because we have to look at ourselves within the context of Europe, it's slowing. China, it's slowing. And when those things happening and connected, I think that it's -- they won't raise rates and it is conceivable that if you were to take another year or so, that they might need to ease and that might be through the balance sheet and then we deal with the question of Europe.How does Europe ease when you have a negative interest rate and quantitative easing has limited -- has already done most of what quantitative easing could do and the same applies to Japan. So I think that's the nature of the situation. But there's a greater now awareness than there was just a few months ago at the Fed and other central banks.BARTIROMO: There sure is. And final question. How worried are you about debt? Because it seems like this is another issue that we talk about it but there's really not that much of a focus on it but given the budget deficit, the overall debt of America, the spending that we continue to see, where's this going?DALIO: Yes. There is -- there's the debt and then there's the unfunded liabilities that are like debt. If you take pension liabilities and you take healthcare liabilities and you do a pro forma financial statement on all of those, can those be met? They cannot be met. And then what does concern me is that we -- that amount of debt that you're referring to, then has to be sold and when I do the calculations of who are the buyers of that, I have concerns about that issue.So we've been blessed by being a reserve currency. And what happens, it's a two-edged sword. You're blessed because when you're a reserve currency, you're a storehold of wealth. You know, if they want to say, where am I going to save, I will save in U.S. dollar bonds and so on. But when that happens, historically, that puts countries in the positions of being borrowers and greater borrowers and I think that that's our issue.So as a -- so things as they evolve over the next few years, we can't take for granted that we're going to be able to sell that debt and fund that debt without disruptive consequences. Those disruptive consequences could be the depreciation of the exchange rate or the slowing of our own consumption. So I'm concerned about those things in an evolutionary way.BARTIROMO: In the face of all of this, you've been investing effectively, you were up almost 15 percent last year while everybody else was down. How do you keep that growth going? How do you keep that kind of performance? Would you put new money to work today in equities?DALIO: I think -- I think the -- a few things I want to say about that. I think the way that we manage money and I think the way people should manage money is that they should start with what is a balanced account. If I had no idea what's going to be good or bad, what -- how do I achieve balance in my portfolio? And then that's beta. And then there's how do I take bets? How do I overweight or underweight certain things and that's alpha.And I would say what happens is right now we have a leverage long position, like everybody has -- is one directional. So in other words, in our particular case there's not such thing as a good year -- I mean, go -- you know, going up or going down. It is something that matters to us. We want to be not have any systematic biases. I think the world is leveraged long. In other words, everybody's long assets or if you think about employment and what is a good economy, everybody wants everything to go up and so central banks and so we make a system in which credit is put in and interest rates are lowered to maximize that.When you start to get to zero interest rates and you have -- go beyond zero interest rates and you buy assets to make them go up and quantitative easing. You start to approach the limits of that leverage long. So I think the important thing is to not have any systematic risk to hold the portfolio in a way that could do equally well regardless of the direction of the economy if growth picks up or declines or inflation picks up or declines.And I would say for most investors what that really means is not to try to guess the movements because they have to compete against professionals and it's tough enough for professionals, but really to know how to create a balanced account so that they don't have those systematic biases and that's whole other conversation maybe we could have some day.BARTIROMO: Ray Dalio, thank you.DALIO: Thank you.(END VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: Coming up next. My first on Fox interview with the CEO of Verizon, Hans Vestberg on the hotter than hot wireless industry and 5G right after this.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. And welcome back to MORNINGS WITH MARIA. We are coming to you live this week from the World Economic Forum here in beautiful Davos, Switzerland. Telecom giants expanding their offerings to consumers. Verizon announcing last week that it will add Apple music subscriptions to some data plans and the companies reportedly working on a Netflix-style gaming service. We're going to find out exactly what they're doing right now.And first on Fox Business interview, the CEO of Verizon, Hans Vestberg is with us. It is good to see you.HASN VESTBERG, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, VERIZON: Good morning. Good seeing you.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. That was a nice perk adding the Apple music. Tell us about the wireless industry today. Because as we went to break a moment ago, I said it's hotter than hot. Do you agree with that? What's your stance on wireless today?VESTBERG: I think we have a good round, we reported our fourth quarter wireless numbers for a week ago and we added 1.2 million new net that adds and 650,000 net phones. So, yes, we continue to have a good roll from the third quarter into the fourth quarter, we did net additions. And of course, we also had some new things like Apple music, et cetera. I think we see a good turnout for us.BARTIROMO: Hans, how do you grow from here? Verizon is largely a domestic company in America. You obviously come your -- you ran Ericsson for a time.VESTBERG: Yes. Exactly.BARTIROMO: So are there plans to go international?VESTBERG: I think on our enterprise business we are already global as well as on our media strategy with our Yahoo! brands, et cetera. On the consumer we're only in the U.S. and that's what we're focusing on right now because when the 5G is coming up, that's of course opening new markets for us that we haven't had before.BARTIROMO: So how do you expand in terms of the U.S. just for the wireless industry? Are there pockets of the community that still don't have a wireless phone? Are you looking to get that population that wants second phones? How do you grow from here in the U.S.?VESTBERG: I think that it's -- when it comes to wireless consumption or consumers, of course it's not so much more growth to do. But what we see with 5G, there are so many other use case as well. Of course, consumers can get the best service and 5G will get them even better service than they have today. But we also do in 5G home where we actually are addressing a market we don't address today and then of course the real-time enterprise solution based on 5G. The way you transform an enterprise, it can be production floor or it could be a campus that you transform with 5G.So we see other use cases beyond consumers of 5G. We will always take care of consumers, we're the best network and all we had with the best performance. That will continue as well.BARTIROMO: You know, I feel like one of the reasons that Apple saw a slowdown when they reported recently is because why would I buy a new phone now when I know a 5G is coming and there aren't any 5G phones yet. When -- realistically, do you think 5G phones are on the market and what is that going to mean for me? What do consumers get with 5G?VESTBERG: It will be soon. I have already announced that we will have two 5G phones coming out this year and preferably in the first half of the year, from Motorola and from Samsung. And what it's going to mean is that when we're going to have the 5G ultra wide band zones where you're going to be in to, you're going to have 10x throughput and speeds and of course you're going to ask me what are going to be new use cases.Remember when 4G came, we didn't know. I can tell you there's so many people of smartphones when will they have 5G with those capabilities, they're going to innovate a lot of new services it can do with that speed, that throughput, the low latency. So I think that our work is to work with the different developers, using our platform or our networking service in order to get a lot of innovation on top of it.And that's going to create a lot of new services.BARTIROMO: I think that's also why the home market is so important because there are pockets even today in America where I don't get good broadband service. I go to the beach on the weekend sometimes, you don't get good service. Why is that?VESTBERG: No, that's true. And of course, their home service has predominant to been a cable or a fiber service. Nowadays, we can also see that you can do it with wireless. And of course, then you can get it quicker and we also see a cord cutting, so we see that together when you want to know the service rather than the linear package. We want to follow that and give optionality for our customers if they want to have a -- sort of a wireless offering.They should be able to have that in the home as well. So yes, we see that's a good opportunity. We already launched last year the 5G home in four markets and of course this year we're going to do in more markets.BARTIROMO: So your -- that's where the investment is in the home broadband market, in the 5G to come. You're still in a $10 billion cost-cutting program. Tell us about that in terms of what you're going to prioritize spending money on. Is it spectrum?VESTBERG: No. We price of course on the -- on the network, number one is the Capex we're investing. We -- last year we have not announced the fourth quarter yet, so we don't have the full year figures. But of course, we continue to invest whatever is needed in the network and then of course from investment point of view, our dividend is important and then we continue to manage our debt.So I think we have very clear priorities in our strategy. And I think we're doing everything we need to do when it comes to building the best network in the U.S.BARTIROMO: Everybody is trying to get at you, at your ankles trying to take the market share to competitive business, T-Mobile makes an acquisition announcement. How does that impact your business?VESTBERG: Oh, I think we need to be on our toes. It's a very competitive market. And of course, if you are the leader, you need to lead. And of course for us, it's very important to continue to do that. But from the consumer perspective, but we have a big enterprise that we need to take care of as well where we have all the different type of enterprises that we're serving and then we have the media group which is all the Yahoo! brands which is also an important piece of our business.And all those assets together is what we can leverage going forward.BARTIROMO: So tell me about getting bigger. Do you need more scale? Will you be making a telecom acquisition?VESTBERG: No, I think we have a scale. We have -- we are one of the biggest telecom players in the world. So we have the scale. For us, it's more to seeing that we're doing the best on that and getting the best performance out of that and continue to have the best network. I think that's important for us. It's important for our customers and ultimately it's important for our shareholders.BARTIROMO: You mentioned the Yahoo! brands. Are you trying to be more of a content player? Is that going to be a priority?VESTBERG: No, I think what we have right now with assets that we have from Yahoo! and sort of Yahoo! finance, Yahoo! news and Yahoo! sports, that is important for us but it's also serving a much broader global market, not only the U.S. market and the consumer share. So that's important for us to have sort of the online sort of streaming services.BARTIROMO: And finally, let me ask you that strategy that you went to unlimited, a lot of people said unlimited, how could they offer all this unlimited service and not get revenue. Initially, revenue got crushed from that but it actually, in retrospect, was a really good thing: you gained market share.VESTBERG: Yes. First of all, we have built the fantastic network that can cope with it. And we knew that in the beginning, we will have a little bit of a revenue decline, but then we turned it around and we have growth in the wireless recently. So, in the third quarter, we had good growth. And we're going to report the fourth quarter soon and --BARTIROMO: All right. Final question, big debate in Davos about the global economy slowing down. Are you expecting a slowdown this year?VESTBERG: I don't know. I mean, if I look in the U.S. market -- I mean, technology is so important for daily life, and so far, we've seen that continues to be an important piece. But of course, if it's a huge slowdown, then people will, of course, start thinking about their communication bill as well. But so far, it's such an incentive for lives, so you continue to invest on it.BARTIROMO: Hans, great to hear about your business. Thanks so much.VESTBERG: Thank you very much.BARTIROMO: Good to see you.VESTBERG: Good seeing you.BARTIROMO: Hans Vestberg is the CEO of Verizon. We'll take a break, when we come back, Google is under fire; the technology giant fined by Europe under its new privacy law. How much it's paying up, what are the implications, next up. And then, seeking growth in energy, ValueAct Capital CEO, Jeff Ubben is here weighing in. My exclusive interview, he's next live from Davos. Stay with us.ANNOUNCER: Here again is Maria Bartiromo with a special edition of MORNINGS WITH MARIA, live from Davos, Switzerland at the World Economic Forum.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Live from Switzerland this morning. It is Tuesday, January 22nd, your top stories right now 6:34 a.m. on the East Coast. Markets back open today after the Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday yesterday and we are kicking the week off on the downside. Futures indicating a decline at the start of trading this morning to the tune of 200 points, Dow Industrials down 192, 3/4 of one percent, S&P 500 is down 22, almost one percent and the NASDAQ down 67 points, that's about one percent lower.This after the major indices finished higher for the fourth in a row last week. As you can see, markets last week had a good week, up about three percent on the Dow, three percent on the S&P and 2-2/3 percent higher on the NASDAQ for the week last week. In Europe this morning, here's the action. The major indices in Europe are lower across the board. FTSE100 down 48, CAC Quarante in Paris, down 33 and the Dax Index in Germany down 65.Asian markets were higher overnight. Take a look at the Asian markets. Well, we did see actually some selling there as well. Japan was down as was Hong Kong, Shanghai and Kospi in Korea. China was down the most. And of course, one of the top stories in the journal this morning about the growth in China in 2018 -- the slowest in two decades.Well, it is day 32 of the partial government shutdown in the U.S. over border wall funding. President Trump skipping the World Economic Forum here in Davos this week because of the shutdown. Also, not here: British Prime Minister Theresa May. She's issuing a secondary plan for Britain's exit from the European Union. I spoke UBS Chairman Axel Weber earlier about the exit and he outlined what needs to get done.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)AXEL WEBER, CHAIRMAN, UBS: In the end, I think people have to start making compromises. This is -- you know, it's OK to insist on your position if you're negotiating but, in the end, if you want a deal, everyone needs to compromise. I haven't seen the compromises on the table.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: More highlights coming up from my panel this morning here at the World Economic Forum in Davos where China was the big topic as well as the Federal Reserve and central banks globally making moves this year, or not. Trouble for Google to report. The technology giant fined by the European Union over data protection issues. We will tell you how much it is paying European regulators.But first, out top story this half-an-hour. Growth in the energy sector, one of the top issues for the year is renewable and green energy with Democratic lawmakers in the U.S. calling for a Green New Deal, a policy calling for 100 percent of the nation's electricity to be generated from clean sources. My next guest is on the Board of Directors of AES, a global power company that provides sustainable energy to 15 countries. Joining me right now is ValueAct Capital CEO, Jeff Ubben. Jeff, good to see you, thank you so much for being here. So, tell me about that. Do you think -- I mean, we talk a lot about it but we haven't seen policies and we haven't seen actually money moving into this area specifically, what's your take?JEFF UBBEN, CEO, VALUEACT CAPITAL: The spring fund, the sustainability idea that we're purporting is to get companies to go -- to invest more, to go faster, to be a leader and solve big global problems. And the IPCC would tell you that we're going way too slowly. So, when I got involved with AES in particular and also Hawaiian electric, you know, they have the available technology in terms of battery storage and renewables, which are going down the cost curve dramatically, but the investor class in particular isn't so interesting necessarily or hasn't been in investing more.So, you know, the way I think about sustainability is deploy the available capital and be tomorrow's company, not yesterday's company. Don't bear hug coal because it pays a dividend. And what I've seen is, you know, if you think about companies moving from kind of profit-centric to purpose-driven, that it changes the company and it generates a certain sort of productivity and innovation and so at AES when they moved their mission statement to something simple, impact lives by accelerating, you know, investment in clean and safe green future, it galvanized something.Then they signed up for the TCFD, the first western energy company to do so, and it really resulted in innovation. So, you know, the CEO, having done a lot of hard work and really investing in storage, is now moving his customers he calls it green, blend and extend. So, we're using our coal plants as batteries essentially, running them less, buying renewables on the market because they're cheap, passing the cost and the savings to the customer and then migrating them to tomorrow's technology.BARTIROMO: Well, this is obviously one of the priorities that you look at when investing. You've got a very diversified portfolio. Jeff, tell us what metrics you look at in terms of identifying the growth stories. I will say this. When I've spoken with number of CEOs, they say when you call to perhaps -- whether it's in an active way, an activist way, rather, or not, they appreciate the fact that you want to work with them to actually grow the business. So, where is the growth today looking at your portfolio which is quite expansive, where's the growth in the U.S. today?UBBEN: You know, and I think if you're addressing a big global problem, whether it's climate change or, you know, waste or healthy food, healthy soil, you have the opportunity if you're the incumbent and you're in the problem to fix the problem and generate what we think is a sustainability premium, because -- the interesting thing about the stock market is we've kind of shortened the duration of long duration assets.Investors have asked for more current return, when, in fact, equities are really a terminal value mechanism, they really want the terminal value, the company 20 years out to be -- you can get a current return in bonds, right? So, let's let a company really compound and the best way to generate terminal value is to be integral to a societal need and, therefore, fix it and then if you do that -- every industry has so much disruptive technology available. You can really change the profile of your company and thereby earn the sustainability premium.BARTIROMO: But it's not just sustainability in terms of priorities, right? I mean, you have stakes in healthcare companies, technology companies. Are there -- is that where you see growth?UBBEN: Well, I mean, I think, a really fun example is like who would have thought for-profit education was the answer? You know, the Obama administration found them to be the problem. But Strayer Education, now Strategic Education invested so heavily in artificial intelligence that they now have the ability to give you a great student outcome online while they reduce their tuition.So, they're educating adult population in an affordable way that nobody else was doing with a really you high quality experience. And ultimately, they can get the tuition to the point where it could be a corporate benefit which then creates a certain retention for the company and we've solved a problem with market forces rather than having Elizabeth or Bernie come try to make education free, whatever that means.BARTIROMO: Yes.UBBEN: That company now is growing double digit in terms of admissions because -- enrollments because it's a great value proposition, but it's also addressing a huge problem that I think gives it tremendous runway.BARTIROMO: It reminds me of the saying: "Do right is also doing well for shareholders." When you're doing the right thing --UBBEN: I don't like that. I don't like that because --BARTIROMO: You don't want shareholders being involved --UBBEN: You've introduced the profit motive again, you know. What you've done is -- why do we moralize goodness and maximize greediness? That has that connotation. So, I'd rather not go there.BARTIROMO: Fair point. Jeff, it's great to have you on the show.UBBEN: Yes, thank you.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. And in full disclosure, you are a former Board Member and ValueAct is an investor in 21st Century Fox.UBBEN: Yes, it was a great experience. It's a great company.BARTIROMO: The parent company of Fox Business Network. So, you were pleased with Rupert Murdoch's moves?UBBEN: I loved working with him. For sure.BARTIROMO: Great. Great to see you, Jeff.UBBEN: Sure.BARTIROMO: Thanks so much. Jeff Ubben, joining us there, at ValueAct. Coming up, staying behind bars. Embattled Nissan Chairman, Carlos Ghosn losing his latest appeal for bail. We've got the very latest details. And then, Britain's plan b? Theresa May rolling out another plan for Britain's exit from the European Union, critics say not enough has changed. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Big news for Google, the company has just been handed down a significant fine. Cheryl Casone in New York with headlines now. Cheryl, good morning to you.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: That's right. And Maria, good morning to you there. Well, this is the biggest penalty imposed under a new European privacy law. Regulators alleging that Google didn't go far enough to get consent from users to gather data for targeted advertisers. The law requires companies to abide by very strict data protection and privacy rules that protect E.U. residents. Google still needs to fix the problem. If they don't, regulators there have the nuclear option of ordering them to stop transferring data out of the E.U. completely. Hope it doesn't come to that. Google is slightly lower after the past year. There is Alphabet, the parent company of Google, that's the stock we're watching for you.Well, former Nissan Motors Chairman, Carlos Ghosn, likely is going to be remaining behind bars until at least March. Yesterday, the Tokyo district court again denied Ghosn's request for release on bail. He proposed paying for an ankle monitor, even security guards as well as surrendering his passport. Ghosn has been detained since November 19th on multiple charges including underreporting his pay. He denies all of these charges.And members of the British cabinet meeting with Prime Minister Theresa May a day after she unveiled her exit plan b, this is the Brexit plan b, if you will. Critics say it is little changed from her previous deal that was rejected by parliament last week. Earlier, UBS Chairman Axel Weber talked about the potential impact of a chaotic Brexit, a hard Brexit in an interview with Maria at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WEBER: I think ultimately, it is not in anybody's interest to have an unorderly Brexit without new rules of the game being defined. If that requires because they started late and they didn't gain traction and they didn't agree early, that requires more time to negotiate, it's the rational thing to do.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Well, May said, that she could not take a no deal Brexit off the table. The U.K. is due to leave the European Union on March 29th, Maria. And those are your headlines from New York. Back to you. That was a fascinating panel and a lot of news breaking during that panel, Maria.BARTIROMO: Yes, I thought it was interesting because we moved back and forth from global central banks to China and, of course, as you mentioned to Brexit as well. Thank you so much for that, Cheryl. More highlights from my World Economic Forum panel coming up. We focused on the global economy; wait until you hear what was said about China and how much debt they hold of the United States. Back in a minute.DALIO: The cycle like in China, I agree, it's one of those cycles people pay attention to but they have the power, the debt is in their currency, they can handle that cycle. But there is a weakening there.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: That was Ray Dalio from my panel here in the World Economic Forum in Davos. The conversation focused on the global economy. Let's hear now from Dagen McDowell in New York along with CFRA Investment Strategist Lindsey Bell, joining us in our New York studio. Dagen, good morning to you. How are you girls?DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: I'm great, Maria. I was just fascinated with the panel. I made sure to watch it bright and early here at work this morning, and it was breaking news after breaking news out of those fantastic panelists.BARTIROMO: You know, I thought it was really interesting and I thought of you because I said, this is something that Dagen is going to notice and take note of. When Ray Dalio talked about the dollar being a reserve currency, and what they're doing in China, you know, right now they're sending buckets of renminbi to African countries and what does that tell you that several African countries right now are exchanging the yuan? The renminbi, Chinese currency and not dollars? So, you just wonder where that's going as well as what he was intimating about all of that debt that China holds of the United States, Dagen?MCDOWELL: It puts us in a very weak position and that -- what China is doing with its own currency speaks to global aspirations, to be the dominant economy on the world stage. Nevertheless, we are still looking at a Chinese economy that last year grew -- and this is based on the stated numbers -- grew at the slowest level since 1990 and it does have very serious not only growth problems, but debt problems of its own that Xi Jinping has tried to address over the last three years, as the leader of that nation -- leader for life. But that is a real struggle and there haven't been those reforms in China. Again, they favor local companies, local businesses over opening their economy to outside countries and organizations and businesses, and I think that that ultimately is going to come to bite them.BARTIROMO: Yes. Now, I will say this. The gentleman from China who was the regulator of the Chinese government, he's the lead regulator of the financial services industry, that was Dr. Fang Xinghai who was on my panel, he was talking about how financial services is truly opening up. So, Axel Weber, the Chairman of UBS said, right now they were able to buy and own an investment firm in China. UBS owns 51 percent. And you know that that's a rarity because typically, if you go to China you have to own 49 percent of a joint venture with the Chinese company that owns 51 percent. But little by little, I think they're trying to open the financial services industry. What do you say?MCDOWELL: I think that you raised this issue and your panelist was a little dumb-founded, he didn't know how to answer it, but again, if businesses are going to be comfortable doing business in China, you raised the issue, the theft of intellectual property and the forced surrender of technology. What are you doing about that? And that is exactly the issue -- two of the major issues that the U.S. is trying to address with China, that they need to take on themselves if they truly want to have an open society and make these financial executives comfortable being there.BARTIROMO: Yes, we'll see what that deal looks like. And Lindsey, one thing that he pushed back on me, when I said look, the top story in the journal -- the top story in the Wall Street Journal European version, is that China, the growth was the slowest growth, as Dagen said, in two decades but you're still talking about six percent, Lindsey.MCDOWELL: Right.LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA: Yes, I mean, it's the best in the world out there for real. So, like that's great news. But it's slowing. And you're seeing that IMF is cutting numbers across the globe.BARTIROMO: Yes, we're going to talk about growth in the U.S. as well, we're talking global growth when we come back. Stay with us.Load-Date: January 22, 2019End of Document

Air Liquide: 2018 Results: Strong growth and improvement in all performance indicators; PRESS RELEASE AND ACTIVITY REPORTBusiness WireFebruary 14, 2019 Thursday 6:20 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Business Wire, Inc.Distribution: Business EditorsLength: 13461 wordsDateline: PARIS BodyRegulatory News:Air Liquide (Paris:AI):Commenting on the results for 2018, Benoît Potier, Air Liquide Chairman and CEO, stated:"2018 was a particularly strong year, whether we are looking at sales growth to 21 billion euros and the rise in net profit to 2.1 billion euros or the efficiencies and synergies achieved as well as the high level of industrial investment decisions.Sales growth is the highest since 2011. All activities/businesses are growing, in particular Gas & Services activities, which account for 96% of the Group's revenue, with the last quarter particularly dynamic in Electronics and Industrial Merchant. From a geographic perspective, growth was also seen across the board, especially for the Americas and Asia Pacific, particularly China.Key Figures (in millions of euros) FY 2018 2018/2017 as published 2018/2017 comparable (a)Group Revenue 21,011 +3.3% +6.1%Gas & Services Revenue 20,107 +2.4% +5.2%Operating Income Recurring (OIR) 3,449 +2.5% +7.6%Group OIR Margin 16.4%    Variation excluding energy +10 bps    Gas & Services OIR Margin 18.3%    Variation excluding energy +30 pbs    Net Profit (Group Share) 2,113 +4.2% (b) + 8.7% (c)Earnings per Share (in euros) 4.95 +4.0% (b)  2018 proposed Dividend per Share (in euros) 2.65 +0.0%  Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities 4,716 +10.9%  Net Debt on 12/31/2018 (EURO) 12.5 Bn (EURO) -0.8 Bn  Return on Capital Employed after tax - ROCE 8.0% + 30 bps (d) + 60 bps (e)(a) Change excluding the currency, energy (natural gas and electricity) and significant scope impacts, see reconciliation in appendix. (b) Change compared to 2017 recurring net profit, excluding the exceptional items and the impact of the US tax reform that had no impact on cash flow in 2017. (c) Change compared to 2017 recurring net profit and excluding currency. (d) Change compared to 2017 recurring ROCE. (e) Change compared to 2017 recurring ROCE and excluding currency.The Airgas synergies are achieved a year ahead of schedule, confirming that the integration is now successfully completed. In addition, operating efficiency objectives were surpassed, contributing to the improved operating margin in Gas & Services, excluding the energy impact. As of 2019, the annual efficiency objective is raised to 400 million euros for the Group, which is 100 million euros more than the objective initially announced in the NEOS program.Cash flow grew and contributed to a significant reduction in the debt ratio, to 69%. The Group's balance sheet is strong and its ROCE improved, reaching 8.3% excluding the currency impact, in line with the NEOS objective.In a context where industrial opportunities remain substantial, the Group's investment decisions reached more than 3 billion euros. Investment backlog amounted to 2.2 billion euros, supporting future growth.Accordingly, assuming a comparable environment, Air Liquide is confident in its ability to deliver net profit growth in 2019, calculated at constant exchange rate."2018 Highlights• Developments for industry: Signature of new long-term contracts for the construction of hydrogen production units (South Korea, Benelux) and two airgas units (Russia); supply of oxygen for a strategic customer from the Group's network in the United States; entry into the Kazakhstan market; record year for Electronics with, in particular, nine ultra-pure nitrogen supply investments and excellent reception of the enScribeTM offering; ramp-up of the world's largest airgas unit (South Africa).• New acquisitions in Healthcare: In the Saudi Arabian home healthcare sector and investment in EOVE, a French startup specializing in connected portable ventilators.• Innovation: Inauguration of the Paris Innovation Campus on the "Plateau de Saclay", which gathers the Group's largest R&D center, business experts and a deep-tech startup accelerator in a single place.• The Group announces its Climate objectives with a commitment to low carbon growth and a 30% reduction in its carbon intensity between 2015 and 2025. Signature of a contract to buy 50 megawatts (MW) of renewable electricity from wind farms.• Hydrogen Energy:• Mobility: Announcement of the construction of the first world-scale liquid hydrogen production unit in the United States;• Technological advancement with the inauguration of a pilot electrolyzer in Denmark for the production of carbon-free hydrogen;• New partnership in China and Japan to foster Hydrogen development;• Hydrogen Council: 54 global multinationals are members of the Council, co-chaired by Benoît Potier.• Development of the biomethane market with the commissioning of 5 new production units (United States, France, United Kingdom) and new investment decisions in Northern Europe and in the United States.Group revenue for 2018 stood at 21,011 million euros, up +6.1% on a comparable basis and above the high end of the NEOS target range. It was supported by high Gas & Services sales growth, +5.2%, increasing sequentially, an improvement in Engineering & Construction (+31.5%) and strong growth in Global Markets & Technologies (+29.6%). The negative currency impact of -3.6% in 2018 eased over the year, mainly due to a stronger US dollar against the euro. The energy impact, which was negative during the 1st quarter, turned positive as of the 2nd quarter, and reached +1.3% over the year. The sale of the Airgas Refrigerants business at the end of 2017 led to a significant scope impact of -0.5% in 2018. Published Group revenue was therefore up +3.3% over 2018.Gas & Services revenue reached 20,107 million euros in 2018, up +5.2% on a comparable basis. All zones contributed to the growth.• Gas & Services revenue in the Americas totaled 7,982 million euros in 2018. Growth, which continued to improve quarter-on-quarter, stood at +5.2% for the year. Large Industries activity level was high (+5.4%) in both air gases and hydrogen. Industrial Merchant sales posted strong growth (+4.6%) with a high price impact. Healthcare revenue continued to improve markedly (+8.2%), despite a limited contribution from bolt-on acquisitions. Electronics posted revenue growth of +6.7% over the year.• Revenue in the Europe zone totaled 7,111 million euros, up +2.5% over the year. Large Industries sales improved (+1.9%) in particular in air gases. Growth was solid in Industrial Merchant (+3.2%), with price impacts increasing throughout the year. Healthcare continued its steady growth (+4.8%), mainly driven by organic sales growth.• Revenue in the Asia Pacific zone totaled 4,359 million euros in 2018, up +8.2%. In Large Industries, higher sales (+3.5%) benefitted from the ramp-up of units in the 1st half and from start-ups at the end of the year. Industrial Merchant was up markedly in the zone (+7.0%), especially in China. Electronics revenue posted record growth of +17.1%, with strong gas sales and exceptionally high Equipment & Installation sales.• Revenue in the Middle East and Africa zone amounted to 655 million euros, up +15.5% over the year. In Large Industries, 2018 sales benefited from the start-up in December 2017 of the largest Air Separation Unit in the world in South Africa. Business momentum remained high in Egypt.Gas & Services revenue benefited from a strong contribution from all business lines. Industrial Merchant growth was solid, +4.5%, supported by high price impacts (+2.5%), which were stronger in the 2nd half (+3.1%) than in the 1st half (+1.9%). Large Industries, +4.7%, benefited in particular from a major start-up in South Africa in December 2017 and sustained demand in oxygen, notably in the Americas and Asia. Sales growth in Healthcare was strong, +5.7%, despite a limited contribution from bolt-on acquisitions. Electronics posted record growth of +9.9%, with a marked increase in Carrier Gases and Advanced Materials and exceptionally high Equipment & Installation sales.Engineering & Construction revenue for 2018 totaled 430 million euros, up +31.5% compared with 2017. It benefited from the gradual improvement in order intake seen since the beginning of 2017.Global Markets & Technologies sales were up +29.6% in 2018 at 474 million euros, the biogas activity being the main contributor to this growth.The additional Airgas synergies in 2018 amounted to 76 million US dollars and reached a cumulated 290 million US dollars since the acquisition. The 300 million-US dollar target of cumulated synergies is therefore reached in the 1st quarter of 2019, i.e., more than a year before initially planned.For the year, efficiencies amounted to 351 million euros, largely above the NEOS company program's annual target of more than 300 million euros. The strong investment momentum in our customers' main markets led to an increase in investment opportunities for the Group and in the number of new long-term contracts signed. In this favorable environment for future growth and to ensure reaching the NEOS target of a ROCE in excess of 10% by 2021-2022, the Group is significantly strengthening its efficiency program. As of 2019, the annual target for efficiencies is therefore set at more than 400 million euros.The Group's operating income recurring (OIR) reached 3,449 million euros in 2018, +6.7% excluding the currency impact. The operating margin (OIR to revenue) stood at 16.4% and at 16.6% excluding the energy impact, which corresponds to a +10 basis point improvement compared with 2017. Excluding the energy impact, the operating margin for Gas & Services increased by +30 basis points compared with 2017.Net profit (Group share) amounted to 2,113 million euros in 2018, up +4.2% compared with the "recurring" net profit for 2017 which excluded exceptional items and the impact of the US tax reform that had no impact on cash flow, and up +8.7% when also excluding the currency impact.Cash flow from operating activities before changes in working capital requirement totaled 4,138 million euros and stood at 19.7% of Group sales. It allowed in particular the financing of net industrial capital expenditures, which reached 2.2 billion euros, and the decrease of the debt-to-equity ratio, down from 80% at the end of 2017 to 68.8% at the end of 2018. Gross industrial capital expenditures represented 10.7% of sales.Industrial and financial investment decisions exceeded 3.1 billion euros, a +22% increase compared with 2.6 billion euros in 2017. This was a record level excluding major acquisitions. Despite this particularly high level of investment decisions, the 12-month portfolio of investment opportunities totaled 2.6 billion euros, as of December 31, 2018, up 500 million euros compared with 2017.The return on capital employed after tax (ROCE) stood at 8.0%, a +30 basis point increase compared with the recurring ROCE at the end of 2017 (7.7%). Excluding the currency impact, ROCE improved by +60 basis points. The Group confirmed the NEOS target of returning to a ROCE of above 10% by 2021-2022.Moreover, for many years now, Air Liquide has been committed to a sustained growth, notably to limit its own CO2 emissions as well as those of its customers. The Group presented on November 30, 2018 its Climate objectives, in particular the 30% reduction objective in its carbon intensity1 between 2015 and 2025, with a global approach that includes its assets, its customers, and ecosystems. These objectives are the most ambitious of its sector and are in line with its NEOS company program.The Air Liquide Board of Directors, which met on February 13, 2019, approved the audited financial statements for fiscal year 2018. A report with an unqualified opinion is being issued by the Statutory Auditors.1 In kg CO2 equivalent / (EURO) Operating income recurring before depreciation and amortization.At the next Shareholders' Meeting, the Board of Directors will propose the payment of a dividend of 2.65 euros per share, stable compared to previous year. The ex-dividend date has been set for May 20, 2019, with payment set for May 22, 2019. In addition, the Board of Directors has decided to allot one free share for every 10 shares held in the second half of 2019. The allotment date is set for October 9, 2019.The Board also approved the draft resolutions to be submitted to a vote by the shareholders at their annual meeting scheduled for May 7, 2019, including proposed reappointments of the following board members for a four-year term:• Ms. Siân Herbert-Jones, member of the Company's Board of Directors since 2011 and Chairman of the Audit and Accounts Committee since 2015;• Ms. Geneviève Berger, member of the Company's Board of Directors since 2015 and member of the Environment and Society Committee since 2017.At the close of the Shareholders' Meeting of May 7, 2019, assuming these resolutions are approved, the Board of Directors will be composed of 12 members, of whom 11 are elected and one is an employee director. The Board will be made up of seven men and five women and will include six members who are foreign nationals.In addition, the Board has set the remuneration of the executive officers, applicable to Mr. Benoît Potier as Chairman and CEO for 2018 and 2019, details of which will be published on the Air Liquide website. In compliance with the Sapin 2 Law, the shareholders are invited to vote on the 2018 remuneration elements of the Chairman and CEO and on the principles and criteria used for the determination of his compensation for 2019.Management Report's Table of Content 2018 PERFORMANCE 6 Key Figures6Income Statement72018 Cash Flow and Balance Sheet16 INVESTMENT CYCLE AND FINANCING18 Investments182018 Financing21 OUTLOOK23 APPENDICES24 Estimated impact of IFRS16 on the fiscal year 201924Currency, energy and significant scope impacts (Year)25Currency, energy and significant scope impacts (Quarter)264th Quarter 2018 Revenue27Geographic and Segment Information27Consolidated Income Statement28Consolidated Balance Sheet29Consolidated Cash Flow Statement30Return on Capital Employed - ROCE322018 PERFORMANCE Unless otherwise specified, all variations on revenue commented below are made on a comparable basis, which excludes the currency, energy (natural gas and electricity) and significant scope impacts.

It was supported by high Gas & Services sales growth, +5.2%, which increased quarter-on-quarter, an improvement in Engineering & Construction (+31.5%) and strong growth in Global Markets & Technologies (+29.6%). The negative currency impact of -3.6% in 2018 eased over the year, mainly due to a stronger US dollar against the euro. The energy impact, which was negative during the 1st quarter, turned positive as of the 2nd quarter, and reached +1.3% over the year. The sale of the Airgas Refrigerants business at the end of 2017 led to a significant scope impact of -0.5% in 2018. Published Group revenue was therefore up +3.3% over 2018.Gas & ServicesGas & Services revenue reached 20,107 million euros in 2018, up +5.2% on a comparable basis. This was driven by a strong contribution from all business lines and all zones. Industrial Merchant growth was solid, +4.5%, supported by high price impacts (+2.5%), which were stronger in the 2nd half (+3.1%) than in the 1st half (+1.9%). Large Industries, +4.7%, benefited in particular from a major start-up in South Africa in December 2017 and sustained demand in oxygen, notably in the Americas and Asia. Sales growth in Healthcare was strong, +5.7%, despite a limited contribution from bolt-on acquisitions. Electronics posted record growth of +9.9%, with a marked increase in Carrier Gases and Advanced Materials and exceptionally high Equipment & Installation sales. As published revenue was up +2.4%; the energy impact, at +1.4%, did not offset the unfavorable currency and scope impacts (at -3.7% and -0.5% respectively).Revenue by geography and business line (in millions of euros) FY 2017 FY 2018 2018/2017 published change 2018/2017 comparable changeAmericas 8,150 7,982 -2.1% +5.2%Europe 6,776 7,111 +5.0% +2.5%Asia-Pacific 4,081 4,359 +6.8% +8.2%Middle East & Africa 635 655 +3.2% +15.5%GAS & SERVICES REVENUE 19,642 20,107 +2.4% +5.2%Large Industries 5,336 5,685 +6.6% +4.7%Industrial Merchant 9,261 9,181 -0.9% +4.5%Healthcare 3,401 3,486 +2.5% +5.7%Electronics 1,644 1,755 +6.7% +9.9%AmericasGas & Services revenue in the Americas totaled 7,982 million euros in 2018. Growth, which continued to improve quarter-on-quarter, stood at +5.2% for the year. Large Industries activity level was high (+5.4%) in both air gases and hydrogen. Industrial Merchant sales posted strong growth (+4.6%) with a high price impact. Healthcare revenue continued to improve markedly (+8.2%), despite a limited contribution from bolt-on acquisitions.• Large Industries posted revenue growth of +5.4% in 2018. The start-up of the OCI unit in the United States at the end of the 2nd quarter and the ramp-up of units in Latin America contributed to the increase in oxygen volumes. Hydrogen sales were also up, driven by high demand. The cogeneration activity in Canada enjoyed favorable electricity market conditions in Alberta in 2018.• Industrial Merchant sales were up +4.6% over the year. Growth in the United States was driven by very solid cylinder gas and hardgoods sales, which benefited from favorable conditions in most end markets, in particular in Metal Fabrication, Construction and Energy. In Canada, cylinder gas and hardgoods sales were up, in particular in the Metal Fabrication end market, and offset weaker liquid nitrogen volumes for oil well services in Alberta. Growth in South America retained momentum, with a marked increase in liquid gas volumes in Brazil in particular. Price impacts increased towards the end of the year, reaching +4.2% in the 4th quarter, and stood at +3.0% for the year, in line with inflation.• Healthcare revenue grew strongly, +8.2%, in 2018 despite a limited contribution from bolt-on acquisitions. Medical Gases growth was strong in the United States, driven in particular by the success of cylinders with a digital interface and increased sales to proximity care customers. Business momentum continued in Latin America, in particular in Brazil and Colombia, notably in Home Healthcare.• Electronics posted revenue growth of +6.7% over the year, with an increase in Carrier Gases and Advanced Materials sales and exceptionally high Equipment & Installation sales.EuropeRevenue in the Europe zone totaled 7,111 million euros, up +2.5% over the year. Large Industries sales improved (+1.9%) in particular in air gases. Growth was solid in Industrial Merchant (+3.2%), with price impacts increasing throughout the year. Healthcare continued its steady growth (+4.8%), mainly driven by organic sales growth.• Large Industries revenue was up +1.9% in 2018, with air gas sales increasing, in particular in France, Benelux and Italy, and increased cogeneration activity in Benelux. Hydrogen sales were impacted in the 2nd half by major customer turnarounds, in particular in Benelux. Momentum was particularly strong in Turkey with the start-up of a new unit during the 4th quarter. The Group also launched its operations in Kazakhstan during the 3rd quarter with the takeover of a hydrogen production unit to meet the needs of the national oil company.• Industrial Merchant sales were up +3.2% in 2018, with growth solid throughout the year and particularly strong during the 4th quarter at +4.7%. The majority of the countries contributed to this growth. Cylinder gas sales improved at a faster pace in the 2nd half of the year, but the increase remained below that of liquid gas sales. Growth continued at a very high pace in Turkey and in Eastern Europe, in particular in Poland and Russia. Price impacts increased quarter-on-quarter, gradually catching up with the rate of inflation, and reached +1.5% for the year and +2.6% for the 4th quarter.• Healthcare continued to improve steadily posting mostly organic sales growth of +4.8%, with bolt-on acquisitions having a limited contribution. Home Healthcare momentum remained very strong with, in particular, a marked increase in the number of diabetic patients in Scandinavia. Growth in sales of Medical Gases for hospitals was impacted by constant price pressure. Specialty Ingredients revenue grew significantly.Asia PacificRevenue in the Asia Pacific zone totaled 4,359 million euros in 2018, up +8.2%. In Large Industries, higher sales (+3.5%) benefitted from the ramp-up of units in the 1st half and from start-ups at the end of the year. Industrial Merchant was up markedly in the zone (+7.0%), especially in China. Electronics revenue posted record growth of +17.1%, with strong gas sales and exceptionally high Equipment & Installation sales.• Large Industries sales were up +3.5% in 2018, driven by the contribution from the ramp-up of units during the 1st half and from several start-ups in China at the end of the year. These additional sales largely offset the loss of revenue from the disposal of three isolated units in Northern China at the end of 2017. Customer demand was solid, in particular for hydrogen in South Korea and for air gases in South-East Asia.• Industrial Merchant revenue grew strongly, +7.0%, over the year, with performances varying greatly by country. In China, growth exceeded +15% for the year, driven by the strong increase in cylinder gases and liquid argon volumes as well as by higher prices. Revenue in Japan declined slightly. Sales were up in Australia, notably in liquid gas for the mining sector. Price impacts stood at +1.8% for the year and at +1.2% for the 4th quarter, due to softer price impact in China following five consecutive quarters of strong growth.• Electronics revenue posted a record increase of +17.1% in 2018. This was driven by strong momentum for Advanced Materials, in particular in South Korea, China and Taiwan, and the ramp-up of Carrier Gases units in Singapore, Taiwan, China and Japan. Equipment & Installations sales were also exceptionally high, and posted growth above +50%.Middle East and AfricaRevenue in the Middle East and Africa zone amounted to 655 million euros, up +15.5% over the year. In Large Industries, 2018 sales benefited from the start-up in December 2017 of the largest Air Separation Unit in the world in South Africa. Business momentum remained high in Egypt, with the start-up of an Air Separation Unit during the 1st quarter 2018 and growing volumes in Industrial Merchant. Healthcare continued its development, in particular in Saudi Arabia, where an acquisition at the end of 2017 led to the local launch of the Home Healthcare activity.Engineering & ConstructionEngineering & Construction revenue for 2018 totaled 430 million euros, up +31.5% compared with 2017. It benefited from the gradual improvement in order intake seen since the beginning of 2017.Order intake reached 807 million euros at the end of December 2018, a double-digit increase compared with 2017. Air Separation Units accounted for more than half of all orders. These included Group projects and third-party customer orders, notably in Asia.Global Markets & TechnologiesGlobal Markets & Technologies sales were up +29.6% in 2018 at 474 million euros. The main contributor to this growth was the biogas activity, which benefited from the ramp-up of a major landfill biogas purification unit in the United States and four smaller farm waste biogas purification units in France and in the United Kingdom. Maritime and Advanced Technologies activities also posted strong growth.Order intake was up more than +30% at the end of December and reached 460 million euros.Focus - Global Markets & Technologies• Air Liquide and 10 large Japanese companies, representing several industries and finance, announced the creation in March of the "Japan H2 Mobility" consortium for the purpose of accelerating the deployment in Japan of hydrogen stations and fuel cell electric vehicles. The 11 founding companies will contribute to the development of a large-scale hydrogen infrastructure in order to build a network of 320 stations by 2025, and 900 by 2030. Today, there are about 100 stations already in operation in Japan. For its part, Air Liquide will install and operate some 20 stations by 2021.• In March, Air Liquide inaugurated a new hydrogen station near Versailles in France. This station will fuel two hydrogen-powered buses, scheduled for rollout in 2019, and supplement the Paris hydrogen taxi fleet "Hype" which is developing rapidly. This is the third station that has been installed by Air Liquide in the Greater Paris Area.• Air Liquide has commissioned three new biomethane production units, in the United States, in France, and in the United Kingdom in the 1st quarter 2018, doubling its biomethane production capacity, which now stands at 60 MW, the equivalent of 500 GWh for a full year of production. Over the course of the last four years, the Group has decided around 100 million euros in investments in biomethane production. The Group operates 10 production units around the world, designed to purify biogas in order to transform it into biomethane and inject it into the natural gas network.• Early September, Air Liquide inaugurated in Hobro, Denmark, HyBalance, a pilot site for the production of carbon-free hydrogen, in the presence of the project's partners. This facility uses electrolysis technology and allows to balance the electricity grid and store surplus electricity in the form of hydrogen that will be used in industry and transportation. The electrolyser, with a capacity of 1.2 MW, enables the production of around 500 kg of hydrogen a day without releasing CO2. As part of this project initiated in 2016, Air Liquide developed, built, and is operating the facility that produces hydrogen from water electrolysis as well as the filling center for its customers delivered by trailers.• At the end of September, Air Liquide inaugurated its Paris Innovation Campus on the "Plateau de Saclay", in the Paris area. This new Campus illustrates the Group's open innovation approach, especially on energy transition and environment, healthcare and digital transformation. It includes Air Liquide's largest Research & Development Center, a fully renovated center with an investment of (EURO)50 million. It is a high-performance energy building allowing to test new clean energies: fuel cell, photovoltaic panels, 100% biomethane natural gas, and 100% renewable electricity. It brings together almost 500 people, including 350 researchers. From 2019, the Innovation Campus will also host a deep tech start-up accelerator.• At the end of November, Air Liquide announced the construction of the first world scale liquid hydrogen production unit dedicated to the hydrogen energy markets, located in the Western U.S. Air Liquide expects to invest more than 150 million US dollars for the production of nearly 30 tons of hydrogen per day that will serve the growing needs of the hydrogen mobility market in California.• At the end of January 2019, Air Liquide announced that it acquired an 18.6% stake in the capital of the Canadian company Hydrogenics Corporation, a leader in electrolysis hydrogen production equipment and fuel cells. This strategic transaction represents an investment of 20.5 million US dollars (18 million euros). Air Liquide and Hydrogenics have also entered into a technology and commercial agreement to jointly develop electrolysis technologies.OPERATING INCOME RECURRINGOperating income recurring before depreciation and amortization reached 5,215 million euros, up +1.4% as published compared with 2017, and +5.3% excluding the currency impact.Purchases were up +7.2%, in particular due to the increase in energy prices. Equipment purchases were also up for the Equipment & Installation activity in Electronics as well as for Engineering & Construction. Besides, the continued attention paid to costs and efficiencies allowed for personnel costs and other expenses and income to grow at a slower pace than sales (+0.2% and +0.8% respectively, compared with published sales growth of +3.3%).Depreciation and amortization reached 1,766 million euros, down -0.7% due to the currency impact. Excluding the currency impact and despite the impact of start-ups and ramp-ups, depreciation and amortization growth remained lower than revenue growth. This development also reflected the large number of contract renewals in 2018 in our main Large Industries basins.At the end of 2018, Airgas synergies represented a cumulated 290 million US dollars since the acquisition in May 2016. These included 231 million US dollars of cost synergies, i.e., more than the initial objective, and 59 million US dollars of growth synergies. The 300 million-US dollar target of cumulated synergies is therefore reached in the 1st quarter of 2019, i.e., more than a year before initially planned. The integration of Airgas is now complete.For the 2018 fiscal year, synergies amounted to 76 million US dollars. The share of growth synergies continued to rise and represented more than 40% of synergies for the year. These came from the rollout of cross-selling offerings in the United States, such as small onsite generators using Air Liquide technology offered to Airgas customers and cylinder gases and hardgoods now available to Air Liquide customers. Supporting Airgas customers in their expansion in Canada and Mexico is another example of growth synergies.For the year, efficiencies amounted to 351 million euros, largely above the NEOS company program's annual target of more than 300 million euros. They included a contribution from Airgas for the first time in 2018, which amounted to 31 million euros. They represented savings of 2.3% of the cost base and 2.9% excluding Airgas. Industrial Merchant was the greatest contributor, with more than one third of efficiencies, followed by Large Industries and Healthcare. Moreover, approximately 50% of these efficiencies related to industrial projects which mainly target a decrease in logistic costs and the optimization of production unit operation. The accelerated rollout of remote operation centers (Smart Innovative Operations, SIO) was a major example of this in 2018. Almost one third of efficiencies related to procurement savings, notably for the purchases of molecules in Electronics, equipment in Home Healthcare, and energy in Large Industries. The remaining efficiencies mainly related to administrative efficiencies and realignment plans in several countries and businesses, including Engineering & Construction.The strong investment momentum in our customers' main markets led to an increase in investment opportunities for the Group and in the number of new long-term contracts signed. In this favorable environment for future growth and to ensure reaching the NEOS target of a ROCE in excess of 10% by 2021-2022, the Group is significantly strengthening its efficiency program. As of 2019, the annual target for efficiencies is therefore set at more than 400 million euros, compared with a target of more than 300 million euros previously. Half of the additional efficiencies will be related to the integration of Airgas in the program and half from the reinforcement of asset pooling and platform sharing projects, as well as an acceleration in the implementation of digital solutions.The Group's operating income recurring (OIR) reached 3,449 million euros in 2018, a published increase of +2.5%, or +6.7% excluding the currency impact. The operating margin (OIR to revenue) stood at 16.4% and 16.6% excluding the energy impact, which corresponds to a +10 basis point improvement compared with 2017.Focus - Purchases and Efficiencies• One year after the launch of the first remote operation center in France, Air Liquide inaugurated in January 2018 in Malaysia its Smart Innovative Operations (SIO) Center for the Southeast Asia Pacific region. The SIO Center enables the remote management of production for 18 Air Liquide Large Industries production units spanning eight countries across the region, as well as optimizing energy consumption and improving reliability at these sites. Air Liquide invested 20 million euros in this project.• At the end of November, Air Liquide announced a new agreement to purchase 50 megawatts (MW) of renewable wind electricity from a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources, LLC, the world's largest generator of renewable energy. By using the wind-generated electricity, Air Liquide will save 1.5 million tons of CO2 emissions over the term of the agreement.Gas & ServicesOperating income recurring for Gas & Services amounted to 3,679 million euros, an increase of +2.6% as published compared with 2017. The operating margin as published was 18.3%. Excluding the energy impact, it stood at 18.6%, representing a +30 basis point increase compared with 2017.In an environment where global inflation is stronger, sales prices increased +1.5% for the year, thanks in particular to the Industrial Merchant business which was up +2.5%. Prices were down slightly in Electronics and almost flat in Healthcare.Efficiencies totaled 315 million euros in 2018 for Gas & Services.Gas & Services Operating margin (a) 2017 2018 2018, excluding energyAmericas 16.8% 17.2% 17.2%Europe 19.3% 19.2% 19.8%Asia-Pacific 19.7% 19.2% 19.5%Middle East & Africa 17.2% 16.0% 15.0%TOTAL 18.3% 18.3% 18.6%(a) Recurring operating income/revenue, as published figuresOperating income recurring for the Americas zone stood at 1,369 million euros in 2018, stable (+0.3%) compared with 2017 due to the depreciation of the US dollar against the euro and the disposal of Airgas Refrigerants activity. Excluding the energy impact, the operating margin stood at 17.2%, an increase of +40 basis points compared with 2017. The Industrial Merchant operating margin improved markedly, notably due to the contribution from Airgas synergies and a high price impact. Conversely, strong Equipment & Installation sales in Electronics and the disposal of Airgas Refrigerants business had a dilutive effect on the margin.Operating income recurring in the Europe zone reached 1,368 million euros, an increase of +4.5%. Excluding the energy impact, the operating margin was 19.8%, a +50 basis point increase mainly due to price impact getting stronger throughout the year in Industrial Merchant and efficiencies generated across all business lines in the zone. Moreover, the active management of the business portfolio that led to the disposal of a small Equipment & Installation business in Electronics also had an accretive impact on the margin.Operating income recurring in the Asia Pacific zone stood at 837 million euros, an increase of +4.1%. Excluding the energy impact, the operating margin was 19.5%, down -20 basis points. The exceptionally high level of Equipment & Installation sales in Electronics and several Large Industries unit start-ups in China during the 2nd half had a slightly dilutive impact on the margin. Nevertheless, the Industrial Merchant operating margin improved, driven by cylinder gas sales growth and efficiencies.Operating income recurring for the Middle East and Africa zone amounted to 105 million euros, a decrease of -3.9% compared with 2017. Excluding the energy impact, the operating margin totaled 15.0%, a decrease of -220 basis points. After a transitional period in relatively exceptional operating conditions, the hydrogen production units in Yanbu, Saudi Arabia, have now reached their nominal operating mode marked by a structural adjustment of the operating margin.Engineering & ConstructionOperating income recurring for Engineering & Construction totaled -4 million euros, penalized by a business volume which remained insufficient. Nevertheless, the gradual improvement in the business contributed to the return to a positive operating income recurring in the 2nd half which should continue to improve gradually to reach a margin of between 5% and 10% in the medium term.Global Markets & TechnologiesOperating income recurring for Global Markets & Technologies reached 50 million euros with an operating margin of 10.5% for the year; it was higher in the 2nd half (12.0%). A portion of these activities is in start-up phase and the margin level, which depends on the nature of the projects carried out during the period, may vary significantly.Research & Development and Corporate costsResearch & Development expenses and Corporate costs stood at 277 million euros, a +14.2% increase compared with 2017, due to an increase in research and the ramping-up of the Group's digital transformation.NET PROFITOther operating income and expenses showed a net balance of -162 million euros. This was mainly related to costs for realignment plans in various countries and businesses, in particular Engineering & Construction, Airgas integration costs and provisions for exceptional geopolitical risks.The financial result of -353 million euros was down compared with 2017 (-489 million euros). Net finance costs, at -303 million euros, were down -28.1% and benefited from a non-recurring gain of around 55 million euros generated during the 1st half of the year by the unwinding of hedging instruments relating to debt restructuring in the United States. Excluding this impact, the average cost of net indebtedness, at 3.0%, was down by -20 basis points compared with 2017.Income tax expense stood at 731 million euros, a +523 million euros increase compared with 2017 when an exceptional non-cash gain of 586 million euros was recognized mainly due to the US tax reform. The effective tax rate was 24.9% in 2018, a +450 basis point improvement over the recurring effective tax rate of 2017. This decrease was mainly due to the reduction of the US federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% coupled with exceptional items, notably in France during the 1st half of the year and in the Netherlands during the 2nd half of the year.The share of profit of associates amounted to 4 million euros, compared with 5 million euros in 2017. The share of minority interests in net profit reached 94 million euros, an increase of +2.2%, as the profit from subsidiaries with minority shareholders rose, particularly in China.For the record, net profit from discontinued operations for 2017 (-37 million euros) reflected the impact of the disposal of Air Liquide Welding.Net profit (Group share) amounted to 2,113 million euros in 2018, down -3.9% as published, but up +4.2% compared with the "recurring" net profit for 2017 which excluded exceptional items and the impact of the US tax reform that had no impact on cash flow, and up +8.7% when also excluding the currency impact.Net earnings per share, at 4.95 euros, were up +4.0% compared with the "recurring" net earnings per share for 2017, in line with the increase in net profit (Group share). The average number of outstanding shares used for the calculation of net earnings per share as of December 31, 2018 was 426,674,123.Change in the number of shares  2017 2018Average number of outstanding shares(a) 426,409,142 426,674,123Number of shares as of December 31, 2017   426,731,852Options exercised during the year   185,549Capital increase reserved for employees   1,049,529Number of shares as of December 31, 2018   427,966,930(a) Restated in 2017 for the impact of the free share attribution on October 4, 2017.Focus - Change in the number of shares• At the end of October, Air Liquide announced an increase in share capital reserved for employees. This transaction, which forms part of the Group's policy to develop employee share ownership, covers more than seventy countries. Air Liquide aims to further associate its employees to the Group's development and its performance over the long-term.DIVIDENDAt the Annual General Meeting on May 7, 2019, the payment of a dividend of 2.65 euros per share as well as a free share attribution of 1 for 10 will be proposed to shareholders for the fiscal year 2018. The total estimated pay-out taking into account share buybacks and cancellations would amount to 1,165 million euros, representing a pay-out ratio of 55% of the published net profit. The ex-dividend date is scheduled for May 20, 2019 and the payment is scheduled for May 22, 2019.2018 Cash Flow and Balance Sheet  (in millions of euros) 2017 2018Cash flow from operating activities before change in working capital 4,133 4,138Change in working capital requirement 188 613Other items (67) (35)Net cash flow from operating activities 4,254 4,716Dividends (1,099) (1,234)Purchases of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, net of disposals (a) (1,850) (2,272)Increase in share capital 70 138Purchase of treasury shares (158) (64)Impact of exchange rate changes and net indebtedness of newly consolidated companies & restatement of net finance costs 780 (448)Change in net indebtedness 1,997 836Net indebtedness as of December 31 (13,371) (12,535)Debt-to-equity ratio as of December 31 80% 69%(a) Including transactions with minority shareholdersNET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIESCash flow from operating activities before changes in working capital requirement totaled 4,138 million euros, stable (+0.1%) compared with 2017, and stood at 19.7% of Group sales.Net cash flow from operating activities after changes in working capital requirement amounted to 4,716 million euros, up +10.9% compared with 2017, and reached 22.4% of sales. This improvement is the result of measures taken to reduce working capital requirement.CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITALWorking capital requirement (WCR) decreased by -613 million euros in 2018. This improvement mainly came from Gas & Services, where trade receivables were down, notably thanks to the introduction of a non-recourse factoring program at Airgas. Engineering & Construction WCR was also down, albeit to a lesser extent, and that of Global Markets & Technologies was stable. Working capital requirements excluding tax came to 4.1% of sales, down compared with the 2017 ratio of 6.4%.CAPITAL EXPENDITUREIn 2018, gross capital expenditure totaled 2,380 million euros, including transactions with minority shareholders.(in millions of euros) Industrial investments Financial investments(a) Total capital expenditures(a)2014 1,902 273 2,1752015 2,028 395 2,4232016 2,259 12,180 14,4392017 2,183 144 2,3272018 2,249 131 2,380(a) Including transactions with minority shareholdersProceeds from the sale of fixed assets, for a total of 103 million euros, related to smaller non-strategic assets.

Despite a negative currency impact and an increase in the dividend, net indebtedness declined -836 million euros compared with the end of 2017 due to a very high level of net cash flow from operating activities in 2018. The debt-to-equity ratio stood at 68.8% at the end of December 2018, a strong decline compared to 80% at the end of 2017.Focus - Debt issue• In March, Air Liquide successfully completed a first bond issuance on the Chinese mainland market ("Panda") for an aggregate nominal amount of 2.2 billion Renminbi (approximatively 280 million euros), becoming one of the first European companies to issue on this market. This transaction bears coupons of 5.95% and 6.40% for a 3-year and a 5-year maturity respectively. The 5-year issuance, the longest maturity ever achieved by a European company on the Panda market, reflects the long-term dimension of the Group's activities. The proceeds of this issue will be used to finance new investments and to refinance debt related to previous investments in China.ROCEThe return on capital employed after tax (ROCE) stood at 8.0%, a +30 basis point increase compared with the recurring ROCE at the end of 20171 (7.7%). Excluding the currency impact, ROCE improved by +60 basis points. The Group confirmed the NEOS target of returning to a ROCE of above 10% by 2021-2022.2 Which excludes from 2017 net profit the non-cash impacts of exceptional items and the US tax reform.INVESTMENT CYCLE AND FINANCINGInvestmentsThe momentum in investment projects seen in recent quarters continued. Investment decisions reached a record level, while the 12-month portfolio of opportunities increased sharply.INVESTMENT DECISIONS AND INVESTMENT BACKLOG(in billions of euros) Industrial investment decisions Financial investment decisions (acquisitions) Total investment decisions2014 1.9 0.2 2.12015 1.9 0.5 2.42016 2.0 12.2 14.22017 2.4 0.2 2.62018 3.0 0.2 3.1In 2018, industrial and financial investment decisions exceeded 3.1 billion euros, a +22% increase compared with 2.6 billion euros in 2017. This was a record level excluding major acquisitions. At 1,173 million euros, 4th quarter decisions were particularly high.Industrial investment decisions amounted to 2,960 million euros. These included nine major investments in Large Industries, of which five are in key industrial basins for the Group, in Benelux and along the Gulf Coast of the United States, three are in developing economies, in Eastern Europe and in China, and one efficiency investment was in Japan. Industrial investment decisions in Electronics were up more than +40% compared with 2017 and reached a record high in 2018. These included nine ultra-pure nitrogen supply investments for major players in the integrated circuit industry, mainly in Asia. Moreover, investment decisions in Global Markets & Technologies, linked to the energy transition, were up markedly in 2018, in particular for hydrogen energy and biomethane.Financial investment decisions reached approximately 160 million euros for the year. These mainly included bolt-on acquisitions in Industrial Merchant, in the United States (seven companies were acquired by Airgas in 2018) and in China, as well as in Healthcare.The investment backlog totaled 2.2 billion euros, an increase of almost 100 million euros compared with 2017. It is expected to bring a future contribution to annual sales of approximately 0.9 billion euros per year after full ramp-up of the units.Focus - Industrial and financial investment decisions• Air Liquide announced in April having signed a new long-term contract with Covestro, a world-leading supplier of high-tech polymer materials, for the supply of hydrogen to their new production site in the port area of Antwerp. Air Liquide will invest 80 million euros in the construction of a hydrogen production unit fitted with a new proprietary technology that improves energy efficiency and the overall environmental footprint of the production process. By capturing carbon and upgrading the recovered CO2, this model is part of a circular economy system. The hydrogen produced will also enable Air Liquide to supply customers in this industrial basin in Europe.• Air Liquide and Evraz, a world major steel producer, have signed a long-term contract for the supply of oxygen, nitrogen and argon in Novokuznetsk, Russian Federation. Air Liquide will invest around 130 million euros for the construction of two state-of-the-art Air Separation Units of 1,500 ton per day of oxygen each. These plants will improve energy efficiency and the overall environmental footprint of the production process.• In April, Air Liquide announced having signed a new long-term contract in the United States with LyondellBasell to supply oxygen to their new petrochemical plant in Texas, expected to be completed in 2021. This new propylene oxide/tertiary butyl alcohol plant (PO/TBA) is expected to be the largest in the world upon construction. The oxygen will be sourced from Air Liquide's pipeline system which spans more than 2,000 miles along the coasts of Texas and Louisiana, part of the largest pipeline system in the world.• With the acquisition of the respiratory division of Thimar Al Jazirah Company (TAC) in Saudi Arabia, announced in early January, Air Liquide enters the Home Healthcare market in Saudi Arabia, where the Group already supplies medical gases to hospitals. This division is specialized in the distribution of respiratory equipment and related services. TAC is the main player in this field, serving over 1,400 patients at home throughout the country. In 2016, the Home Healthcare division of TAC generated a revenue of over 5.5 million euros.• Air Liquide extends its service offering of Home Healthcare activity via the acquisition at the beginning of April of the start-up EOVE, a French company specialized in the design and manufacture of ventilators for home-based patients suffering from chronic respiratory failure. EOVE developed an innovative solution: a connected portable ventilator that takes into account the mobility needs of patients and facilitates the practice of doctors.• Airgas announced, in May, the acquisition of the assets and operations of Weiler Welding Company, a full-service industrial gas, beverage and gas welding supply business, based in Moraine, Ohio. This transaction marks the 500th acquisition in Airgas' 36-year company history.• In June 2018, Air Liquide announced the acquirement of a minority stake in the Chinese startup STNE (Shanghai Sinotran New Energy Automobile Operation CO., LTD) to accelerate the rollout of hydrogen-powered electric truck fleets in China. This agreement fits in the Chinese government's 13th five-year-plan, which aims notably to support the development and sale of hydrogen-powered electric vehicles serving clean mobility.START-UPSThere were 17 start-ups during 2018 including Fujian Shenyuan in China in December: six start-ups in the Americas including four in the United States; four in Europe including the Kazakhstan takeover, which marks the Group's entry into this country; five in Asia including three in China; and two in the Middle East and Africa in Egypt. Fujian Shenyuan also contributes for one month of activity, all tests being successfully completed and all necessary permits being obtained, while discussions are still going-on regarding the full implementation of certain contract clauses.Over 2018, the contribution to sales of unit start-ups and ramp-ups totaled 270 million euros. The largest contribution came from the start-up of a major Air Separation Unit in South Africa at the end of December 2017.Focus - Start-ups• In December 2017, Air Liquide has started-up the world's largest oxygen production unit for Sasol, an international integrated energy and chemicals company. Air Liquide invested around 200 million euros for the construction of this unit, with a total production capacity of 5,000 tonnes of oxygen per day in Secunda (around 140 km East of Johannesburg). Owned and operated by Air Liquide, it is the first time that Sasol has chosen to outsource its oxygen needs to a specialist of industrial gas production at this site.• The start-up of this major unit in South Africa is also a new source of rare gases. In 2018, several multi-year contracts worth a total of more than 50 million euros supplying xenon and krypton have been signed by Air Liquide and the semiconductor and the satellite industries. The semiconductor industry uses xenon or krypton in its new processes to produce high-end flash memories at a lower cost. The all-electric propulsion satellites also use xenon, enabling significant launching costs reduction.• Early September, Air Liquide starts supplying hydrogen in Kazakhstan through the acquisition of hydrogen and purification units with a total capacity of up to 30,000 Nm3/h. This investment of 12 million euros by Air Liquide Munay Tech Gases (ALMTG) marks the first step in the cooperation between Air Liquide and KazMunayGaz (KMG). The hydrogen and steam produced will be delivered to the Pavlodar Oil Chemistry Refinery (POCR) in the context of a long term Gas Supply Agreement.INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIESThe 12-month portfolio of investment opportunities totaled 2.6 billion euros, as of December 31, 2018, up 500 million euros compared with 2017, despite a particularly high level of investment decisions. Indeed, new projects in the portfolio represented amounts that exceeded those signed by the Group, awarded to the competition or delayed. The portfolio of investment opportunities had not reached this level since the end of 2015.The Americas remained the leading region within the portfolio with more than one third of opportunities followed by Asia, which increased its relative share. Opportunities mainly came from the chemicals and metals industries in Large Industries, which represented two thirds of the portfolio, and from the integrated circuit industry in Electronics.Around half of projects had investments of less than 50 million euros and five projects had investments of between 100 and 150 million euros. The average size of projects was down compared with prior years to around 20 million euros, which contributed to a better distribution of risk and ensures more regular future growth. The portfolio of opportunities also included some takeovers that would have a faster contribution to growth.2018 Financing"A" CATEGORY RATING CONFIRMEDAir Liquide is rated by two main rating agencies, Standard & Poor's and Moody's. The long-term rating from Standard & Poor's for Air Liquide is "A-" and from Moody's "A3". These are in line with the Group's strategy. Moreover, the short-term ratings attributed to Air Liquide are "A2" for Standard & Poor's and "P2" for Moody's. Standard & Poor's, on October 11, 2018, and Moody's, on June 18, 2018, confirmed their ratings and have maintained their stable outlook.DIVERSIFYING AND SECURING FINANCIAL SOURCESAs of December 31, 2018, financing through capital markets accounted for 94% of the Group's total debt, for an amount of bonds outstanding of 12.4 billion euros, across all programs, and 0.7 billion euros of commercial paper.As of December 31, 2018, the total amount of credit facilities had increased significantly, from 3.1 billion euros, to 3.6 billion euros. The amount of bilateral credit facilities decreased from 1.8 to 1.6 billion euros, as one facility reached maturity, and was renewed for an amount that was 0.2 million euros lower. The Group also renewed a syndicated credit facility, taking the amount from 1.3 billion euros to 2 billion euros. This facility will mature in December 2023, and has two extension options of one year each.As of December 31, 2018, the amount of total debt maturing in the next 12 months was 2.5 billion euros, stable compared to the amount at December 31, 2017.2018 issuesIn March 2018, Air Liquide Finance successfully completed a first bond issuance on the Chinese mainland market ("Panda") for an aggregate nominal amount of 2.2 billion Chinese renminbi (approximatively 280 million euros). Income from this issue was used to finance new investments and to refinance debt related to previous investments in China.Moreover, as of the end of 2018, outstanding bonds issued under the EMTN program amounted to 5.9 billion euros (nominal amount).Net indebtedness by currency as of December 31  12/31/2017 12/31/2018Euro 31% 45%US dollar 52% 37%Chinese renminbi 5% 3%Japanese Yen 3% 3%Other 9% 12%TOTAL 100% 100%Investments are generally funded in the currency in which the cash flows are generated, creating a natural currency hedge. In 2018, US dollar debt decreased markedly, following the financing in euros of a share of debt in US dollar contracted for Airgas acquisition. The weighting between the euro and the US dollar has thus shifted in favor of the euro. Moreover, the debt in US dollars has benefited from a favorable currency impact. Debt denominated in Chinese renminbi decreased in volume and share, as the cash flow generated was used to repay a portion of the debt. Debt denominated in Japanese yen remains stable.CENTRALIZATION OF CASH AND FUNDINGAir Liquide Finance continued to pool the cash flow balances of Group entities. In 2018, Air Liquide included the Australian dollar in its daily cashpooling, which now contains 14 currencies.As of December 31, 2018, Air Liquide Finance had granted, directly or indirectly, the equivalent of 15.4 billion euros in loans and received 4.4 billion euros in excess cash as deposits. These transactions were denominated in 28 currencies (primarily the euro, US dollar, Singapore dollar and Chinese renminbi). The direct and indirect scope (including subsidiaries where cashpooling is carried out locally before being centralized at Air Liquide Finance) included around 390 subsidiaries.DEBT MATURITY AND SCHEDULEThe average of the Group's debt maturity stood at 5.9 years at December 31, 2018. This is a slight decrease compared with December 31, 2017, due to bond issues which reached maturity in 2018 without renewal, through the use of cash.The following chart represents the Group's debt maturity schedule. The single largest annual maturity represents approximately 18% of total debt.OUTLOOK2018 was a particularly strong year, whether we are looking at sales growth to 21 billion euros and the rise in net profit to 2.1 billion euros or the efficiencies and synergies achieved as well as the high level of industrial investment decisions.Sales growth is the highest since 2011. All activities/businesses are growing, in particular Gas & Services activities, which account for 96% of the Group's revenue, with the last quarter particularly dynamic in Electronics and Industrial Merchant. From a geographic perspective, growth was also seen across the board, especially for the Americas and Asia Pacific, particularly China.The Airgas synergies are achieved a year ahead of schedule, confirming that the integration is now successfully completed. In addition, operating efficiency objectives were surpassed, contributing to the improved operating margin in Gas & Services, excluding the energy impact. As of 2019, the annual efficiency objective is raised to 400 million euros for the Group, which is 100 million euros more than the objective initially announced in the NEOS program.Cash flow grew and contributed to a significant reduction in the debt ratio, to 69%. The Group's balance sheet is strong and its ROCE improved, reaching 8.3% excluding the currency impact, in line with the NEOS objective.In a context where industrial opportunities remain substantial, the Group's investment decisions reached more than 3 billion euros. Investment backlog amounted to 2.2 billion euros, supporting future growth.Accordingly, assuming a comparable environment, Air Liquide is confident in its ability to deliver net profit growth in 2019, calculated at constant exchange rate.APPENDICESEstimated impact of IFRS16 on the fiscal year 2019As of January 1, 2019, the Group financial statements will include the impacts of the mandatory adoption of the standard IFRS16 « Leases » issued on January 13, 2016. The Group will not restate the financial statements of prior periods. The standard will not affect the recognition of revenue for the Group as a leaser, as mentioned in the 2017 Reference Document (page 229). The main impact of the application of IFRS16 for the Group as a lessee consists of the recognition on the balance sheet of all lease contracts, without distinction between finance and operating leases. In the course of its activity, the Group as a lessee enters in contracts mainly for the following type of assets:• Land, buildings and offices;• Transportation equipment, in particular for Industrial Merchant and Healthcare;• Other equipment.Any contract containing a lease leads to the recognition on the lessee's balance sheet of a lease liability measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments and a right-of-use asset measured at the amount equal to the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of any prepaid or accrued lease payments as well as of any provision for onerous leases recognized in the balance sheet as of December 31, 2018.Data collection and quantitative analysis of the impacts on the Group's financial statements are being finalized but the Group anticipates the following impacts:• Consolidated Balance Sheet: The Group estimates that the first application of IFRS16 would lead to the recognition on January 1, 2019, of a right-to-use and a lease liability in the range of 1.3-1.5 billion euros.• Consolidated Income Statement. The operating expenses linked to lease contracts will from now on be accounted for as Depreciation & Amortization and Finance Costs:• The Operating Margin before Depreciation & Amortization1 should increase by approximately +100 basis points;• The Depreciation & Amortization on Revenue ratio should increase by approximately +100 basis points;• The Operating Income Recurring (OIR) should increase slightly, the impact of which on the OIR on sales ratio should be limited to a maximum of +10 basis points;• The Group does not expect any material impact on the Net Profit.• Return on Capital Employed (ROCE): with the recognition of an additional debt, the ROCE should decrease by -10 to -20 basis points.3 Operating Income Recurring before Depreciation & Amortization on RevenueCurrency, energy and significant scope impacts (Year)Applied methodIn addition to the comparison of published figures, financial information is given excluding currency, natural gas and electricity price fluctuation and significant scope impacts.• Since industrial and medical gases are rarely exported, the impact of currency fluctuations on activity levels and results is limited to euro translation impacts with respect to the financial statements of subsidiaries located outside the euro zone. The currency effect is calculated based on the aggregates for the period converted at the exchange rate for the previous period.• In addition, the Group passes on variations in the cost of energy (electricity and natural gas) to its customers via indexed invoicing integrated into their medium and long-term contracts. This indexing can lead to significant variations in sales (mainly in the Large Industries Business Line) from one period to another depending on fluctuations in prices on the energy market.An energy impact is calculated based on the sales of each of the main subsidiaries in Large Industries. Their consolidation allows the determination of the energy impact for the Group as a whole. The foreign exchange rate used is the average annual exchange rate for the year N-1.Thus, at the subsidiary level, the following formula provides the energy impact, calculated for natural gas and electricity respectively:Energy impact = Share of sales index to energy year (N-1) x (Average energy price over the year (N) - Average energy price over the year (N-1))This indexation effect of electricity and natural gas does not impact the operating income recurring.• The significant scope effect corresponds to the impact on sales of all acquisitions or disposals of a significant size for the Group. These changes in scope of consolidation are determined:• for acquisitions during the period, by deducting from the aggregates for the period the contribution of the acquisition,• for acquisitions during the previous period, by deducting from the aggregates for the period the contribution of the acquisition between January 1 of the current period and the anniversary date of the acquisition,• for disposals during the period, by deducting from the aggregates for the previous period the contribution of the disposed entity as of the anniversary date of the disposal,• for disposals during the previous period, by deducting from the aggregates for the previous period the contribution of the disposed entity.(in millions of euros) FY 2018 FY 2018/2017 Published Growth Currency impact Natural gas impact Electricity impact Significant scope impact FY 2018/2017 Comparable GrowthRevenue              Group 21,011 +3.3% (752) 186 93 (98) +6.1%Impacts in %     -3.6% +0.9% +0.4% -0.5%  Gas & Services 20,107 +2.4% (733) 186 93 (98) +5.2%Impacts in %     -3.7% +0.9% +0.5% -0.5%  Operating Income Recurring            Group 3,449 + 2.5 % (142) - - (26) + 7.6 %Impacts in %     -4.2%     -0.8%  Gas & Services 3,679 + 2.6 % 141 - - (26) + 7.3 %Impacts in %     +3.9%     -0.7%  The operating margin excluding energy impact corresponds to the operating income recurring on sales excluding energy.

Facebook and Data Mining: Is Anything Private?; Are Facebook, Google, and other online giants simply too big and too ubiquitous to suffer the traditional economic penalties for violating public trust? If so, we are on a slippery slope indeed.Datamation.comFebruary 19, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 Quinstreet, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1018 wordsByline: Mike MatchettBodyFacebook knows us. Exceptionally well.Facebook tracks who we talk to, what we talk about, what we like, what we're interested in. It tracks where we are and what transactions we conduct. Facebook can pick your face out of other people’s pictures and automatically tag you in media. It can even find you in the background of crowd shots (“isn’t it cool that I’ve been tagged in so many pictures?”).After gathering all this personal data, who does Facebook sell it to? Any buyer who can afford it. Even foreign actors, as we saw in the 2016 election. If there's a small smidgen of our intimate life that Facebook can sell, it will do so.Yet here's the irony: Facebook recently posted continued growth and profit numbers for the last year. It reported that over two billion people use its online properties every day. So it appears that users don't care that their personal data is sold freely – or more accurately, don't fully understand the ramifications.Think about it: Facebook is enabling the subversion of our highly personal social networks for profit and undue political influence. Which raises the questions: Is consumer capitalism – with any sense of safeguards – working anymore? Are the likes of Facebook, Google, and other online giants simply too big to suffer economic penalties for violating public trust? If so, we are on a slippery slope indeed.Even if we accept that by sharing personal data we’ll receive more targeted advertising, we face a huge challenge. Namely, Facebook's reach and potential misuse of personal data is now creating a real threat to our fundamental ideas of individual freedom and liberty.Harvesting All of UsIt’s not that we haven’t been warned about the dangers of sharing personal data online. And many of us do take precautions with some of our sensitive data. Yet as a group we think all those online complimentary services are worth the loss of privacy, bit by bit.So Facebook (and other Web giants) accumulate all our personal data points over time. The more data there is in one place, the more value it has for data mining. Over time, and in context of other individual data points, it becomes            Big Data. Using            data integration, it's then mixed on the back-end with other data sources that, as end-users, we'll never be aware.Increasingly, identifiable data collection is happening in more dimensions than are ever understood by most users. Some apps now offer “general” surveys or take note about group preferences, but are really harvesting detailed notes that track us individually. These apps, we know, use data analytics to analyze "friends of friends" comments to compile data about us. They even determine our current emotional state from textual analysis or online behavior. It’s now possible to correlate how sad or depressed someone might be by analyzing the volume and variety of their online interactions.Are we comfortable with all of this?  Harvesting All of UsLet’s look at China today. The government is building a huge system to track every individual’s social reputation. Why shouldn’t good people be recognized and rewarded? Yet it’s not just a reward. Authorities can use that reputation as a means of direct influence and control – who gets jobs, travel and educational opportunities.The Chinese government can aggregate and mine phone and app online activity, reported recorded personal interactions, and all financial transactions. In China, every individual will be monitored at a micro-level. Everything people do will be auditable forever.Now, back to Facebook: Recently there was an online “fun” app in which users were encouraged to submit two pictures of themselves, 10 years apart. Privacy experts suspect that this was a thinly disguised excuse to collect a massive amount of training data, to train algorithms at a huge scale. Of course, all of this makes that vast Facebook photo library even more commercially valuable. If you submitted your precious selfies, you helped a machine learn how to erode one more layer of your privacy.When we compare China with our freedom-oriented Western culture, are we really aiming to get somewhere much different? I fear that platforms like Facebook have taken us many steps down that darker road.Harvesting All of UsMuch of the data mining we're talking about is about training recognition algorithms. I’m a big fan of the mathematics of machine learning, but I'm not so sure it can be ethically deployed at scale “for good.”  Much has been written about the way machine learning algorithms at scale can be taught prejudices and learn bad behaviors, or used as a pretense and shield for ultimately unethical practices.Beyond that, we should be aware that machine learning is also forming the basis of much of today’s drive towards process automation. Increasingly, intelligent machine-based automation – powered by deep learning and artificial intelligence – will replace many of the jobs of many low-skilled people.I don’t believe in protecting jobs that could otherwise be intelligently automated. But those users who aren’t careful about “donating” their data might find it used to automate them out of relevancy. There could come a time when companies that own the resulting “intelligence” will own everything there is of value.Harvesting All of UsThere is an implied social contract between people that assumes a basic level of goodness in all people. But too many forget that Facebook is a for-profit company, not a trusted confidante or even a neutral platform. Even if we believe that online privacy is already a lost cause, we’d be wise to remember one thing: not everything we do needs to be exposed and handed outright to commercial entities.Trust should be a hard thing to earn, and for trust in third parties, constantly re-validated. We need to keep in mind that passive data sharing is a deliberate trust decision. I’m not suggesting we turn off the Internet, or give up on tech-based networking with our friends and family. But as we said back in my Air Force days – “The price of freedom is eternal vigilance.” Facebook may be where your friends are, but it isn’t your friend.Load-Date: March 27, 2019End of Document

Germany yields to US pressure and plans to ban Huawei networkCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 18, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 725 wordsBody Germany joined its US and British allies and is already taking steps to prevent Huawei from supplying its next-generation mobile phone network, bowing to pressure from Washington to block the Chinese telecommunications equipment manufacturer on fears that the firm perform espionage.  The decision to adopt a much harsher approach to security in the 5G network marks a 180 degree change for Berlin, which was more skeptical than the UK about White House claims that the Shenzhen-based company has links with the Chinese State.  In a statement from the German Ministry of Economy, it was warned that the security of the future 5G network and the products offered by telecommunications providers is "very relevant". The government will be "guided" by such worries in its development of the network.  No decision has yet been made on how the security of the 5G network is to be guaranteed, but the announcement came after the United States actively lobbied Berlin to ban Huawei for reasons of national security. Washington argues that the technology of the telecommunications giant can be used by the Chinese government to spy on or carry out cyber attacks.  A bipartisan group of US congressmen recently increased their scrutiny over the Asian company, and warned that Huawei's solar equipment poses a threat to the security of the US power grid.  The Huawei team is already largely banned from the systems and contractors of the United States government. In November, the United Kingdom, which is the oldest European market of the Chinese group, demanded arrangements that the company must make to continue operating in the country.  But until now Berlin had remained quiet publicly at the idea of joining its Anglo-American allies. In October, Günter Krings, Deputy Interior Minister, wrote to the Bundestag (Federal Parliament) that there was "no concrete legal basis" to exclude any particular equipment supplier from the development of 5G in Germany "and was not planned for any" .  But, as the final deadline for the deployment of the 5G network in Germany approaches, the government's position hardened. The spectrum licenses are going to be tendered in the spring, telecommunications companies need to be clear by then to know with which providers they can work. The initiative was first reported by the German newspaper Handelsblatt.  This week, the founder and president of Huawei, Ren Zhengfei, broke his silence about the accusations against the telecommunications company. He noted that "he has never received any request from any government to provide undue information."  His comments came weeks after Meng Wanzhou, his daughter and chief financial officer of Huawei, was arrested in Canada on charges in the United States of violating US sanctions against Iran.  Zhengfei, a 74-year-old former Chinese army engineer, also denied that China's new national security law requires Huawei to build back doors on its equipment in order to gather electronic intelligence.  Members of the opposition Parliament in Germany said they were pleased that the government took seriously the security concerns that exist about Huawei.  "For too long, the government underestimated the explosive nature of this problem," said Katharina Dröge, a Green Party parliamentarian. He called on the ministers "to finally publicly say what they think about Huawei participating in the development of 5G."  Last month, Deutsche Telekom said it would reassess itssystem for the acquisition of network equipment. A spokesman said the company "takes the global debate about the security of network elements made by Chinese producers very seriously."  The European Union is also increasingly concerned about Huawei. Andrus Ansip, Brussels' top technology policy official, recently warned that Beijing's intelligence services could order Chinese groups to build backdoors in their systems.  Australia and New Zealand, which are members of the Five Eyes intelligence exchange network, along with Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom, have already prevented Huawei from forming alliances with local telecom operators. Huawei announced last month that it would spend $ 2 billion to reform its system in order to satisfy the concerns of the British, but the UK has yet to publicly review its directive.  Additional information from Kiran Stacey in Washington. Load-Date: January 18, 2019End of Document

On Thursday, British spy agency Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) published a scathing report detailing security concerns about Huawei as it seeks to roll out its next-generation 5G networks.In the report, the agency said it found "further significant technical issues" in Huawei's engineering processes as well as "concerning issues" with the company's software.Several other allies have also weighed in on Huawei concerns as they seek to expand their own 5G networks.On Tuesday, the EU released guidelines to member states for the development of their ultra-fast networks in the coming years. It urged member states to assess cyber threats to their infrastructure, and that information should be shared with other EU countries in order to develop a set of "mitigating measures," though it didn't mention Huawei by name.In recent months, Australia has banned Huawei and ZTE from supplying tech for their networks, citing major security risks.New Zealand has also turned down a proposal for one of its major telecom carriers to use Huawei gear in its planned 5G mobile network, but the country has not ruled out using the tech giant in future internet network upgrades if security risks are addressed.Huawei's CEO pushed back on concerns about its 5G network on Friday, saying: "Cyber security and user privacy protection are at the absolute top of our agenda. We are confident that the companies that choose to work with Huawei will be the most competitive in the 5G era.""The easiest way to bring down a fortress is to attack it from within. And the easiest way to reinforce it is from outside."NOW WATCH: Watch Google's Stadia video-game-platform event in 5 minutesSee Also:• Huawei's crazy new phone ditches the ear speaker and lets you hear calls through a vibrating screen• Hands-on with Huawei's P30 Pro, which has 4 cameras and takes calls through a vibrating screen• No sleep, no sex, no life: Tech workers in China's Silicon Valley face burnout before they reach 30SEE ALSO: The EU is ignoring US calls to boycott Huawei in its 5G roll-out despite security concernsLoad-Date: March 29, 2019End of Document

High speed shockCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 17, 2019 SundayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 874 wordsBody Under the suspicious gaze of Paris and Berlin, Margrethe Vestager was preparing to announce her decision on the expected merger of Alstom and Siemens.  At age 50, the Antimonopoly Commissioner of Europe was playing her political career, started at 21 in small Denmark. Now he was about to face not only two European business icons, but also the governments of France and Germany. "Nothing can justify Brussels blocking this merger," said the French finance minister. His German pair did not stay behind: "Berlin wants this merger to take place".  But Vestager does not intimidate easily. His credentials have earned him the nickname of Tsar of free competition. A few weeks after arriving in Brussels, he accused Google of abuse of a dominant position. Among his trophies he has cases against Fiat, Starbucks, Amazon and Apple. The latter was forced to disrupt a tax scheme in Ireland and pay more than € 13 billion, against the will of the Irish government. He even pursued Gazprom, the Russian state-owned giant and main gas exporter to Europe, for uncompetitive practices.  For some, their excess of power is worrisome. Among its victims are hundreds of former employees of Cyprus Airways, the airline that Vestager pushed to bankruptcy when forced to return the € 65 million that had received from the government of the small island as support in the process of restructuring.  The case of Alstom-Siemens is probably the most relevant of the European Commission since its founding in 1989. The Franco-German approach was triggered by the formation of CRRC, the industrial champion created by the Chinese government in 2015 when it merged its two train companies. Just as Bismark unified Germany by creating a common enemy in Napoleon III's France, the two European rivals agreed to join forces to face the Chinese competitor who threatens them. "We need big players, European industrial champions, who can beat them with the competition of their competitors in the United States and China," justified a German minister.  Margrethe Vestager, a few days ago, blocked the merger of Alstom and Siemens on the basis of high market concentrations in Europe, disdaining the threat of the Chinese competitor.  The criticisms were not left waiting. "This reflects the totally naïve mentality of the European Union. The system is upside down, "said the CEO of Siemens. "A political and economic error," said the French finance minister, who along with his German counterpart just announced a proposal to change European antitrust legislation, promoting a veto of political authority over the Commission.  The convulsions of Alstom-Siemens are relevant, embodying various tensions of the current political-economic order.  First, the accumulation of power in economic institutions without democratic representation has generated growing apprehensions. Along with the army and justice, organizations such as Central Banks and Antitrust Commissions have concentrated a huge power in the hands of leaders who do not respond directly to the votes. In its epic against the great financial crisis, the FED defined policies that by nature left winners and losers. Something similar happens in the case of Vestager. His decision has also left losers - clearly Alstom and Siemens, but also their governments - by favoring users of railway projects. Paul Tucker, a Harvard professor, offers an interesting reflection in his recent book Unelected Power on the legitimacy of power accumulated by democratically elected technocrats and regulators.  Second, the accelerated influence of Chinese state capitalism in the globalized economy has dislocated some aspects of the economic system of liberal democracies. Among them, thefree competition, but also tax, social and regulatory burdens.  While the European Union is committed to keeping corporate giants at bay, China has empowered and fostered them, enabling the development of greater economies of scale. In the production of trains, CRRC is not only the largest in the world in sales, but also the one that has more experience and its technology is on the border of high-speed trains.  But the main problem after the conflict between Vestager and the two main European governments is not only the Chinese creation of business champions, but the reduction in the technological and human capital gap between China and Europe. Asian proximity increases the pressures on European social, tax and regulatory burdens. For companies, it's like running in shackles against athletes who are putting on nail shoes.  In France, for example, for every € 100 of labor cost, the State takes half of it in social charges and collects the corresponding income tax for the remaining € 50. That is why the Yellow Jackets are in the streets. Not to mention union regulations and procedures.  The most paradoxical of Vestager's decision is that it has not only defended free competition on high-speed trains, but also reaffirmed the need to let the company compete more freely. Free of inefficient tax systems, burdensome social burdens and bureaucratic regulations. Thus, Vestager has made European governments more competitive with their rising global competitors.  The high-speed crash entry was first published in La Tercera. Load-Date: February 17, 2019End of Document

Xenophobia is backThe Stanford Daily: Stanford UniversityFebruary 7, 2019 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 1159 wordsByline: Terence ZhaoBodyThis morning, I was sent an innocuous-looking op-ed in the Stanford Review from more than a week ago, entitled "How China Leverages Stanford's Expertise in Artificial Intelligence." With a title like that, I expected the piece to be about some specific, concrete incidents of tech transfers or even thefts (like this Daily piece on Huawei, for example). I was shocked by what I found instead: a piece that accuses "U.S. technological education centers" of "aiding Chinese governmental oppression" by way of Chinese international students returning home, labels these students in the US a "national security risk," and compares teaching them to training nuclear engineers for the Kremlin during the Cold War.To start, I want to note that it is important to talk about concrete cases of US-China disputes with regards to technology, patents, trade practices and espionage and how they relate to Stanford, especially in an era when US-China relations have become noticeably more tense. However, this Review article mentions no such specifics. Instead, it collectively labels all of the more than 350,000 Chinese nationals currently studying in US universities a security risk based on no evidence whatsoever; if that is not discrimination based on national origin, I do not know what is. I can't vouch for the innocence of all 350,000 of these students any more than the author of the article can presume their guilt based on, again, no specific evidence. And, frankly, given that our legal system presumes innocence until proven otherwise, I would argue my way feels far more American.I do find it interesting and ironic that the author would bring up nuclear engineering, because while American universities did not train nuclear scientists for the USSR, there is one country that it did do that for: China. The father of the Chinese nuclear program, H.S. Tsien, was originally a professor at Caltech when the fever of McCarthyism infected the United States. Tsien was under investigation starting in the early 1940s, culminating in his application for naturalization being denied and his security clearance being revoked, even as the rest of his extended family was naturalized. One of his nephews, Roger, was a professor at UCSD and was winner of the 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry; another nephew, Richard, was the director of the Brain Research Center at Stanford and now teaches at NYU; their father, H.C., was the chief engineer at Boeing.H.S. Tsien, meanwhile, was unable to continue his research without clearance, and moved back to China after a disgraceful 5-year house arrest, during which he also had to fight trumped-up charges of espionage. As then head of the US Secretary of the Navy Dan A. Kimball put it, "[forcing Tsien out] was the stupidest thing this country ever did. He was no more a Communist than I was, and we forced him to go."And stupid it was.Tsien arrived in China in 1955 and became the so-called "father of Chinese rocketry." Within ten years, China became a nuclear power. He also lived to see, in 2003, the first Chinese taikonaut in space, propelled there by a rocket based on his designs.I don't want to give the impression that Tsien has been the only scientist of Asian descent to have their life and career destroyed by false espionage charges. Rather, these false espionage charges represents a sadly familiar pattern of perceptions of "yellow peril." Just a few years ago in 2015, Professor Xiaoxing Xi, the Chair of the Physics department at Temple University, was arrested and accused of giving restricted technology to China, only for those charges to be proven false by his colleagues less than four months later (Xi's daughter, Joyce, actually came to Stanford to speak on several occasions). It was a case that drew parallels with that of Professor Wen Ho Lee, who received $1.6 million in damages (and an extraordinarily long apology from the judge and admissions of fault by then president Bill Clinton) after being false jailed based on charges of espionage. The secrets that Lee was falsely charged with stealing were, ironically, pertaining to US nuclear technology, even though nothing has done more to advance Chinese nuclear technology than that act of xenophobic paranoia against H.S. Tsien all those decades ago; and, more importantly, this pattern of false accusations of espionage that is apparently still being perpetuated today shows that we have learned nothing from "the stupidest thing" this country has ever done in all those decades.What xenophobes and bigots never seem to understand is that the biggest threat to America isn't whatever Other they've chosen to demonize for the day - it is themselves. H.S. Tsien did not leave the United States because he was a spy. He left because he was forced out by a xenophobic and paranoid McCarthyism that is fundamentally and diametrically opposed to the values of openness, diversity and pluralism that this country was supposed to stand for - values for which so many immigrants who have built this country up to become what it is today believed it stands for when they came.America has been a welcome refuge and destination for people from all parts of the world because of the diversity and pluralism that it has been able to foster. This is not only what has made this country strong, it has defined our values and our national identity - an identity that the xenophobic grumblings of people like the author of this piece severely undermines. The "yellow peril" stereotype may be centuries old, but the pain felt by people of Chinese descent in America is constantly renewed. In an environment like this, it should not be surprising why people are still coming to the US for travel or to get educated, but not to stay or settle. And, at the end of the day, why would anyone want to stay in a place where they will be accused as being hostile foreign agents for no reason?The author of the Review article points to "the rapid drop in the percentage of [Chinese] students staying stateside after graduation" as "cause for concern," and further accused the Chinese government of being "odious." I can only hope that he would consider the possibility that maybe folks aren't staying because they don't feel welcome in a country where people like him feel emboldened to categorically accuse entire groups of people of being foreign spies without so much as a shred of actual evidence. That, I would argue, is pretty odious too.Contact Terence Zhao at zhaoy 'at' stanford.eduWhile you're here...We're a student-run organization committed to providing hands-on experience in journalism, digital media and business for the next generation of reporters.
