Corporations Tiptoe around Hong KongThe Journal: University of Illinois - SpringfieldOctober 22, 2019 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: TOP-STORIES; Pg. 1Length: 405 wordsByline: Spencer VoylesBodyStarting in late March and continuing in the present, the citizens of Hong Kong have been peacefully protesting China's attempts to gain further political control over the territory. As these months long protests for sovereignty continue, vocal activist support for the movement has faced increasing resistance from global corporations.This censorship gained public transaction after Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey tweeted his support for protesting citizens. In response to this, the Chinese Basketball Association, which the NBA has been building business ties with, threatened that they would cease cooperation with the Rockets. This initial response was backed by a further threat from China's consulate general who stated that the team should "clarify and immediately correct the mistakes." Following these two threats, Morey deleted his tweet and the NBA issued an apology claiming that these statements "deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China." As of now, the NBA has withdrawn its policy of censorship after intense criticism, but they are not the only company giving into China's censorship demands.Other examples of this corporate censorship include tech conglomerate Apple choosing to remove an app that protesters used to track police movements and Vans' choice to remove a shoe design from their Custom Culture competition due to its depiction of protesters. In response to this mass corporate censorship, pro Hong Kong activists are calling for both a boycott of these companies and a unique form of protest.After media company Activision Blizzard suspended professional Hearthstone player Chung 'blitzchung' Ng Wai for his vocal support of the pro-democracy protests, fans began a campaign to get one of the companies IP's banned in China. Activists have recently been circulating edited images of the Overwatch character Mei wearing protestor slogans. Activists are hoping that these critical images will cause the Chinese government to ban the company altogether. Whether or not this strategy will work remains to be seen. As of now, fan outcry has caused Blizzard to shorten the ban it has imposed on blitzchung from a year to six months, but it has yet to reinstate two commentators who were fired after interviewing blitzchung. If you want to support the boycotts currently occurring, ad blocker friendly lists of companies supporting China can be found on the tech news site Mashable.Load-Date: October 22, 2019End of Document

House Commerce Subcommittee Issues Hearing Memo on Legislating to Secure Wireless FutureTargeted News ServiceSeptember 25, 2019 Wednesday 8:40 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2670 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on Communications and Technology issued the following hearing memorandum:To: Subcommittee on Communications and Technology Members and StaffFr: Committee on Energy and Commerce StaffRe: Hearing on "Legislating to Secure America's Wireless Future"On Friday, September 27, 2019, at 9:30 a.m. in the John D. Dingell Room, 2123 of the Rayburn House Office Building, the Subcommittee on Communications and Technology will hold a hearing entitled, "Legislating to Secure America's Wireless Future."I. KEY FCC SPECTRUM ISSUES AND PROCEEDINGSElectromagnetic spectrum--often referred to only as spectrum--is used to deliver radio, broadcast television (TV), cellular, and wireless broadband internet services, including 5G wireless technology. There is a finite amount of spectrum available. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) manages the commercial use of spectrum1 while the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) manages federal use.2Wireless service providers are seeking a range of spectrum bands (low, mid, and high) to deploy 5G services.3 Some others would like for that spectrum to be reserved for unlicensed use or made available for shared use.4Depending on the frequency, spectrum has different characteristics. High-band spectrum fades over shorter distances and is less able to penetrate buildings and trees than mid- or low-band spectrum, which can travel over greater distances without being deflected by obstacles.The existing contiguous blocks of low- and mid-band spectrum available for commercial use will not necessarily be able to keep up with the growing demand for data.5A. Licensed SpectrumRecently, the FCC has taken a series of actions to make more mid- and high-band spectrum available for licensed 5G wireless broadband services. In July the Commission adopted an order that made the 2.5 GHz band, which had previously been reserved for educational entities, available to commercial entities and also established a priority filing window for rural Tribal Nations, to be followed by a public auction of any remaining unassigned spectrum.6 Similarly in March, the FCC held an auction for terrestrial wireless licenses in the 24 GHz band (despite some controversy regarding the effects commercial services might have on the adjacent weather band).7 The FCC intends to hold an incentive auction this coming December for wireless broadband licenses in the upper 37, 39, and 47 GHz bands.8 The Commission also has an open proceeding in which it is considering making portions of the C-Band available.9B. Unlicensed SpectrumUnlicensed spectrum can be used for a variety of useful services, from wireless microphones in theaters and stadiums to wireless broadband services in remote areas of the country. The FCC has determined that unlicensed uses should be able to share spectrum with licensed services in some places and under certain conditions.The Commission has made certain spectrum available for unlicensed and shared use in the 3.5 GHz band through a novel, three-tiered spectrum-use co-existence program that automatically coordinates shared Federal and non-federal use of the band.10 During the Broadcast Incentive Auction, the FCC decided to make available for unlicensed use a portion of the 600 megahertz band--the TV White spaces.11 Finally, the Commission is considering making the 6 GHz band available for unlicensed or shared use.12 The 6 GHz band is currently used for non-federal services, including public safety, coordination of railroad train movement, and control of natural gas and oil pipelines, among others.13 The FCC has yet to complete that rulemaking.II. TELECOMMUNICATIONS SUPPLY CHAIN SECURITY ISSUESUnited States communications service providers rely heavily on equipment and services manufactured and provided by foreign companies. The increasingly globalized market for telecommunications equipment and services has increased competition and opened the door to cheaper goods for consumers but poses new challenges for the United States, particularly for ensuring the security of the telecommunications supply chain.Given the pivotal role that private communications networks serve in connecting U.S. critical infrastructure functions, American networks are appealing targets for foreign adversaries. The United States, therefore, has a clear interest in mitigating threats posed by vulnerable communications equipment and services.In particular, the United States identified individual Chinese telecommunications firms, including Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd (Huawei) and its affiliates, as posing significant threats to U.S. commercial and security interests.14 Their susceptibility to state influence over business operations results in China having "the means, opportunity, and motive to use telecommunications companies for malicious purposes," such as espionage and cyberattacks.15 In April 2018, the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission found that thealso Federal Communications Commission, In the Matter of Promoting Investment in the 3550-3700 MHz Band, GN Docket No. 17-258, FCC 18-149 (Oct. 24, 2018), para. 3.Chinese government has "invested significant state capital and influence" on state-owned enterprises to strategically place these companies in the U.S. telecommunications supply chain.16Large telecommunications companies with sophisticated network security operations and significant capital generally have avoided installing and using Huawei and other suspect foreign equipment in their networks.17 Moreover, Federal agencies have actively reached out to large carriers to express concerns when carriers have considered purchasing suspect equipment.18 In contrast, some smaller carriers with more limited resources and less sophisticated security operations have purchased and installed Huawei, and other suspect foreign equipment, in their networks either because the equipment was less expensive or they were unaware of the security risk, or both.19On May 15, 2019, the White House issued an Executive Order prohibiting "any acquisition, importation, transfer, installation, dealing in, or use of any" information or communications technology involving equipment developed through foreign adversaries.20 The same day, the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry Security announced it would add Huawei and its affiliates to its Entity List, limiting their ability to access U.S. exports.21III. LEGISLATIONA. H.R. 4462, the SHARE Act of 2019Reps. Doyle (D-PA) and Latta (R-OH) introduced in the House on September 24, 2019, H.R. 4462, the "Studying How to Harness Airwave Resources Efficiently Act of 2019" or the "SHARE Act". The SHARE Act would require NTIA, in consultation with the FCC, to establish a spectrum sharing research and development program to explore new ways for Federal entities to share and inventory spectrum with other Federal entities. The legislation would authorize an appropriation to NTIA in the amount of $50 million to establish the spectrum sharing research and development program. It would also require the FCC to submit a report to Congress on how to improve and expand the spectrum sharing techniques developed for the 3.5 GHz band and consider their applicability to other bands, including 3.1 GHz to 3.55 GHz and 7.1 GHz to 8.4 GHz.B. H.R. 4459, the Secure and Trusted Communications Networks ActChairman Pallone (D-NJ), Ranking Member Walden (R-OR), Rep. Matsui (D-CA), and Rep. Guthrie (R-KY) introduced in the House H.R. 4459, the "Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Act" on September 24, 2019. The Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Act instructs the FCC to develop and maintain a list of communications equipment and services that pose an unacceptable risk to national security and prohibits the use of Federal funds to purchase, rent, lease, or otherwise obtain such equipment and services. The bill also establishes the Secure and Trusted Communications Reimbursement Program to assist communications providers with the costs of removing prohibited equipment and services from their networks and replacing prohibited equipment with more secure communications equipment and services.C. H.R. 4461, the Network Security Information Sharing ActReps. Kinzinger (R-IL) and Doyle (D-PA) introduced in the House the bill H.R. 4461, the "Network Security Information Sharing Act" on September 24, 2019. The Network Security Information Sharing Act directs the Secretary of Homeland Security, in cooperation with the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, NTIA, and FCC, to establish a program to share supply chain security risks with advanced communications service providers and trusted suppliers of telecommunications equipment and services.D. H.R. 2063, the E-FRONTIER ActReps. Cardenas (D-CA), Brooks (R-IN), Vela (D-TX), and Banks (R-IN) introduced in the House the bill H.R. 2063, the "Eliminate From Regulators Opportunities to Nationalize The Internet in Every Respect Act" (E-FRONTIER Act) on April 3, 2019. The E-FRONTIER Act would prohibit the President or any Federal agency from constructing or operating broadband networks or providing wholesale or retail service on a broadband network without prior authorization from Congress.E.

Great to see everybody this morning.KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK: Great to see you, and especially the action in the markets today, I mean, given the fact that the news out of Germany over the past couple of days, especially looks like they're in contraction, what's happening over with Boris Johnson.And looks like Brexit won't be happening for a long time, so it's more, you know, this uncertainty over there, but the markets are shrugging all this off.BARTIROMO: Is this market just focused squarely on a potential deal with China?JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Yes, I think it --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: That's the headline, right --KELLY: Well, for today, because the Fed too, the market has been --DEANGELIS: Right.KELLY: -- most of our returns this year have been predicated on what the Fed is going to be doing, because it hasn't come through on earnings, right? So, if you think about how everyone's like, keep cutting, keep cutting, keep cutting, you know, it supports the lofty valuations that we're trading at which is above historical norms.DEANGELIS: Sorry, even Bullard said yesterday, that if there is a recession, it could be sharper or more pronounced than some people are expecting, and that'll make it difficult for the Fed to reach its two percent inflation target. The markets, kind of, shrugged that off.At this point, they just want to see the China peace because that's the fundamental piece that will matter so much for business, I mean, rates are low right now, so --KELLY: Yes.DEANGELIS: -- there's not much more to go.BARTIROMO: I met -- I met Art Laffer, earlier, when I said Art Laffer thinks if there's a China deal, it's going to be thousands of points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.(CROSSTALK)JONATHAN HOENIG, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: President himself said that if not for the trade war with China, the market --(CROSSTALK)HOENIG: -- could be 10,000 points higher, could be slightly hyperbolic, but there's no -- there's no question. And Maria, to your point, every incremental move we've seen toward the trade deal, you mentioned the waivers China, well, Apple also has been granted a slew of waivers.Every move we make towards away from this trade war, towards a trade deal, the market seems to like it, and wants to head towards those all-time highs.KELLY: And just real quick, the president isn't going to do a deal until we get closer to the election, because why would he, right? And I think you are seeing that happen --HOENIG: Maybe to save some Americans some money? We're being (INAUDIBLE) trade war? Maybe --BARTIROMO: What we need for the holidays, it's going to be a problem if there are tariffs on the products that everybody is buying, right?KELLY: Totally.HOENIG: But I thought China was paying for the tariffs? No?BARTIROMO: Yes, well, we'll see. That's certainly what the administration says.KELLY: He got the Japan deal done, which is good.BARTIROMO: He did. Well, we got to -- we want to wait for an official comment on that --KELLY: Right, of course.BARTIROMO: -- but certainly, it does look like --KELLY: Yes.BARTIROMO: -- time with the Japanese prime minister resulted in a trade deal. We've got all of that coming up this morning.Joining the conversation, the energy secretary, Rick Perry is here, along with former Citigroup chairman and CEO, Sandy Weill, to discuss their partnership in advancing Artificial Intelligence in biomedicine and health research, the host of "VARNEY & COMPANY" Stuart Varney joins us as well. Don't miss a moment of it. We've got a big hour coming up.And our top story this half hour is, President Trump speaking at the U.N. General Assembly here in New York City, later this morning. Kristina Partsinevelos is covering the story. She joins us now from the east side of Manhattan, with what to expect. Kristina.KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Yes, it's the 74th U.N. G.A., and what we are seeing today is the president going to arrive around 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time, going to address the General Assembly at 10:15 a.m., but a lot of that speech could be overshadowed by comments about Ukraine, and why the White House withheld $400 million in military aide to Ukraine.There are some reports, allegations, that the president wanted to look into Joe Biden's son. However, sources tell FOX News, that that was really about corruption, corruption in Ukraine, and the reason why they withheld it is because of that, and they released it mid-August, due to what we call an impoundment.So, it's either you have to spend the money or it gets taken away. The president, though, he denied these allegations. Listen to the commentary that he made yesterday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did you tell the Ukrainian leader that they would have the aid only if they investigated Joe Biden and his family?DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: No, I didn't. No, I didn't. I did not make a statement that you have to do this, or I'm not going to give you aid.A perfect phone call with the president of Ukraine, everybody knows it, it's just a Democrat witch hunt, here we go again. They failed with Russia, they failed with recession, they failed with everything, and now, they're bringing this up.(END VIDEO CLIP)PARTSINEVELOS: So, we -- again, I'd like to reiterate that sources tell us it was about corruption. That is the reason why the president, the White House, withheld the military aid to Ukraine.We have a statement from the White House, and that reads, I "The media pushed the Russia lie for almost three years with no evidence, and now they are doing it all over again. These allegations are completely false, but because the media wants this story to be true so badly, they'll once again manufacture a frenzy and drive ignorant, fake stories to attack this president."So, that is going on at 10:15, followed by that speech at 11:15 a.m. We're expecting a bilateral meeting with the prime minister of the U.K., Boris Johnson. But, Maria, as you mentioned at the top of the show, there's drama going on there.The judge ruling that it's illegal to suspend parliament up until October 15th, so there's questions as to whether that meeting will happen. After that meeting, there's another bilateral meeting with India, and then the president is expected to leave here around 3:15 p.m. Eastern Time. Back to you.BARTIROMO: All right, Kristina, thank you. We will check back as news develops. Joining us right now with his thoughts is former senior adviser to the Clintons, MDC Partner CEO and Stagwell Group president and managing partner, Mark Penn. Mark, it's great to have you this morning.MARK PENN, PRESIDENT AND MANAGING PARTNER, STAGWELL GROUP: Good morning.BARTIROMO: What's your reaction to all of this, in terms of the Ukraine call?PENN: Well, look, I think in terms of the Ukraine call, I think you're going to see Democrats move towards some kind of impeachment inquiry here, and these transcripts going to have to come out. I think, typically, the administration has gotten ahead of these stories and put out all the e- mails. They've got to do it this time and do it quickly.BARTIROMO: What would be wrong with giving the transcript of the call to the Congress, as they are asking? The intel.PENN: Well, in general, you wouldn't want to give a transcript with the foreign leaders, but in this case, questions have been raised that have to be answered. There's no stopping these questions at this point.BARTIROMO: Well, you make a really good point because that's what Senator Lindsey Graham said on my show on Sunday, that look, what are we going to do? Start opening up every private call that the president has with the foreign leader? Did we do that with other presidents?PENN: No, and I think that this would be an exception. But real issues have been raised, Democrats are not going to be satisfied. You're seeing moderates move over into an impeachment inquiry. I think they definitely will vote for an inquiry, and the sooner if they can put this story out, the better, they better move -- Congress is going to get the information on this, one way or the other, no question.BARTIROMO: Does it bother you, Mark, and I know you've done a lot of work on this, that the Democrats refuse to focus on the wrongdoing happening at the early -- 2016 in the election, and yet everything this president has done, it's like, oh impeach, and yet, where do we stand on the, you know, Michael Horowitz report, and what took place?PENN: Well, you know, Michael Horowitz has got to take less than two years doing reports if he wants to give us meaningful information on what happened here. You know, I've always thought that the Russia investigation didn't have a real foundation, but I think that's irrelevant to this thing.This thing has got to go forward, information has got to come out, the public and Congress have to be satisfied about it. And Michael Horowitz, where is his report already?BARTIROMO: Yes, you're right.KELLY: So, Mark, I think we are talking about one side of the story, but the other side of the story has to deal with Joe Biden, right? So, do you think there's exposure on his side, you know, with everything coming out that actually could hurt his campaign, going into 2020?PENN: Well, look, I don't know, but The New York Times wrote a pretty tough story, May of 2019, on Biden and the family, and all these financial things, and nothing really happened after that. I think that's going to be raised here, or to be looked at. Again, I don't know these facts, nobody does.I think that everybody here is going to have to take a deep breath and say I want facts, and this time, there's some very specific questions.BARTIROMO: Well, we know -- we know that Hunter Biden got $1-1/2 billion from the Chinese government, right?PENN: Well, I don't know that.BARTIROMO: That we know.PENN: I mean, I've heard that from Rudy Giuliani, and I've heard about this wire transfer and all. This has not yet really been proven to the satisfaction of the American public about what's going on here, and I think, journalists here are going to have to ask questions on all sides, and I expect that's going to happen.And boy, I thought we'd have a little calm period here, with just a war between Iran and Saudi Arabia, and now politics have broken out all over.BARTIROMO: You're right, and there's these fresh calls for impeachment, this time, from seven freshmen Democrats, all writing an op-ed on The Washington Post, where they write this, "If these allegations are true, we believe these actions represent an impeachable offense.We do not arrive at this conclusion lightly, and we call on our colleagues in Congress, to consider the use of all congressional authorities available to us, to address these new alterations, find the truth and protect our national security."PENN: Well, I think that's what you see, moderates moving over --BARTIROMO: Just going beyond the Jerry Nadlers of the world.PENN: An inquiry has to happen here, and these facts have to come out. The good news is, there are probably aren't that many facts. It's not going to take years here, to see the transcript and understand whether or not there was a relationship with the funding.BARTIROMO: Yes, Jonathan.HOENIG: There's been some effort -- Mark, thank you for being with us -- to discredit the whistleblower, president has called him or her partisan, at this point. Does that going to make any hay or will it only be resolved when as you said, the transcripts or, at least, slightly redacted transcript is released? That's the only thing that can (INAUDIBLE) effect.PENN: The story is beyond the complainant or the whistleblower, even if it was third-hand or fourth-hand information. The president has said that he raised the issue. Now, how did he raise that issue, in what context, and whether or not pressure was involved pertaining the funding, or legitimate and specific questions that have to be answered now. It's beyond that.BARTIROMO: All right. So, we are -- we are waiting for answers on. In the meantime, let's talk about the Democrats on the stage, making it tougher now. The DNC is making it tougher for Democrats to qualify for the next round of debates. That next round of debates is in November.New rules rolled out Monday, include the following; individual donations from 165,000 people with at least 600 unique donors in at least 20 states, polling at 3 percent or higher in at least 4 approved national polls. Those polls need to be conducted between September 13th and a week before the debate.Your reaction to this tighter situation or to even get on that stage, who's going to be on that stage?PENN: Well, my reaction is, I think the voters are tightening up the race themselves. I think you see three clear frontrunners in Biden, Sanders and Warren. And then I think, you see, several candidates like Mayor Pete and Harris that have seem to have potential to move, and you don't really see any traction among the rest of the field.So, really, that -- the Democratic voters want this narrowed down, and they want it narrowed to the top candidates.BARTIROMO: Who do you think out of those three; Sanders -- Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and obviously, Joe Biden, who do you think takes on Trump the most?PENN: Look, I think Biden has the best opportunity versus Trump because he is very strong with the working-class voters. The Trump has taken from the Democratic column. I think he's probably the best candidate the Democrats could have in terms of taking on Trump.However, Warren is surging, she's surging in California, poll that just came out today, in Iowa. This is going to be a real race. I'm not sure that anybody is going to have 50 percent going into this Democratic convention.BARTIROMO: I know, you've been saying -- you've been calling for a brokered convention, I know that for a long time. It's amazing how well Elizabeth Warren has done. Jackie.DEANGELIS: If you look at Biden's tone over the last couple of weeks, and obviously, there have been developments with this Ukraine situation. He has taken on a very angry tone, it's almost like he is -- any chance he has in front of the media, he's attacking the president. Is that what it's going to take or is that going to turn people off?PENN: Well, but Joe Biden is the one Democrat everybody likes. He has the highest favorable rating of any of the Democrats and Republicans, and that's 50 percent, but it's still is much higher. And I think, actually, this attack on him now, may cause him to rebound among Democratic voters who will see him targeted --DEANGELIS: But he's being so aggressive. To me, that's a turnoff, when I see that on television.PENN: People wanted to see a little bit more fight from him, and maybe a little bit less aggression from others, because they're worried that he wasn't strong enough to take on Trump, and I think he had to prove that, and I think, actually, this contest here is going to focus it more on Biden versus Trump, and that is good for Biden.KELLY: Yes, I -- just to go back to your point, I think that the Democrats actually need to coalesce around Joe Biden, because I was talking to several Democrats, and they said if Elizabeth Warren gets the nomination, they're not actually going to vote for the president, because their markets-focused guys, and they think she'll be terrible for the economy. Now, it's fascinating to hear them say this because --BARTIROMO: Well, she already said she wants to take out private equity, she wants to -- the whole banks to account.KELLY: I mean, I've talked to nine Democrats that are markets-focused, eight out of the nine of them said they wouldn't actually vote for Elizabeth Warren. They said they wouldn't vote for Trump, so they actually stepped out, and that's a big worry because that's where a lot of the money comes from, during the election cycle. So, what is your take on that?PENN: Well, coalesce and Democrats is not something I would use, in the same sense, at the moment, I think, Democrats go through a primary process, and vet this out. And I think that's going to have to happen here. And remember, Democratic primary candidates are famous for being left in the primaries, moving right in the general. Let's see what happens here.BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. Mark, it's always great to get your insights.PENN: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Mark Penn, joining us there. Coming up, the strike against General Motors, it is causing G.M. an estimated $100 million a day. The company is not the only one taking a hit, we're going to take you live to Detroit with a closer look at the ripple effects of this strike.And then a new era of healthcare, I'll sit down with Energy secretary, Rick Perry, and former Citigroup chairman and CEO, Sandy Weill, on their joint efforts to advance A.I. in medicine. Back in a moment.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. It is now day nine of the General Motors strike, and workers are not the only ones feeling the pain. Fox Business' Grady Trimble is in Detroit this morning. Grady?GRADY TRIMBLE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER: Hey, Maria, we've been talking about the ripple effect of this strike. And this is one of the businesses affected. It's Maine Street Restaurant, and it's just a couple miles from the Detroit Hamtramck facility where we've been bringing you live reports. I want to bring in the owner. This is Nick Lulgjuraj. Tell me what it would be like normally at this time if the strike weren't happening.NICK LULGJURAJ, OWNER, MAINE STREET RESTAURANT: You see one ticket right now. All these racks will be full of yellow tickets, which means they're going to the factories, whether the G.M. or the other factories, the smaller ones that kind of cater to the G.M. you know, plans. But for the most part, it crippled our workforce, it crippled -- basically, we've had to throw a lot of food away because we're a busy restaurant. And it all of a sudden stopped, we lost 70 to 80 percent of the delivery business. And it's affected our inside business from waitresses and waiters, you know, to everybody else.TRIMBLE: And you actually had to cut delivery drivers' hours because the workers do a lot of delivery orders, and they're just not ordering.LULGJURAJ: Yes, exactly. So, in this case, if we do have any orders out of an ordinary meal, my brother Mario or one of the cooks will go deliver it. And we're just cutting back on the prep cook, the ladies on the phone, whether it's wait staff, or whatever.TRIMBLE: Obviously, you're affected by this directly. What would you say to both sides who are, you know, kind of still dragging this on?LULGJURAJ: Honestly, I get both sides, you know, one side has to cater to the investors, which is one thing but the working force, you know, they just want fair wages and they want, you know, good health care. If you guys could come to an agreement, it would help us and everybody around the community. So, try to work whatever problems you got. Have a drink before you negotiate. I think that'll help, you know?TRIMBLE: All right, Nick, thank you for your time. I don't know about that advice, Maria, but we certainly wish them the best here at the restaurant.BARTIROMO: As do we. Grady, thank you so much. Grady Trimble this morning in Detroit. Coming up, the power of artificial intelligence. I'll sit down with Energy Secretary Rick Perry and former city Group Chairman and CEO Sandy Weill on their efforts to advance artificial intelligence for a new era of medicine. Plus, saving up, Americans squirreling away more than ever, but experts are warning that's not necessarily a good thing. We'll tell you why when we come back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Economists are finding Americans are saving more money than they have been spending. And wealthier Americans could be leading the way. The personal savings rate has increased from 3.7 percent in 2007, at the height of the housing bubble, to 8.2 percent in the first seven months of this year. Joining me right now is Ramsey Solutions financial expert, author of "Everyday Millionaires", Chris Hogan. Chris, great to see you.CHRIS HOGAN, FINANCIAL EXPERT, RAMSEY SOLUTIONS: Well, thank you, Maria, it's good to be with you.BARTIROMO: Well, this is good news, right? I mean, you always say we need to sock some money away before we start, you know, paying for other things. Are you happy with the savings rate above eight percent?HOGAN: Well, Maria, part of me says yes, people are hearing me and they know it's important to get out of debt. Because when you get out of debt, you give yourself a raise. And then, you take the next step of building yourself an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses. Now, that's what one part of me says. The other part of me says that this article is simply looking through the lens of big business, not necessarily real families.And what I mean by this is it talks about the wealthiest people are starting to save more, or maybe even invest more. But I don't think this is an indicator of people that are living on Main Street. You know, it says that 38 percent of people don't have an emergency fund. And I know without a shadow of a doubt, 64 percent of Americans can't afford a $500 emergency in cash. So, obviously, people aren't saving enough, so we still have to keep pushing them.DEANGELIS: Chris, let me ask you this. Do you think the trend is just that Americans are becoming more responsible? Or, do you think at the same time, they're worried about a recession looming ahead? And at the same time, it all kind of surprises me because interest rates are so low that savers have been penalized forever, really, for holding on to that money.HOGAN: I think you bring a good point, the fear of recession always causes people to begin to take some action. So, hopefully, people that have lived through the things that we dealt with in '08 and '09, understand that, hey, I need to be prepared. But I would much rather people get focused, then get themselves out of debt first, to attacking the credit cards, attacking the car loans, and then start to focus on saving three to six months of expenses.KELLY: Yes, Chris, it's Kevin Kelly here. What do you make of that? It seems like the household debt is actually going up more significantly than we've seen in the past. So, what is your take on the current balance sheet of the everyday American and everyday Millionaire?HOGAN: Well, I can tell you the balance sheet of the everyday American is we've got -- still got 80 percent of people still living paycheck to paycheck. So, Kevin, people are not acting fast enough. People are strolling. When they try to get out of debt, they're looking at it like, well, I'll do it as I can. No, I want you to sprint, getting out of debt is not about math. It's about momentum. I want you to start to make sacrifices. I want you to start to budget and understand that, hey, this debt is a threat to my future and my dreams. I talked about this on my show, the Chris Hogan Show, but I am talking to people that are waking up and hearing this and they're making changes. The problem is that we're waiting on the government to save the day, and we have to get our own cape. We've got to have a plan for ourselves and our families right now.HOENIG: Yes, Chris, it's Jonathan Hoenig, thank you for being with us. And back in 2005, '06 and '07, it was the housing debt that really affected most Americans. This time around, it's the credit card debt. Does it surprised you, I think to Kevin's point, even as savings rates have ticked up, that credit card debt has exploded in the last decade for most Americans?HOGAN: Well, credit card debt has been there, and it's been a threat for the last 25 years, as it continues to grow. But not only the credit card debt, when we look at student loan debt, we've got a $1.6-trillion time bomb on our hands with the fact of student loan debt. So, if we take the consumer debt, of credit card debts, and car loans, along with student loan debt, what we have are people that are feeling more and more buried and up to their eyeballs in debt. I'm trying to show them how to battle and dig their way out one step at a time.BARTIROMO: All right, we will leave it there. Chris, always some great insights from you. Thank you so much, sir.HOGAN: Thank you.BARTIROMO: We will see you soon, Chris Hogan. Plus, a new era for healthcare, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and former Citigroup Chairman and CEO Sandy Weill will join me next discussing their joint efforts to advance artificial intelligence in medicine. Then, the Fortnum & Mason CEO is here. He will weigh in on how he's kept one of the world's largest department stores successful, despite recent retail woes and tariffs. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Our top story this half an hour, A.I. and healthcare as part of my one-hour A.I. special airing tomorrow night right here on Fox Business. I sat down with IBM CEO Ginni Rometty about her company's investments in healthcare and artificial intelligence.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)GINNI ROMETTY, CEO, IBM: We've been a big investor in healthcare. And a real believer. This is a long road, but this is one of the industry's so badly in need of A.I. It is difficult for a doctor, the amount of data. And so, we've been working away on Watson for Health, and in particular we worked on oncology. It was one of the early things we started on. We're now at 300 hospitals and over 125,000 patients around the world where AI has helped the doctor identify the diagnosis and the appropriate treatment.These are things that you didn't realize before how either infrequently they were done or not done with precision.(END VIDEO CLIP)MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN ANCHOR: My next guests are making major investments in the field. The Sandy Weill Family Foundation is teaming up with the U.S. Department of Energy to invest in AI technology to advance biomedical research.And joining me right now are the principles, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and former Citigroup chairman and CEO Sandy Weill.It's great to have you both here. Thanks so much for joining us.RICK PERRY, U.S. ENERGY SECRETARY: Good to be with you. Thank you.SANDY WEILL, FORMER CITIGROUP CHAIRMAN ANC CEO: Good to be here.BARTIROMO: And, Sandy, I know we go back a long time. You have a history of -- of donating, giving back to health care institutions. Thank you for a lifetime of doing that, number one.Number two, Secretary, what -- tell us about this partnership. You're a sitting energy secretary and you're trying to do a public/private partnership here.PERRY: Yes, what we found a couple of years ago is that we were in about third place on the super computers and the administration made the commitment that that's not good enough. Whoever gets to quantum computing first wins. And so this administration now has increased funding by 45 percent on our super computers.And I was out at the University of California San Francisco, again where Sandy's been a great, extraordinary benefactor from the standpoint of the - - those universities neuroscience school, and it started making some sense that we would o be able to have a public/private partnership with the Weill Family Foundation and the DOE and to be able to work together to create a focus on, in this case, mental health, traumatic brain injury --BARTIROMO: Wow.PERRY: Concussions, CTE, all of those issues, and we're finding some great answers to questions that we just didn't have the computing capacity to -- to answer beforehand.BARTIROMO: Such an important point that you're making because for so many years, we donated and put a lot of time, money and energy into things like heart disease. We figured out that, you know, eating poorly can cause diabetes. And then we started to change our behavior. We figured out that smoke causes cancer. We started to change our -- our behavior.We don't know enough about the brain.PERRY: Yes.BARTIROMO: And -- and to focus on the brain is really important.Sandy, this has been something that's been important for you for years. I know what you've done just here in New York, at New York Presbyterian Hospital.Tell us what you're trying to do.WEILL: I think what we're -- what we're trying to do, I think what we will do, working with the Department of Energy, is to be able to look at a thousand times more information in a very short period of time so that the information is really important to the doctors, they're seeing it in real time rather than weeks later when it's -- where it's not nearly as valuable.And also, I think, you know, I think quantum computing is going to be important in all different areas, whether it's energy or health care or really being able to examine what -- what the issues are and being able to go through a lot more --PERRY: (INAUDIBLE) modeling. You know, we're having a big debate --BARTIROMO: Getting ahead -- getting ahead of it and coming up with a prediction on things.PERRY: On -- on climate. This is a great example of where real science can come in and help us make some (INAUDIBLE). Earthquake predictivity (ph). I mean the idea that we're going to be able to do these predictive modelings. We're going to be predictive modeling on the brain. If this event happens, here's what you can expect to happen.For instance, we're seeing some great work being done on traumatic brain injury again because of what Sandy and his foundation is doing out at UCSF in California with Dr. Jeffrey Manly (ph). He's come up with a device, Maria --BARTIROMO: Wow.PERRY: Take a drop of your blood --BARTIROMO: Yes.PERRY: And even if the MRI does not show a concussion, he can tell definitively whether or not you've been concussed. That's life-changing stuff.BARTIROMO: Sure is.PERRY: And that is now done with the partnership with UCSF, Dr. Manly and Abbott Laboratories. That's the type of cutting-edge technology that's going to come out of this artificial intelligence effort. It makes complete sense for DOE to be involved in this effort because the super computers, four of the fastest super computers of the world, belong to the Department of Energy.BARTIROMO: I get it. I get it. OK, so in my special I spoke with Bill Joy, who back in 1999, going into 2000, wrote an article for "Wired" magazine, and the title of the article was, "Why the Future Does Not Need Us," talking about artificial intelligence.Now, he also said in the special, that the machine can look at a million eyes, and in milliseconds understands which one of the eyes are actually diseased.So I ask you, what can be done in terms of getting ahead of disease, saving people's lives, I think is -- is where you're going with this? And, secondly, what about those people who are worried about this, that a doctor is going to be replaced with a machine, that their jobs are going to go away?PERRY: Yes.WEILL: There will -- there will be some jobs that go away. But like all things in -- this is like an autonomous revolution that we are participating in.BARTIROMO: New jobs will be created.WEILL: New jobs will be created. The standard of living will become better. And people will --PERRY: It's like the buggy whip manufacturer back in the turn of the 20th century.BARTIROMO: Well, even --WEILL: Who's going to take its place?PERRY: Who's going to take its place, right? And I think it all worked out.BARTIROMO: Well, even -- even when you look at 1999, I mean we didn't know half the jobs that are very good jobs today.PERRY: Yes.BARTIROMO: We didn't know about coders. We didn't know about people who are organizing and mining data. You know, there were new jobs created from the digital revolution as well.WEILL: Right. Correct.PERRY: Yes. Human beings are still going to be very much at the -- at the center of all the new innovation, the new technology.WEILL: And --BARTIROMO: But what should people know to arm themselves with the right information so that they're not out of a job and out of a career?PERRY: Yes, I think they ought to be excited about the potential changes that are out there. I mean, for me, that's what this is. I mean this is an exciting time. This is about American innovation and American technology. Nobody else is going to do this the way that we will. And I can promise you that the potential for new jobs, but new places for you and your health, when you think about the challenges that are plaguing us, whether it's cancer. I'll, again, with great confidence say that artificial intelligence in the cure for cancer, it's in there somewhere and it's going to be faster than what we think because these computers are changing exponentially the speed of which we are working together.So all of government is working together on this. We're -- we're focused in on the Department of Energy as the place where AI, because of the computers. But we've got a partnership with the VA. A million veterans program were we've got a million veterans volunteering to give a sample of their blood --BARTIROMO: Yes.PERRY: We go back in, and then we can tell this massive amount of information about them. Veterans, they're out. They've done their duty.BARTIROMO: Yes.PERRY: But we're going to tell them, you've got a real project -- or a real possibility of prostate cancer.BARTIROMO: Unbelievable.PERRY: You've got breast cancer opportunity that's going to happen.BARTIROMO: One of the interviews in my piece was this woman, Regina Barzilay, from MIT, and she had breast cancer. She was a survivor. But now she has come up with an AI powered system that can predict breast cancer cells five years in advance.What are the doctors saying about this? You're in touch with all the doctors. Are they happy to have this additional work?WEILL: I -- I think they're more than happy. They're thrilled.But you asked before, what do we do to train our people? We have to get more women and minorities to take up stem education when they're in high school so that they're trained in coding, so that they know the new jobs. The new jobs pay a lot more money than the jobs that they -- than they would get without having a college education.BARTIROMO: I know right now, MIT, IBM and PWC have all come out with reports on the future of work, trying to explain to people what they need to do in terms of arming themselves with the right information to thrive in this new -- in this new AI world. It is life changing, isn't it?PERRY: Yes. And conventional wisdom gets it wrong from time to time. You know, there's always -- there's always people out there who make a living scaring folks, you know, whether it's on the climate or whatever they're doing. It's on AI, whatever it is, or people who may not be particularly armed with good information but the future is exciting to me. AI is one of the opportunities that -- that we have to be able to do things with our computers to be able to save our children's lives or to make their lives better. I mean, for me, that is incredibly exciting.And the Department of Energy, Sandy Weill's foundation -- by the way, I just want to say something about this guy.BARTIROMO: Yes.PERRY: He is -- he is a great partner. I think some $60 million he and/or his family foundation have given to pay off the debts of young men and women who are going into medical practices. My friend Robert Smith gave a huge amount of money to Morehouse College, and these are the types of people --BARTIROMO: Yes.PERRY: Who, because America and because America is this incredibly great and opportunistic place, these are the things that we're all working together on.BARTIROMO: And he's been doing it for a lifetime.PERRY: The future is good because of that. Sandy, thank you, man.WEILL: You know, I -- thank you. Thank you. And I -- I think we have to become a leader in this --PERRY: Yes.WEILL: Because the -- the country that has the best computers and the best scientists will be the country that ends up being the leader in this world and the --BARTIROMO: Well, I think you make a really important point because I know that the president has earmarked a billion dollars for AI. The first president to put it actually in the budget. I get that. But China is spending much more. So compare where we are on AI to where China is and China is using it in different ways, like, for example, tracking their citizens. Um, facial recognition is debatable.PERRY: Who do you want to get to quantum computing first?BARTIROMO: Right.PERRY: I'll suggest that it needs to be the United States, for a lot of reasons.BARTIROMO: You want a democracy to be getting it. You don't want -- the leading superpower of the world, by the way, being a communist country. But that's what is -- what -- the conversation we're having today.PERRY: That's the stakes.BARTIROMO: Yes.WEILL: But we have to improve our whole education system to make this work. We've got to have everybody being a participant in the economy of the future and not be taught about the economy of the past.BARTIROMO: It goes back to education.WEILL: Correct.PERRY: Yes. And, again, conventional wisdom has gotten it wrong so many times.BARTIROMO: Yes.PERRY: In 2005 they told us we found all of the oil and gas resources that were -- that's a bit of a change.BARTIROMO: Well, we're in a different moment right now.And while I have you, let me ask you about this Saudi-Iran conflict.European leaders are now joining the United States, we think, in terms of blaming Iran for the Saudi oil attacks. This coming as world leaders are convening here in New York at the U.N. General Assembly.Secretary, your reaction to what took place on the Saudi oil fields and the U.S. is, I guess, better equipped today than it has been in a long time.PERRY: Well, maybe ever. And the key here is that, yes, we saw a bump up in the cost of -- of crude. I think, you know, West Texas Intermediate today is about $58 a barrel. But had this happened a decade ago, we would have gone through $100 in just a few days.America's ability to fill the gap here, America producers, should give our country and our allies, great -- good feelings of confidence that America can fill in the needed supplies of this. And, at the same time, we're making some great progress in -- in other areas of energy.Nuclear energy, for instance. We happen to think that -- that small modular (ph) reactors, some, you know, zero emission types of energy, under the president, we've seen a 90 percent increase in renewable energy in this country. So there's a lot of great stories going on out there. The Iranians and individuals who don't want to live under the rules of -- of common, good decency, they need to be held accountable. And that's what this president's doing.BARTIROMO: Sandy, we haven't seen you in a while. What's your -- what's your take on the economy right now? I know you're giving more money away these days than -- than -- than taking any in, but can --WEILL: It's more fun, by the way.BARTIROMO: It's more fun. You're having more fun than you ever have?WEILL: I am. I am.BARTIROMO: Tell me what your -- what your reaction is to sort of the -- the economy today and what you're seeing out there.WEILL: I think the economy is in very good shape. Everybody knows the employment numbers -- unemployment numbers are very, very low. I think we have to figure out a way to make this world a better place and have the U.S. and China get along better and understand each other better. So I -- I think if we can resolve these issues, and we should be able to --BARTIROMO: Yes.WEILL: I think the economy -- you'll see the economy really, really do very well.BARTIROMO: Well, you've worked hard your entire life. You've created an empire for yourself and you've given it away, but a major talking point of the Democratic Party right now in the primary is taxing the wealthy. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders looking to outdo Elizabeth Warren. His wealth tax is actually higher than Elizabeth Warren's wealth taxing. It would apply to net worth above $32 million. It would raise an estimated $4.35 trillion over the next ten years.What do you say to that, Sandy?WEILL: I'm going to give my money away before they get -- get it.BARTIROMO: You're going to -- giving it all away. Good for you.But, seriously, it is a very different philosophy when you look at what you're hearing from the Democrats to what you're hearing from President Trump. Isn't that true?PERRY: Yes. And, listen, socialism doesn't work. It hasn't worked anywhere.WEILL: It's true.PERRY: President Trump is going to be a very loud and proud supporter of capitalism. And we'll let the other side defend socialism.BARTIROMO: Yesterday I was at a meeting and actually I was told that income inequality is actually going down right now. Do you have any confirmation of that? Are you seeing the income inequality tightening at all at this point because I was told by somebody in the Trump administration that' it's actually gone down.WEILL: Well, wages are going up. I mean, so that's helping the very low end of the scale. And that's going up faster than inflation now. So that's a good thing..BARTIROMO: And that's one -- that's one of the key reason.It is great to talk with you both. Sandy Weill, good to see you.WEILL: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Rick Perry, energy secretary, great to see you. Thanks so much. Thanks for all of what you've --WEILL: He's a great man.PERRY: Awe.BARTIROMO: Greet to see the partnership.PERRY: You're a good partner, brother.WEILL: You (INAUDIBLE).BARTIROMO: And be sure to tune in for my special one hour presentation Wednesday night, "Artificial Intelligence: The Coming Revolution." That's tomorrow night at 9:00 p.m. Eastern, right here on Fox Business, where we identify the industries that are getting affected by artificial intelligence.Coming up, Bernie Sanders roll out his wealth tax plan and it is giving Elizabeth Warren a bit of a run for her money. Stuart Varney has a thing or two to say about that. He's up next.And then luxury retailer Fortnum and Mason remaining one of the world's largest department stores, even amid recent retail woes. CEO Ewan Venters will join me on set with his secrets to success.We're back in two minutes' time. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Taxing the wealthy. Bernie Sanders looks to outdo Elizabeth Warren this morning with his own wealth tax.Joining me right now, the host of "VARNEY AND COMPANY," Stuart Varney, to weigh in on that.Just had a billionaire here to react to it as well, Sandy Weill.Stu, good morning.STUART VARNEY, FBN HOST, "VARNEY AND COMPANY": Oh, excellent. Excellent.OK, let me address my comments directly to the wealthy. They're going to fleece you, OK, it's as simple as that.A new form of taxation coming down the pike if we get a president Warren and if we get a president Sanders.Bernie is one-upped Elizabeth Warren. He would now introduce a wealth tax of 1 percent above $32 million net worth, 2 percent from $50 million to $250 million, and way up from there.My point in bringing this up is very simple. This is a new form of taxation. It's a terrible idea. And we'll simply take money off one group and stop them innovating and investing in productive technology and facilities and give it to another group to pay for all the -- for all the social services that Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders want to introduce.It is a rotten idea. Even though it may be temporarily popular, it is a rotten idea. And I hope, dear Lord, that it does not happen.Does that conform with the views of the billionaire on your set?BARTIROMO: Yes, I would say so. He said he's going to give all his money away before they can take it.But, look, you were very clear, they will flees you, bottom line. I think that was very good that you -- you were very direct, Stu.VARNEY: Crazy stuff.BARTIROMO: I know you're going to have more on that in 10 minutes.VARNEY: You will.BARTIROMO: Stuart Varney at the top of the hour. Don't miss "VARNEY AND COMPANY" every day at 9:00 a.m. Eastern right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.But first, we are looking at a retail revival. The Fortnum and Mason CEO joins me here on set. How he's kept one of the world's largest department stores a success despite retail woes for other department stores. He's next.Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.The big business of luxury retail, Fortnum and Mason, a popular London- based grocer and supplier catering to the royal household has been in business for more than 300 years, evolving into a British institution. The company specials in luxury teas, food products, unique homewares, boasting hundreds of partner stores as well.Joining us right now is the CEO of Fortnum and Mason, Ewan Venters.Ewan, it's great to have you. Thanks so much for joining us.EWAN VENTERS, CEO, FORTNUM AND MASON: Good morning.BARTIROMO: How's business even though every day we're talking about how department stores are weakening while people go online? Characterize business for us.VENTERS: Our business is stronger than ever, really. Double digit sales growth now for seven years. Both our physical store business is doing really well, as well as our digital online sales, which reaches 126 countries in the world. But if you're differentiating your product offer, if you've got great quality products, authentic products, a product that tastes fantastic, that's desirable for consumers, then -- then we ought to do well.BARTIROMO: What's the impact of tariffs on your business?VENTERS: Nothing that we can see at this stage really. Ultimately, you know, tariffs will lead into pricing, which, you know, eventually will pass on the consumer. But, for the moment, that's not really affecting our day to day operations. If anything, the pound being quite weak is actually strengthening our business from a tourism perspective in London.And also, you know, you take American consumers shopping online. America is our second biggest market. And New York City in particular is our most important American city for trading at fortnumandmason.com.KEVIN KELLY, BENCHMARK MANAGING PARTNERS: When it comes to your consumers, can you talk about their tastes and preferences? So first -- do they want packages in a day or less or two days or less and are they wanting experiential (ph), because we're seeing a lot of stores now trying to draw in customers because it's the gateway to them by providing an experience.VENTERS: Well, ultimately our -- our business is all about in store experience. You know, Piccadilly is our flagship store. We have a number of satellites around London. Just most recently we opened in the city of London. And in November this year we're opening in Hong Kong. So these strategic outposts, as we might call them, are engaging with consumers. They're creating awareness. They're creating in-store experience, including restaurants, of course, which is a very important part of our business.KELLY: OK.BARTIROMO: Wow, you are in all these hot button places. You're about to open in Hong Kong. Two million protesters taking to the streets last week. Britain's supreme court this morning ruled that Prime Minister Boris Johnson suspended parliament and when he did that, that was actually illegal. So you've got the Brexit showdown in London, the U.K., and then Hong Kong.How is all of this affecting your business?VENTERS: Well, ultimately, we sell the best tea in the world. So a good cup of tea solves (ph) most things.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's only if you belong -- (INAUDIBLE).BARTIROMO: No, but, seriously, do you think Brexit's going to happen?VENTERS: I think Brexit -- well, the great British people are that Brexit should happen. So, I mean, why not? How it will happen, I think, will take -- continue a very different shape.But your observation about Hong Kong, I mean, I'm in and out of Hong Kong a lot at the moment. It's not a city under siege, as it's portrayed in the media. People are still going about their everyday lives. People are still shopping. They're eating out. They're going to their spin (ph) classes. So life isn't as bad as it appears on the cameras.BARTIROMO: An interesting take on that.JONATHAN HOENIG, FOUNDER, CAPITALISTPIG.COM: And, briefly, you don't believe that all the Brexit chaos, some of which Maria alluded to -- I mean this -- these products are quintessentially British. So all this chaos you don't think, big picture, perhaps affects, maybe puts down the British brand, if you will?VENTERS: I'm not so sure. I mean we've been in business for 312 years. You know --BARTIROMO: There you go.VENTERS: A little interruption at a moment I think will be OK. Our products are authentic. They're beautifully made. And they're -- most of them are made in Britain.BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there.Ewan, it's great to have you.VENTERS: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Congrats on keeping up the growth at Fortnum & Mason.Ewan Venters. We'll be right back.Load-Date: September 25, 2019End of Document

NEW AMERICA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL FELLOWS CLASS OF 2020 IN NEW AMERICA'S 20TH ANNIVERSARY YEAR, THE FELLOWS PROGRAM WILL BE SUPPORTING 12 BOOKS,States News ServiceSeptember 5, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 2362 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, D.C. BodyThe following information was released by New America:two films, and its first podcast project. Fellows Press ReleaseSept. 5, 2019Washington, D.C. Today, New America announced its newest class of National Fellows.The Class of 2020 consists of 15 talented individuals who will who pursue projects varying in form and approach. In New America's 20th anniversary year, the Fellows Program will be supporting 12 books, two films, and its first podcast project. This class of National Fellows includes writers, educators, artists, filmmakers, doctors, editors, and scholars who are dedicated to enhancing conversations around the most pressing issues of our time. The full roster of 2020 National Fellows can be found here.New America's Fellows Program invests in thinkers who generate big, bold ideas that have impact and spark new conversations. The Class of 2020 will pursue projects on a wide array of topics, including the legacy of slavery, immigration, mass incarceration, Chinese surveillance, terrorism, medical caregiving, the refugee experience, and more."As we celebrate our 20th anniversary, the New America Fellows Program is an essential bridge between our past and our future," New America CEO Anne-Marie Slaughter said. "The idea of finding and supporting a new generation of public intellectuals who could engage broad audiences on the most important issues of America's future animated our founders and continues today. This latest class of National Fellows is an exciting group of big thinkers and creative storytellers, including many new voices who represent the America we are becoming and reflect the power and possibility of renewal. I am proud and happy to welcome the Class of 2020 to New America.""Every year, we receive hundreds of applications, all worthy of a fellowship, but those projects that stand out are ones that challenge us to think deeply and thoughtfully about pressing social issues," Fellows Program Director Awista Ayub said. "This year's class continues to push their form, whether as a writer, filmmaker, or artist, to tell the stories that force us to stop, take notice, and act."Learn more about the nearly 400 applications we received to the program this year. Read our "Who Applied?: Class of 2020 National Fellows Program Applicants" report here.New America's Fellows Program thanks Eric and Wendy Schmidt, New America's board of directors, Emerson Collective, the Center for the Future of Arizona, Southern New Hampshire University, the 11th Hour Project, Arizona State University's Center on the Future of War, as well as the Political Reform Program for their support this year.The 2020 Class of New America National Fellows:Trevor Aaronson , ASU Future Security Fellow, is working on a book and a podcast series about Americans who joined the Islamic State. Aaronson's previous book, The Terror Factory: Inside the FBI's Manufactured War on Terrorism, documented how federal law enforcement uses informants and sting operations in Muslim communities. His TED Talk about the FBI's counterterrorism practices has been viewed more than 1 million times and translated into 23 languages. Aaronson is a contributing writer at the Intercept and a co-founder of the nonprofit Florida Center for Investigative Reporting. His work has appeared in Mother Jones, Foreign Policy, Al Jazeera English, and the Miami Herald. He was previously a fellow at the Investigative Reporting Program at the University of California, Berkeley.Jessica Bruder , Eric and Wendy Schmidt Fellow, is an associate adjunct professor at the Columbia Journalism School and the author, most recently, of Nomadland: Surviving America in the Twenty-First Century (W.W.

Most are Somali Muslims. Many are refugees. The book follows their rise to the forefront of the American labor movement, examining their struggles through the prism of race, immigration, economic inequality, and anti-Muslim sentiment in the modern American workplace.Josh Chin , National Fellow, is writing a book that examines China's drive to build the world's first surveillance state and what it reveals about state use of data for social control. Chin has spent more than a decade covering China for the Wall Street Journal in print and video. He led a team that won the 2018 Gerald Loeb Award for international reporting for a series exposing the Chinese government's pioneering embrace of digital surveillance.Molly Crabapple , Eric and Wendy Schmidt Fellow, is an artist and author of two books Drawing Blood and Brothers of the Gun with Marwan Hisham, which was longlisted for a 2018 National Book Award for Nonfiction. Her reportage has been published in the New York Times, New York Review of Books, the Paris Review, Vanity Fair, the Guardian, Rolling Stone, and elsewhere. Her art is in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art. She is currently working on a book about the forgotten history of the Jewish Labor Bund.Josie Duffy Rice , Eric and Wendy Schmidt Fellow, is president of the Appeal, a news publication that publishes original journalism about the criminal justice system.

She is a 2019 Type Media Fellow, and a 2019 Civic Media Fellow at the University of Southern California's Annenberg Innovation Lab. A graduate of Harvard Law School, she lives in Atlanta, Georgia.Patricia Evangelista , ASU Future Security Fellow, is a Manila-based trauma journalist covering disaster, conflict, and human rights issues. She was a fellow at the Southeast Asian Press Alliance, the Dart Center for Journalism and Trauma, and the Logan Nonfiction Fellowship. Her reporting on armed conflict as well as on the aftermath of typhoon Haiyan was awarded the Kate Webb Prize for exceptional journalism in dangerous conditions.Evangelista was a staff reporter for the Philippine news agency Rappler for seven years, where she produced documentaries and long-form multimedia reportage. She led the investigative team behind the Rappler series "Impunity," covering President Rodrigo Duterte's war on drugs. The series is a recipient of the Human Rights Press Award, three Society of Publishers in Asia Awards, and was a 2018 finalist for the Osborn Elliott Prize for Journalism. Evangelista is writing a book on the Philippine drug war.Suzy Hansen , ASU Future Security Fellow, is working on a book about life in one Istanbul neighborhood. The project will focus on the neighborhood's experience with the Syrian refugee crisis, the long history of internal and external migration in Turkey, and the dramatic changes in Turkish politics and social and urban life during the years of Recep Tayyip Erdogan. She is a contributing writer for the New York Times Magazine, and the author of Notes on a Foreign Country: An American Abroad in a Post-American World, which was a finalist for the 2018 Pulitzer Prize in general nonfiction and the winner of the Overseas Press Club's Cornelius Ryan Award for best nonfiction book on international affairs.CJ Hunt , Eric and Wendy Schmidt Fellow, is producing The Neutral Ground, a feature-length documentary about New Orleans' fight over Confederate monuments and America's codependent relationship with the Lost Cause.

He was also a field producer on BET's "The Rundown" with Robin Thede and a staff writer on AandE's "Black and White." With a degree in Africana studies and a career in finding humor at the edge of tragedy, Hunt believes satire is perfect for capturing the absurdity of a losing army erecting self-congratulatory statues that are protected for a century as "our history." He is an alumnus of the New Orleans Film Fest's Emerging Voices program and a fellow with Firelight Media's Documentary Lab. His work is supported by ITVS, the Center for Asian American Media, and the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Foundation.Daniela Lamas , New Arizona Fellow, is a pulmonary and critical care doctor at the Brigham and Women's Hospital and faculty at Harvard Medical School.

He is working on a book on the fates of some of the oldest black communities in the United States in the paths of climate catastrophes, and also on a podcast for the Atlantic about Hurricane Katrina.Julia Ott, New Arizona Fellow, is a scholar, teacher, and public intellectual. She investigates how financial institutions, practices, and theories influence American political culture and how, in turn, policies and political beliefs shape economic behavior and outcomes. Her current book project, Wealth Over Work: The Origins of Venture Capital, The Return of Inequality, and the Decline of Innovation, examines the history of venture capital as a concept, as an industry, and as a form of political mobilization. At present, she is collaborating with FICTILIS (artist-curators Andrea Steves and Tim Furstnau) to install the Museum of Capitalism in Kellen Gallery at The New School, to open October 2019. Ott is an associate professor in the history of capitalism at the New School, co-founder of the Robert L. Heilbroner of Capitalism Studies, and a member of the editorial board of Dissent.Ral O. Paz-Pastrana , Eric and Wendy Schmidt Fellow, is a Mexican immigrant filmmaker, cinematographer, and multimedia creator. His work intersects contemporary art, political documentary, and visual ethnography to explore themes of belonging and alienation in immigrant communities. His feature-length film Border South follows the migrant routes from southern Mexico to the U.S.-Mexico border. The result is a close-up, nuanced, and highly original view of the migrant experience, one fraught with risk and danger but also comradery, ingenuity, and humor.

FTSE Russell Announces Results of Country Classification Review for Equities and Fixed IncomeTargeted News ServiceSeptember 26, 2019 Thursday 8:40 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 904 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: LONDON, England BodyFTSE Russell, a provider of benchmarks, analytics and data solutions, issued the following news release:FTSE Russell today published the results of the annual Country Classification Review, for countries monitored by its global equity and fixed income indexes. FTSE Russell's comprehensive approach to country classification is informed by feedback from a broad set of market participants and provides investors with a framework for evaluating and investing across asset classes in global equities and fixed income markets.A Watch List of is maintained for both equity and fixed income to monitor their investment conditions and ensure transparency in market assessments.FTSE Equity Country ClassificationFollowing the September 2019 annual review, FTSE Russell confirms that:* Romania, currently a Frontier market, to be reclassified as a Secondary Emerging market, effective from September 2020* Tanzania, currently unclassified, to be included as a Frontier Market, effective from September 2020* Argentina is removed from the Watch List for possible reclassification to Secondary Emerging market status due to the imposition of capital controls* Vietnam is retained on the Watch List for possible reclassification from Frontier to Secondary EmergingFTSE Russell acknowledges Romania and Tanzania on meeting the requirements for attaining Secondary Emerging and Frontier market status respectively. The reclassification follows market improvements implemented by authorities in the respective countries.Joti Rana, Head of Index Governance and Policy, Americas said: "Congratulations to the authorities in Romania and Tanzania who have worked hard to achieve their promotions. We also continue to track the progress of Vietnam, which remains on our Watch List. FTSE Russell continues to engage with the Argentinean market authorities to ascertain the longevity of the recently introduced capital controls. Our strong, transparent country classification framework ensures our indexes are an accurate representation of global markets and we will continue to work with our global clients to provide benchmarks and analytic solutions to facilitate their equity investments."FTSE Fixed Income Country ClassificationThe FTSE Russell Fixed Income Country Classification Framework was introduced in early 2019 to enhance the transparency of the process used to manage benchmark inclusion. It assigns a Market Accessibility Level of 0, 1 or 2, with 2 representing the highest level of accessibility for foreign investors. A minimum of 2 is required for the FTSE World Government Bond Index (WGBI), a widely used metric for global, fixed-rate local currency investment grade government bonds markets that covers 22 markets.Following the September 2019 annual review, FTSE Russell confirms that:* Israel was assigned a Market Accessibility Level of 2 as part of the inaugural March 2019 review and continues to meet the minimum market size and credit rating criteria for the WGBI. As a result, Israel local currency government bonds will be added to the index from 1 April 2020 and are projected to comprise 0.29% of the index on a market value weighted basis as of August 2019 based on 13 bonds with $68.2 billion in market value. ILS-denominated linkers will also be added to the FTSE World Inflation Linked Securities Index (WorldILSI) from 1 April 2020, and are projected to comprise 1.78% of the index on a market value weighted basis.* China will remain on the Watch List for potential upgrade to Market Accessibility Level 2 based on feedback from index users that the Chinese government bond market continues to make demonstrable progress towards meeting the criteria for the highest accessibility level.* Malaysia will be retained on the Watch List for potential downgrade from its current Market Accessibility Level of 2. FTSE Russell will continue to engage with market participants to understand the practical impact of recent initiatives announced by Bank Negara Malaysia to improve market liquidity and accessibility.FTSE Russell will provide further updates as appropriate after the interim review in March 2020.Nikki Stefanelli, Head of Fixed Income Index Policy, FTSE Russell, said: "We congratulate Israel on their inclusion in the FTSE World Government Bond Index. There was a strong consensus from index users that the Israeli government bond market meets the thresholds of our highest accessibility level. Additionally, the September review further demonstrated that our transparent Watch List serves as an effective tool to identify areas for market structure development and monitor the progress of ongoing regulatory initiatives to improve accessibility. Overall, the framework has been extremely well received by the global investment community."More information on the Equity Country Classification framework and the Fixed Income Country Classification framework can be found on our website.* * *- For equities, Romania reclassified from Frontier to Secondary Emerging while Tanzania becomes a Frontier market- For fixed income, Israel to be added to FTSE World Government Bond Index (WGBI) and FTSE World Inflation Linked Securities Index beginning April 2020- China and Malaysia remain on FTSE Russell Fixed Income Watch List- FTSE Russell's comprehensive approach to country classification applied on a multi-asset basis across equities and fixed incomeCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6871293 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: September 27, 2019End of Document

Rubio, Colleagues Urge Review of U.S. Export Controls Regarding Developments in Hong KongTargeted News ServiceSeptember 10, 2019 Tuesday 7:41 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 913 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodySen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, issued the following news release:U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) today joined Senators Jim Risch (R-ID), Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), and other colleagues in sending a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross requesting an assessment of the adequacy of U.S. export controls with respect to Hong Kong. The Senators expressed two concerns: Mainland China's potential abuse of Hong Kong's special treatment under U.S. law to illicitly procure sensitive technologies; and the use of crowd control equipment against Hong Kong protesters.The senators wrote, "We believe it is critical that the United States take appropriate measures to ensure China does not abuse Hong Kong's special status under U.S. law to steal or otherwise acquire critical or sensitive U.S. equipment and technologies in support of its strategic objectives or to infringe on the rights of people in Mainland China, Hong Kong, and elsewhere."Additional signatories include Senators Cory Gardner (R-CO), Ed Markey (D-MA), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Pat Toomey (R-PA), and Jack Reed (D-RI).The full text of the letter is below.Dear Secretary Ross and Secretary Pompeo:We write today to highlight two concerns about the current United States' export control regime with Hong Kong: first, whether current export controls are sufficient to prevent the diversion of sensitive technologies to China; and second, whether current controls are sufficient to prevent the inappropriate supply of crowd control equipment to Hong Kong's police force.In that context, we request an assessment of the adequacy of our export control regime with respect to Hong Kong.China is on a drive to displace its rivals and become the global leader in a number of strategic technologies, including those articulated in its "Made in China 2025" industrial plan. The Chinese government has demonstrated its willingness to use both licit and illicit means to acquire and advance its development of technologies such as artificial intelligence, tools of mass surveillance, and advanced robotics, among others. China is using these technologies not only to bolster its own industries, but also to advance its military capabilities and to infringe on the fundamental liberties of its citizens.Since its handover to China in 1997, Hong Kong's open investment environment has been a source of growth for China, as well as a conduit for closer ties with the United States and other advanced economies. More recently, Hong Kong has become an integral part of China's signature foreign policy initiative - the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which includes a digital component known as the Digital Silk Road.We believe it is critical that the United States take appropriate measures to ensure China does not abuse Hong Kong's special status under U.S. law to steal or otherwise acquire critical or sensitive U.S. equipment and technologies in support of its strategic objectives or to infringe on the rights of people in Mainland China, Hong Kong, and elsewhere.Our concern that Beijing could abuse Hong Kong's special status is growing because the autonomy guaranteed to Hong Kong in the Sino-British Joint Declaration has eroded significantly in recent years. This trend is most evident in declining political and civil liberties for the Hong Kong people through abductions, the banning of a political party, expulsion of journalists, and the arbitrary jailing of peaceful protest leaders and activists. Had it become law, an extradition bill proposed by the Hong Kong government earlier this year would have had direct implications for U.S. citizen interests and bilateral law enforcement cooperation, raising concern about whether other areas of U.S.-Hong Kong cooperation are implicated in China's growing encroachment on Hong Kong's autonomy.A related concern is whether current export control laws allow U.S. persons to inappropriately export police equipment to Hong Kong, which may be used to suppress legitimate civil dissent.In the last several weeks of protests, Hong Kong police have used tear gas extensively to disperse protesters. They have also used rubber bullets (including allegedly at close range) and beat protesters with batons, inconsistent with acceptable norms of treatment of civilians by law enforcement. The United Kingdom has suspended licenses for export of such equipment to Hong Kong, and we believe similar steps by the United States are warranted.This combination of factors demands an expeditious review of our export control regime with Hong Kong both to safeguard U.S. interests relevant to strategic technologies as well as to protect the Hong Kong people from police brutality and other abuses of their rights.We therefore ask that you provide detailed information about the current status of our export control regime focusing on these two concerns. We request an assessment - either in writing or in the form of a briefing - on whether our export controls are sufficient to safeguard U.S. interests, and an identification of any gaps. Finally, we would appreciate an update regarding any relevant interagency discussions on revamping U.S. export controls towards Hong Kong as a means to address China's continued erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy.Please kindly provide a response by October 1, 2019, as this situation continues to become more critical by the day.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6850018 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: September 11, 2019End of Document

Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), and Jack Reed (D-R.I.).In the letter to Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the senators wrote, "We believe it is critical that the United States take appropriate measures to ensure China does not abuse Hong Kong's special status under U.S. law to steal or otherwise acquire critical or sensitive U.S. equipment and technologies in support of its strategic objectives or to infringe on the rights of people in Mainland China, Hong Kong, and elsewhere."Full text of the letter follows and can be found here (https://www.foreign.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Hong%20Kong%20Dual%20Use%20Tech%20Export%20Letter%20FINAL.pdf) and below.Dear Secretary Ross and Secretary Pompeo:We write today to highlight two concerns about the current United States' export control regime with Hong Kong: first, whether current export controls are sufficient to prevent the diversion of sensitive technologies to China; and second, whether current controls are sufficient to prevent the inappropriate supply of crowd control equipment to Hong Kong's police force.In that context, we request an assessment of the adequacy of our export control regime with respect to Hong Kong.China is on a drive to displace its rivals and become the global leader in a number of strategic technologies, including those articulated in its "Made in China 2025" industrial plan. The Chinese government has demonstrated its willingness to use both licit and illicit means to acquire and advance its development of technologies such as artificial intelligence, tools of mass surveillance, and advanced robotics, among others. China is using these technologies not only to bolster its own industries, but also to advance its military capabilities and to infringe on the fundamental liberties of its citizens.Since its handover to China in 1997, Hong Kong's open investment environment has been a source of growth for China, as well as a conduit for closer ties with the United States and other advanced economies. More recently, Hong Kong has become an integral part of China's signature foreign policy initiative - the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which includes a digital component known as the Digital Silk Road.We believe it is critical that the United States take appropriate measures to ensure China does not abuse Hong Kong's special status under U.S. law to steal or otherwise acquire critical or sensitive U.S. equipment and technologies in support of its strategic objectives or to infringe on the rights of people in Mainland China, Hong Kong, and elsewhere.Our concern that Beijing could abuse Hong Kong's special status is growing because the autonomy guaranteed to Hong Kong in the Sino-British Joint Declaration has eroded significantly in recent years. This trend is most evident in declining political and civil liberties for the Hong Kong people through abductions, the banning of a political party, expulsion of journalists, and the arbitrary jailing of peaceful protest leaders and activists. Had it become law, an extradition bill proposed by the Hong Kong government earlier this year would have had direct implications for U.S. citizen interests and bilateral law enforcement cooperation, raising concern about whether other areas of U.S.-Hong Kong cooperation are implicated in China's growing encroachment on Hong Kong's autonomy.A related concern is whether current export control laws allow U.S. persons to inappropriately export police equipment to Hong Kong, which may be used to suppress legitimate civil dissent.In the last several weeks of protests, Hong Kong police have used tear gas extensively to disperse protesters. They have also used rubber bullets (including allegedly at close range) and beat protesters with batons, inconsistent with acceptable norms of treatment of civilians by law enforcement. The United Kingdom has suspended licenses for export of such equipment to Hong Kong, and we believe similar steps by the United States are warranted.This combination of factors demands an expeditious review of our export control regime with Hong Kong both to safeguard U.S. interests relevant to strategic technologies as well as to protect the Hong Kong people from police brutality and other abuses of their rights.We therefore ask that you provide detailed information about the current status of our export control regime focusing on these two concerns. We request an assessment - either in writing or in the form of a briefing - on whether our export controls are sufficient to safeguard U.S. interests, and an identification of any gaps. Finally, we would appreciate an update regarding any relevant interagency discussions on revamping U.S. export controls towards Hong Kong as a means to address China's continued erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy.Please kindly provide a response by October 1, 2019, as this situation continues to become more critical by the day.* * *Cory Gardner is a member of the U.S. Senate serving Colorado.

Pilbara iron ore production of 87.3 million tonnes (100% basis) was 6% higher than the third quarter of 2018 and 10% higher than the previous quarter, reflecting a good recovery from the operational and weather challenges experienced earlier in the year.

Kitchen Collection has ~800 employees. "While operating losses have moderated from the prior year in the first half of 2019, Kitchen Collection continues to experience decreased comparable store sales as a result of declining foot traffic due to the consumer shift to e-commerce sales. Despite our best efforts to return Kitchen Collection to profitability through footprint consolidation, further deterioration in foot traffic has lowered our outlook for the prospects of a future return to profitability and positive cash flow generation. We have evaluated strategic alternatives to maximize the value of the Kitchen Collection business and reached the difficult but necessary decision that it is in the best interests of the company and all of its stakeholders to wind down the business by the end of 2019."During the third quarter, Kitchen Collection expects to record a non-cash, pretax impairment charge of $1 mln related to property, plant and equipment and a valuation allowance of $1.9 mln related to deferred tax assets primarily for state net operating losses.

This change in top line performance, coupled with lower factory absorption, higher operating expenses arising largely from acquisitions, and other factors, will adversely affect net income for the period. Thus, management expects that quarterly earnings per share are likely to be less than half of the [$0.23] consensus estimate and will provide conclusive data on that subject in its next earnings release."Focusing on full year 2019 results, we expect consolidated sales to increase by about 6% year-over-year with mixed performance among our major markets. International sales should increase by about 27% for the full year. However, our domestic sales will likely decrease by about 5% on a per annum basis, which we believe is consistent with industry-wide forecasts showing domestic markets receding by 6% to 12%. With these considerations in mind, we are revising our full year 2019 net sales forecast downward to ~$480 million [from $500 mln vs. $499 mln consensus]. Other previously forecasted financial metrics relating to 2019 remain unchanged since our last earnings call."16:29LW Lamb Weston forms joint venture with Sociedad Comercial del Plata in Argentina (75.50 -0.34)Lamb Weston has formed a joint venture with Sociedad Comercial del Plata in Argentina to serve the nearly 2-billion-pound South American market.

This change in top line performance, coupled with lower factory absorption, higher operating expenses arising largely from acquisitions, and other factors, will adversely affect net income for the period. Thus, management expects that quarterly earnings per share are likely to be less than half of the [$0.23] consensus estimate and will provide conclusive data on that subject in its next earnings release."Focusing on full year 2019 results, we expect consolidated sales to increase by about 6% year-over-year with mixed performance among our major markets. International sales should increase by about 27% for the full year. However, our domestic sales will likely decrease by about 5% on a per annum basis, which we believe is consistent with industry-wide forecasts showing domestic markets receding by 6% to 12%. With these considerations in mind, we are revising our full year 2019 net sales forecast downward to ~$480 million [from $500 mln vs. $499 mln consensus]. Other previously forecasted financial metrics relating to 2019 remain unchanged since our last earnings call."16:29LW Lamb Weston forms joint venture with Sociedad Comercial del Plata in Argentina (75.50 -0.34)Lamb Weston has formed a joint venture with Sociedad Comercial del Plata in Argentina to serve the nearly 2-billion-pound South American market.

Driveline Market progressing at a robust CAGR of 15.88% during the forecast period of 2019-2025iCrowdNewswire (English)September 17, 2019 Tuesday 10:46 AM GMTCopyright 2019 iCrowdNewswire, LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1701 wordsBodyAs of 2018, the global driveline market was evaluated to be $19.45 billion and the demand is rampantly progressing at a robust CAGR of 15.88% during the forecast period of 2019-2025.Escalating sales of electric vehicles globally along with increasing uptake of premium automotive with demand for advanced torque transmission and fuel efficiency are key factors leveraged by global driveline marketIn the absence of a driveline, the power generated by the engine will be ceased in the transmission ending up with no rotation in wheels. Hence, the driveline is a very imperative and critical constituent of the automotive sector to make a vehicle function appropriately. Considering the bourgeoning sales of vehicles globally, the globalDriveline Market Demandis rampantly progressing at a robust CAGR of 15.88% during the forecast period of 2019-2025. Owing to developments in the automotive sector such as the transition from front-wheel drive (FWD) towards all-wheel drive (AWD) with abundant integration of ECU (electronic control unit), innovation in the form E-CVT E-axle (electronically-controlled continuously variable transmission) for enhanced fuel efficiency is adding substantial impetus to the driveline market growth. Instructions and enforcements for enhanced fuel efficiency amalgamated with strict emission regulations by governments across the globe have enforced automotive OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) to implement the hybrid and electric vehicle technology. As a consequence, technological developments in the spectrum of electric and hybrid drivelines that includes automatic start-stop, regenerative braking, E-CVT, and E-axle are the major driving forces for the driveline market demand. The arrangement of driveline equipment varies for a Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV), Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV), or Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) as the prime source of power differ from internal combustion engine (fuel combustion) to batteries, hence the market is witnessing rampant developments in terms of variants as well. As of 2018, the global driveline market was evaluated to be $19.45 billion. Apart from ICE (internal combustion vehicle) and EVs (electric vehicles), advancements towards autonomous vehicles are also creating additional scope of opportunities for the application of driveline. For instance, in 2018, HARMAN International, a subsidiary of Samsung dedicated towards connected technologies for automotive, showcased HARMAN's and Samsung's accumulated approach for establishing a network of associates and solutions to develop Samsung's DRIVELine further, it's novel open platform for automated driving solutions.View Full Table of Contents @https://www.industryarc.com/Research/Driveline-Market-Research-501113Report Price (Single User): US $3850Falling Prices Aluminum A Major Factor Assisting to Overcome the Expensiveness of Electric and Hybrid Driveline:Lightweighting conquers the apex spot among the list of approaches car manufacturers are employing to encounter the set objective of enhanced vehicle fuel economy. As a consequence, significant amounts of lightweight aluminum are not only applied in crafting the engine but also in the rest of the powertrain that is in the transmission and the various driveline components. As the high cost of driveline technology for EVs as compared to conventional IC engine-powered driveline is a major factor hindering driveline market share for EVs, recent circumstances indicating the falling prices of aluminium, the most preferred automotive material, is a major disruptive force in the market. A survey conducted by the WardsAuto and DuPont Automotive in 2018 confirmed aluminium to be the most preferred material by automotive engineers and designers to content the targeted fuel economy and emissions standards by 2025. Higher aluminium demand comes from the electric vehicles (EVs) revolution that is witnessing unprecedented growth in 2018. Hence, the falling prices of aluminium in some of the major automotive making nations such as India, and its inevitable application in conventional vehicles driveline, as well as expensive EVs driveline, is a major factor augmenting its economic manufacturing and increasing the range of profits.E-axle and Motor with a power output of 45100 kW Leading Segment in Final Drive and Motor Output Verticals:· Motor output differs from 12 kW to more than 250kW that is provisional of the vehicle specification.

COMPETITIVENESS IMPROVES LIVESStates News ServiceOctober 4, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 679 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: LAUSANNE, Switzerland BodyThe following information was released by the International Management & Development Institute (IMD):The "right objective" of competitiveness in shaping public policy is to improve the lives of people, said IMD Emeritus Professor Stephane Garelli, on day two of a conference celebrating the 30th anniversary of the IMD World Competitiveness Center that he founded.Taking ideas from thinkers before him, Garelli had been inspired in 1989 to develop a new metric to measure prosperity - competitiveness. Because, he said, "GDP does not tell the whole story. We have to look at society at large and not only the economics."Garelli wanted to change perceptions about achieving success through economic growth, with standard measures often failing to capture the human impact of economic activity. It must be a win-win scenario for everyone.During the special event at IMD's Lausanne campus, participants learned that from Bhutan to China, many countries have taken note and are acting.Bhutan famously introduced Gross Domestic Happiness in 1970. Lyonpo Loknath Sharma, Minister of Economic Affairs in Bhutan, confirmed that countries should use many measures to gauge their economic performance but equally importantly the population's well-being.In Egypt, where the GDP is growing, the human development index is actually regressing. For Nabil Fahmy, the country's former Minister of Foreign Affairs, his nation is acting on that competitiveness indicator and is focused on improving the lives of youth by reforming education to increase creativity. "We're changing the system to teach you how to think."How can technology improve the prosperity of its citizens?On Friday, IMD Professor Michael Wade, Cisco Chair holder, posed this question to ministers at the forefront of digital transformation in their countries.Estonia has built one of the world's most innovative digital sectors while keeping people and trust at the heart of the system, explained Marten Kaevats, the Baltic state's National Digital Advisor.Thailand has been improving the lives of its rural citizens by extending connectivity to 80% of its unconnected villages already, with the aim of reaching 100% next year. This will pave the way for new industries and job growth in areas like smart farming, said Dr. Pichet Durongkaveroj, Former Minister of Digital Economy in the Thai government.Who will lead the way increasing prosperity through competitiveness?If competitiveness is to be a win-win game, then naturally it needs to be a team sport.The private and public sectors cannot succeed in improving our lives by acting alone, said Professor Didier Cossin, who leads teaching and research on boards and governance at IMD.Saudi Arabia, for example, is changing laws to facilitate growth, but it has also changed laws to allow more than 50% of its citizens to have better access to the economy. H.E. Dr. Eiman Al-Mutari, Assistant Minister of Commerce and Investment, said she and other women in the country "get goose bumps" of joy when they see car keys in each other's purses.What about the environment?IMD President and Nestle Professor Jean-Fran ois Manzoni asked government participants what trade-offs they have to make in policy making to drive competitiveness.The environment, for example, has long suffered at the expense of economic activity."The Chinese government used to attach a lot of importance to GDP. In recent years, we have been focusing on high quality development and social development to improve people's lives," Geng Wenbin, the Chinese Ambassador to Switzerland, said.For Garelli, the ultimate test of whether he had succeeded in changing how people viewed prosperity was if his competitiveness concept could survive beyond his professional research career. He handed over the reins of the World Competitiveness Center in 2014.Now directed by Arturo Bris, the Center is growing from strength to strength, releasing this week a new innovative smart cities index."There will always be a need for competitiveness. We need it to work to make the people's lives better." Stephane GarelliLoad-Date: October 5, 2019End of Document

28th World Economic Forum on Africa to Focus on Inclusive Growth in the Fourth Industrial RevolutionTargeted News ServiceSeptember 2, 2019 Monday 7:30 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1187 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: JOHANNESBURG, South Africa BodyThe World Economic Forum issued the following news release:Sub-Saharan Africa's future prosperity hinges on the ability of its leaders to create inclusive, sustainable growth at a time of rapid transformation in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. This will be the main message coming from the 28th World Economic Forum on Africa in Cape Town, South Africa 4-6 September.The meeting will bring together 1,100 leaders from government, business and civil society, including ten heads of state or government. Top of the agenda will be new partnerships to create sustainable employment opportunities for Africa's large and growing workforce.The meeting will highlight: improving the funding and regulatory environments for start-ups; developing new partnerships for re-skilling and upskilling workers; identifying opportunities for green growth such as the circular economy; scaling-up e-commerce for rapid business growth, especially in the SME sector; and how to leverage the new Africa Continental Free Trade Agreement to drive regional integration.Also high on the agenda are government policies and responsible business practices to provide a foundation for a more inclusive society. While globalization has driven economic growth, it is criticized for leading to unacceptable levels of income inequality. Tackling corruption, universal healthcare provision and protection of workers in the gig economy all have a role to play in building more equitable societies."The World Economic Forum brings top leaders together to create the conditions for socio-economic investment to happen.

28TH WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM ON AFRICA TO FOCUS ON INCLUSIVE GROWTH IN THE FOURTH INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTIONStates News ServiceSeptember 2, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1133 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: JOHANNESBURG, South Africa BodyThe following information was released by the World Economic Forum in Davos:Sub-Saharan Africa's future prosperity hinges on the ability of its leaders to create inclusive, sustainable growth at a time of rapid transformation in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. This will be the main message coming from the 28th World Economic Forum on Africa in Cape Town, South Africa 4-6 September.The meeting will bring together 1,100 leaders from government, business and civil society, including ten heads of state or government. Top of the agenda will be new partnerships to create sustainable employment opportunities for Africa's large and growing workforce.The meeting will highlight: improving the funding and regulatory environments for start-ups; developing new partnerships for re-skilling and upskilling workers; identifying opportunities for green growth such as the circular economy; scaling-up e-commerce for rapid business growth, especially in the SME sector; and how to leverage the new Africa Continental Free Trade Agreement to drive regional integration.Also high on the agenda are government policies and responsible business practices to provide a foundation for a more inclusive society. While globalization has driven economic growth, it is criticized for leading to unacceptable levels of income inequality. Tackling corruption, universal healthcare provision and protection of workers in the gig economy all have a role to play in building more equitable societies."The World Economic Forum brings top leaders together to create the conditions for socio-economic investment to happen. Africa, like all regions of the world, faces great challenges. For the region to prosper in an increasingly globalized world, it needs transparent governance, competitive economies and peaceful societies.

Daryl Morey, Hong Kong, and the Limits of Sports ActivismThe Guardian: University of California - San DiegoOctober 24, 2019 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: SPORTS; Pg. 1Length: 589 wordsBodyIt began - as these things often do - on Twitter. Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey tweeted a picture "Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong" on Oct. 4. What started as a pro-democracy tweet by an executive most NBA fans couldn't pick out of a lineup quickly turned into a firestorm at the intersection of sports and politics. In doing so, the fans have provided the current generation of superstars a battleground for protest in which there's real cash at stake - and the ramifications will affect all future political speech coming from the sports world.Activism is nothing new in sports, but the current generation of superstars have avenues to express themselves that were inaccessible to those before them. But that trend has been coupled with a rapid monetization of players' public personas. There is no better example of this than LeBron James's recent attempt to trademark "Taco Tuesday." Combined with the NBA's rise globally, it was only a matter of time before politics and finance came into conflict.Which brings us back, of course, to Daryl Morey. Within days, the Rockets joined Winnie the Pooh and Tiananmen Square among the casualties of the Great Firewall of China; China Central Television and Tencent Holdings Limited stopped airing Rockets games, and the Chinese government asked the NBA to fire Morey. When the league refused, every Chinese sponsor terminated their deals, and the TV ban extended to all games. While that ban has now ended, the Rockets remain off the air.As for the NBA ecosystem, the responses have been mixed. Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr and star player Stephen Curry gave noncommittal statements, despite being on the forefront of the league's political zeitgeist. Rockets star James Harden even apologized for Morey's comments. But the most inexplicable comments came from the greatest current NBA player, James, who criticized Morey as "uneducated" on the issue and for being selfish by risking league interests. It might be too far to call players hypocritical, as some have, for being vehemently anti-Trump - James famously called the president "U bum" in a 2017 tweet - and yet remaining silent about China. After all, one can sense players' discomfort when asked about a foreign protest movement they're likely uninformed about. But it delegitimizes future NBA activism - most of it being positive - if players submit to such a clear attack on the league. As for James, Fox News's Laura Ingraham was wrong to say he should just "shut up and dribble" last February. But that would've been preferable to James's comments, who condemned Morey, while those in Hong Kong, Xinjiang, and across China face draconian human rights violations daily speak louder than LeBron ever could.It's futile to ask billion-dollar corporations to worry about anything other than their bottom lines, even the NBA. But the players face a responsibility today that they will often face again, and appeasement can only defer it. Maybe it's unfair to make this comparison, but since James was willing to monetize "shut up and dribble" into a documentary of that name about the history of sports activism, it's one he's welcomed. Muhammad Ali gave up the prime of his career to protest the draft. Colin Kaepernick lost his career protesting police brutality. Tommie Smith and John Carlos were expelled from the 1968 Olympics for protesting racial injustice. To James, it seems Space Jam 2 was more important. But to the rest of the league, we can only ask: What are you willing to lose?Load-Date: October 24, 2019End of Document

TrendForce Announces Top 10 Trends in Information and Communication Technology Industry for 2020Business WireOctober 2, 2019 Wednesday 10:00 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Business Wire, Inc.Length: 2546 wordsDateline: TAIPEI, Taiwan BodyIn this press release, TrendForce provides predictions of the information and communication technology industry for 2020, focusing on 10 key themes.Demand from AI, 5G, and automotive will push back against headwinds in the global semiconductor marketThe global semiconductor market has been in a slump this year on account of the fallout from the US-China trade dispute. Although the demand outlook remains uncertain for 2020, TrendForce expects the market to make a gradual recovery on the back of the demand related to 5G, AI, and automotive applications. The strategies of IC design companies for next year will mainly revolve around introducing next-generation IP cores and strengthening capabilities related to chip customization and the development of ASICs. IC design companies will also accelerate their adoption of next-generation process technologies, including the 7nm EUV and the 5nm.Regarding trends on the manufacturing side during 2020, the usage of the 7nm will continue to increase. Furthermore, the schedules for volume production on the 5nm and for R&D of the 3nm will become clearer. The latest cutting-edge process technologies will account for a greater share of the overall production next year. Additionally, there will be an increasing focus on the development and usage of compound semiconductor materials such as SiC, GaN, and GaAs. These materials feature high voltage resistance, high frequency switching and low resistance. They are thus suitable for power discretes, RF switch ICs, and other products that are gaining traction in the supply chains for 5G technologies and electric vehicles.Finally, the continuing demand for chip products to feature smaller process pitch and higher computing power has resulted in a steady shift toward SiP in the development advanced IC packaging technologies. The SiP architecture is more effective in meeting the requirements of AI, 5G, and automotive applications because it offers greater flexibility and lower cost compared with the SoC architecture.Development of DRAM will advance toward EUV and DDR5/LPDDR5; NAND Flash stacking will surpass 100 layersDRAM manufacturing is approaching the physical limit of Moore's Law as the development of process technologies moves into the 10nm class (i.e. 1X-nm, 1Y-nm, and 1Z-nm). Not only is it the case that further die shrinking no longer brings significant supply bit growth, but cost reduction is also becoming increasingly difficult. DRAM suppliers are now working to double the density per chip from the current 8Gb to 16Gb using the 1Y-nm and 1Z-nm technologies. This, in turn, will help gradually raise the market penetration of high-density modules. EUV machines may also find their way into the development of the 1Z-nm processes and replace the existing double patterning techniques. A generational shift will also take place in the DRAM market in 2020 with the debut of DDR5/LPDDR5. Even though DDR5/LPDDR5 products will just be entering the stage of initial adoption and sample testing, their advantages over DDR4/LPDDR4 such as less power consumption and faster data rate will immediately get noticed.In the NAND Flash market, suppliers will be attempting to cross the 100-layer threshold in the development of the stacking technology during 2020. They will also be working to increase the maximum density per chip to the 1Tb level from the current 512Gb. The trend toward more layers and higher chip density is mainly in response to the growing demand stemming from the continuing progress in the fields of 5G, AI, and edge computing. To support these emerging applications, end devices and systems including smartphones, servers, and data center equipment will require larger storage capacity. At the same time, the physical dimensions of storage solutions will have to be scaled down further. Apart from the evolution of NAND Flash chips themselves, the interface specification of the smartphone storage solutions will upgrade from UFS 2.1 to UFS 3.X that offers faster data rate. Regarding storage solutions for the server/data center market, next year will see the adoption of PCIe G4 in Enterprise SSDs. Being the more advanced interface technology, PCIe G4 offers double the speed and performance of PCIe G3. The launching of UFS 3.X and PCIe G4 products next year will be targeting the high-end segment of their respective markets.The range of 5G commercialized solutions expands, and more hardware devices to be debutedDevelopments in the global telecom sector during 2020 will continue to revolve around 5G. Major communication chip manufacturers (e.g. Qualcomm, HiSilicon, Samsung, and MediaTek) and telecom equipment providers (e.g. Huawei, Ericsson, and Nokia) will be introducing various kinds of solutions as they compete for a piece of the 5G market. The focus in the development of the network architecture will be on Standalone (SA) 5G technologies, so rising demand for 5G New Radio (NR) equipment and core network solutions is expected. The main emphasis of SA technologies is to ensure that the wireless network, the core network, and the backhaul architecture can meet the 5G requirements for the uplink rate, the network latency, and the number of connections when supporting applications such as networking slicing and edge computing. Also, following the scheduled completion of the development of the R16 standard in the first half of 2020, telecom companies in countries around the world will begin planning for the rollout of the 5G infrastructure. In addition to the deployment of 5G networks in heavily populated metropolitan areas, the range of commercially available 5G-enabled services will also expand. Hence, more 5G devices and wireless base stations are expected to arrive in the market in the near future.Market penetration of 5G smartphones will surpass 15%, and Chinese brands will account for more than half of the total proThe focus of external design for smartphones in 2020 will remain on creating as perfect a full-screen device as possible through the maximization of the display area. The optimization of the full-screen design, in turn, will also lead to greater adoption of in-display fingerprint sensors, an increase in the angle at which the screen curves to the sides, and further advancement in the development of in-display camera. Other hardware specifications that smartphone makers will be targeting for improvement are the onboard memory and the front and rear cameras. Regarding memory, the density of DRAM and NAND Flash components will continue to increase next year. As for cameras, smartphone makers will upgrade resolutions and introduce more sophisticated multi-cam setups for the rear camera.On the topic of 5G, smartphone makers are becoming more proactive in developing 5G-enabled models. Furthermore, the Chinese government continues to aggressively push for the commercialization of the 5G network and related services. As a result, the demand for 5G smartphones will gain momentum in 2020. TrendForce currently forecasts that the share of 5G models in the global annual smartphone production will leap upward from less than 1% for 2019 to over 15% for 2020. Also, TrendForce expects devices under Chinese brands to account for more than 50% of the total 5G smartphone production in 2020. On the other hand, purchases of 5G smartphones by consumers will still hinge on a few fundamental factors such as the progress made in the deployment of the 5G infrastructure worldwide, the data plans offered by telecom companies, and the pricing of the devices themselves.High refresh rate mobile phone panel demand increases, and tablet becomes Mini LED and OLED new battlegroundIn terms of mobile phone panel, so far, OLED or LCD panel specifications have been able to meet the needs of all kinds of consumers, but with the 5G deployment, its high transmission efficiency and low latency characteristics can improve the dynamic performance of mobile phone content and develop mobile phone applications in other areas such as AR, boosting the demand for 90Hz or even 120Hz panels.In terms of the most popular esports application, in addition to the existing high refresh rate panels, the production conditions are becoming more abundant for higher-end products that enhance contrast performance through Mini LED backlight. After many years of LCD adoption, the market also announced that the 2020 iPad may be simultaneously introduced with Mini LED backlight and OLED, making the tablet become another opportunity for OLED and Mini LED.Micro LED will open up a new blue ocean in the oversupplied display industryIn terms of the progress of Micro LED self-emissive display, more and more panel manufacturers introduced Micro LED with glass backplane, but due to yield rate problem, currently the maximum size is 12 inches. The larger size of the display can be achieved through glass splicing. Although the cost of Micro LED is still high in the short term, because Micro LED with mass transfer technology can be combined with different display backplanes to produce transparent, projected, curved, flexible and other display effects, in the future, there will be opportunities to create a new blue ocean market in the oversupplied display industry. Take foldable display market as an example, because the material structure is robust and does not require many protective layers and polarization, Micro LED may be a proper solution.Adoption growth of 3D modules based on ToF solutions will benefit the development of AR applicationsThe advantages that Time of Flight (ToF) has over Structured Light in the area of mobile 3D sensing include a lower technological barrier for development and a larger number of solution suppliers. Hence, ToF modules are expected to become one of the mainstay options for branded smartphone makers when designing the multi-cam setup for the rear cameras of their devices. Although the growth in applications for mobile 3D sensing is not expected to be significant in 2020, more smartphone makers will expand their model offerings that are equipped with ToF modules during that year. Consequently, the adoption of ToF modules and 3D sensing modules in general will become more widespread in the smartphone market in the future. As smartphones including iPhone devices start to incorporate ToF modules, they are able to enhance augmented reality (AR) capabilities through accurate 3D depth mapping. Advances in the mobile 3D sensing technology thus drive consumers' demand for AR apps. This, in turn, encourages more software developers to build AR apps, thus reinforcing the demand for the technology.Sensing capabilities and algorithms are the keys to add value to the IoTInnovative solutions for different levels of the Internet of Things (IoT) have already entered testing and commercialization phase this year on account of the maturation of related technologies and the built-up of the necessary infrastructure. Hence, the IoT market as a whole is also starting to deliver returns on investments. Looking ahead to 2020, the IoT will penetrate deeper into different vertical application markets and do to agriculture and healthcare what it has already done to manufacturing and retail. This means that IoT-related technologies will continue to transform whole industries by driving process optimization and creating value-added services. Regarding sensing technologies for IoT-related applications, efforts are underway to improve capabilities of sensors so that smart devices and systems can have a wider range of responses to changes in the physical environment. Moreover, continuing breakthroughs in AI algorithms will result in deeper machine learning capabilities that can take advantage of the huge volumes of data produced by various connected devices. The growing demand for data processing and analysis is expected to spur the integration of AI and edge computing in end devices in the near future. This, in turn, will generate new opportunities for hardware and software upgrades in the IoT market.The race to commercialize self-driving intensifies, more business models to be exploredRegarding the commercialization of self-driving technology in 2020, there are three main fields of interests, namely commercial vehicles, specific driving routes and region-specific applications. Most manufacturers aim to develop the autonomous vehicles which meet SAE Level 4. There will be an increase in the quantity as well as types of self-driving commercial applications in 2020. One of the driving forces comes from the various platforms, such as NVIDIA Drive, which is a self-driving development platform powered by AI. Baidu Apollo is also an open platform providing solutions for different self-driving scenarios, which helps car manufacturers and developers at all levels to accelerate the implementation of self-driving technology in their products. However, the development cost of self-driving technology is high. Car manufacturers or developers need to explore more possibilities of self-driving technology, which must maintain its profitability, optimize costs and solve problems. Consequently, finding a business model that can fulfill this potential is also the focus of 2020.Solar modules' price performance rules as standardized end products fade into historyThe development of solar energy technology is constantly evolving. The modules in 2018 and before are made of the standard 60 or 72 cells. The cells are also deployed in their original size. In 2019, the layout of the cells has changed. The micro-technology development of the module has diversified, including half-cut, paved, shingled, multi-busbar cells, glass-to-glass, bifacial (cells) modules. Multiple technologies are combined for different applications, which the output power of the modules-the solar end products-has increased by 1~2 power steps (5W/ power step). However, the core competitiveness of solar modules depends on levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). To create greater power generation and ensure the long-term reliability of the product, LCOE is to be reduced. It is necessary to increase cell efficiency and module power output to lower the LCOE. The manufacturers no longer call the shots in terms of the product pricing in the future market. The market demand and the buyer acceptance will be the ones making the rules now.For further details of the press release, along with the graph illustrating the Top 10 trends, please visit:https://press.trendforce.com/press/20191002-3301.htmlAbout TrendForce ( www.trendforce.com )TrendForce is a global provider of market intelligence on the technology industries.

U.S. SENATOR CALLS ON NBA TO CANCEL CHINA GAMES AMID HONG KONG PROTEST ROWStates News ServiceOctober 8, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 996 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:A Republican Senator has weighed into a row over the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s attitude to China after it condemned Houston Rockets manager Daryl Morey for his public support of the Hong Kong protest movement.Josh Hawley wrote to NBA chief Adam Silver calling on the sporting body to remember its responsibilities and to stop aiding "the most brutal of regimes.""Remember that some things are more important than money," Hawley told the NBA. "Remember your responsibility ... For an American organization to help the most brutal of regimes silence dissent in pursuit of profit is appalling."He called for an end to all NBA exhibition games in China until the situation in Hong Kong was resolved."For five months now, Hong Kong's citizens have been calling for representative government and preservation of their basic liberties,"Hawley wrote. "In response, and at the instruction of the Chinese Communist Party, the Government of Hong Kong has engaged in escalating repression.""Police have employed tear gas, batons, water cannons with dye, pepper spray, and rubber bullets against their own people," he said, adding that thousands have been hospitalized and arrested amid a lack of transparency over whether anyone died -- a reference to a raid by riot police who attacked passengers in Prince Edward MTR station on Aug. 31.The NBA had responded to Morey's support for the movement by tweeting that he had "deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable.""What is regrettable is the suppression and political violence carried out by the Chinese Communist Party against the good people of Hong Kong," Hawley said, citing Joseph Tsai, co-founder of the Chinese online trading giant Alibaba and owner of the Brooklyn Nets, who has also called the demonstrations a "separatist movement.""The people of Hong Kong are themselves Chinese and are seeking nothing more than basic liberties Beijing has promised them," he wrote.Houston Rockets rebroadcasts cancelledChinese broadcasters have been ordered to cancel any rebroadcasts of the Houston Rockets' NBA games because Morey tweeted the words "stand with Hong Kong."But Silver appeared to double down on the NBA's position on Tuesday, saying he still regrets that Chinese fans are upset."We are not apologizing for Daryl exercising his freedom of expression," NBA chief Adam Silver said, referring to Morey."I regret, again having communicated directly with many friends in China, that so many people are upset, including millions and millions of our fans," he said.Hong Kong-based Twitter users also called on protesters to delete the game Hearthstone after the company that developed it sanctioned a Hong Kong player for shouting out a protest slogan after winning a tournament.The company, Blizzard, said it had revoked prize money due to the player, Blitzchung, for violating its rules by engaging in "individual behavior which does not represent Blizzard or Hearthstone Esports."The row over Morey's support for the Hong Kong protesters comes after Chinese censors deleted all clips, shows and references to the animated comedy show South Park after it aired an episode titled "Band in China" that made fun of Chinese censorship."A search of the Twitter-like social media service Weibo turns up not a single mention of South Park among the billions of past posts," the Hollywood Reporter said in a recent report. "On streaming service Youku, owned by Internet giant Alibaba, all links to clips, episodes and even full seasons of the show are now dead."And on Baidu's Tieba, if users manually type in the URL for what was formerly the South Park thread, a message appears saying that, "According to the relevant law and regulation, this section is temporarily not open," the report said.Band in ChinaTwitter user @nomad99hk, who is identified as a Chinese University of Hong Kong student on their bio, said the Chinese Communist Party is a threat to freedom."The victims is not just us Hongkongers, but also the Tibetans and Uyghurs, who are suffering ... de facto genocide," the user wrote in response to a tweet from Hawley.Hong Kong-based Twitter user @JanetTeddy111 agreed."NBA as a national league of the US, it should play a role to defend the freedom of speech and stand up for its own people who're just telling the truth," the user wrote.Other users tweeted screenshots of mainland Chinese social media comments saying that they would support the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks on the U.S. if the U.S. supported Hong Kong's "pro-independence" movement.The Hong Kong protest movement is demanding: the formal withdrawal of an amended law enabling extradition to mainland China; an independent inquiry into police violence; an amnesty for thousands of arrested protesters; an end to the description of protesters as 'rioters'; and fully democratic elections to the Legislative Council (LegCo) and for the post of chief executive.The South Park episode involves some of the shows characters running afoul of Chinese censorship, while another is sent to a Chinese prison where he runs into Winnie the Pooh, a satirical reference to the bear's targeting by censors over his alleged resemblance to President Xi Jinping.One character comments during the episode: "You gotta lower your ideals of freedom if you want to suck on the warm teat of China."South Park" creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone later offered a fake apology to China on Twitter, saying that they, like the NBA, "welcome the Chinese censors into our homes and into our hearts.""We too love money more than freedom and democracy. Xi doesn't look just like Winnie the Pooh at all," the apology said. "Long live the Great Communist Party of China! May this autumn's sorghum harvest be bountiful! We good now China?" they wrote.Reported by Pan Jiaqing for RFA's Cantonese Service, and by Xi Wang for the Mandarin Service.

On behalf of our respective member companies, we stand ready to support Governments and international organizations with our knowledge, data and commitment to articulate improved trade rules and to restore normal market functions so that all producers throughout the aluminum value chain can compete under conditions of fairness and transparency."The three representatives spoke in a panel discussion on the aluminium sector, as part of a full-day conference devoted to the issues of leveling the playing field and identifying a multilateral path forward for addressing trade distorting government support across a range of sectors.Discussion in the session drew on the OECD's January 2019 report, "Measuring Distortions in International Markets: The Aluminium Value Chain." The report, which forms part of broader OECD work to measure government support across sectors including agriculture, fossil fuels and fisheries, is the first OECD has produced on the aluminium industry specifically. The study shows that non-market forces, including state subsidies, are responsible for much of the recent increase in global aluminum capacity, with impacts along the entire industry value chain.Using publicly available data, the report examined state support for 17 of the world's largest aluminum companies. While each of the 17 firms received some level of government support, industry participants highlighted their concerns about the nature and scale of support in some countries."The fact that fully 85 percent of the identified subsidies went to five aluminium producing firms in China, representing USD $70 billion in direct support from the Chinese government over a five-year period is of great concern," said the three associations in their joint statement.

Asia-Pacific Remote Patient Monitoring Devices Market Analysis, 2019-2027: Market to Reach $347 Million by 2027 - ResearchAndMarkets.comBusiness WireSeptember 4, 2019 Wednesday 9:31 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Business Wire, Inc.Length: 1077 wordsDateline: DUBLIN BodyThe "Asia-Pacific Remote Patient Monitoring Devices Market to 2027 - Regional Analysis and Forecasts by Product, Application End User, and Country" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.The Asia-Pacific Remote Patient Monitoring Devices market is expected to reach US$ 347.15 Mn in 2027 from US$ 153.78 Mn in 2018. The market is estimated to grow with a CAGR of 9.7% from 2019-2027.The growth of the market is driven by the factors such as rise in economy of these countries, the living standard of people is also increasing attributed to the increase in per capita income and spending capability, the increasing prevalence of the cardiovascular disease population in India and China are likely to boost the growth of the remote patient monitoring devices in the Asia Pacific during the forecast period.Chronic diseases, including heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and obesity, are the leading causes of death in the world and account for most of the nation's health care costs.• According the Global Burden of Disease study estimate of CVD death rate of 272 per 100,000 population in India which is higher than the global average of 235 per 100,000 population. Moreover, Premature mortality in terms of years of life lost because of CVD in India increased by 59%, from 23.2 million (1990) to 37 million (2010).• Similar trends for high prevalence of diabetes are present around other geographies of the Asia-Pacific that include China, South Korea, and Australia. For instance, according to IDF Diabetes Atlas published by the International Diabetes Federation in 2017, south-east Asia is home to approximately one-fifth (19%) of the total diabetes population worldwide.• According to the World Health Organization, in 2014, 230 million people had cardiovascular disease (CVD) in China. Furthermore, by 2030, the number is predicted to increase by 50% considering aging Chinese population and growth. Furthermore, by 2030, cardiovascular disease will cost $1,044 billion to Chinese government.Thus, increasing geriatric population and related chronic diseases are expected to drive the sales of patient monitoring devices thereby propelling the growth of Asia-Pacific remote patient monitoring devices market over the forecast years.Japan is anticipated to lead the adoptions of Remote Patient Monitoring Devices across the Asia Pacific region through the forecast period. Japan has entered the era of the fastest growing geriatric population, the growing ageing population has led to the transformation of the medical systems. The advanced health transition is seen in the country and is increasingly putting pressure on the sustainability of its health systems.

The Asia-Pacific Remote Patient Monitoring Devices market is expected to reach US$ 347.15 Mn in 2027 from US$ 153.78 Mn in 2018. The market is estimated to grow with a CAGR of 9.7% from 2019-2027.The growth of the market is driven by the factors such as rise in economy of these countries, the living standard of people is also increasing attributed to the increase in per capita income and spending capability, the increasing prevalence of the cardiovascular disease population in India and China are likely to boost the growth of the remote patient monitoring devices in the Asia Pacific during the forecast period.Chronic diseases, including heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and obesity, are the leading causes of death in the world and account for most of the nation's health care costs.• According the Global Burden of Disease study estimate of CVD death rate of 272 per 100,000 population in India which is higher than the global average of 235 per 100,000 population. Moreover, Premature mortality in terms of years of life lost because of CVD in India increased by 59%, from 23.2 million (1990) to 37 million (2010).• Similar trends for high prevalence of diabetes are present around other geographies of the Asia-Pacific that include China, South Korea, and Australia. For instance, according to IDF Diabetes Atlas published by the International Diabetes Federation in 2017, south-east Asia is home to approximately one-fifth (19%) of the total diabetes population worldwide.• According to the World Health Organization, in 2014, 230 million people had cardiovascular disease (CVD) in China. Furthermore, by 2030, the number is predicted to increase by 50% considering aging Chinese population and growth. Furthermore, by 2030, cardiovascular disease will cost $1,044 billion to Chinese government.Thus, increasing geriatric population and related chronic diseases are expected to drive the sales of patient monitoring devices thereby propelling the growth of Asia-Pacific remote patient monitoring devices market over the forecast years.Japan is anticipated to lead the adoptions of Remote Patient Monitoring Devices across the Asia Pacific region through the forecast period. Japan has entered the era of the fastest growing geriatric population, the growing ageing population has led to the transformation of the medical systems. The advanced health transition is seen in the country and is increasingly putting pressure on the sustainability of its health systems. The rise in the geriatric population is responsible for the increasing the burden of the diseases in the region.                                Key Topics Covered Part 1.

Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) Market Communications Ecosystem 2030 Account for a Market Worth $1.2 Billion by 2022PR NewswireSeptember 23, 2019 Monday 7:00 AM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 3982 wordsDateline: PUNE, India, Sept. 23, 2019 BodyPR NewswireVehicle-to-Everything (V2X) Market Communications Ecosystem: 2019 - 2030 - Opportunities, Challenges, Strategies & Forecasts Research Report added to ReportsnReports.com with 871 no. of pages and over 330 leading ecosystem players Profiles and strategies. Commonly referred to as V2X, vehicle-to-everything communications technology allows vehicles to directly communicate with each other, roadside infrastructure, and other road users to deliver an array of benefits in the form of road safety, traffic efficiency, smart mobility, environmental sustainability, and driver convenience. In addition, V2X is also helping pave the way for fully autonomous driving through its unique non line-of-sight sensing capability which allows vehicles to detect potential hazards, traffic, and road conditions from longer distances and sooner than other in-vehicle sensors such as cameras, radar, and LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging).Browse Complete Report of V2X Market (Vehicle-to-Everything) Communications Ecosystem 2019-2030 Research Report athttps://www.reportsnreports.com/reports/2058475-the-v2x-vehicle-to-everything-communications-ecosystem-2019-2030-opportunities-challenges-strategies-forecasts.htmlAlthough legacy V2I (Vehicle-to-Infrastructure) technologies are currently in operational use worldwide for ETC (Electronic Toll Collection) and relatively simple V2I applications, advanced V2X systems - capable of supporting V2V (Vehicle-to-Vehicle), V2I and other forms of V2X communications - are beginning to gain broad commercial acceptance with two competing technologies vying for the attention of automakers and regulators:  the commercially mature IEEE 802.11p/DSRC (Dedicated Short Range Communications) standard, and the relatively new 3GPP-defined C-V2X (Cellular V2X) technology which has a forward evolutionary path towards 5G.With an initial focus on road safety and traffic efficiency applications, Toyota and GM (General Motors) have already equipped some of their vehicle models with IEEE 802.11p-based V2X technology in Japan and North America.  Among other commercial commitments, Volkswagen will begin deploying IEEE 802.11p on volume models in Europe starting from 2019, while Geely and Ford plan to integrate C-V2X in their new vehicles by 2021 and 2022 respectively. It is also worth nothing that a number of luxury automakers - including BMW, Daimler, Volkswagen's subsidiary Audi, and Volvo Cars - already deliver certain V2X-type applications through wide-area cellular connectivity and supporting infrastructure such as appropriately equipped roadwork trailers.Despite the ongoing 802.11p/DSRC versus C-V2X debate, regulatory uncertainty and other challenges, global spending on V2X communications technology is expected to grow at a CAGR of more than 170% between 2019 and 2022.

Predicts that by the end of 2022, V2X will account for a market worth $1.2 Billion, with an installed base of nearly 6 Million V2X-equipped vehicles worldwide. While Toyota and other DSRC proponents are pushing ahead with their plans to roll out IEEE 802.11p in North America, Europe and Japan,  pre-commercial C-V2X deployments have recently gained considerable momentum, spearheaded by cellular industry giants such as Qualcomm and Huawei - with support from automakers including Ford, BMW, Daimler, Groupe PSA, SAIC, Geely, Volkswagen's luxury brand Audi, and JLR (Jaguar Land Rover). Regional markets are also visibly divided with the Chinese Government backing C-V2X, Europe leaning towards IEEE 802.11p through its recently published delegated act on C-ITS (Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems), and heated debates ensuing in the United States as a result of the 5GAA's waiver request to allow C-V2X deployments in the 5.9 GHz band. As a result, a number of automotive OEMs are beginning to adopt a flexible approach by choosing to deploy different technologies in different regions as they commit to V2X. For example, although GM has equipped its Cadillac CTS sedan vehicles with IEEE 802.11p in North America, the automaker is actively working with business partners to prepare for C-V2X deployment in China. Besides becoming a standard safety feature on an increasing number of vehicles, V2X communications technology - through its unique non line-of-sight sensing capability - will play a critical role in ensuring the safe and efficient operation of autonomous driving systems, particularly with the commercialization of next-generation V2X standards, specifically 5G-V2X and IEEE 802.11bd. The globally harmonized 5.9 GHz band continues to remain the preferred spectrum for V2X communications technology, with the exception of Japan - where the national regulator has allocated a single 9 MHz channel in the frequency range 755.5 - 764.5 MHz for safety-related applications based on V2V and V2I communications. Early discussions are ongoing for the potential use of new bands, most notably in the 3.4 - 3.8 GHz and 5.9 - 7.2 GHz frequency ranges, as well as millimeter wave spectrum for LOS (Line-of-Sight) and high data rate V2X applications. Recent field trials using 39 GHz spectrum in the United States have demonstrated that millimeter propagations for V2V communications can work well in the distance range of 100 meters, without advanced beamforming techniques.Inquire for More Details on this Research Report athttps://www.reportsnreports.com/contacts/inquirybeforebuy.aspx?name=2058475 Countires Covered: WorldwideList of Companies Mentioned:01LightCom 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project) 5GAA (5G Automotive Association) 5G-Connected Mobility Consortium 7Layers A1 Telekom Austria Group AASA AASHTO (American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials) Abu Dhabi Department of Transport ACEA (European Automobile Manufacturers' Association) ADI (Analog Devices Inc.)

Finally Some Merited Action Against China's 'Cultural Genocide'RealMoneyOctober 9, 2019 Wednesday 12:00 PM EDTCopyright 2019 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 812 wordsByline: Alex Frew McMillanHighlight: Let's hope the blacklisting of eight companies supplying surveillance equipment to the Chinese state is not just another chip on the U.S.-China trade negotiating table.BodyFinally, someone is doing something about China's most-flagrant human rights abuses. And it's the cartoon comedy show "South Park."I'm kidding. South Park took a stand on China's efforts to expand its censorship overseas with its "Band in China" episode. But actually, the staunchest move has come from the U.S. Commerce Department, which has placed eight Chinese tech companies and 20 public security bureaus on a blacklist barring them from doing business with U.S. counterparts.Well done. I've written recently that investors have a difficult choice to make surrounding Chinese holdings, particularly state-owned enterprises. The authoritarians in Beijing are doing their best to use corporate power to enforce their wishes in places such as Hong Kong.Last week,  the world's leaders are just sitting back and doing nothing about the concentration camps that, for two years, have detained more than 1 million ethnic minorities in western China. Besides outright detention, which China presents as voluntary re-education, it has also installed security cameras basically everywhere, required biometric scans, and waged "cultural genocide" to wipe out those cultures and homogenize them with Han Chinese.So I'm encouraged to see action against the companies that have aided and abetted these abuses. These eight companies all have tight ties with the Chinese state and happily provide their cutting-edge technology to the police state.The targets include the video surveillance companies Hikvision SZ:002415 and Zhejiang Dahua Technology. The list also includes artificial intelligence and facial recognition companies SenseTime Group and Megvii Technology, the latter of which is backed by Alibaba Group Holding  .Megvii, which counts China's Ministry of Public Security among its customers, has been planning to list with an initial public offering (IPO) in Hong Kong. It is reportedly looking to raise at least US$500 million. Goldman Sachs GS now says it is reviewing its role in the IPO in light of the U.S. government action. Citigroup C and J.P. Morgan Chase JPM are also among the IPO sponsors.The others on the list are Yitu Technologies, voice recognition developer iFlytek, data forensics specialist Xiamen Meiya Pico Information, and nanotechnology maker Yixin Science and Technology Co.They are now prevented from buying parts from U.S. companies without getting special permission. According to Reuters, which first reported the blacklist, Hikvision and Dahua both use parts from Intel  , Nvidia  , Western Digital  , Seagate Technology  and Ambarella  .Shares in all of those U.S. companies fell as word of the sanctions came out. None of them have regained lost ground and were drifting south on Wednesday.The smaller the company, the bigger its losses. Ambarella shares tumbled 13.2% on Tuesday, by some stretch the greatest impact. Seagate lost 4.1%, Western Digital 3.9%, Nvidia 3.8% and Intel 2.1%.I doubt the U.S. share price action will continue for long. But the blacklist is a big headache for the Chinese companies.Shenzhen-listed Hikvision has a market value of US$42.3 billion and is the market leader in video surveillance gear. It said on Wednesday that it is reducing its dependence on U.S. chips and parts, but could see a short-term impact from the blacklisting. It said it had been preparing for just such an event for around two years.The State Department has also placed visa restrictions on executives and officials that it believes are involved. It did not identify those people, but the party secretary of the provincial-level Xinjiang "Uyghur Autonomous Region," Cheng Quanguo, is a member of China's powerful politburo.The People's Government Public Security Bureau that rules Xinjiang with an iron fist was put on the Commerce Department blacklist. The other 19 bureaus fall under it.The "Entity List" that now includes the eight Chinese companies and 20 government bureaus is the same restrictive list that includes the mobile phone and telecom equipment maker Huawei Technologies Co.The "entities have been implicated in human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China's campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance against Uygurs, Kazakhs and other members of Muslim minority groups," the Commerce Department filing stated.U.S. officials say this is not a bargaining chip in the ongoing trade war with China. I certainly hope it is not. Human rights should not be part of an economic tussle.Beijing has insisted that the United States must desist and stand on the right side of history -- its version."We urge the U.S. side to immediately correct its mistake, withdraw the relevant decision and stop interfering in China's internal affairs," foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said in in a press conference.As to whether China will retaliate, "stay tuned," Geng warned.Load-Date: October 10, 2019End of Document

John Garamendi, D-California, issued the following statement, which was published in the Congressional Record on Oct. 17, introducing the Pharmaceutical Independence Long-Term Readiness Reform Act:* * *Today I introduce the "Pharmaceutical Independence Long-Term Readiness Reform Act." I want to thank Congresswoman HARTZLER for her support as an original cosponsor.Our legislation would require the Department of Defense to acquire and purchase only American-made raw materials, medicines, and vaccines for our military. It would also require the Department of Defense to identify the national security vulnerabilities caused by our country's current dependence on Chinese pharmaceuticals.As a result of the Chinese government's chokehold on the generic pharmaceutical market, our military service members have been left vulnerable. China is a principal creator of generic prescriptions, which account for approximately 90 percent of the global pharmaceutical market.The reality is that if the Chinese wanted to cripple the United States they could sabotage or cut off our supply of generic medications and antibiotics used by our military. This simply is a vulnerability that we cannot let continue to exist. We need to reinvigorate the United States' industrial base to produce generic medicines and antibiotics domestically, ensuring the readiness of our military forces.I urge all Members to join us in cosponsoring the "Pharmaceutical Independence Long-Term Readiness Reform Act."TARGETED NEWS SERVICE, Harwood Place, Springfield, Virginia, USA: Myron Struck, editor; 703/304-1897; editor@targetednews.com; https://targetednews.com-1411693Load-Date: October 18, 2019End of Document

5G: WHO CAN YOU TRUST?States News ServiceOctober 31, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 534 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: London, England BodyThe following information was released by the U.S. Embassy in London:Emerging 5G wireless networks will change the world. New interconnected applications will revolutionize businesses, improve infrastructure and transform personal communications.These new applications will be central to our lives, so keeping all this data secure is more important than ever.But how can you protect against violations of your privacy? What about stolen business secrets and disrupted vital infrastructure? As with everything else in modern society, you need to be able to trust your telecom company.What does it mean to trust a telecom company?Consumers need to be able to trust that their 5G provider will keep their data secure and provide uninterrupted service. This is more than a technical issue.On a recent call with journalists, Robert Strayer, the State Department's chief diplomat for cybersecurity, explained the importance of users knowing that their 5G telecom company "cannot be compromised by a foreign government and asked to take steps to undermine [their] software and firmware."Consumers are accustomed to constantly receiving hardware and software updates from their telecom companies. But what is in those updates? Strayer explained that assessment of one version as secure doesn't mean a telecom company won't later install a version that can be compromised.For telecom companies headquartered in Western countries, consumers have recourse and legal protections from data breaches. But consumers don't have such protections from telecom companies headquartered in China.Of course, every company claims it will never be compromised. This is why countries thinking of buying 5G networks should evaluate vendors based on objective factors. Strayer posed these questions to consider:Is the company headquartered in a country where there is rule of law and an independent judiciary in place? This provides evidence of whether a company can withstand pressure to compromise its network.Does the company have a transparent ownership structure? This ensures that consumers will know who is really making the decisions, particularly if a company is partially or wholly controlled by a foreign power.Does the company have a history of ethical behavior? Past performance is the best way to determine whether consumers can trust a company's claims that it will not compromise its networks.Is Huawei trustworthy?Huawei is hoping to produce and sell its 5G network equipment around the world. However, there are clear reasons for countries and consumers to act cautiously.Huawei is headquartered in China, a country without an independent judiciary or enforceable rule of law. China even has a law that requires companies to help the government spy. That means there is no way to challenge the Chinese government if it orders a company to spy or steal.Additionally, Huawei also has a history of ethical violations, including stealing secrets from its competitors."There's a long track record of intellectual property theft by Huawei and of violations of corruption laws around the world," said Strayer. When it comes to 5G, the U.S. and its allies "need to ensure that we have only trusted vendors in 5G networks."Load-Date: October 31, 2019End of Document

Video management software market is set to flourish with increasing application in security and surveillance servicesiCrowdNewswire (English)September 18, 2019 Wednesday 11:22 AM GMTCopyright 2019 iCrowdNewswire, LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1600 wordsBodyThe global video management software was valued at $4.12 billion in 2018 and projected to grow at a CAGR of 21% during the forecast period of 2019 to 2025.A video management software (VMS) or video management server is a system that collects videos from cameras and other electronic sources, stores and records the video to the storage device, and offers an interface to stream live videos and pre-recorded videos. The increasing density of surveillance cameras in numerous end-user verticals has increased the demand for video management software. Increasing risks related to property, identity, and resource theft are burgeoning the demand for monitoring and surveillance systems which, in turn, are increasing opportunities for video management software vendors. The global video management software was valued at $4.12 billion in 2018. Foreseeing the escalating security concerns and increased infiltration of the video surveillance system, the demand in theVideo Management Software Marketis projected to grow at a CAGR of 21% during the forecast period of 2019 to 2025. Rising requirements for real-time video feed and high-quality video processing are boosting the market growth. The report covers Video Management Software Market size by type and applications, Video Management Software Market share by top 5 companies and also the market share by start-ups during the forecast period.North America leading the regional marketplaceNorth America was observed to be the most profitable region in 2018, and accounted for 38.54% of the total video management software market share. The enormous presence of enterprises, and other commercial setups are resulting in the massive share held by North America in the market. The presence of multiple key players in the market allows customers a wide pool of services to choose from, which means the software developed by these companies are consumer centric and upgrades in line with customer's demand is imperative for companies to survive in the video management software market. Moreover, the dense concentration of innovative security initiatives and surveillance systems are responsible for the high demand in the market. According to the U.S.-based Project On Government Oversight (POGO), there are almost 30 million security cameras installed in the country. Among the states, Chicago has the maximum number of security cameras amounting to to around 30,000 cameras.Heavy funding into security services in the region is driving the video surveillance market in the region. The U.S. government invests large amounts into surveillance, monitoring, and security services which are recognized as the main reason for the massive double-digit market share held by the region. According to the American Civil Liberties Union, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is capable of requesting a match or identifying a match against over 640 million photos. Also, the FBI ran over 152,000 searches from October 2017 to April 2019 using its law enforcement database. The increasing surveillance activities to improve security and safety are projected to inject massive revenues into the North American video management market. However, the APAC region is also growing at a significant pace. The presence of some of the fastest growing economies in the world such as India, China, and Japan are increasing opportunities for the video management software market players.

Cloud computing is the need of the hour, with every business nowadays being based on the cloud. Cloud enables companies to scale their business according to requirement. All the data stored on the cloud is stored at a physical server located somewhere on the planet. This data is accessed through login credentials provided by the service provider over the Internet. Data stored in the media format on the cloud is vulnerable to cyber-attacks because it can be unethically accessed by hackers, which might raise questions regarding the privacy of people's data. Security breach at any level of cloud computing can lead to a significant loss to the company as well as to the service provider. The major characteristics encouraging growth of the video management software market are thecloud-oriented video recordings that optimizes the ability to store, replay, and playback recordings offline while accessing them from anywhere, scalable infrastructure, built-in system management, and reduced upfront costs. Owing to the above-stated factors, the cloud-based application in the video management software market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 24% during the forecast period.Integrated IoT and facial recognition enabled video management softwareThe emerging IoT technology isin the video monitoring software technology as well. Practices to place IoT cameras across various areas such as at offices, streets, parks and other public places is projected to significantly increase opportunities for vendors in the global video management software market. Facial recognition is a procedure that uses bio-metrics for identification and authentication of individuals by comparing their facial features with an image previously stored in the database. Facial recognition is gaining traction owing to its applications in the government, electronics, and defense and military verticals. A humungous amount of video is generated on a daily basis via CCTV cameras, which is further parsed through advanced video management software that recognizes the input of facial traits with an existing database to identify suspicious individuals and activities. Generally, this specific software is used by security services, police departments, and military and defense industries. Similar software is used by the traffic department to identify license plate numbers through IoT cameras. A well-established central database of the existing vehicles in a city could aid the traffic department to track the movement of a specific vehicle. Further, this technology will improvise upon the existing operating strategies in the traffic department, which will support the video management software growth.Importance of surveillance at power plantsPower plant operations include hazardous activities that can increase the risk of loss of lives and properties. For meeting with the security requirements in order to ensure the safe operation of power plants and for efficient handling of plant lifetime extension (PLEX) related issues, the application of video management software is imperative. Currently, nuclear power is responsible for sourcing a substantial 11% of the global electricity supply, whereas 12 countries are already using nuclear power for 30% of their supply as per the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). IAEA further noted that there are 449 operational nuclear power reactors globally, with 56 others under construction in 15 countries.Burgeoningdevelopments in the nuclear energy sector has opened up an array of opportunities for video monitoring software to be employed in power plants, as pressure monitoring, leakage detection, and fire detection are deemed to be of utmost importance in such hazardous environments.. To ensure the safety of the power plant, the agency provides essential provisions related to the importance of surveillance and monitoring through video streaming via cameras. Such initiatives by IAEA are projected to be one of the major drivers in the video monitoring software market.Talk to one of our sales representative about the full report by providing your details in the link below:https://www.industryarc.com/support.php?id=500587Video Management Software Market Competitive LandscapeA majority of the key players are investing huge capital to boost RandD activities into the video management software systems.

Patients 02002 and 02006 were treated with higher dose levels of RP-L102. Patients 02004 and 02005 received non-optimized and lower doses of RP-L102. Key highlights of the manuscript include:Follow-up data for the initial four patients 18-30 months post-infusion demonstrate progressively increased engraftment in peripheral blood leukocytes and in the bone marrow following administration of RP-L102 without the use of conditioning. In Patient 02002 at 30 months follow-up, approximately 44% of bone marrow CD34+ cells displayed gene marking, suggesting the engraftment of very primitive corrected hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Sequential increases in gene marking in peripheral blood and in the bone marrow for Patients 02004 and 02005 were also seen, but at more modest levels and after longer durations. The bone marrow resistance to MMC in Patient 02002 increased to 70% at 24 months, approaching the phenotype of a healthy donor. Patients 02004, 02005 and 02006 also displayed progressive increases in MMC resistance. DEB exposure resulted in a lower proportion of cells with aberrant chromosomes in Patients 02002, 02004 and 02006. Patient 02002 demonstrated stabilized neutrophil counts and hemoglobin levels as early as six months post-administration of RP-L102. Similar trends were also seen in Patient 02006. Progressive increases in the total number of corrected leukocytes were observed shortly after the initial administration of RP-L102 in all treated patients. Favorable safety profile with no serious adverse events associated with infusion of the investigational product in these initial four patients.07:08STOR STORE Capital increases quarterly dividend to $0.35/share from $0.33/share (37.08 )07:07STC Stewart Info confirms termination of Fidelity National (FNF) merger, names new CEO (33.77 )In light of the FTC's decision, the Stewart Board has clearly determined that leveraging the company's strong brand, financial position, and valued employees to grow the organization as a standalone entity will create the greatest shareholder value.

NfL is a protein that provides structural support to nerve fibres in the brain. An increase in the amount of NfL may be associated with nerve cell damage, and detection of increased NfL levels in blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may serve as a biomarker of nerve cell damage.In the Phase III OPERA I study in RMS and the ORATORIO study in PPMS, blood NfL levels were significantly lower after treatment with OCREVUS. In RMS, blood serum NfL levels were reduced by 43 percent from baseline to 96 weeks after OCREVUS treatment compared with a 31 percent reduction with interferon beta-1a (p<0.001). In PPMS, blood plasma NfL levels were reduced by 16 percent from baseline to 96 weeks after OCREVUS treatment compared with 0.2 percent reduction with placebo (p<0.001). Additionally, these analyses showed higher blood NfL levels at the start of the study were correlated with more disability progression in upper and lower limbs in PPMS and overall disability in the interferon beta-1a RMS treatment group at 96 weeks.06:03FTS Fortis announces five-year capital investment plan of $18.3 bln for the period 2020 to 2024, increases quarterly dividend to $0.4775/share from $0.45/share (42.08 )The co announced its five-year capital investment plan of $18.3 billion for the period 2020 to 2024, up $1.0 billion from the prior year's plan.

OS rates at five years were 13.4% for Opdivo and 2.6% for docetaxel. The OS benefit for Opdivo-treated patients was observed across all subgroups.The safety profile for patients treated with Opdivo was consistent with previously reported findings in second-line NSCLC and no new safety signals were seen with extended follow-up. Of patients still on study, only 2 of 70 experienced a new treatment-related select AE between years three and four and there were no new treatment-related select AE's reported between years four and five among the 55 patients still on study.Among patients with an objective response to Opdivo, 32.2% continued to see a response at five years. 0% of patients with an objective response to docetaxel continued to see a response at five years. The median duration of response was 19.9 months for Opdivo-treated patients and 5.6 months for patients treated with docetaxel.06:00ALNY Alnylam Pharma presents new clinical results for Givosiran -- Porphyria attack reductions observed in ENVISION Phase 3 study maintained with ongoing Givosiran dosing in open-label extension study (82.69 )ENVISION Phase 3 OLE Results -- As of the data cut-off date of January 31, 2019, all eligible patients (N=93) from the ENVISION Phase 3 study of givosiran rolled over into the OLE phase of the study. Reduction in the composite porphyria attack rate with givosiran treatment, which had been observed in the ENVISION Phase 3 study as early as one month after dosing, was shown to be sustained with continued dosing in the OLE phase of the study. Sustained reduction in levels of aminolevulinic acid (ALA), an intermediate in the heme biosynthesis pathway believed to be the primary neurotoxic intermediate responsible for causing both porphyria attacks and ongoing symptoms in between attacks, was also observed with continued dosing. Rapid and sustained lowering of attack rate and ALA levels was also observed in placebo patients who crossed over after the six-month double blind phase of the ENVISION Phase 3 study to receive givosiran in the OLE phase of the study. Givosiran's safety profile in the OLE phase has remained consistent with the profile observed in the double blind phase of the ENVISION study.ENVISION Results of Select Patient Reported Outcomes -- A number of patient reported outcomes were collected as secondary and exploratory measures in the ENVISION study. Daily worst pain did not achieve statistical significance based on the prespecified ANCOVA analysis (p equals 0.0530), however, the data were found to not be normally distributed. A post-hoc analysis of daily worst pain was therefore performed using the non-parametric stratified Wilcoxon test. Based on the non-parametric test, patients on givosiran had a significant reduction in daily worst pain (nominal p equals 0.0455). In exploratory analyses, the reductions in pain were accompanied by fewer days of use of both opioid and non-opioid analgesics. Givosiran did not impact daily worst fatigue or daily worst nausea at six months, although these assessments will be repeated at twelve months to explore the effects of longer term dosing. Updated Phase 1/2 OLE Results -- As of the data cut-off date of April 19, 2019, a robust treatment effect was maintained in givosiran-treated patients with continued dosing in the Phase 1/2 OLE study (N=16), with a mean time on treatment of 22.8 months and total time on treatment across the Phase 1 and OLE studies of up to 35 months. Substantial mean reductions in annualized attack rate (AAR) and in annualized hemin use of greater than 90 percent were observed, with evidence for sustained or potentially enhanced clinical activity with continued dosing. Five out of twelve patients (42 percent) who received givosiran during the Phase 1 study and continued with givosiran dosing in the OLE study and two out of four patients (50 percent) who had been in the placebo arm of the Phase 1 study and crossed over to givosiran treatment in the OLE study achieved an AAR of zero for a mean of 18.1 and 24.9 months, respectively.06:00ACN Accenture acquires Pragsis Bidoop; terms not disclosed (194.83 )Pragsis Bidoop, headquartered in Madrid with additional offices in Barcelona and the U.K., will add more than 200 employees with deep machine learning, artificial intelligence and big data engineering experience, along with its portfolio of end-to-end solutions, to Accenture's Applied Intelligence business.06:00ASX ASE Technology reports August net revenues +10.3% yr/yr to $1.28 bln (4.51 )06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- World markets ease back; S&P Futures take out yesterday's lowThe global equity markets are under slight pressure to start the day.

The S&P 500 (-0.01%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.2%), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%) finished near their flat lines.The small-cap Russell 2000 (+1.3%), which is home to many energy and financial stocks, outperformed the broader market.The market entered today on the heels of a two-week rally, with some investors beginning to feel less concerned about growth prospects and trade relations with China. For instance, data has shown the U.S. consumer to be resilient in the face of trade tensions, which could see a reprieve with trade talks coming up next month.This positive sentiment was manifested in the higher oil prices ($57.87/bbl, +$1.42, +2.5%) and the selling in the Treasury market on Monday. In turn, the S&P 500 financials (+1.5%) and energy (+1.9%) sectors were today's leaders, which were further boosted by their perceived value-oriented nature, as opposed to the crowded positioning in the information technology sector (-0.7%).The 2-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.62%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 98.32.The Dow Jones Transportation Average (+2.0%), which is a trade-sensitive group and is often viewed as a proxy for economic growth, also outperformed. The defensive-oriented real estate (-0.9%), health care (-0.9%), and utilities (-0.6%) sectors joined the tech sector as today's laggards.Separately, Saudi Arabia replaced its oil minister with a member of the royal family, which traders believed could portend favorable policy for oil prices. A less appreciated factor contributing to the outperformance in the energy sector was the relatively higher dividend yields that many energy companies provide yield-hunting investors.In corporate news, activist shareholder Elliot Management disclosed a $3.2 billion stake in AT&T (T 336.79, +0.54, +1.5%), sharing a plan with the company it thinks could boost the stock to $60 by the end of 2021. Much of the initial enthusiasm waned throughout the session, leaving shares of AT&T near their session lows.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit Report for July:Consumer credit increased by $23.3 bln in July (Briefing.com consensus $18.2 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $13.8 bln (from $14.6 bln) in June. That is the largest expansion since July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is the recognition that revolving credit expanded at its fastest pace since November 2017. That could mean one of two things: (1) consumers are using revolving credit more because they lack the cash to cover spending on basic needs or (2) consumers are using revolving credit more because they feel confident about repayment capabilities due to feelings of job security. Only future economic data will tell the real tale, but in the context of a U.S. growth outlook, the expansion in consumer credit in July is apt to be taken at face value as an an encouraging sign.Looking ahead, investors will receive the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +21.9% YTDS&P 500 +18.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.0% YTDRussell 2000 +13.0% YTD16:20IMXI International Money Express announces secondary public offering of 5,217,392 shares of common stock by selling stockholders (13.60 -0.55)Shares will be offered by affiliates of Stella Point Capital and certain of the company's other stockholders.

Additionally, the company has decided to discontinue the development of MRT5201, a liver-targeted treatment for OTC deficiency.The company's decision to discontinue the development of MRT5201 for OTC deficiency is based on data from recently completed preclinical studies that do not support the desired pharmacokinetic and safety profile for advancement of the program. These data are related to the first-generation lipid nanoparticle (LNP) designed to be delivered to the liver via intravenous administration for the OTC deficiency program. As such, this LNP is different than that used in the CF and other pulmonary development programs which are designed to deliver the LNP-encapsulated mRNA through nebulization. Additionally, ongoing discovery efforts have generated promising, novel next-generation LNPs supporting the further development of liver disease mRNA therapeutics with potentially favorable product profiles.The company's prioritization of pulmonary diseases is supported by the previously reported positive single-ascending dose Phase 1/2 data from the CF program, which utilizes its proprietary lung delivery platform. MRT5005 is a first-in-class mRNA therapeutic designed to address the underlying cause of CF regardless of genetic mutation by delivering mRNA encoding fully functional cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein to cells in the lung through nebulization. The multiple-ascending dose portion of the clinical trial is ongoing with data expected in 2020.16:08CASY Casey's General beats by $0.28, beats on revs; reaffirms guidance (167.30 -2.03)Reports Q1 (Jul) earnings of $2.31 per share, $0.28 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $2.03; revenues rose 1.5% year/year to $2.63 bln vs the $2.59 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

Patients 02002 and 02006 were treated with higher dose levels of RP-L102. Patients 02004 and 02005 received non-optimized and lower doses of RP-L102. Key highlights of the manuscript include:Follow-up data for the initial four patients 18-30 months post-infusion demonstrate progressively increased engraftment in peripheral blood leukocytes and in the bone marrow following administration of RP-L102 without the use of conditioning. In Patient 02002 at 30 months follow-up, approximately 44% of bone marrow CD34+ cells displayed gene marking, suggesting the engraftment of very primitive corrected hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Sequential increases in gene marking in peripheral blood and in the bone marrow for Patients 02004 and 02005 were also seen, but at more modest levels and after longer durations. The bone marrow resistance to MMC in Patient 02002 increased to 70% at 24 months, approaching the phenotype of a healthy donor. Patients 02004, 02005 and 02006 also displayed progressive increases in MMC resistance. DEB exposure resulted in a lower proportion of cells with aberrant chromosomes in Patients 02002, 02004 and 02006. Patient 02002 demonstrated stabilized neutrophil counts and hemoglobin levels as early as six months post-administration of RP-L102. Similar trends were also seen in Patient 02006. Progressive increases in the total number of corrected leukocytes were observed shortly after the initial administration of RP-L102 in all treated patients. Favorable safety profile with no serious adverse events associated with infusion of the investigational product in these initial four patients.07:08STOR STORE Capital increases quarterly dividend to $0.35/share from $0.33/share (37.08 )07:07STC Stewart Info confirms termination of Fidelity National (FNF) merger, names new CEO (33.77 )In light of the FTC's decision, the Stewart Board has clearly determined that leveraging the company's strong brand, financial position, and valued employees to grow the organization as a standalone entity will create the greatest shareholder value.

NfL is a protein that provides structural support to nerve fibres in the brain. An increase in the amount of NfL may be associated with nerve cell damage, and detection of increased NfL levels in blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may serve as a biomarker of nerve cell damage.In the Phase III OPERA I study in RMS and the ORATORIO study in PPMS, blood NfL levels were significantly lower after treatment with OCREVUS. In RMS, blood serum NfL levels were reduced by 43 percent from baseline to 96 weeks after OCREVUS treatment compared with a 31 percent reduction with interferon beta-1a (p<0.001). In PPMS, blood plasma NfL levels were reduced by 16 percent from baseline to 96 weeks after OCREVUS treatment compared with 0.2 percent reduction with placebo (p<0.001). Additionally, these analyses showed higher blood NfL levels at the start of the study were correlated with more disability progression in upper and lower limbs in PPMS and overall disability in the interferon beta-1a RMS treatment group at 96 weeks.06:03FTS Fortis announces five-year capital investment plan of $18.3 bln for the period 2020 to 2024, increases quarterly dividend to $0.4775/share from $0.45/share (42.08 )The co announced its five-year capital investment plan of $18.3 billion for the period 2020 to 2024, up $1.0 billion from the prior year's plan.

OS rates at five years were 13.4% for Opdivo and 2.6% for docetaxel. The OS benefit for Opdivo-treated patients was observed across all subgroups.The safety profile for patients treated with Opdivo was consistent with previously reported findings in second-line NSCLC and no new safety signals were seen with extended follow-up. Of patients still on study, only 2 of 70 experienced a new treatment-related select AE between years three and four and there were no new treatment-related select AE's reported between years four and five among the 55 patients still on study.Among patients with an objective response to Opdivo, 32.2% continued to see a response at five years. 0% of patients with an objective response to docetaxel continued to see a response at five years. The median duration of response was 19.9 months for Opdivo-treated patients and 5.6 months for patients treated with docetaxel.06:00ALNY Alnylam Pharma presents new clinical results for Givosiran -- Porphyria attack reductions observed in ENVISION Phase 3 study maintained with ongoing Givosiran dosing in open-label extension study (82.69 )ENVISION Phase 3 OLE Results -- As of the data cut-off date of January 31, 2019, all eligible patients (N=93) from the ENVISION Phase 3 study of givosiran rolled over into the OLE phase of the study. Reduction in the composite porphyria attack rate with givosiran treatment, which had been observed in the ENVISION Phase 3 study as early as one month after dosing, was shown to be sustained with continued dosing in the OLE phase of the study. Sustained reduction in levels of aminolevulinic acid (ALA), an intermediate in the heme biosynthesis pathway believed to be the primary neurotoxic intermediate responsible for causing both porphyria attacks and ongoing symptoms in between attacks, was also observed with continued dosing. Rapid and sustained lowering of attack rate and ALA levels was also observed in placebo patients who crossed over after the six-month double blind phase of the ENVISION Phase 3 study to receive givosiran in the OLE phase of the study. Givosiran's safety profile in the OLE phase has remained consistent with the profile observed in the double blind phase of the ENVISION study.ENVISION Results of Select Patient Reported Outcomes -- A number of patient reported outcomes were collected as secondary and exploratory measures in the ENVISION study. Daily worst pain did not achieve statistical significance based on the prespecified ANCOVA analysis (p equals 0.0530), however, the data were found to not be normally distributed. A post-hoc analysis of daily worst pain was therefore performed using the non-parametric stratified Wilcoxon test. Based on the non-parametric test, patients on givosiran had a significant reduction in daily worst pain (nominal p equals 0.0455). In exploratory analyses, the reductions in pain were accompanied by fewer days of use of both opioid and non-opioid analgesics. Givosiran did not impact daily worst fatigue or daily worst nausea at six months, although these assessments will be repeated at twelve months to explore the effects of longer term dosing. Updated Phase 1/2 OLE Results -- As of the data cut-off date of April 19, 2019, a robust treatment effect was maintained in givosiran-treated patients with continued dosing in the Phase 1/2 OLE study (N=16), with a mean time on treatment of 22.8 months and total time on treatment across the Phase 1 and OLE studies of up to 35 months. Substantial mean reductions in annualized attack rate (AAR) and in annualized hemin use of greater than 90 percent were observed, with evidence for sustained or potentially enhanced clinical activity with continued dosing. Five out of twelve patients (42 percent) who received givosiran during the Phase 1 study and continued with givosiran dosing in the OLE study and two out of four patients (50 percent) who had been in the placebo arm of the Phase 1 study and crossed over to givosiran treatment in the OLE study achieved an AAR of zero for a mean of 18.1 and 24.9 months, respectively.06:00ACN Accenture acquires Pragsis Bidoop; terms not disclosed (194.83 )Pragsis Bidoop, headquartered in Madrid with additional offices in Barcelona and the U.K., will add more than 200 employees with deep machine learning, artificial intelligence and big data engineering experience, along with its portfolio of end-to-end solutions, to Accenture's Applied Intelligence business.06:00ASX ASE Technology reports August net revenues +10.3% yr/yr to $1.28 bln (4.51 )06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- World markets ease back; S&P Futures take out yesterday's lowThe global equity markets are under slight pressure to start the day.

The S&P 500 (-0.01%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.2%), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%) finished near their flat lines.The small-cap Russell 2000 (+1.3%), which is home to many energy and financial stocks, outperformed the broader market.The market entered today on the heels of a two-week rally, with some investors beginning to feel less concerned about growth prospects and trade relations with China. For instance, data has shown the U.S. consumer to be resilient in the face of trade tensions, which could see a reprieve with trade talks coming up next month.This positive sentiment was manifested in the higher oil prices ($57.87/bbl, +$1.42, +2.5%) and the selling in the Treasury market on Monday. In turn, the S&P 500 financials (+1.5%) and energy (+1.9%) sectors were today's leaders, which were further boosted by their perceived value-oriented nature, as opposed to the crowded positioning in the information technology sector (-0.7%).The 2-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.62%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 98.32.The Dow Jones Transportation Average (+2.0%), which is a trade-sensitive group and is often viewed as a proxy for economic growth, also outperformed. The defensive-oriented real estate (-0.9%), health care (-0.9%), and utilities (-0.6%) sectors joined the tech sector as today's laggards.Separately, Saudi Arabia replaced its oil minister with a member of the royal family, which traders believed could portend favorable policy for oil prices. A less appreciated factor contributing to the outperformance in the energy sector was the relatively higher dividend yields that many energy companies provide yield-hunting investors.In corporate news, activist shareholder Elliot Management disclosed a $3.2 billion stake in AT&T (T 336.79, +0.54, +1.5%), sharing a plan with the company it thinks could boost the stock to $60 by the end of 2021. Much of the initial enthusiasm waned throughout the session, leaving shares of AT&T near their session lows.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit Report for July:Consumer credit increased by $23.3 bln in July (Briefing.com consensus $18.2 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $13.8 bln (from $14.6 bln) in June. That is the largest expansion since July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is the recognition that revolving credit expanded at its fastest pace since November 2017. That could mean one of two things: (1) consumers are using revolving credit more because they lack the cash to cover spending on basic needs or (2) consumers are using revolving credit more because they feel confident about repayment capabilities due to feelings of job security. Only future economic data will tell the real tale, but in the context of a U.S. growth outlook, the expansion in consumer credit in July is apt to be taken at face value as an an encouraging sign.Looking ahead, investors will receive the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +21.9% YTDS&P 500 +18.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.0% YTDRussell 2000 +13.0% YTD16:20IMXI International Money Express announces secondary public offering of 5,217,392 shares of common stock by selling stockholders (13.60 -0.55)Shares will be offered by affiliates of Stella Point Capital and certain of the company's other stockholders.

Additionally, the company has decided to discontinue the development of MRT5201, a liver-targeted treatment for OTC deficiency.The company's decision to discontinue the development of MRT5201 for OTC deficiency is based on data from recently completed preclinical studies that do not support the desired pharmacokinetic and safety profile for advancement of the program. These data are related to the first-generation lipid nanoparticle (LNP) designed to be delivered to the liver via intravenous administration for the OTC deficiency program. As such, this LNP is different than that used in the CF and other pulmonary development programs which are designed to deliver the LNP-encapsulated mRNA through nebulization. Additionally, ongoing discovery efforts have generated promising, novel next-generation LNPs supporting the further development of liver disease mRNA therapeutics with potentially favorable product profiles.The company's prioritization of pulmonary diseases is supported by the previously reported positive single-ascending dose Phase 1/2 data from the CF program, which utilizes its proprietary lung delivery platform. MRT5005 is a first-in-class mRNA therapeutic designed to address the underlying cause of CF regardless of genetic mutation by delivering mRNA encoding fully functional cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein to cells in the lung through nebulization. The multiple-ascending dose portion of the clinical trial is ongoing with data expected in 2020.16:08CASY Casey's General beats by $0.28, beats on revs; reaffirms guidance (167.30 -2.03)Reports Q1 (Jul) earnings of $2.31 per share, $0.28 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $2.03; revenues rose 1.5% year/year to $2.63 bln vs the $2.59 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

The S&P 500 is down 0.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is flat, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.2%. The Russell 2000 (+1.2%) outperforms for the second straight day.Today's action has reflected much of yesterday's value trade that benefits underperforming areas of the stock market, most notably the S&P 500 energy sector (+1.8%) and SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.36, +0.93, +2.2%). An upturn in Boeing (BA 366.34, +7.56, +2.1%) and many of the transportation stocks has had a similar effect on the industrials sector (+0.5%).The gains in these areas, however, are coming at the expense of crowded groups like the S&P 500 information technology sector (-0.9%), which is the S&P 500's most heavily-weighted sector. The real estate sector (-1.7%), which investors had piled into for its higher dividend yields and low-beta disposition, is today's worst performer.Allowing today's value trade to play out are the improved views on trade and growth, which have helped some money flow out of the Treasury market and drive yields higher. The 2-yr yield is up seven basis points to 1.64%, and the 10-yr yield is up seven basis points to 1.69%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 98.35.Separately, the market saw a sharp uptick on a report from the South China Morning Post indicating that China is ready to purchase more agricultural products from the U.S. The caveat, though, is that China would want the U.S. to agree to delay tariffs and ease its supply ban on Huawei. Nothing material has transpired, but the report likely triggered some algorithms.Some story stocks today include Wendy's (WEN 19.45, -2.50, -11.4%) and Ford Motor (F 9.28, -0.26, -2.9%). Wendy's is down big after the company lowered its earnings guidance to reflect costs needed to expand its breakfast menu nationwide. Ford Motor is down after its senior unsecured debt was downgraded to "junk status" at Moody's.Reviewing today's economic data, which included the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July.The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August declined to 103.1 from 104.7 in July. The August reading was its lowest in five months, but the index remains running at elevated levels.The July Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey showed that job openings declined to 7.217 million from a revised 7.248 million in June (from 7.348 million).As a reminder, Apple's (AAPL 214.13, -0.10, -0.1%) annual product event is expected to start within the next few minutes.12:25 ETDow +2.20 at 26837.69, Nasdaq -19.78 at 8067.69, S&P -6.80 at 2971.63[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 has come well off its lows (-0.7%) and now trades near its highs with a loss of 0.2%.The recent move in the market has come amid a further increase in U.S. Treasury yields, as investors continue to leave the crowded U.S. Treasury market. Currently, the benchmark 10-yr note yield is up six basis points to 1.68%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows Facebook (FB 186.85, -1.91, -1.0%) leading the group lower. Apple (AAPL 213.84, -0.34, -0.2%), Amazon (AMZN 1821.60, -9.75, -0.5%), Netflix (NFLX 293.22, -0.80, -0.3%) hold modest losses, while Alphabet (GOOG 1205.88, +0.14, +0.1%) is up 0.1%.11:55 ETDow +6.78 at 26842.27, Nasdaq -34.79 at 8052.68, S&P -9.79 at 2968.64[BRIEFING.COM] The market has seen a recent uptick on news that China is expected to agree to purchase more agriculture products at the October trade meeting. The S&P 500 is down 0.3%, while the Dow is up 0.1%.The news was reported by the South China Morning Post, whose sources also said China, in exchange, would ask the U.S. to delay tariffs increases and ease a supply ban against Huawei. The report has likely triggered the algorithms, as it's unclear if the U.S. will agree to the deal.Overseas, the major European indices closed on a higher note. Germany's DAX increased 0.3%, UK's FTSE increased 0.4%, and France's CAC increased 0.1%. The Europe Stoxx 600 increased 0.1%.11:25 ETDow -84.51 at 26750.98, Nasdaq -68.45 at 8019.02, S&P -19.88 at 2958.55[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to waver in negative territory. The S&P 500 is down 0.6%, the Dow is down 0.3%, and the Nasdaq is down 0.7%.Semiconductor stocks are struggling today, evidenced by the losses seen in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-0.7%). Applied Materials (AMAT 49.82, -0.84, -1.7%) has shown relative weakness. On the other hand, the Dow Jones Transportation Average (+0.9%) is seeing continued strength from yesterday.Separately, HD Supply Holdings (HDS 37.44, -3.38, -8.3%) has dropped 8% after the company issued downside guidance for the third quarter and lowered its FY20 guidance. HD Supply is an industrial distributor in North America.11:00 ETDow -116.25 at 26719.24, Nasdaq -62.38 at 8025.09, S&P -18.92 at 2959.51[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is currently down near session lows with a loss of 0.7%. Yesterday's "value" trade has weakened a bit with the S&P 500 financials sector (-0.5%) sliding into the red.The energy sector, which is up 1.7%, continues to uphold its end of the value bargain. Another gain in the price of oil ($58.63/bbl, +0.80, +1.4%) has been a nice support for the group.Separately, shares of Boeing (BA 363.00, +4.35) are up 1.2%, giving the price-weighed Dow (-0.4%) some support.10:25 ETDow -65.90 at 26769.59, Nasdaq -49.23 at 8038.24, S&P -15.08 at 2963.35[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades down 0.5% as the retreat in technology shares continues.The broader information technology sector is down 1.3%, and the consumer discretionary sector is down 1.2%. The underpeformance in Microsoft (MSFT 135.22, -2.26, -1.6%) and Amazon (AMZN 1814.95, -16.40, -0.9%) today has reflected broader efforts to take profits from cyclical stocks that have outperformed.Other notable laggards include Ford Motor (F 9.13, -0.42, -4.4%) and Wendy's (WEN 19.67, -2.28, -10.5%). Moody's downgraded Ford's senior unsecured rating to "junk status," citing a weak financial outlook. Wendy's is down after it lowered its earnings guidance to reflect its efforts to launch a breakfast menu nationwide.10:00 ETDow -68.99 at 26766.5, Nasdaq -76.19 at 8011.28, S&P -18.86 at 2959.57[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.6%, and the Russell 2000 trades lower by 0.4%.Just in, the July Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey showed that job openings declined to 7.217 million from a revised 7.248 million in June (from 7.348 million).09:40 ETDow -66.98 at 26768.51, Nasdaq -61.64 at 8025.83, S&P -15.02 at 2963.41[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages begin the day on a lower note. The S&P 500 is down 0.4%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.7%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows the information technology (-1.2%) and health care (-1.0%) sectors leading today's decline. The energy (+1.1%) and financials (+0.3%) sectors are the lone sectors up today amid higher oil prices ($58.08, +0.23, +0.4%) and higher U.S. Treasury yields. The groups might also be benefiting from a value-oriented trade.The 2-yr yield is up three basis points to 1.60%, and the 10-yr yield is up three basis points to 1.65%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.1% to 98.36.09:15 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -7.10. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -33.80.The stock market is on pace to open slightly lower with the S&P 500 futures trading seven points, or 0.2%, below fair value following a dull pre-market session.Apple's (AAPL 213.76, -0.41, -0.2%) annual product event at 1:00 p.m. ET today is an obligatory news headline, although expectations aren't too high this year.Elsewhere, some eyebrows have been raised after Wendy's (WEN 20.51, -1.44, -6.6%) announced plans to launch a breakfast menu next year, Moody's downgraded Ford Motor's (F 9.15, -0.39, -4.1%) senior unsecured rating to "junk status," and HD Supply Holdings (HDS 39.00, -1.82, -4.5%) lowered its FY20 guidance.Other than that, there isn't a lot of "new" macro news today. Investors might look to see if yesterday's "value" trade plays out again, where recent underperforming stocks outperform.08:50 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -6.90.

China reported hotter than expected inflation figures for August due to an ongoing pork shortage. Jilin Transportation Investment Group elected to not exercise a call option on a perpetual note and will instead pay a higher coupon, which is likely to invite concerns about the group's cash position. Bloomberg noted that this was the first time that a Chinese local government financing vehicle did not exercise a call option on its debt.

China's Premier Li Kegiang reportedly repeated Beijing's willingness to make trade progress.At the same time, the market is holding steady in front of an ECB policy decision on Thursday and the Retail Sales Report for August on Friday, which could alter the market's assumptions about growth.

The S&P 500 (-0.01%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.2%), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%) finished near their flat lines.The small-cap Russell 2000 (+1.3%), which is home to many energy and financial stocks, outperformed the broader market.The market entered today on the heels of a two-week rally, with some investors beginning to feel less concerned about growth prospects and trade relations with China. For instance, data has shown the U.S. consumer to be resilient in the face of trade tensions, which could see a reprieve with trade talks coming up next month.This positive sentiment was manifested in the higher oil prices ($57.87/bbl, +$1.42, +2.5%) and the selling in the Treasury market on Monday. In turn, the S&P 500 financials (+1.5%) and energy (+1.9%) sectors were today's leaders, which were further boosted by their perceived value-oriented nature, as opposed to the crowded positioning in the information technology sector (-0.7%).The 2-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.62%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 98.32.The Dow Jones Transportation Average (+2.0%), which is a trade-sensitive group and is often viewed as a proxy for economic growth, also outperformed. The defensive-oriented real estate (-0.9%), health care (-0.9%), and utilities (-0.6%) sectors joined the tech sector as today's laggards.Separately, Saudi Arabia replaced its oil minister with a member of the royal family, which traders believed could portend favorable policy for oil prices. A less appreciated factor contributing to the outperformance in the energy sector was the relatively higher dividend yields that many energy companies provide yield-hunting investors.In corporate news, activist shareholder Elliot Management disclosed a $3.2 billion stake in AT&T (T 336.79, +0.54, +1.5%), sharing a plan with the company it thinks could boost the stock to $60 by the end of 2021. Much of the initial enthusiasm waned throughout the session, leaving shares of AT&T near their session lows.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit Report for July:Consumer credit increased by $23.3 bln in July (Briefing.com consensus $18.2 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $13.8 bln (from $14.6 bln) in June. That is the largest expansion since July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is the recognition that revolving credit expanded at its fastest pace since November 2017. That could mean one of two things: (1) consumers are using revolving credit more because they lack the cash to cover spending on basic needs or (2) consumers are using revolving credit more because they feel confident about repayment capabilities due to feelings of job security. Only future economic data will tell the real tale, but in the context of a U.S. growth outlook, the expansion in consumer credit in July is apt to be taken at face value as an an encouraging sign.Looking ahead, investors will receive the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +21.9% YTDS&P 500 +18.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.0% YTDRussell 2000 +13.0% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1771/1084. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1875/1201.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: September 10, 2019End of Document

Also announced new 10.2" iPad.The DJIA's modest move lower leaves the index 0.18% lower since the start of August.Elsewhere, at the top of the hour, the Treasury's $38 bln 3-year note auction drew a high yield of 1.573% on a bid-to-cover of 2.42.12:55 ETDow +14.61 at 26850.1, Nasdaq -12.71 at 8074.76, S&P -4.11 at 2974.32[BRIEFING.COM] The stock market trades mixed, as investors shift away from crowded areas of the market and into more value-oriented sectors like energy and retail. The S&P 500 is down 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%. The Russell 2000 (+1.2%) outperforms for the second straight day.Today's action has reflected much of yesterday's value trade that benefits underperforming areas of the stock market, most notably the S&P 500 energy sector (+1.8%) and SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.36, +0.93, +2.2%). An upturn in Boeing (BA 366.34, +7.56, +2.1%) and many of the transportation stocks has had a similar effect on the industrials sector (+0.5%).The gains in these areas, however, are coming at the expense of crowded groups like the S&P 500 information technology sector (-0.9%), which is the S&P 500's most heavily-weighted sector. The real estate sector (-1.7%), which investors had piled into for its higher dividend yields and low-beta disposition, is today's worst performer.Allowing today's value trade to play out are the improved views on trade and growth, which have helped some money flow out of the Treasury market and drive yields higher. The 2-yr yield is up seven basis points to 1.64%, and the 10-yr yield is up seven basis points to 1.69%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 98.35.Separately, the market saw a sharp uptick on a report from the South China Morning Post indicating that China is ready to purchase more agricultural products from the U.S. The caveat, though, is that China would want the U.S. to agree to delay tariffs and ease its supply ban on Huawei. Nothing material has transpired, but the report likely triggered some algorithms.Some story stocks today include Wendy's (WEN 19.45, -2.50, -11.4%) and Ford Motor (F 9.28, -0.26, -2.9%). Wendy's is down big after the company lowered its earnings guidance to reflect costs needed to expand its breakfast menu nationwide. Ford Motor is down after its senior unsecured debt was downgraded to "junk status" at Moody's.Reviewing today's economic data, which included the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July.The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August declined to 103.1 from 104.7 in July. The August reading was its lowest in five months, but the index remains running at elevated levels.The July Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey showed that job openings declined to 7.217 million from a revised 7.248 million in June (from 7.348 million).As a reminder, Apple's (AAPL 214.13, -0.10, -0.1%) annual product event is expected to start within the next few minutes.12:25 ETDow +2.20 at 26837.69, Nasdaq -19.78 at 8067.69, S&P -6.80 at 2971.63[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 has come well off its lows (-0.7%) and now trades near its highs with a loss of 0.2%.The recent move in the market has come amid a further increase in U.S. Treasury yields, as investors continue to leave the crowded U.S. Treasury market. Currently, the benchmark 10-yr note yield is up six basis points to 1.68%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows Facebook (FB 186.85, -1.91, -1.0%) leading the group lower. Apple (AAPL 213.84, -0.34, -0.2%), Amazon (AMZN 1821.60, -9.75, -0.5%), Netflix (NFLX 293.22, -0.80, -0.3%) hold modest losses, while Alphabet (GOOG 1205.88, +0.14, +0.1%) is up 0.1%.11:55 ETDow +6.78 at 26842.27, Nasdaq -34.79 at 8052.68, S&P -9.79 at 2968.64[BRIEFING.COM] The market has seen a recent uptick on news that China is expected to agree to purchase more agriculture products at the October trade meeting. The S&P 500 is down 0.3%, while the Dow is up 0.1%.The news was reported by the South China Morning Post, whose sources also said China, in exchange, would ask the U.S. to delay tariffs increases and ease a supply ban against Huawei. The report has likely triggered the algorithms, as it's unclear if the U.S. will agree to the deal.Overseas, the major European indices closed on a higher note. Germany's DAX increased 0.3%, UK's FTSE increased 0.4%, and France's CAC increased 0.1%. The Europe Stoxx 600 increased 0.1%.11:25 ETDow -84.51 at 26750.98, Nasdaq -68.45 at 8019.02, S&P -19.88 at 2958.55[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to waver in negative territory. The S&P 500 is down 0.6%, the Dow is down 0.3%, and the Nasdaq is down 0.7%.Semiconductor stocks are struggling today, evidenced by the losses seen in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-0.7%). Applied Materials (AMAT 49.82, -0.84, -1.7%) has shown relative weakness. On the other hand, the Dow Jones Transportation Average (+0.9%) is seeing continued strength from yesterday.Separately, HD Supply Holdings (HDS 37.44, -3.38, -8.3%) has dropped 8% after the company issued downside guidance for the third quarter and lowered its FY20 guidance. HD Supply is an industrial distributor in North America.11:00 ETDow -116.25 at 26719.24, Nasdaq -62.38 at 8025.09, S&P -18.92 at 2959.51[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is currently down near session lows with a loss of 0.7%. Yesterday's "value" trade has weakened a bit with the S&P 500 financials sector (-0.5%) sliding into the red.The energy sector, which is up 1.7%, continues to uphold its end of the value bargain. Another gain in the price of oil ($58.63/bbl, +0.80, +1.4%) has been a nice support for the group.Separately, shares of Boeing (BA 363.00, +4.35) are up 1.2%, giving the price-weighed Dow (-0.4%) some support.10:25 ETDow -65.90 at 26769.59, Nasdaq -49.23 at 8038.24, S&P -15.08 at 2963.35[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades down 0.5% as the retreat in technology shares continues.The broader information technology sector is down 1.3%, and the consumer discretionary sector is down 1.2%. The underpeformance in Microsoft (MSFT 135.22, -2.26, -1.6%) and Amazon (AMZN 1814.95, -16.40, -0.9%) today has reflected broader efforts to take profits from cyclical stocks that have outperformed.Other notable laggards include Ford Motor (F 9.13, -0.42, -4.4%) and Wendy's (WEN 19.67, -2.28, -10.5%). Moody's downgraded Ford's senior unsecured rating to "junk status," citing a weak financial outlook. Wendy's is down after it lowered its earnings guidance to reflect its efforts to launch a breakfast menu nationwide.10:00 ETDow -68.99 at 26766.5, Nasdaq -76.19 at 8011.28, S&P -18.86 at 2959.57[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.6%, and the Russell 2000 trades lower by 0.4%.Just in, the July Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey showed that job openings declined to 7.217 million from a revised 7.248 million in June (from 7.348 million).09:40 ETDow -66.98 at 26768.51, Nasdaq -61.64 at 8025.83, S&P -15.02 at 2963.41[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages begin the day on a lower note. The S&P 500 is down 0.4%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.7%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows the information technology (-1.2%) and health care (-1.0%) sectors leading today's decline. The energy (+1.1%) and financials (+0.3%) sectors are the lone sectors up today amid higher oil prices ($58.08, +0.23, +0.4%) and higher U.S. Treasury yields. The groups might also be benefiting from a value-oriented trade.The 2-yr yield is up three basis points to 1.60%, and the 10-yr yield is up three basis points to 1.65%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.1% to 98.36.09:15 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -7.10. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -33.80.The stock market is on pace to open slightly lower with the S&P 500 futures trading seven points, or 0.2%, below fair value following a dull pre-market session.Apple's (AAPL 213.76, -0.41, -0.2%) annual product event at 1:00 p.m. ET today is an obligatory news headline, although expectations aren't too high this year.Elsewhere, some eyebrows have been raised after Wendy's (WEN 20.51, -1.44, -6.6%) announced plans to launch a breakfast menu next year, Moody's downgraded Ford Motor's (F 9.15, -0.39, -4.1%) senior unsecured rating to "junk status," and HD Supply Holdings (HDS 39.00, -1.82, -4.5%) lowered its FY20 guidance.Other than that, there isn't a lot of "new" macro news today. Investors might look to see if yesterday's "value" trade plays out again, where recent underperforming stocks outperform.08:50 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -6.90. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -30.00.The S&P 500 futures trade seven points, or 0.2%, below fair value.Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region ended Tuesday on a mixed note. China reported hotter than expected inflation figures for August due to an ongoing pork shortage. Jilin Transportation Investment Group elected to not exercise a call option on a perpetual note and will instead pay a higher coupon, which is likely to invite concerns about the group's cash position. Bloomberg noted that this was the first time that a Chinese local government financing vehicle did not exercise a call option on its debt. North Korea fired two projectiles into the East Sea, shortly after a DPRK official indicated that North Korea is ready for another round of talks with U.S. officials.In economic data: China's August CPI +0.7% m/m (expected 0.5%; last 0.4%); +2.8% yr/yr (expected 2.6%; last 2.8%).

Some consolidation appears to be taking shape after a recent stretch of gains, while the market awaits some key events later this week.For the moment, the narrative in the market's mind is that U.S. consumer spending could continue to support growth and that trade tensions with China may not escalate before their trade talks in October. China's Premier Li Kegiang reportedly repeated Beijing's willingness to make trade progress.At the same time, the market is holding steady in front of an ECB policy decision on Thursday and the Retail Sales Report for August on Friday, which could alter the market's assumptions about growth. Today, though, many investors will tune in to Apple's (AAPL 213.73, -0.44, -0.2%) annual product event at 1:00 p.m. ET, where it will likely unveil its latest iPhone.In economic data, investors will receive the JOLTS - Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey for July at 10:00 a.m. ET.

The S&P 500 (-0.01%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.2%), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%) finished near their flat lines.The small-cap Russell 2000 (+1.3%), which is home to many energy and financial stocks, outperformed the broader market.The market entered today on the heels of a two-week rally, with some investors beginning to feel less concerned about growth prospects and trade relations with China. For instance, data has shown the U.S. consumer to be resilient in the face of trade tensions, which could see a reprieve with trade talks coming up next month.This positive sentiment was manifested in the higher oil prices ($57.87/bbl, +$1.42, +2.5%) and the selling in the Treasury market on Monday. In turn, the S&P 500 financials (+1.5%) and energy (+1.9%) sectors were today's leaders, which were further boosted by their perceived value-oriented nature, as opposed to the crowded positioning in the information technology sector (-0.7%).The 2-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.62%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 98.32.The Dow Jones Transportation Average (+2.0%), which is a trade-sensitive group and is often viewed as a proxy for economic growth, also outperformed. The defensive-oriented real estate (-0.9%), health care (-0.9%), and utilities (-0.6%) sectors joined the tech sector as today's laggards.Separately, Saudi Arabia replaced its oil minister with a member of the royal family, which traders believed could portend favorable policy for oil prices. A less appreciated factor contributing to the outperformance in the energy sector was the relatively higher dividend yields that many energy companies provide yield-hunting investors.In corporate news, activist shareholder Elliot Management disclosed a $3.2 billion stake in AT&T (T 336.79, +0.54, +1.5%), sharing a plan with the company it thinks could boost the stock to $60 by the end of 2021. Much of the initial enthusiasm waned throughout the session, leaving shares of AT&T near their session lows.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit Report for July:Consumer credit increased by $23.3 bln in July (Briefing.com consensus $18.2 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $13.8 bln (from $14.6 bln) in June. That is the largest expansion since July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is the recognition that revolving credit expanded at its fastest pace since November 2017. That could mean one of two things: (1) consumers are using revolving credit more because they lack the cash to cover spending on basic needs or (2) consumers are using revolving credit more because they feel confident about repayment capabilities due to feelings of job security. Only future economic data will tell the real tale, but in the context of a U.S. growth outlook, the expansion in consumer credit in July is apt to be taken at face value as an an encouraging sign.Looking ahead, investors will receive the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +21.9% YTDS&P 500 +18.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.0% YTDRussell 2000 +13.0% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1771/1084. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1875/1201.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: September 10, 2019End of Document

Also announced in the last half hour were Apple Health partnerships and a new Apple Watch.13:30 ETDow -18.80 at 26816.69, Nasdaq -29.38 at 8058.09, S&P -8.98 at 2969.45[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages haven't shifted much in the last half hour; the Nasdaq Composite sits 0.36% lower, the S&P 500 sheds 0.30%, and the DJIA loses 0.07%.Top decliners in the Dow Jones Industrial Average include Visa (V 175.06, -6.49, -3.57%), McDonald's (MCD 209.92, -7.34, -3.38%), and American Express (AXP 116.94, -2.98, -2.48%).Conversely, chemical giant Dow (DOW 45.68, +1.23, +2.77%) sits atop the index.Also, Apple's (AAPL 215.71, +1.54, +0.72%) iPhone event started after the bottom of the hour; the company thus far has discussed its Arcade service (available Sept. 19 at $4.99 per month) and the AppleTV+ service which will be available on Nov. 1 starting at $4.99 per month and offer one year of free AppleTV+ with a new device purchase. Also announced new 10.2" iPad.The DJIA's modest move lower leaves the index 0.18% lower since the start of August.Elsewhere, at the top of the hour, the Treasury's $38 bln 3-year note auction drew a high yield of 1.573% on a bid-to-cover of 2.42.12:55 ETDow +14.61 at 26850.1, Nasdaq -12.71 at 8074.76, S&P -4.11 at 2974.32[BRIEFING.COM] The stock market trades mixed, as investors shift away from crowded areas of the market and into more value-oriented sectors like energy and retail. The S&P 500 is down 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%. The Russell 2000 (+1.2%) outperforms for the second straight day.Today's action has reflected much of yesterday's value trade that benefits underperforming areas of the stock market, most notably the S&P 500 energy sector (+1.8%) and SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.36, +0.93, +2.2%). An upturn in Boeing (BA 366.34, +7.56, +2.1%) and many of the transportation stocks has had a similar effect on the industrials sector (+0.5%).The gains in these areas, however, are coming at the expense of crowded groups like the S&P 500 information technology sector (-0.9%), which is the S&P 500's most heavily-weighted sector. The real estate sector (-1.7%), which investors had piled into for its higher dividend yields and low-beta disposition, is today's worst performer.Allowing today's value trade to play out are the improved views on trade and growth, which have helped some money flow out of the Treasury market and drive yields higher. The 2-yr yield is up seven basis points to 1.64%, and the 10-yr yield is up seven basis points to 1.69%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 98.35.Separately, the market saw a sharp uptick on a report from the South China Morning Post indicating that China is ready to purchase more agricultural products from the U.S. The caveat, though, is that China would want the U.S. to agree to delay tariffs and ease its supply ban on Huawei. Nothing material has transpired, but the report likely triggered some algorithms.Some story stocks today include Wendy's (WEN 19.45, -2.50, -11.4%) and Ford Motor (F 9.28, -0.26, -2.9%). Wendy's is down big after the company lowered its earnings guidance to reflect costs needed to expand its breakfast menu nationwide. Ford Motor is down after its senior unsecured debt was downgraded to "junk status" at Moody's.Reviewing today's economic data, which included the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July.The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August declined to 103.1 from 104.7 in July. The August reading was its lowest in five months, but the index remains running at elevated levels.The July Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey showed that job openings declined to 7.217 million from a revised 7.248 million in June (from 7.348 million).As a reminder, Apple's (AAPL 214.13, -0.10, -0.1%) annual product event is expected to start within the next few minutes.12:25 ETDow +2.20 at 26837.69, Nasdaq -19.78 at 8067.69, S&P -6.80 at 2971.63[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 has come well off its lows (-0.7%) and now trades near its highs with a loss of 0.2%.The recent move in the market has come amid a further increase in U.S. Treasury yields, as investors continue to leave the crowded U.S. Treasury market. Currently, the benchmark 10-yr note yield is up six basis points to 1.68%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows Facebook (FB 186.85, -1.91, -1.0%) leading the group lower. Apple (AAPL 213.84, -0.34, -0.2%), Amazon (AMZN 1821.60, -9.75, -0.5%), Netflix (NFLX 293.22, -0.80, -0.3%) hold modest losses, while Alphabet (GOOG 1205.88, +0.14, +0.1%) is up 0.1%.11:55 ETDow +6.78 at 26842.27, Nasdaq -34.79 at 8052.68, S&P -9.79 at 2968.64[BRIEFING.COM] The market has seen a recent uptick on news that China is expected to agree to purchase more agriculture products at the October trade meeting. The S&P 500 is down 0.3%, while the Dow is up 0.1%.The news was reported by the South China Morning Post, whose sources also said China, in exchange, would ask the U.S. to delay tariffs increases and ease a supply ban against Huawei. The report has likely triggered the algorithms, as it's unclear if the U.S. will agree to the deal.Overseas, the major European indices closed on a higher note. Germany's DAX increased 0.3%, UK's FTSE increased 0.4%, and France's CAC increased 0.1%. The Europe Stoxx 600 increased 0.1%.11:25 ETDow -84.51 at 26750.98, Nasdaq -68.45 at 8019.02, S&P -19.88 at 2958.55[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to waver in negative territory. The S&P 500 is down 0.6%, the Dow is down 0.3%, and the Nasdaq is down 0.7%.Semiconductor stocks are struggling today, evidenced by the losses seen in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-0.7%). Applied Materials (AMAT 49.82, -0.84, -1.7%) has shown relative weakness. On the other hand, the Dow Jones Transportation Average (+0.9%) is seeing continued strength from yesterday.Separately, HD Supply Holdings (HDS 37.44, -3.38, -8.3%) has dropped 8% after the company issued downside guidance for the third quarter and lowered its FY20 guidance. HD Supply is an industrial distributor in North America.11:00 ETDow -116.25 at 26719.24, Nasdaq -62.38 at 8025.09, S&P -18.92 at 2959.51[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is currently down near session lows with a loss of 0.7%. Yesterday's "value" trade has weakened a bit with the S&P 500 financials sector (-0.5%) sliding into the red.The energy sector, which is up 1.7%, continues to uphold its end of the value bargain. Another gain in the price of oil ($58.63/bbl, +0.80, +1.4%) has been a nice support for the group.Separately, shares of Boeing (BA 363.00, +4.35) are up 1.2%, giving the price-weighed Dow (-0.4%) some support.10:25 ETDow -65.90 at 26769.59, Nasdaq -49.23 at 8038.24, S&P -15.08 at 2963.35[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades down 0.5% as the retreat in technology shares continues.The broader information technology sector is down 1.3%, and the consumer discretionary sector is down 1.2%. The underpeformance in Microsoft (MSFT 135.22, -2.26, -1.6%) and Amazon (AMZN 1814.95, -16.40, -0.9%) today has reflected broader efforts to take profits from cyclical stocks that have outperformed.Other notable laggards include Ford Motor (F 9.13, -0.42, -4.4%) and Wendy's (WEN 19.67, -2.28, -10.5%). Moody's downgraded Ford's senior unsecured rating to "junk status," citing a weak financial outlook. Wendy's is down after it lowered its earnings guidance to reflect its efforts to launch a breakfast menu nationwide.10:00 ETDow -68.99 at 26766.5, Nasdaq -76.19 at 8011.28, S&P -18.86 at 2959.57[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.6%, and the Russell 2000 trades lower by 0.4%.Just in, the July Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey showed that job openings declined to 7.217 million from a revised 7.248 million in June (from 7.348 million).09:40 ETDow -66.98 at 26768.51, Nasdaq -61.64 at 8025.83, S&P -15.02 at 2963.41[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages begin the day on a lower note. The S&P 500 is down 0.4%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.7%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows the information technology (-1.2%) and health care (-1.0%) sectors leading today's decline. The energy (+1.1%) and financials (+0.3%) sectors are the lone sectors up today amid higher oil prices ($58.08, +0.23, +0.4%) and higher U.S. Treasury yields. The groups might also be benefiting from a value-oriented trade.The 2-yr yield is up three basis points to 1.60%, and the 10-yr yield is up three basis points to 1.65%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.1% to 98.36.09:15 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -7.10. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -33.80.The stock market is on pace to open slightly lower with the S&P 500 futures trading seven points, or 0.2%, below fair value following a dull pre-market session.Apple's (AAPL 213.76, -0.41, -0.2%) annual product event at 1:00 p.m. ET today is an obligatory news headline, although expectations aren't too high this year.Elsewhere, some eyebrows have been raised after Wendy's (WEN 20.51, -1.44, -6.6%) announced plans to launch a breakfast menu next year, Moody's downgraded Ford Motor's (F 9.15, -0.39, -4.1%) senior unsecured rating to "junk status," and HD Supply Holdings (HDS 39.00, -1.82, -4.5%) lowered its FY20 guidance.Other than that, there isn't a lot of "new" macro news today. Investors might look to see if yesterday's "value" trade plays out again, where recent underperforming stocks outperform.08:50 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -6.90. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -30.00.The S&P 500 futures trade seven points, or 0.2%, below fair value.Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region ended Tuesday on a mixed note. China reported hotter than expected inflation figures for August due to an ongoing pork shortage. Jilin Transportation Investment Group elected to not exercise a call option on a perpetual note and will instead pay a higher coupon, which is likely to invite concerns about the group's cash position. Bloomberg noted that this was the first time that a Chinese local government financing vehicle did not exercise a call option on its debt. North Korea fired two projectiles into the East Sea, shortly after a DPRK official indicated that North Korea is ready for another round of talks with U.S. officials.In economic data: China's August CPI +0.7% m/m (expected 0.5%; last 0.4%); +2.8% yr/yr (expected 2.6%; last 2.8%).

Some consolidation appears to be taking shape after a recent stretch of gains, while the market awaits some key events later this week.For the moment, the narrative in the market's mind is that U.S. consumer spending could continue to support growth and that trade tensions with China may not escalate before their trade talks in October. China's Premier Li Kegiang reportedly repeated Beijing's willingness to make trade progress.At the same time, the market is holding steady in front of an ECB policy decision on Thursday and the Retail Sales Report for August on Friday, which could alter the market's assumptions about growth. Today, though, many investors will tune in to Apple's (AAPL 213.73, -0.44, -0.2%) annual product event at 1:00 p.m. ET, where it will likely unveil its latest iPhone.In economic data, investors will receive the JOLTS - Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey for July at 10:00 a.m. ET. The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August declined to 103.1 from 104.7 in July.U.S. Treasuries are slightly lower, nudging yields higher.

The S&P 500 (-0.01%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.2%), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%) finished near their flat lines.The small-cap Russell 2000 (+1.3%), which is home to many energy and financial stocks, outperformed the broader market.The market entered today on the heels of a two-week rally, with some investors beginning to feel less concerned about growth prospects and trade relations with China. For instance, data has shown the U.S. consumer to be resilient in the face of trade tensions, which could see a reprieve with trade talks coming up next month.This positive sentiment was manifested in the higher oil prices ($57.87/bbl, +$1.42, +2.5%) and the selling in the Treasury market on Monday. In turn, the S&P 500 financials (+1.5%) and energy (+1.9%) sectors were today's leaders, which were further boosted by their perceived value-oriented nature, as opposed to the crowded positioning in the information technology sector (-0.7%).The 2-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.62%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 98.32.The Dow Jones Transportation Average (+2.0%), which is a trade-sensitive group and is often viewed as a proxy for economic growth, also outperformed. The defensive-oriented real estate (-0.9%), health care (-0.9%), and utilities (-0.6%) sectors joined the tech sector as today's laggards.Separately, Saudi Arabia replaced its oil minister with a member of the royal family, which traders believed could portend favorable policy for oil prices. A less appreciated factor contributing to the outperformance in the energy sector was the relatively higher dividend yields that many energy companies provide yield-hunting investors.In corporate news, activist shareholder Elliot Management disclosed a $3.2 billion stake in AT&T (T 336.79, +0.54, +1.5%), sharing a plan with the company it thinks could boost the stock to $60 by the end of 2021. Much of the initial enthusiasm waned throughout the session, leaving shares of AT&T near their session lows.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit Report for July:Consumer credit increased by $23.3 bln in July (Briefing.com consensus $18.2 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $13.8 bln (from $14.6 bln) in June. That is the largest expansion since July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is the recognition that revolving credit expanded at its fastest pace since November 2017. That could mean one of two things: (1) consumers are using revolving credit more because they lack the cash to cover spending on basic needs or (2) consumers are using revolving credit more because they feel confident about repayment capabilities due to feelings of job security. Only future economic data will tell the real tale, but in the context of a U.S. growth outlook, the expansion in consumer credit in July is apt to be taken at face value as an an encouraging sign.Looking ahead, investors will receive the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +21.9% YTDS&P 500 +18.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.0% YTDRussell 2000 +13.0% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1771/1084. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1875/1201.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: September 10, 2019End of Document

The S&P 500 is still in second place, down 0.41%.The worst performers in the S&P 500 include Marketaxess (MKTX 339.11, -30.58, -8.27%), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG 787.48, -52.17, -6.21%), and Ball Corp (BLL 71.64, -3.43, -4.57%). CMG is near a one-month low after news that New York City is suing the company for alleged labor law violations.Conversely, biotechnology company Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR 19.88, +2.02, +11.31%) sits atop the index, extending opening gains which stemmed from last night's insider purchase disclosure by Chief Scientific Officer Stephen Doberstein.At the Apple (AAPL 214.42, +0.25, +0.12%) iPhone event, CEO Tim Cook unveiled a "Pro" iPhone 11 model and the new A13 Bionic chipset.14:00 ETDow -5.96 at 26829.53, Nasdaq -24.27 at 8063.2, S&P -7.06 at 2971.37[BRIEFING.COM] The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite remains at the bottom of the sector standings, though comfortably off session lows.Gold futures settled $11.90 lower (-0.8%) to $1,499.20/oz, below the $1,500 level for the first time in five weeks.The U.S. Dollar Index sits less than 0.1% higher to 98.35.Apple's (AAPL 213.82, -0.35, -0.16%) iPhone event remains ongoing and the company announced the latest iteration of its iPhone line in the last 30 minutes -- the iPhone 11. Also announced in the last half hour were Apple Health partnerships and a new Apple Watch.13:30 ETDow -18.80 at 26816.69, Nasdaq -29.38 at 8058.09, S&P -8.98 at 2969.45[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages haven't shifted much in the last half hour; the Nasdaq Composite sits 0.36% lower, the S&P 500 sheds 0.30%, and the DJIA loses 0.07%.Top decliners in the Dow Jones Industrial Average include Visa (V 175.06, -6.49, -3.57%), McDonald's (MCD 209.92, -7.34, -3.38%), and American Express (AXP 116.94, -2.98, -2.48%).Conversely, chemical giant Dow (DOW 45.68, +1.23, +2.77%) sits atop the index.Also, Apple's (AAPL 215.71, +1.54, +0.72%) iPhone event started after the bottom of the hour; the company thus far has discussed its Arcade service (available Sept. 19 at $4.99 per month) and the AppleTV+ service which will be available on Nov. 1 starting at $4.99 per month and offer one year of free AppleTV+ with a new device purchase. Also announced new 10.2" iPad.The DJIA's modest move lower leaves the index 0.18% lower since the start of August.Elsewhere, at the top of the hour, the Treasury's $38 bln 3-year note auction drew a high yield of 1.573% on a bid-to-cover of 2.42.12:55 ETDow +14.61 at 26850.1, Nasdaq -12.71 at 8074.76, S&P -4.11 at 2974.32[BRIEFING.COM] The stock market trades mixed, as investors shift away from crowded areas of the market and into more value-oriented sectors like energy and retail. The S&P 500 is down 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%. The Russell 2000 (+1.2%) outperforms for the second straight day.Today's action has reflected much of yesterday's value trade that benefits underperforming areas of the stock market, most notably the S&P 500 energy sector (+1.8%) and SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.36, +0.93, +2.2%). An upturn in Boeing (BA 366.34, +7.56, +2.1%) and many of the transportation stocks has had a similar effect on the industrials sector (+0.5%).The gains in these areas, however, are coming at the expense of crowded groups like the S&P 500 information technology sector (-0.9%), which is the S&P 500's most heavily-weighted sector. The real estate sector (-1.7%), which investors had piled into for its higher dividend yields and low-beta disposition, is today's worst performer.Allowing today's value trade to play out are the improved views on trade and growth, which have helped some money flow out of the Treasury market and drive yields higher. The 2-yr yield is up seven basis points to 1.64%, and the 10-yr yield is up seven basis points to 1.69%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 98.35.Separately, the market saw a sharp uptick on a report from the South China Morning Post indicating that China is ready to purchase more agricultural products from the U.S. The caveat, though, is that China would want the U.S. to agree to delay tariffs and ease its supply ban on Huawei. Nothing material has transpired, but the report likely triggered some algorithms.Some story stocks today include Wendy's (WEN 19.45, -2.50, -11.4%) and Ford Motor (F 9.28, -0.26, -2.9%). Wendy's is down big after the company lowered its earnings guidance to reflect costs needed to expand its breakfast menu nationwide. Ford Motor is down after its senior unsecured debt was downgraded to "junk status" at Moody's.Reviewing today's economic data, which included the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July.The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August declined to 103.1 from 104.7 in July. The August reading was its lowest in five months, but the index remains running at elevated levels.The July Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey showed that job openings declined to 7.217 million from a revised 7.248 million in June (from 7.348 million).As a reminder, Apple's (AAPL 214.13, -0.10, -0.1%) annual product event is expected to start within the next few minutes.12:25 ETDow +2.20 at 26837.69, Nasdaq -19.78 at 8067.69, S&P -6.80 at 2971.63[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 has come well off its lows (-0.7%) and now trades near its highs with a loss of 0.2%.The recent move in the market has come amid a further increase in U.S. Treasury yields, as investors continue to leave the crowded U.S. Treasury market. Currently, the benchmark 10-yr note yield is up six basis points to 1.68%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows Facebook (FB 186.85, -1.91, -1.0%) leading the group lower. Apple (AAPL 213.84, -0.34, -0.2%), Amazon (AMZN 1821.60, -9.75, -0.5%), Netflix (NFLX 293.22, -0.80, -0.3%) hold modest losses, while Alphabet (GOOG 1205.88, +0.14, +0.1%) is up 0.1%.11:55 ETDow +6.78 at 26842.27, Nasdaq -34.79 at 8052.68, S&P -9.79 at 2968.64[BRIEFING.COM] The market has seen a recent uptick on news that China is expected to agree to purchase more agriculture products at the October trade meeting. The S&P 500 is down 0.3%, while the Dow is up 0.1%.The news was reported by the South China Morning Post, whose sources also said China, in exchange, would ask the U.S. to delay tariffs increases and ease a supply ban against Huawei. The report has likely triggered the algorithms, as it's unclear if the U.S. will agree to the deal.Overseas, the major European indices closed on a higher note. Germany's DAX increased 0.3%, UK's FTSE increased 0.4%, and France's CAC increased 0.1%. The Europe Stoxx 600 increased 0.1%.11:25 ETDow -84.51 at 26750.98, Nasdaq -68.45 at 8019.02, S&P -19.88 at 2958.55[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to waver in negative territory. The S&P 500 is down 0.6%, the Dow is down 0.3%, and the Nasdaq is down 0.7%.Semiconductor stocks are struggling today, evidenced by the losses seen in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-0.7%). Applied Materials (AMAT 49.82, -0.84, -1.7%) has shown relative weakness. On the other hand, the Dow Jones Transportation Average (+0.9%) is seeing continued strength from yesterday.Separately, HD Supply Holdings (HDS 37.44, -3.38, -8.3%) has dropped 8% after the company issued downside guidance for the third quarter and lowered its FY20 guidance. HD Supply is an industrial distributor in North America.11:00 ETDow -116.25 at 26719.24, Nasdaq -62.38 at 8025.09, S&P -18.92 at 2959.51[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is currently down near session lows with a loss of 0.7%. Yesterday's "value" trade has weakened a bit with the S&P 500 financials sector (-0.5%) sliding into the red.The energy sector, which is up 1.7%, continues to uphold its end of the value bargain. Another gain in the price of oil ($58.63/bbl, +0.80, +1.4%) has been a nice support for the group.Separately, shares of Boeing (BA 363.00, +4.35) are up 1.2%, giving the price-weighed Dow (-0.4%) some support.10:25 ETDow -65.90 at 26769.59, Nasdaq -49.23 at 8038.24, S&P -15.08 at 2963.35[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades down 0.5% as the retreat in technology shares continues.The broader information technology sector is down 1.3%, and the consumer discretionary sector is down 1.2%. The underpeformance in Microsoft (MSFT 135.22, -2.26, -1.6%) and Amazon (AMZN 1814.95, -16.40, -0.9%) today has reflected broader efforts to take profits from cyclical stocks that have outperformed.Other notable laggards include Ford Motor (F 9.13, -0.42, -4.4%) and Wendy's (WEN 19.67, -2.28, -10.5%). Moody's downgraded Ford's senior unsecured rating to "junk status," citing a weak financial outlook. Wendy's is down after it lowered its earnings guidance to reflect its efforts to launch a breakfast menu nationwide.10:00 ETDow -68.99 at 26766.5, Nasdaq -76.19 at 8011.28, S&P -18.86 at 2959.57[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.6%, and the Russell 2000 trades lower by 0.4%.Just in, the July Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey showed that job openings declined to 7.217 million from a revised 7.248 million in June (from 7.348 million).09:40 ETDow -66.98 at 26768.51, Nasdaq -61.64 at 8025.83, S&P -15.02 at 2963.41[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages begin the day on a lower note. The S&P 500 is down 0.4%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.7%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows the information technology (-1.2%) and health care (-1.0%) sectors leading today's decline. The energy (+1.1%) and financials (+0.3%) sectors are the lone sectors up today amid higher oil prices ($58.08, +0.23, +0.4%) and higher U.S. Treasury yields. The groups might also be benefiting from a value-oriented trade.The 2-yr yield is up three basis points to 1.60%, and the 10-yr yield is up three basis points to 1.65%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.1% to 98.36.09:15 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -7.10. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -33.80.The stock market is on pace to open slightly lower with the S&P 500 futures trading seven points, or 0.2%, below fair value following a dull pre-market session.Apple's (AAPL 213.76, -0.41, -0.2%) annual product event at 1:00 p.m. ET today is an obligatory news headline, although expectations aren't too high this year.Elsewhere, some eyebrows have been raised after Wendy's (WEN 20.51, -1.44, -6.6%) announced plans to launch a breakfast menu next year, Moody's downgraded Ford Motor's (F 9.15, -0.39, -4.1%) senior unsecured rating to "junk status," and HD Supply Holdings (HDS 39.00, -1.82, -4.5%) lowered its FY20 guidance.Other than that, there isn't a lot of "new" macro news today. Investors might look to see if yesterday's "value" trade plays out again, where recent underperforming stocks outperform.08:50 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -6.90.

China reported hotter than expected inflation figures for August due to an ongoing pork shortage. Jilin Transportation Investment Group elected to not exercise a call option on a perpetual note and will instead pay a higher coupon, which is likely to invite concerns about the group's cash position. Bloomberg noted that this was the first time that a Chinese local government financing vehicle did not exercise a call option on its debt. North Korea fired two projectiles into the East Sea, shortly after a DPRK official indicated that North Korea is ready for another round of talks with U.S. officials.In economic data: China's August CPI +0.7% m/m (expected 0.5%; last 0.4%); +2.8% yr/yr (expected 2.6%; last 2.8%).

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -31.50.The S&P 500 futures trade six points, or 0.2%, below fair value after a flat day yesterday. Some consolidation appears to be taking shape after a recent stretch of gains, while the market awaits some key events later this week.For the moment, the narrative in the market's mind is that U.S. consumer spending could continue to support growth and that trade tensions with China may not escalate before their trade talks in October. China's Premier Li Kegiang reportedly repeated Beijing's willingness to make trade progress.At the same time, the market is holding steady in front of an ECB policy decision on Thursday and the Retail Sales Report for August on Friday, which could alter the market's assumptions about growth. Today, though, many investors will tune in to Apple's (AAPL 213.73, -0.44, -0.2%) annual product event at 1:00 p.m. ET, where it will likely unveil its latest iPhone.In economic data, investors will receive the JOLTS - Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey for July at 10:00 a.m. ET.

The S&P 500 (-0.01%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.2%), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%) finished near their flat lines.The small-cap Russell 2000 (+1.3%), which is home to many energy and financial stocks, outperformed the broader market.The market entered today on the heels of a two-week rally, with some investors beginning to feel less concerned about growth prospects and trade relations with China. For instance, data has shown the U.S. consumer to be resilient in the face of trade tensions, which could see a reprieve with trade talks coming up next month.This positive sentiment was manifested in the higher oil prices ($57.87/bbl, +$1.42, +2.5%) and the selling in the Treasury market on Monday. In turn, the S&P 500 financials (+1.5%) and energy (+1.9%) sectors were today's leaders, which were further boosted by their perceived value-oriented nature, as opposed to the crowded positioning in the information technology sector (-0.7%).The 2-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.62%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 98.32.The Dow Jones Transportation Average (+2.0%), which is a trade-sensitive group and is often viewed as a proxy for economic growth, also outperformed. The defensive-oriented real estate (-0.9%), health care (-0.9%), and utilities (-0.6%) sectors joined the tech sector as today's laggards.Separately, Saudi Arabia replaced its oil minister with a member of the royal family, which traders believed could portend favorable policy for oil prices. A less appreciated factor contributing to the outperformance in the energy sector was the relatively higher dividend yields that many energy companies provide yield-hunting investors.In corporate news, activist shareholder Elliot Management disclosed a $3.2 billion stake in AT&T (T 336.79, +0.54, +1.5%), sharing a plan with the company it thinks could boost the stock to $60 by the end of 2021. Much of the initial enthusiasm waned throughout the session, leaving shares of AT&T near their session lows.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit Report for July:Consumer credit increased by $23.3 bln in July (Briefing.com consensus $18.2 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $13.8 bln (from $14.6 bln) in June. That is the largest expansion since July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is the recognition that revolving credit expanded at its fastest pace since November 2017. That could mean one of two things: (1) consumers are using revolving credit more because they lack the cash to cover spending on basic needs or (2) consumers are using revolving credit more because they feel confident about repayment capabilities due to feelings of job security.

The streaming service will launch on Nov.1 and will be billed at $4.99 per month, which was below expectations.Looking ahead, RH (RH 156.39, +2.88, +1.8%) and Dave & Busters (PLAY 44.00, +1.50, +3.5%) will report earnings after today's close.14:30 ETDow -37.34 at 26798.15, Nasdaq -42.46 at 8045.01, S&P -12.12 at 2966.31[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have slipped a little in the last half hour, though still stand firmly within their daily ranges. The S&P 500 is still in second place, down 0.41%.The worst performers in the S&P 500 include Marketaxess (MKTX 339.11, -30.58, -8.27%), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG 787.48, -52.17, -6.21%), and Ball Corp (BLL 71.64, -3.43, -4.57%). CMG is near a one-month low after news that New York City is suing the company for alleged labor law violations.Conversely, biotechnology company Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR 19.88, +2.02, +11.31%) sits atop the index, extending opening gains which stemmed from last night's insider purchase disclosure by Chief Scientific Officer Stephen Doberstein.At the Apple (AAPL 214.42, +0.25, +0.12%) iPhone event, CEO Tim Cook unveiled a "Pro" iPhone 11 model and the new A13 Bionic chipset.14:00 ETDow -5.96 at 26829.53, Nasdaq -24.27 at 8063.2, S&P -7.06 at 2971.37[BRIEFING.COM] The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite remains at the bottom of the sector standings, though comfortably off session lows.Gold futures settled $11.90 lower (-0.8%) to $1,499.20/oz, below the $1,500 level for the first time in five weeks.The U.S. Dollar Index sits less than 0.1% higher to 98.35.Apple's (AAPL 213.82, -0.35, -0.16%) iPhone event remains ongoing and the company announced the latest iteration of its iPhone line in the last 30 minutes -- the iPhone 11. Also announced in the last half hour were Apple Health partnerships and a new Apple Watch.13:30 ETDow -18.80 at 26816.69, Nasdaq -29.38 at 8058.09, S&P -8.98 at 2969.45[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages haven't shifted much in the last half hour; the Nasdaq Composite sits 0.36% lower, the S&P 500 sheds 0.30%, and the DJIA loses 0.07%.Top decliners in the Dow Jones Industrial Average include Visa (V 175.06, -6.49, -3.57%), McDonald's (MCD 209.92, -7.34, -3.38%), and American Express (AXP 116.94, -2.98, -2.48%).Conversely, chemical giant Dow (DOW 45.68, +1.23, +2.77%) sits atop the index.Also, Apple's (AAPL 215.71, +1.54, +0.72%) iPhone event started after the bottom of the hour; the company thus far has discussed its Arcade service (available Sept. 19 at $4.99 per month) and the AppleTV+ service which will be available on Nov. 1 starting at $4.99 per month and offer one year of free AppleTV+ with a new device purchase. Also announced new 10.2" iPad.The DJIA's modest move lower leaves the index 0.18% lower since the start of August.Elsewhere, at the top of the hour, the Treasury's $38 bln 3-year note auction drew a high yield of 1.573% on a bid-to-cover of 2.42.12:55 ETDow +14.61 at 26850.1, Nasdaq -12.71 at 8074.76, S&P -4.11 at 2974.32[BRIEFING.COM] The stock market trades mixed, as investors shift away from crowded areas of the market and into more value-oriented sectors like energy and retail. The S&P 500 is down 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%. The Russell 2000 (+1.2%) outperforms for the second straight day.Today's action has reflected much of yesterday's value trade that benefits underperforming areas of the stock market, most notably the S&P 500 energy sector (+1.8%) and SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.36, +0.93, +2.2%). An upturn in Boeing (BA 366.34, +7.56, +2.1%) and many of the transportation stocks has had a similar effect on the industrials sector (+0.5%).The gains in these areas, however, are coming at the expense of crowded groups like the S&P 500 information technology sector (-0.9%), which is the S&P 500's most heavily-weighted sector. The real estate sector (-1.7%), which investors had piled into for its higher dividend yields and low-beta disposition, is today's worst performer.Allowing today's value trade to play out are the improved views on trade and growth, which have helped some money flow out of the Treasury market and drive yields higher. The 2-yr yield is up seven basis points to 1.64%, and the 10-yr yield is up seven basis points to 1.69%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 98.35.Separately, the market saw a sharp uptick on a report from the South China Morning Post indicating that China is ready to purchase more agricultural products from the U.S. The caveat, though, is that China would want the U.S. to agree to delay tariffs and ease its supply ban on Huawei. Nothing material has transpired, but the report likely triggered some algorithms.Some story stocks today include Wendy's (WEN 19.45, -2.50, -11.4%) and Ford Motor (F 9.28, -0.26, -2.9%). Wendy's is down big after the company lowered its earnings guidance to reflect costs needed to expand its breakfast menu nationwide. Ford Motor is down after its senior unsecured debt was downgraded to "junk status" at Moody's.Reviewing today's economic data, which included the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July.The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August declined to 103.1 from 104.7 in July. The August reading was its lowest in five months, but the index remains running at elevated levels.The July Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey showed that job openings declined to 7.217 million from a revised 7.248 million in June (from 7.348 million).As a reminder, Apple's (AAPL 214.13, -0.10, -0.1%) annual product event is expected to start within the next few minutes.12:25 ETDow +2.20 at 26837.69, Nasdaq -19.78 at 8067.69, S&P -6.80 at 2971.63[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 has come well off its lows (-0.7%) and now trades near its highs with a loss of 0.2%.The recent move in the market has come amid a further increase in U.S. Treasury yields, as investors continue to leave the crowded U.S. Treasury market. Currently, the benchmark 10-yr note yield is up six basis points to 1.68%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows Facebook (FB 186.85, -1.91, -1.0%) leading the group lower. Apple (AAPL 213.84, -0.34, -0.2%), Amazon (AMZN 1821.60, -9.75, -0.5%), Netflix (NFLX 293.22, -0.80, -0.3%) hold modest losses, while Alphabet (GOOG 1205.88, +0.14, +0.1%) is up 0.1%.11:55 ETDow +6.78 at 26842.27, Nasdaq -34.79 at 8052.68, S&P -9.79 at 2968.64[BRIEFING.COM] The market has seen a recent uptick on news that China is expected to agree to purchase more agriculture products at the October trade meeting. The S&P 500 is down 0.3%, while the Dow is up 0.1%.The news was reported by the South China Morning Post, whose sources also said China, in exchange, would ask the U.S. to delay tariffs increases and ease a supply ban against Huawei. The report has likely triggered the algorithms, as it's unclear if the U.S. will agree to the deal.Overseas, the major European indices closed on a higher note. Germany's DAX increased 0.3%, UK's FTSE increased 0.4%, and France's CAC increased 0.1%. The Europe Stoxx 600 increased 0.1%.11:25 ETDow -84.51 at 26750.98, Nasdaq -68.45 at 8019.02, S&P -19.88 at 2958.55[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to waver in negative territory. The S&P 500 is down 0.6%, the Dow is down 0.3%, and the Nasdaq is down 0.7%.Semiconductor stocks are struggling today, evidenced by the losses seen in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-0.7%). Applied Materials (AMAT 49.82, -0.84, -1.7%) has shown relative weakness. On the other hand, the Dow Jones Transportation Average (+0.9%) is seeing continued strength from yesterday.Separately, HD Supply Holdings (HDS 37.44, -3.38, -8.3%) has dropped 8% after the company issued downside guidance for the third quarter and lowered its FY20 guidance. HD Supply is an industrial distributor in North America.11:00 ETDow -116.25 at 26719.24, Nasdaq -62.38 at 8025.09, S&P -18.92 at 2959.51[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is currently down near session lows with a loss of 0.7%. Yesterday's "value" trade has weakened a bit with the S&P 500 financials sector (-0.5%) sliding into the red.The energy sector, which is up 1.7%, continues to uphold its end of the value bargain. Another gain in the price of oil ($58.63/bbl, +0.80, +1.4%) has been a nice support for the group.Separately, shares of Boeing (BA 363.00, +4.35) are up 1.2%, giving the price-weighed Dow (-0.4%) some support.10:25 ETDow -65.90 at 26769.59, Nasdaq -49.23 at 8038.24, S&P -15.08 at 2963.35[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades down 0.5% as the retreat in technology shares continues.The broader information technology sector is down 1.3%, and the consumer discretionary sector is down 1.2%. The underpeformance in Microsoft (MSFT 135.22, -2.26, -1.6%) and Amazon (AMZN 1814.95, -16.40, -0.9%) today has reflected broader efforts to take profits from cyclical stocks that have outperformed.Other notable laggards include Ford Motor (F 9.13, -0.42, -4.4%) and Wendy's (WEN 19.67, -2.28, -10.5%). Moody's downgraded Ford's senior unsecured rating to "junk status," citing a weak financial outlook. Wendy's is down after it lowered its earnings guidance to reflect its efforts to launch a breakfast menu nationwide.10:00 ETDow -68.99 at 26766.5, Nasdaq -76.19 at 8011.28, S&P -18.86 at 2959.57[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.6%, and the Russell 2000 trades lower by 0.4%.Just in, the July Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey showed that job openings declined to 7.217 million from a revised 7.248 million in June (from 7.348 million).09:40 ETDow -66.98 at 26768.51, Nasdaq -61.64 at 8025.83, S&P -15.02 at 2963.41[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages begin the day on a lower note. The S&P 500 is down 0.4%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.7%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows the information technology (-1.2%) and health care (-1.0%) sectors leading today's decline. The energy (+1.1%) and financials (+0.3%) sectors are the lone sectors up today amid higher oil prices ($58.08, +0.23, +0.4%) and higher U.S. Treasury yields. The groups might also be benefiting from a value-oriented trade.The 2-yr yield is up three basis points to 1.60%, and the 10-yr yield is up three basis points to 1.65%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.1% to 98.36.09:15 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -7.10. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -33.80.The stock market is on pace to open slightly lower with the S&P 500 futures trading seven points, or 0.2%, below fair value following a dull pre-market session.Apple's (AAPL 213.76, -0.41, -0.2%) annual product event at 1:00 p.m. ET today is an obligatory news headline, although expectations aren't too high this year.Elsewhere, some eyebrows have been raised after Wendy's (WEN 20.51, -1.44, -6.6%) announced plans to launch a breakfast menu next year, Moody's downgraded Ford Motor's (F 9.15, -0.39, -4.1%) senior unsecured rating to "junk status," and HD Supply Holdings (HDS 39.00, -1.82, -4.5%) lowered its FY20 guidance.Other than that, there isn't a lot of "new" macro news today. Investors might look to see if yesterday's "value" trade plays out again, where recent underperforming stocks outperform.08:50 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -6.90. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -30.00.The S&P 500 futures trade seven points, or 0.2%, below fair value.Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region ended Tuesday on a mixed note. China reported hotter than expected inflation figures for August due to an ongoing pork shortage. Jilin Transportation Investment Group elected to not exercise a call option on a perpetual note and will instead pay a higher coupon, which is likely to invite concerns about the group's cash position. Bloomberg noted that this was the first time that a Chinese local government financing vehicle did not exercise a call option on its debt. North Korea fired two projectiles into the East Sea, shortly after a DPRK official indicated that North Korea is ready for another round of talks with U.S. officials.In economic data: China's August CPI +0.7% m/m (expected 0.5%; last 0.4%); +2.8% yr/yr (expected 2.6%; last 2.8%).

Some consolidation appears to be taking shape after a recent stretch of gains, while the market awaits some key events later this week.For the moment, the narrative in the market's mind is that U.S. consumer spending could continue to support growth and that trade tensions with China may not escalate before their trade talks in October. China's Premier Li Kegiang reportedly repeated Beijing's willingness to make trade progress.At the same time, the market is holding steady in front of an ECB policy decision on Thursday and the Retail Sales Report for August on Friday, which could alter the market's assumptions about growth. Today, though, many investors will tune in to Apple's (AAPL 213.73, -0.44, -0.2%) annual product event at 1:00 p.m. ET, where it will likely unveil its latest iPhone.In economic data, investors will receive the JOLTS - Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey for July at 10:00 a.m. ET.

The S&P 500 (-0.01%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.2%), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%) finished near their flat lines.The small-cap Russell 2000 (+1.3%), which is home to many energy and financial stocks, outperformed the broader market.The market entered today on the heels of a two-week rally, with some investors beginning to feel less concerned about growth prospects and trade relations with China. For instance, data has shown the U.S. consumer to be resilient in the face of trade tensions, which could see a reprieve with trade talks coming up next month.This positive sentiment was manifested in the higher oil prices ($57.87/bbl, +$1.42, +2.5%) and the selling in the Treasury market on Monday. In turn, the S&P 500 financials (+1.5%) and energy (+1.9%) sectors were today's leaders, which were further boosted by their perceived value-oriented nature, as opposed to the crowded positioning in the information technology sector (-0.7%).The 2-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.62%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 98.32.The Dow Jones Transportation Average (+2.0%), which is a trade-sensitive group and is often viewed as a proxy for economic growth, also outperformed. The defensive-oriented real estate (-0.9%), health care (-0.9%), and utilities (-0.6%) sectors joined the tech sector as today's laggards.Separately, Saudi Arabia replaced its oil minister with a member of the royal family, which traders believed could portend favorable policy for oil prices. A less appreciated factor contributing to the outperformance in the energy sector was the relatively higher dividend yields that many energy companies provide yield-hunting investors.In corporate news, activist shareholder Elliot Management disclosed a $3.2 billion stake in AT&T (T 336.79, +0.54, +1.5%), sharing a plan with the company it thinks could boost the stock to $60 by the end of 2021. Much of the initial enthusiasm waned throughout the session, leaving shares of AT&T near their session lows.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit Report for July:Consumer credit increased by $23.3 bln in July (Briefing.com consensus $18.2 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $13.8 bln (from $14.6 bln) in June. That is the largest expansion since July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is the recognition that revolving credit expanded at its fastest pace since November 2017. That could mean one of two things: (1) consumers are using revolving credit more because they lack the cash to cover spending on basic needs or (2) consumers are using revolving credit more because they feel confident about repayment capabilities due to feelings of job security. Only future economic data will tell the real tale, but in the context of a U.S. growth outlook, the expansion in consumer credit in July is apt to be taken at face value as an an encouraging sign.Looking ahead, investors will receive the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +21.9% YTDS&P 500 +18.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.0% YTDRussell 2000 +13.0% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1771/1084. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1875/1201.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: September 10, 2019End of Document

On a related note, Uber and Lyft (LYFT 45.18, +0.80, +1.8%) are close to losing a battle in California, where they will have to classify drivers as employees.WTI crude futures settled down $0.50 (-0.9%) to $57.37/bbl, giving up its intraday gains. Today's decline snaps a recent winning streak for oil that came amid an improved growth sentiment.14:55 ETDow -44.66 at 26790.83, Nasdaq -46.95 at 8040.52, S&P -13.89 at 2964.54[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.5%, while the Russell 2000 trades higher by 0.9%.Shares of Netflix (NFLX 283.60, -10.66, -3.6%) have dropped in the wake of Apple's announcement of its TV service pricing. The streaming service will launch on Nov.1 and will be billed at $4.99 per month, which was below expectations.Looking ahead, RH (RH 156.39, +2.88, +1.8%) and Dave & Busters (PLAY 44.00, +1.50, +3.5%) will report earnings after today's close.14:30 ETDow -37.34 at 26798.15, Nasdaq -42.46 at 8045.01, S&P -12.12 at 2966.31[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have slipped a little in the last half hour, though still stand firmly within their daily ranges. The S&P 500 is still in second place, down 0.41%.The worst performers in the S&P 500 include Marketaxess (MKTX 339.11, -30.58, -8.27%), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG 787.48, -52.17, -6.21%), and Ball Corp (BLL 71.64, -3.43, -4.57%). CMG is near a one-month low after news that New York City is suing the company for alleged labor law violations.Conversely, biotechnology company Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR 19.88, +2.02, +11.31%) sits atop the index, extending opening gains which stemmed from last night's insider purchase disclosure by Chief Scientific Officer Stephen Doberstein.At the Apple (AAPL 214.42, +0.25, +0.12%) iPhone event, CEO Tim Cook unveiled a "Pro" iPhone 11 model and the new A13 Bionic chipset.14:00 ETDow -5.96 at 26829.53, Nasdaq -24.27 at 8063.2, S&P -7.06 at 2971.37[BRIEFING.COM] The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite remains at the bottom of the sector standings, though comfortably off session lows.Gold futures settled $11.90 lower (-0.8%) to $1,499.20/oz, below the $1,500 level for the first time in five weeks.The U.S. Dollar Index sits less than 0.1% higher to 98.35.Apple's (AAPL 213.82, -0.35, -0.16%) iPhone event remains ongoing and the company announced the latest iteration of its iPhone line in the last 30 minutes -- the iPhone 11. Also announced in the last half hour were Apple Health partnerships and a new Apple Watch.13:30 ETDow -18.80 at 26816.69, Nasdaq -29.38 at 8058.09, S&P -8.98 at 2969.45[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages haven't shifted much in the last half hour; the Nasdaq Composite sits 0.36% lower, the S&P 500 sheds 0.30%, and the DJIA loses 0.07%.Top decliners in the Dow Jones Industrial Average include Visa (V 175.06, -6.49, -3.57%), McDonald's (MCD 209.92, -7.34, -3.38%), and American Express (AXP 116.94, -2.98, -2.48%).Conversely, chemical giant Dow (DOW 45.68, +1.23, +2.77%) sits atop the index.Also, Apple's (AAPL 215.71, +1.54, +0.72%) iPhone event started after the bottom of the hour; the company thus far has discussed its Arcade service (available Sept. 19 at $4.99 per month) and the AppleTV+ service which will be available on Nov. 1 starting at $4.99 per month and offer one year of free AppleTV+ with a new device purchase. Also announced new 10.2" iPad.The DJIA's modest move lower leaves the index 0.18% lower since the start of August.Elsewhere, at the top of the hour, the Treasury's $38 bln 3-year note auction drew a high yield of 1.573% on a bid-to-cover of 2.42.12:55 ETDow +14.61 at 26850.1, Nasdaq -12.71 at 8074.76, S&P -4.11 at 2974.32[BRIEFING.COM] The stock market trades mixed, as investors shift away from crowded areas of the market and into more value-oriented sectors like energy and retail. The S&P 500 is down 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%. The Russell 2000 (+1.2%) outperforms for the second straight day.Today's action has reflected much of yesterday's value trade that benefits underperforming areas of the stock market, most notably the S&P 500 energy sector (+1.8%) and SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.36, +0.93, +2.2%). An upturn in Boeing (BA 366.34, +7.56, +2.1%) and many of the transportation stocks has had a similar effect on the industrials sector (+0.5%).The gains in these areas, however, are coming at the expense of crowded groups like the S&P 500 information technology sector (-0.9%), which is the S&P 500's most heavily-weighted sector. The real estate sector (-1.7%), which investors had piled into for its higher dividend yields and low-beta disposition, is today's worst performer.Allowing today's value trade to play out are the improved views on trade and growth, which have helped some money flow out of the Treasury market and drive yields higher. The 2-yr yield is up seven basis points to 1.64%, and the 10-yr yield is up seven basis points to 1.69%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 98.35.Separately, the market saw a sharp uptick on a report from the South China Morning Post indicating that China is ready to purchase more agricultural products from the U.S. The caveat, though, is that China would want the U.S. to agree to delay tariffs and ease its supply ban on Huawei. Nothing material has transpired, but the report likely triggered some algorithms.Some story stocks today include Wendy's (WEN 19.45, -2.50, -11.4%) and Ford Motor (F 9.28, -0.26, -2.9%). Wendy's is down big after the company lowered its earnings guidance to reflect costs needed to expand its breakfast menu nationwide. Ford Motor is down after its senior unsecured debt was downgraded to "junk status" at Moody's.Reviewing today's economic data, which included the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July.The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August declined to 103.1 from 104.7 in July. The August reading was its lowest in five months, but the index remains running at elevated levels.The July Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey showed that job openings declined to 7.217 million from a revised 7.248 million in June (from 7.348 million).As a reminder, Apple's (AAPL 214.13, -0.10, -0.1%) annual product event is expected to start within the next few minutes.12:25 ETDow +2.20 at 26837.69, Nasdaq -19.78 at 8067.69, S&P -6.80 at 2971.63[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 has come well off its lows (-0.7%) and now trades near its highs with a loss of 0.2%.The recent move in the market has come amid a further increase in U.S. Treasury yields, as investors continue to leave the crowded U.S. Treasury market. Currently, the benchmark 10-yr note yield is up six basis points to 1.68%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows Facebook (FB 186.85, -1.91, -1.0%) leading the group lower. Apple (AAPL 213.84, -0.34, -0.2%), Amazon (AMZN 1821.60, -9.75, -0.5%), Netflix (NFLX 293.22, -0.80, -0.3%) hold modest losses, while Alphabet (GOOG 1205.88, +0.14, +0.1%) is up 0.1%.11:55 ETDow +6.78 at 26842.27, Nasdaq -34.79 at 8052.68, S&P -9.79 at 2968.64[BRIEFING.COM] The market has seen a recent uptick on news that China is expected to agree to purchase more agriculture products at the October trade meeting. The S&P 500 is down 0.3%, while the Dow is up 0.1%.The news was reported by the South China Morning Post, whose sources also said China, in exchange, would ask the U.S. to delay tariffs increases and ease a supply ban against Huawei. The report has likely triggered the algorithms, as it's unclear if the U.S. will agree to the deal.Overseas, the major European indices closed on a higher note. Germany's DAX increased 0.3%, UK's FTSE increased 0.4%, and France's CAC increased 0.1%. The Europe Stoxx 600 increased 0.1%.11:25 ETDow -84.51 at 26750.98, Nasdaq -68.45 at 8019.02, S&P -19.88 at 2958.55[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to waver in negative territory. The S&P 500 is down 0.6%, the Dow is down 0.3%, and the Nasdaq is down 0.7%.Semiconductor stocks are struggling today, evidenced by the losses seen in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-0.7%). Applied Materials (AMAT 49.82, -0.84, -1.7%) has shown relative weakness. On the other hand, the Dow Jones Transportation Average (+0.9%) is seeing continued strength from yesterday.Separately, HD Supply Holdings (HDS 37.44, -3.38, -8.3%) has dropped 8% after the company issued downside guidance for the third quarter and lowered its FY20 guidance. HD Supply is an industrial distributor in North America.11:00 ETDow -116.25 at 26719.24, Nasdaq -62.38 at 8025.09, S&P -18.92 at 2959.51[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is currently down near session lows with a loss of 0.7%. Yesterday's "value" trade has weakened a bit with the S&P 500 financials sector (-0.5%) sliding into the red.The energy sector, which is up 1.7%, continues to uphold its end of the value bargain. Another gain in the price of oil ($58.63/bbl, +0.80, +1.4%) has been a nice support for the group.Separately, shares of Boeing (BA 363.00, +4.35) are up 1.2%, giving the price-weighed Dow (-0.4%) some support.10:25 ETDow -65.90 at 26769.59, Nasdaq -49.23 at 8038.24, S&P -15.08 at 2963.35[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades down 0.5% as the retreat in technology shares continues.The broader information technology sector is down 1.3%, and the consumer discretionary sector is down 1.2%. The underpeformance in Microsoft (MSFT 135.22, -2.26, -1.6%) and Amazon (AMZN 1814.95, -16.40, -0.9%) today has reflected broader efforts to take profits from cyclical stocks that have outperformed.Other notable laggards include Ford Motor (F 9.13, -0.42, -4.4%) and Wendy's (WEN 19.67, -2.28, -10.5%). Moody's downgraded Ford's senior unsecured rating to "junk status," citing a weak financial outlook. Wendy's is down after it lowered its earnings guidance to reflect its efforts to launch a breakfast menu nationwide.10:00 ETDow -68.99 at 26766.5, Nasdaq -76.19 at 8011.28, S&P -18.86 at 2959.57[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.6%, and the Russell 2000 trades lower by 0.4%.Just in, the July Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey showed that job openings declined to 7.217 million from a revised 7.248 million in June (from 7.348 million).09:40 ETDow -66.98 at 26768.51, Nasdaq -61.64 at 8025.83, S&P -15.02 at 2963.41[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages begin the day on a lower note. The S&P 500 is down 0.4%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.7%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows the information technology (-1.2%) and health care (-1.0%) sectors leading today's decline. The energy (+1.1%) and financials (+0.3%) sectors are the lone sectors up today amid higher oil prices ($58.08, +0.23, +0.4%) and higher U.S. Treasury yields. The groups might also be benefiting from a value-oriented trade.The 2-yr yield is up three basis points to 1.60%, and the 10-yr yield is up three basis points to 1.65%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.1% to 98.36.09:15 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -7.10. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -33.80.The stock market is on pace to open slightly lower with the S&P 500 futures trading seven points, or 0.2%, below fair value following a dull pre-market session.Apple's (AAPL 213.76, -0.41, -0.2%) annual product event at 1:00 p.m. ET today is an obligatory news headline, although expectations aren't too high this year.Elsewhere, some eyebrows have been raised after Wendy's (WEN 20.51, -1.44, -6.6%) announced plans to launch a breakfast menu next year, Moody's downgraded Ford Motor's (F 9.15, -0.39, -4.1%) senior unsecured rating to "junk status," and HD Supply Holdings (HDS 39.00, -1.82, -4.5%) lowered its FY20 guidance.Other than that, there isn't a lot of "new" macro news today. Investors might look to see if yesterday's "value" trade plays out again, where recent underperforming stocks outperform.08:50 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -6.90.

China reported hotter than expected inflation figures for August due to an ongoing pork shortage. Jilin Transportation Investment Group elected to not exercise a call option on a perpetual note and will instead pay a higher coupon, which is likely to invite concerns about the group's cash position.

Some consolidation appears to be taking shape after a recent stretch of gains, while the market awaits some key events later this week.For the moment, the narrative in the market's mind is that U.S. consumer spending could continue to support growth and that trade tensions with China may not escalate before their trade talks in October. China's Premier Li Kegiang reportedly repeated Beijing's willingness to make trade progress.At the same time, the market is holding steady in front of an ECB policy decision on Thursday and the Retail Sales Report for August on Friday, which could alter the market's assumptions about growth.

The S&P 500 (-0.01%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.2%), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%) finished near their flat lines.The small-cap Russell 2000 (+1.3%), which is home to many energy and financial stocks, outperformed the broader market.The market entered today on the heels of a two-week rally, with some investors beginning to feel less concerned about growth prospects and trade relations with China. For instance, data has shown the U.S. consumer to be resilient in the face of trade tensions, which could see a reprieve with trade talks coming up next month.This positive sentiment was manifested in the higher oil prices ($57.87/bbl, +$1.42, +2.5%) and the selling in the Treasury market on Monday. In turn, the S&P 500 financials (+1.5%) and energy (+1.9%) sectors were today's leaders, which were further boosted by their perceived value-oriented nature, as opposed to the crowded positioning in the information technology sector (-0.7%).The 2-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.62%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 98.32.The Dow Jones Transportation Average (+2.0%), which is a trade-sensitive group and is often viewed as a proxy for economic growth, also outperformed.

The Factory Automation and Industrial Control Systems market is expected to register a CAGR of over 8.4% during the forecast period 2019; 2024. The evolution of technological advancements and innovations across various manufacturing units have encouraged the adoption of automation technologies. Digitization and Industry 4. 0 revolution have significantly stimulated the growth of automation among industries, by necessitating the use of smarter and automated solutions, such as robotics and control systems, to improve production processes.GlobeNewswireOctober 23, 2019 Wednesday 3:56 AM PTCopyright 2019 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: COMPANY ANNOUNCEMENTLength: 1387 wordsBodyNew York, Oct.  23, 2019  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Reportlinker.com announces the release of the report "Factory Automation & Industrial Controls Market - Growth, Trends, and Forecast (2019 - 2024)" - https://www.reportlinker.com/p05797259/?utm_source=GNW Automation has drastically changed the way of production in the industrial sector, by reducing the manufacturing time and production costs. The production lines in several factories were manual, for a considerable time. Even if there have been improvements in assembly technologies, such as faster pick-and-place machines and smarter reflow ovens, the back-end operations have remained non-automated.Hence, there has been an exponential rise in labor costs. In addition, the quality requirements are also getting more stringent. Against this backdrop, factory automation can cause a reduction in production, operation, and labor costs.Various advancements have been made in the automation of the various activities that were formerly carried out manually, particularly in the labor-intensive manufacturing industry, with most of these being almost fully automated, using the latest technologies. This has led to improved efficiency, high-quality products, and attendant savings in labor and costs.The high costs of automated systems are associated with effective and robust hardware and efficient software. Automation equipment requires higher capital expenditure, to invest in automation technologies (an automated system can cost millions of dollars to design, fabricate, and install). They also require a higher level of maintenance, than a manually operated machine, and a generally lower degree of flexibility in terms of the possible products, as compared to a manual system (even flexible automation is less flexible than humans, the most versatile machines of all).The sluggish adoption of Industrial IoT technologies can be linked to the higher costs for maintaining their connections, considering that M2M connections were charged heavy taxation, similar to mobile device subscriptions. The acquisition and installation cost of a control system for industrial automation represents half of the total cost, during its lifetime. Additionally, the frequent changes in technology and networking result in significant cost, which is more than that of the initial investment, further slowing down the adoption.In addition, significantly low adoption in SMEs, in developing countries like Brazil, which cannot bear the product costs, is restraining the market's growth.Scope of the ReportThe Industrial control and Factory automation is a rising trend in the manufacturing industry which provides smart manufacturing infrastructure. The industrial control and factory automation facilitate cost efficiency, quality of production; standardize manufacturing, reliability, and flexibility in the process of manufacturing. Industrial control and factory automation offers a perfect mix of mechanical components and devices and Information Technology MarketKey Market TrendsUtilities Sector Expected to Register a Significant GrowthProcess automation paves the path for digital data and analytics that can reduce power system costs by following meansBy reducing operations and maintenance costsBy improving power plant and network efficiencyBy reducing unplanned outages and downtime andBy extending the operational lifetime of assets.The overall savings from these digitally-enabled measures are estimated to be in the order of USD 80 billion per year over 2016-40, or about 5% of total annual power generation costs based on the enhanced global deployment of available digital technologies to all power plants and network infrastructure.Data centers worldwide consumed around 194 TWh of electricity in 2014, or about 1% of total demand. Although data center workload is estimated to triple by 2020, related energy demand is expected to grow by only 3%, due to continued efficiency gains. This is expected to drive the growth in power generation for meeting the demand from ICT sector.The evolution of smart grid and a synchronization to match the variable demand for the electricity, between the peak demand period to rest of the period demand, is expected to further create high demand from the energy and utilities sector. Due to the automation of processes and a networked system communication, digitalization can help integrate the renewable energy by enabling grids to match energy demand to times when the wind is blowing and the sun is shining.In the European Union alone, increased storage and digitally-enabled demand response is estimated to reduce curtailment of solar PVs and wind power from 7% in 2017 to 1.6% in 2040, avoiding 30 million tons of CO2 emissions in 2040.China Expected to Hold a Major Share in Asia Pacific regionDespite China accounting for 25% of the world's manufacturing activities, its manufacturing productivity is a mere one-fifth of that of developed economies. Companies in the country are, thus, embracing Industry 4.0 to improve productivity. A strong indicator of automation uptake in the country is the 58% increase in robot density in 2017 as compared to 2015. Further, the Chinese government's programs, such as the Made in China 2025 plan, are promoting the use of R&D in factory automation and technologies and its investments. Also, as most of the automation equipment is imported from Germany and Japan, the -Made in China' initiative aims to expand the country's domestic production of automation hardware and equipment.China is the 28th fastest in the world, and has a very high industrial production rate. These factors act as drivers for the automation market in the country. Investments are being planned for aiding the quality of growth, addressing environmental concerns, and reducing overcapacity, for the same. The number of companies deploying factory and process automation technologies and robotics in the country is less when compared to the enormous size of China's manufacturing base and the number of workers it employs. This trend presents a great opportunity for companies in the industrial automation sector in China.Automation in the country is also expected to be augmented by the uptake of smart manufacturing. As per the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, China is anticipated to initiate 100 smart manufacturing pilot projects in 2018. According to the 13th Five-Year Plan of Smart Manufacturing, China aims to establish its intelligent manufacturing system and complete the key industries' transformation by 2025.Competitive LandscapeThe Factory Automation and Industrial Control Systems market is highly competitive and consists of several major players. In terms of market share, few of the major players currently dominate the market. These major players with prominent share in the market are focusing on expanding their customer base across foreign countries. These companies are leveraging on strategic collaborative initiatives to increase their market share and increase their profitability. The companies operating in the market are also acquiring start-ups working on Factory Automation and Industrial Control Systems to strengthen their product capabilities. In May 2018, Texas Instruments announced the mass production of its highly integrated, ultra-wideband AWR1642 and IWR1642 mmWave sensors. These sensors support frequencies from 76 to 81 GHz and deliver three times more accurate sensing and the smallest footprint at a fraction of the power of competing for sensor technologies. Thousands of customers are developing with the company's mmWave sensors to enable innovation in automotive and industrial applications, including vehicle occupancy detection, people counting in buildings, machine, and human interaction, and more.Reasons to Purchase this report:- The market estimate (ME) sheet in Excel format- Report customization as per the client's requirements- 3 months of analyst supportRead the full report: https://www.reportlinker.com/p05797259/?utm_source=GNWAbout ReportlinkerReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution.

The S&P 500 is down 0.3%, while the Dow is up 0.1%.The news was reported by the South China Morning Post, whose sources also said China, in exchange, would ask the U.S. to delay tariffs increases and ease a supply ban against Huawei. The report has likely triggered the algorithms, as it's unclear if the U.S. will agree to the deal.Overseas, the major European indices closed on a higher note. Germany's DAX increased 0.3%, UK's FTSE increased 0.4%, and France's CAC increased 0.1%. The Europe Stoxx 600 increased 0.1%.11:25 ETDow -84.51 at 26750.98, Nasdaq -68.45 at 8019.02, S&P -19.88 at 2958.55[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to waver in negative territory. The S&P 500 is down 0.6%, the Dow is down 0.3%, and the Nasdaq is down 0.7%.Semiconductor stocks are struggling today, evidenced by the losses seen in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-0.7%). Applied Materials (AMAT 49.82, -0.84, -1.7%) has shown relative weakness. On the other hand, the Dow Jones Transportation Average (+0.9%) is seeing continued strength from yesterday.Separately, HD Supply Holdings (HDS 37.44, -3.38, -8.3%) has dropped 8% after the company issued downside guidance for the third quarter and lowered its FY20 guidance. HD Supply is an industrial distributor in North America.11:00 ETDow -116.25 at 26719.24, Nasdaq -62.38 at 8025.09, S&P -18.92 at 2959.51[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is currently down near session lows with a loss of 0.7%.

Another gain in the price of oil ($58.63/bbl, +0.80, +1.4%) has been a nice support for the group.Separately, shares of Boeing (BA 363.00, +4.35) are up 1.2%, giving the price-weighed Dow (-0.4%) some support.10:25 ETDow -65.90 at 26769.59, Nasdaq -49.23 at 8038.24, S&P -15.08 at 2963.35[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades down 0.5% as the retreat in technology shares continues.The broader information technology sector is down 1.3%, and the consumer discretionary sector is down 1.2%. The underpeformance in Microsoft (MSFT 135.22, -2.26, -1.6%) and Amazon (AMZN 1814.95, -16.40, -0.9%) today has reflected broader efforts to take profits from cyclical stocks that have outperformed.Other notable laggards include Ford Motor (F 9.13, -0.42, -4.4%) and Wendy's (WEN 19.67, -2.28, -10.5%). Moody's downgraded Ford's senior unsecured rating to "junk status," citing a weak financial outlook.

The energy (+1.1%) and financials (+0.3%) sectors are the lone sectors up today amid higher oil prices ($58.08, +0.23, +0.4%) and higher U.S. Treasury yields. The groups might also be benefiting from a value-oriented trade.The 2-yr yield is up three basis points to 1.60%, and the 10-yr yield is up three basis points to 1.65%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.1% to 98.36.09:15 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -7.10. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -33.80.The stock market is on pace to open slightly lower with the S&P 500 futures trading seven points, or 0.2%, below fair value following a dull pre-market session.Apple's (AAPL 213.76, -0.41, -0.2%) annual product event at 1:00 p.m. ET today is an obligatory news headline, although expectations aren't too high this year.Elsewhere, some eyebrows have been raised after Wendy's (WEN 20.51, -1.44, -6.6%) announced plans to launch a breakfast menu next year, Moody's downgraded Ford Motor's (F 9.15, -0.39, -4.1%) senior unsecured rating to "junk status," and HD Supply Holdings (HDS 39.00, -1.82, -4.5%) lowered its FY20 guidance.Other than that, there isn't a lot of "new" macro news today.

China reported hotter than expected inflation figures for August due to an ongoing pork shortage. Jilin Transportation Investment Group elected to not exercise a call option on a perpetual note and will instead pay a higher coupon, which is likely to invite concerns about the group's cash position. Bloomberg noted that this was the first time that a Chinese local government financing vehicle did not exercise a call option on its debt. North Korea fired two projectiles into the East Sea, shortly after a DPRK official indicated that North Korea is ready for another round of talks with U.S. officials.In economic data: China's August CPI +0.7% m/m (expected 0.5%; last 0.4%); +2.8% yr/yr (expected 2.6%; last 2.8%).

Some consolidation appears to be taking shape after a recent stretch of gains, while the market awaits some key events later this week.For the moment, the narrative in the market's mind is that U.S. consumer spending could continue to support growth and that trade tensions with China may not escalate before their trade talks in October. China's Premier Li Kegiang reportedly repeated Beijing's willingness to make trade progress.At the same time, the market is holding steady in front of an ECB policy decision on Thursday and the Retail Sales Report for August on Friday, which could alter the market's assumptions about growth. Today, though, many investors will tune in to Apple's (AAPL 213.73, -0.44, -0.2%) annual product event at 1:00 p.m. ET, where it will likely unveil its latest iPhone.In economic data, investors will receive the JOLTS - Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey for July at 10:00 a.m. ET.

The S&P 500 (-0.01%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.2%), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%) finished near their flat lines.The small-cap Russell 2000 (+1.3%), which is home to many energy and financial stocks, outperformed the broader market.The market entered today on the heels of a two-week rally, with some investors beginning to feel less concerned about growth prospects and trade relations with China. For instance, data has shown the U.S. consumer to be resilient in the face of trade tensions, which could see a reprieve with trade talks coming up next month.This positive sentiment was manifested in the higher oil prices ($57.87/bbl, +$1.42, +2.5%) and the selling in the Treasury market on Monday. In turn, the S&P 500 financials (+1.5%) and energy (+1.9%) sectors were today's leaders, which were further boosted by their perceived value-oriented nature, as opposed to the crowded positioning in the information technology sector (-0.7%).The 2-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.62%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 98.32.The Dow Jones Transportation Average (+2.0%), which is a trade-sensitive group and is often viewed as a proxy for economic growth, also outperformed. The defensive-oriented real estate (-0.9%), health care (-0.9%), and utilities (-0.6%) sectors joined the tech sector as today's laggards.Separately, Saudi Arabia replaced its oil minister with a member of the royal family, which traders believed could portend favorable policy for oil prices. A less appreciated factor contributing to the outperformance in the energy sector was the relatively higher dividend yields that many energy companies provide yield-hunting investors.In corporate news, activist shareholder Elliot Management disclosed a $3.2 billion stake in AT&T (T 336.79, +0.54, +1.5%), sharing a plan with the company it thinks could boost the stock to $60 by the end of 2021. Much of the initial enthusiasm waned throughout the session, leaving shares of AT&T near their session lows.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit Report for July:Consumer credit increased by $23.3 bln in July (Briefing.com consensus $18.2 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $13.8 bln (from $14.6 bln) in June. That is the largest expansion since July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is the recognition that revolving credit expanded at its fastest pace since November 2017. That could mean one of two things: (1) consumers are using revolving credit more because they lack the cash to cover spending on basic needs or (2) consumers are using revolving credit more because they feel confident about repayment capabilities due to feelings of job security.

Some consolidation appears to be taking shape after a recent stretch of gains, while the market awaits some key events later this week.For the moment, the narrative in the market's mind is that U.S. consumer spending could continue to support growth and that trade tensions with China may not escalate before their trade talks in October. China's Premier Li Kegiang reportedly repeated Beijing's willingness to make trade progress.At the same time, the market is holding steady in front of an ECB policy decision on Thursday and the Retail Sales Report for August on Friday, which could alter the market's assumptions about growth. Today, though, many investors will tune in to Apple's (AAPL 213.73, -0.44, -0.2%) annual product event at 1:00 p.m. ET, where it will likely unveil its latest iPhone.In economic data, investors will receive the JOLTS - Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey for July at 10:00 a.m. ET.

The S&P 500 (-0.01%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.2%), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%) finished near their flat lines.The small-cap Russell 2000 (+1.3%), which is home to many energy and financial stocks, outperformed the broader market.The market entered today on the heels of a two-week rally, with some investors beginning to feel less concerned about growth prospects and trade relations with China. For instance, data has shown the U.S. consumer to be resilient in the face of trade tensions, which could see a reprieve with trade talks coming up next month.This positive sentiment was manifested in the higher oil prices ($57.87/bbl, +$1.42, +2.5%) and the selling in the Treasury market on Monday. In turn, the S&P 500 financials (+1.5%) and energy (+1.9%) sectors were today's leaders, which were further boosted by their perceived value-oriented nature, as opposed to the crowded positioning in the information technology sector (-0.7%).The 2-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.62%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 98.32.The Dow Jones Transportation Average (+2.0%), which is a trade-sensitive group and is often viewed as a proxy for economic growth, also outperformed. The defensive-oriented real estate (-0.9%), health care (-0.9%), and utilities (-0.6%) sectors joined the tech sector as today's laggards.Separately, Saudi Arabia replaced its oil minister with a member of the royal family, which traders believed could portend favorable policy for oil prices. A less appreciated factor contributing to the outperformance in the energy sector was the relatively higher dividend yields that many energy companies provide yield-hunting investors.In corporate news, activist shareholder Elliot Management disclosed a $3.2 billion stake in AT&T (T 336.79, +0.54, +1.5%), sharing a plan with the company it thinks could boost the stock to $60 by the end of 2021. Much of the initial enthusiasm waned throughout the session, leaving shares of AT&T near their session lows.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit Report for July:Consumer credit increased by $23.3 bln in July (Briefing.com consensus $18.2 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $13.8 bln (from $14.6 bln) in June. That is the largest expansion since July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is the recognition that revolving credit expanded at its fastest pace since November 2017. That could mean one of two things: (1) consumers are using revolving credit more because they lack the cash to cover spending on basic needs or (2) consumers are using revolving credit more because they feel confident about repayment capabilities due to feelings of job security. Only future economic data will tell the real tale, but in the context of a U.S. growth outlook, the expansion in consumer credit in July is apt to be taken at face value as an an encouraging sign.Looking ahead, investors will receive the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +21.9% YTDS&P 500 +18.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.0% YTDRussell 2000 +13.0% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1771/1084. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1875/1201.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: September 10, 2019End of Document

The S&P 500 (-0.01%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.2%), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%) finished near their flat lines.The small-cap Russell 2000 (+1.3%), which is home to many energy and financial stocks, outperformed the broader market.The market entered today on the heels of a two-week rally, with some investors beginning to feel less concerned about growth prospects and trade relations with China. For instance, data has shown the U.S. consumer to be resilient in the face of trade tensions, which could see a reprieve with trade talks coming up next month.This positive sentiment was manifested in the higher oil prices ($57.87/bbl, +$1.42, +2.5%) and the selling in the Treasury market on Monday. In turn, the S&P 500 financials (+1.5%) and energy (+1.9%) sectors were today's leaders, which were further boosted by their perceived value-oriented nature, as opposed to the crowded positioning in the information technology sector (-0.7%).The 2-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.62%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 98.32.The Dow Jones Transportation Average (+2.0%), which is a trade-sensitive group and is often viewed as a proxy for economic growth, also outperformed. The defensive-oriented real estate (-0.9%), health care (-0.9%), and utilities (-0.6%) sectors joined the tech sector as today's laggards.Separately, Saudi Arabia replaced its oil minister with a member of the royal family, which traders believed could portend favorable policy for oil prices. A less appreciated factor contributing to the outperformance in the energy sector was the relatively higher dividend yields that many energy companies provide yield-hunting investors.In corporate news, activist shareholder Elliot Management disclosed a $3.2 billion stake in AT&T (T 336.79, +0.54, +1.5%), sharing a plan with the company it thinks could boost the stock to $60 by the end of 2021. Much of the initial enthusiasm waned throughout the session, leaving shares of AT&T near their session lows.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit Report for July:Consumer credit increased by $23.3 bln in July (Briefing.com consensus $18.2 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $13.8 bln (from $14.6 bln) in June. That is the largest expansion since July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is the recognition that revolving credit expanded at its fastest pace since November 2017. That could mean one of two things: (1) consumers are using revolving credit more because they lack the cash to cover spending on basic needs or (2) consumers are using revolving credit more because they feel confident about repayment capabilities due to feelings of job security. Only future economic data will tell the real tale, but in the context of a U.S. growth outlook, the expansion in consumer credit in July is apt to be taken at face value as an an encouraging sign.Looking ahead, investors will receive the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +21.9% YTDS&P 500 +18.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.0% YTDRussell 2000 +13.0% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1771/1084. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1875/1201.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: September 10, 2019End of Document

Thanks so much for joining us. Happy Wednesday.I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Wednesday, October 23rd.Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast.Earnings in focus driving markets this morning. The morning under pressure after missing (INAUDIBLE) and revenue estimates, also cutting its full year guidance. Stock down four and three-quarters percent.The Boeing 737 Max crisis and the company's bottom line coming up. The embattled aerospace giant Boeing reporting earnings in about 30 minutes. We will have those numbers and get you the full analysis as well.Mark Zuckerberg is on the hot seat this morning. The Facebook CEO to defend his proposed cryptocurrency, testifying on Capitol Hill later today, ready to admit the social giant has trust issues. We'll take a look at what to expect as Facebook shares are down a fraction this morning.Broader markets meanwhile look like this. Futures indicating a decline at the start of trading thanks to Caterpillar largely. Caterpillar will cut about 60 points off the Dow this morning. Yesterday's uncertainty and, of course, Brexit also an issue. But the Dow this morning down 89 points. The S&P was down 6 on top of yesterday's declines.S&P was down 10 points yesterday at the close. The Dow was down 39 points. And the Nasdaq lower by 58. By the way, the S&P is still about 1 percent away from an all-time high.Global markets this morning look like this. European indices are mixed. FT 100 is up 7 points as the Brexit drama continues. Parliament approving Prime Minister Boris Johnson's withdrawal agreement but not agreeing to his speedy timetable. Now it is up to the E.U. to allow an extension.CAC 40 in Paris is down 37. The DAX index in Germany down 7 points.There are growing concerns over Hong Kong putting pressure on markets in Asia overnight. Take a look. Nikkei in Japan able to finish with slight gains. But the others down as you see there. Hang Seng in Hong Kong down almost 1 percent.All those stories coming up this Wednesday morning. And joining me to break it all down: Fox Business' Dagen McDowell; National Securities Corporation chief market strategist Art Hogan; and Farvahar Partners founder and CEO Omeed Malik.Great to see everybody this morning.ART HOGAN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, NATIONAL SECURITIES CORPORATION: Good morning.BARTIROMO: We're waiting on a number of earnings which will likely impact markets but Caterpillar's the story of the day and so far stock is down on this earnings miss because I guess it is an indicator of the global economy.HOGAN: Sure, it's an indicator of a part of the global economy that we've known has been slow for a while. For manufacturing, when you talk about what's going on in the world, yes we know there's a slowdown. Where is it getting hurt the most and it's manufacturing.And whether we look at manufacturing because of Boeing not delivering the 737 Max or General Motors being in a 30-day strike or just the, you know, the slower activity that we're seeing in general.Also remember Caterpillar is affected by what's going on in minerals and mining. All the commodity production that's going on globally and we know that has slowed too. So Caterpillar's the tip of the sword for what we see as global economic slowdown.But to Dagen's point, a lot of this are priced in.BARTIROMO: Yes.HOGAN: I mean the S&P 500 is up about 20 percent, it's up 8 percent on year-to-date basis. So we're always -- I'm always surprised by how much we're surprised. But I'm also -- I'm still shocked that Cat didn't come out at some juncture and say hey listen, we've got to (INAUDIBLE) or at least take our guidance down so they wouldn't have this disappointment on earnings day.BARTIROMO: Yes. It's off of the lows. The Morgan Stanley analysts this morning telling clients there's a slight earnings recession going on at Caterpillar.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: No, the quote from the CEO was our volumes declined as dealers reduced their inventories, and end-user demand while positive was lower than our expectations.But overall, the earnings are way down from a year ago, down 13 and-a-half percent from a year ago. So not only is it a miss but it's a double-digit decline in earnings. And then also cutting its full year outlook and total sales and revenue off by 5.6 percent from a year ago. So it's red.HOGAN: Right.BARTIROMO: All right. We're watching that one.Meanwhile, our top story this hour is keeping big tech in check. Facebook's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, is going to be testifying on Capitol Hill later today in front of the House Financial Services Committee. He is expected to face questions on Facebook's cryptocurrency, Libra and whether the public can trust the embattled tech giant to handle users' finances.In his opening statement, Zuckerberg argues if American technology companies do not take the lead on digital currencies other countries will.Here's what he says. It reads in part -- this is the opening statement this morning -- "If healthy skepticism becomes all out hostility, we'll put a lot of progress at risk, not just in the world where American technology companies have an opportunity to champion American values. I think it would be bad for our country and the world if companies were discouraged from taking on challenges like these and settled for safer options that reinforce the status quo. That would harm our national reputation", he says, "for innovation, make our economy less competitive and end up concentrating more power in the hands of existing players rather than people."We're going to talk about that, get your reaction to that.HOGAN: Ok.BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is Texas Congressman, Financial Services Committee member Roger Williams. Congressman -- it's good to see you this morning.REP. ROGER WILLIAMS (R-TX): Good to see you.BARTIROMO: What's your reaction to the opening statement?WILLIAMS: Well, I'm anxious to hear what he has to say. You know, I mean I think America should lead the way in innovation and I'm all for that. I'm kind of an old school guy. I'm a Main Street business guy.But I want to hear what he has to say. And let's assume too that the private sector can do things great. We know they can. So let's see -- let's see what he talks about and let's see where he thinks he can take this thing.BARTIROMO: Well, how come it took them so long to admit that they were breaching our privacy and selling our information to advertisers? I mean can we trust them on cryptocurrency after what we've just been through in terms of privacy?WILLIAMS: Well that's going to be something to ask him. I mean, you know, they didn't say anything until they had to say something. And this is important when you're talking about cryptocurrency. I'm still a dollar- bill guy.And I want to know are the consumers going to be protected. How is it going to work for Main Street America? How is it going to work for a business like I have? I sit going to make things easier, harder or whatever? And can I trust them?OMEED MALIK, FOUNDER & CEO, FARVAHAR PARTNERS: Hi, Congressman. This is Omeed Malik.WILLIAMS: Hey -- Omeed.MALIK: I would just say that if you think about why are they getting into this business -- that's the first question to ask. And that is so they can track the spending behavior of the American citizen. And he's going to use China as a boogeyman.The difference is that the Chinese government is the one who is doing this, not a private corporation. So I certainly agree that you want innovation out of the private sector but to what end?Look at all the different businesses they're in and all seems in order to track citizens. If they're going to get into a currency sector, they need to be regulated to the full extent just like a bank would in some cases. And so I hope to the extent that our congressmen are speaking about this, that we're going to actually have it be regulated because this is a company that has shown bad faith in the past and continues to expand in area after area and swallows up any innovation. And it's also a monopoly.WILLIAMS: Yes. I mean I agree with what you're saying. That's what we're going to have to talk out about today and learn more about it. The transparency is going to have to be important -- to protect the consumer, it's going to have to be important. And I mean that's the bottom line, that's what we do here.And as a small business person, I want to make sure that I'm protected. And those are the things he's going to have to answer.BARTIROMO: Yes. I like that. That's a good question. Is it just to track everybody, to see what they're spending their money on?MCDOWELL: Omeed -- I'm going to ask you a question. How many people with respect, Congressman -- how many people in Washington really understand how Facebook's business works? Because it's vast.And again, when Mark Zuckerberg first appeared on Capitol Hill he was very, very prepared in terms of rehearsed by -- well-rehearsed by his legal team.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: And he was very focused and very respectful. But I don't -- the questions didn't really get to the bottom of what Facebook has been up to literally for the last 12 years or so.MALIK: Dagen -- it's such an important point. Many of the senators that asked him question didn't even know that Facebook was a free service. And as a result they didn't understand how he was making money. They didn't even know that it's from the advertisers.So if you don't understand the fundamental business purpose and how they're actually -- their earnings are generated, how are you going to begin to regulate it? And instead of allowing them to get into more and more areas, this can be very dangerous.BARTIROMO: We'll be watching this hearing. Go ahead -- Congressman. Real quick.WILLIAMS: Well, I was going to say Dagen -- you asked a good question. How many congress people, I mean, the truth of the matter is, very few. And I don't include myself to be all-knowing. I'm still learning this. We have to ask the questions.But the problem is sometimes more people, our peers as you know think they know more than they know.BARTIROMO: Yes.WILLIAMS: And that's why this hearing is important and maybe those to follow.BARTIROMO: Well, take that question to your colleagues that Omeed just gave you. You know, why are they getting into this business? Do they want to just track everybody and what they're spending.Real quick on the push for impeachment, Congressman -- the top American diplomat in Ukraine, William Taylor testified yesterday that President Trump did in fact use aid as an incentive for Ukraine to investigate the Biden family in the 2016 election. Of course then, Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said that Texas Congressman John Ratcliffe question, quote, "destroyed Taylor's argument".Do you have any sense of what went down yesterday? And is the public ever going to get a look behind the curtain here in this impeachment inquiry?WILLIAMS: Well, I don't know. They've been really secret about it. It's not even in the right committee. I know I was in my district last week with the President to open a Louis Vuitton plant in central Texas. And people back home are following it, but it's not important.But I think it's -- nothing is stuck on the president. It's their only way to think they can win in 2022 -- or 2020.BARTIROMO: Yes.WILLIAMS: And it's phony is the bottom line. We've got to get through this. And we've got an election coming up in November and let's let the voters decide.BARTIROMO: Yes, absolutely. Well, I think it's interesting -- Congressman, that because Taylor had in his opening statement suggestions that there was a quid pro quo, they released his opening statement. Nothing else was released in particular, the questioning by John Ratcliffe which blew a hole in that completely.MCDOWELL: The House Democrats are essentially auditioning players for what will be a public Christmas pageant -- a holiday pageant of the impeachment proceedings. They're trying to find the best voices to push this message on the American people. So all this is being done in secret. The Republican congressmen aren't even given transcripts of these interviews or depositions.They have to go in and read the transcript with a Democratic staffer standing next to them.BARTIROMO: Yes. They've got a minder.MCDOWELL: Exactly.BARTIROMO: And that's unprecedented. Never seen --MCDOWELL: You know what? It's not an impeachment proceeding. They haven't voted on it. It's not --BARTIROMO: It's a show.MCDOWELL: -- it's not formal. It's not formal in the way that it was with Clinton and with Richard Nixon. Again, they're not treating this with the seriousness and the severity that it is when you're trying to --BARTIROMO: But they don't have the vote and they also don't have a story.MCDOWELL: Really quickly. There was a CNN report that the number of people in favor of impeachment and removal from office has gone up. It's at 50 percent. But if you look at Republicans, the number of people saying yes to that impeachment and removal from office has fallen dramatically. It's only 6 percent of Republicans right now. So support for the President among his base is actually improving.BARTIROMO: Yes. And I don't see any credibility on the Democrats' side until they focus on the real wrongdoing in 2016. I want to see accountability.Congressman -- it's good to see you, sir. Thank you.WILLIAMS: Ok. Good to see you, guys.BARTIROMO: Congressman Roger Williams joining us there.Caterpillar, we told you, missed on the third quarter earnings report this morning. It's also lowering its full year guidance.Joining us right now by phone is Tigress Financial Partners chief investment officer Ivan Feinseth. Ivan -- thanks very much for calling in. Your reaction to the Caterpillar quarter and what it tells us about the global economy.IVAN FEINSETH, TIGRESS FINANCIAL PARTNERS (via telephone): Well, they do, are experiencing a headwind from slowing global growth, that is mostly trade tariff driven. And when I -- we're moving closer to some type of trade deal with China. I think once that is overcome, I think the shares will snap back.So I think this is a buying opportunity because global construction demand continues to increase, especially for infrastructure, both in the U.S. and in other countries.And they do have some other drivers of revenue including their Cloud- connected platform that they are very technology advanced company. And they are buying back stock at a significant rate and the stock does have an over 3 percent dividend yield.So I still view this weakness as a buying opportunity and we look to some correction once the tariffs are overcome.BARTIROMO: Well, this is exactly what Omeed said. In fact, had I bought - - when you said it, when the stock was down 6 percent I would have already made money. It's still off of the lows, Omeed -- down 3.9 percent right now.MALIK: Yes. I couldn't agree more. This, like so many of other names, I love what you said about that acronym about all the ones affected by the trade deal -- you're making a macroeconomic play less than a fundamental one.BARTIROMO: And is this pretty much priced in -- Ivan? The fact that they took their estimates down? What should we look toward in terms of next move in this stock, do you think? Do you think this is the low that we've seen so far?SEINFEITH: Well, I think when companies are going to lower expectations, they do become very conservative, to hope that business does pick up and then they can exceed the expectations over the next few quarters.So I think that they have been conservative throughout this whole tariff issue in the past year-and-a-half. And that has been weighing on the stock for some time. But they are the dominant construction machine producer globally with the most brand equity and I think when stocks are struggling, it's time to -- when stocks struggle, it's time to buy it. And when we see demand pick up I think they will be a significant beneficiary.BARTIROMO: All right. We'll leave it there.Ivan -- thanks very much for calling in. We appreciate it. Ivan Feinseth joining us there from Tigress.Coming up, investors are watching Boeing as well, the company's third quarter earnings out in about 30 minutes. We'll have those numbers after this break.And then Pizza Hut's meatless play -- its the unique sausage pie could trick your taste buds. We're going to check it out.Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Actress Lori Loughlin and ten other parents facing new charges in the massive college at admissions scandal this morning.Cheryl Casone on headlines -- Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Maria.So prosecutors say that those parents have been indicted on charges of conspiracy to commit federal program bribery. They are accused of attempting to buy off officials at an organization that receives federal funding. The charge carries a maximum sentence of up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.Jeff Bezos putting together an all-star team to build a lunar lander for his company Blue Origin. The contractors which include Lockheed Martin and Northrup Grumman and Draper will build a spacecraft to take NASA astronauts to the moon as soon as 2024.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JEFF BEZOS, CEO, AMAZON: This is the only way to get back to the moon fast and this time we're going back to the moon and we're not going to back to the moon to visit. We're going back to the moon to stay.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Well, the system is being built for NASA's Artemis program.And then finally this. Pizza Hut taking a bite of the plant-based meat fad. They are testing just for today a garden specialty pizza that's topped with "incogmeato" Italian sausage.So incogmeato is made by Morning Star farms. Kellogg owns that company, by the way. The Pizza-hut tryout is being held tomorrow only at one Pizza Hut location in Phoenix near Scottsdale, if anybody is watching from there.Pizza Hut is also testing a round pizza box guys, they claim will keep the pizza hot. You all have it on set. Enjoy, as I give you some more details about it. The round box is compostable.MCDOWELL: So it looks like this.CASONE: Right.MCDOWELL: You take the top off.CASONE: Right.MCDOWELL: It's got a natural base that your pizza locks in. And it's like -- guess who made it. I didn't mean to interrupt you -- Cheryl.CASONE: No, that's ok. But about the pizza -- so you all try it or somebody try it because I can't. I'm over here.BARTIROMO: They made me try it.(CROSSTALKING)CASONE: It's not meat. It's plant-based meat.MCDOWELL: I'm not eating the cheese on it.CASONE: It's not vegan.MCDOWELL: No. But the fake -- sorry, the fake sausage is vegan. It's just the --BARTIROMO: All right. Art -- you took a bite. Tell us.MALIK: How is it?HOGAN: It's fantastic. It's really good.BARTIROMO: Are you kidding me?HOGAN: And it's really hot, too still which is amazing. But that's part of the -- you see how this box is made?CASONE: Yes. It's pretty cool, right.MCDOWELL: So the box was designed alongside Zoom, the company that Meredith Whitney works for us, so she was here telling us about it. This is one of Zoom's products. So it locks in.BARTIROMO: So Meredith --MCDOWELL: Yes, exactly. It locks in. It's awesome.BARTIROMO: I like the lock. That is cool.MCDOWELL: What are they calling it? The sausage or whatever?CASONE: Incogmeato.BARTIROMO: Incogmeato.MCDOWELL: Yes.BARTIROMO: Incogmeato.MCDOWELL: It's delicious.(CROSSTALKING)MCDOWELL: It's really -- it's really delicious.CASONE: If you're near the East Thomas Pizza Hut in Phoenix tomorrow. Go give it a try and e-mail or send us a Twitter message or send some pictures to the show and folks out there let us know what you think.BARTIROMO: I don't know what I like better, the incogmeato or the round box. I am loving this warm pizza. How come nobody had that idea before -- round pizza boxes?MCDOWELL: The key to all this -- I've said this before -- the key to all this plant-based the meats, the burgers, the fillings, sausages, does it have the toothiness of the usual, of the real stuff? Does it eat like a burger? Does it eat like crumbled sausage on a pizza? It's yes with this.BARTIROMO: All right. You said it was delicious.HOGAN: Very good. Absolutely delicious.BARTIROMO: Cool.HOGAN: You guys are getting it right.BARTIROMO: All right. Thank you -- Cheryl. You're getting the pizza.CASONE: You bet.BARTIROMO: Pizza for breakfast.Coming up, Eli Lilly out with mixed earnings this morning. I'll be speaking with the CEO Dave Ricks when we come right back.Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly raising its 2019 profit forecast after reporting better than expected third quarter profits in the last hour. Revenue came in lower than expected however. Take a look at the stock this morning and how it is doing in the premarket right now on the hills of the third quarter earnings from Eli Lilly -- down 2 percent, plus.Joining us right now in a "First on Fox" interview is Eli Lilly CEO Dave Ricks. Dave -- it's good to have you on the program. Thanks so much for joining us.DAVE RICKS, CEO, ELI LILLY: Great to be back. Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: We will really focused on where the growth is coming from at Lilly but first characterize the quarter for us.RICKS: Yes, overall we had a strong quarter. We grew 3 percent on the top line really driven by 8 percent volume growth which is really our newest products. The company's launched 10 products in the last five years and those are now making up 44 percent of our revenue.And that's good news because new medicines getting to patients, that's our business strategy that also drives financial success.BARTIROMO: Yes. Of course. RICKS: We managed cost pretty well and we beat and raised on the bottom line.BARTIROMO: Well, you've got the recently launched drugs certainly helping to offset some of the generic issues. Is that where the growth comes from in the next six months, in the next year?RICKS: That's right. You know, that's an important point. As I said, really double digit volume growth driven by our newest products.We have two headwinds that have showed up in this quarter. One is as you mentions loss of patents on key drugs like Cialis which lost its patent a year ago. We had a 6 percent headwind due to that.I want to point out, that's an important part of the life cycle of our industry. And now that medicine is very inexpensive for patients who need it.In addition we had, particularly in the U.S., price deflation -- this has been going on for a few years now. But our U.S. pricing was minus 5 percent, globally minus 4 percent. So those two things together were a drag on growth.We still grew 3 percent. We do anticipate that drag reducing going forward because both in the case of Cialis which the comparable will get better going into Q4 as well as on the pricing where there is some one-time effects in Q3, we expect improvement on both those headwinds exiting this year into 2020.BARTIROMO: And real quick on the cancer drug, the pancreatic cancer drug, not meeting the primary end point in the overall survival. What can you tell us about that in terms of your cancer drugs and this pancreatic one that was a disappointment. Do you see that coming back in terms of the next year for another review?RICKS: So yes -- thank you for the question. You're talking about a drug called pegilodecakin (ph) which we purchased a year and-a-half ago. It's being studied in three important studies.The pancreatic cancer study was disappointing, not that surprising unfortunately, because pancreatic cancer has really proven to be one of the most difficult settings and difficult condition for patients.But we're also studying it in two forms of lung cancer on top of other immuno-oncology therapies. Those readouts are coming toward the end of this this year, early next year. We're excited to see those readouts with this very novel mechanism that really seeks to partner with other immuno- oncology therapies to improve patients' lives.We also, I would point out -- we had three other important readouts in the quarter in oncology. One in breast cancer with Verzenio which showed an overall survival benefit over nine months for the first time. That's an important benefit for patients.And in two readouts on a drug we acquired earlier this year called selpercatinib (ph) Loxo 292, the acquisition of Loxo Oncology which showed enormous benefit really in lung cancer as well as in thyroid cancer. So a successful quarter for oncology overall. Of course, disappointing news on the pancreatic study.BARTIROMO: Well, I'm glad you said that because, you know, the fight against cancer continues every day. You guys have had some real innovative drugs in terms of oncology.Would you -- is it fair to say that now with the acquisition you just mentioned, with the patents sort of hopefully in the rear view mirror, are you back toward a growth trajectory in terms of the pipeline and what's ahead for the coming five years? Or do you still have to deal with these patent expirations over the near term?RICKS: Well, that's a key thing about our company is I think we have relatively few patent expiries both in this year but going forward, versus the rest of the industry. We do project strong growth going forward. In fact, between 2016 and 2020, we had projected average of 7 percent growth and we aim to hit that as we set guidance later this year, going into 2020.And I think we have a bright future, really driven by the newest medicines and a relative lack of patent exposure in our portfolio. And of course, that's great news for patients, new medicines for serious conditions. We were talking about cancer just now but also diabetes, auto autoimmune conditions which are quite prevalent and pain which is an emerging area for us, non-opioid pain medicines really to help people with the most common condition that people have when they go to the doctor which is something hurts and we know all the problems with opioids. Lilly is inventing new ways to treat pain that don't have those negative properties.BARTIROMO: And Dave -- real quick. Is that an organic growth story or do you see an opportunity for further acquisitions in terms of filling some of those holes?RICKS: It's both. Of course, we need a strong team of scientists. We have a great team of scientists here, discovering new medicines every day and attempting to get those to patients. But we complement that with partnerships and acquisitions, with biotech and other major pharma.That's how our industry works. And we need to be active in all those areas but really focused on the diseases we know how to add value --(CROSSTALKING)BARTIROMO: Dave -- great to have you on the program this morning. Thanks so much.RICKS: Thanks for having me. Thank you -- Maria.BARTIROMO: Dave Ricks joining us there, CEO of Eli Lilly.We are awaiting Boeing earnings amid questions of the 737 Max. Just yesterday the aerospace company announced that it is replacing the head of its commercial airplanes division.Joining us right now is Blue Line Capital President, Bill Baruch and Stifel Airlines Analyst, Joseph DeNardi. Great to see you gentleman. Thanks very much for joining us as we await the Boeing earnings; they are coming out any second here.Bill, your expectations in terms of what drove the quarter?BILL BARUCH, PRESIDENT, BLUE LINE CAPITAL: I want to see how this thing responds on a price action basis. Now, they -- yesterday they talked about significant progress on the 737. Do they follow through? Do we see that come back on the quarter four? On top of that, do they announce any guidance? People overall just want to hear the guidance, even if it is bad. That could actually be a positive.So lastly, the $5.6 million hit in July they announced, is it worse than that? Obviously if they announce the worse we could see the stock react more poorly.BARTIROMO: Yes, Joseph, it looks like the numbers are amiss on the earnings line. The 737 obviously has been the big issue. When you look at the earnings and the revenue over the near term, how big of an issue is the 737 going to be and for how much longer?JOSEPH DENARDI, AIRLINES ANALYST, STIFEL: Yes, I think most U.S. airlines seem to assume that it's going to -- you know, be returned to service early next year. Obviously, that's several months later than they thought it was going to be returned a few months ago and so I think their view on when it comes back is just based on kind of their best guess at this point.And so, yes, I think they're hoping it comes back as soon as Boeing's able to get it back in the air.BARTIROMO: Well, the costs are obviously increasing for this company. That's also showing up in this quarter. Let's get to Jackie DeAngelis with the -- with the numbers on earnings and revenue which is a miss and the stock is trading down, Jackie.JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT: It is a miss, Maria. And you can see the EPS, $1.45 adjusted. The expectation was $2.09. The revenue came in slightly higher at $19.98 billion, expectation there of $19.67 billion.But as you mentioned, the 737 Max jet is really what's in focus this quarter. We actually have a quote from the CEO, saying our top priority remains the safe return to service of the 737 Max. And we're making steady progress there. That was the CEO, Dennis Muilenburg.He also continues to say we've also taken action to further sharpen our company's focus on product and services safety. Maria, for now I'll send it back to you.BARTIROMO: I'll tell you one thing, while you were talking, Jackie, we're seeing a real comeback in the stock. Right after the news were -- was released, you saw a decline of better than two percent, and it is off of the lows. Jackie DeAngelis, thank you. Omeed.MALIK: Yes, so it's all well and good for the company to say that they think the 737 issue is behind them or it's getting to the finish line. I want to ask our guests about the regulatory issues, though, as well. Because it's really going to be ultimately up to the regulators. So how about the disconnect between the FAA here in the United States versus their equivalent in Europe and the disconnect that might occur between there as far as where these planes can actually fly. Do you guys have a thought on that?BARTIROMO: What do you think, Bill?BARUCH: Well, overall actually this could take weeks. I mean, it'd be -- it would be a big achievement to see this fly again in quarter four. You're probably looking at the quarter -- you know, and the first quarter of next year at best. And that's what the stock is responding to now.What really matters, I look at this price action and there's a big support area, 320, and then a shelf below at $3.00. I always say, what are the best technical moves is a fundamental rejection. If we're rejecting lower prices on poor fundamentals right now and the market moves higher, that in it of itself is taking some of the sellers or most of the sellers are out of the market.BARTIROMO: Yes, and then there's the impact on the airlines, Joe, right? I mean, the 737 Max affect has obviously impacted airlines like Southwest and JetBlue. Your reaction to that?DENARDI: Well, in the -- in the airline industry, any constraint on capacity is good. And so, you know, in general what that's meant this year is have been better pricing trends and less capacity growth and so I think what airline investors are worried about next year is how much supply is going to come back online when the Max comes back in. To the extent that the -- that the return to service gets delayed, that's not necessarily a bad thing for airlines.Our view is that Southwest may look at that as kind of an unacceptable risk for them if they're not able to grow and execute their strategy, they may have to look to diversify their fleet away from the Max in order to grow and not lose share.And so I think what Southwest is probably most keyed in on at this point is Boeing's confidence that they'll be able to get production rates back to where they thought they would be and deliver to Southwest the 40 to 50 Maxes a year that they're going to need the next few years to grow and execute their strategy.HOGAN: Joe, you bring up a really good point in terms of the diversity that Southwest has -- that has all of a sudden, you know, been sort of pointed out for not having and using all the Boeing product and none of the Airbus product where other airlines have some sort of combination of both.But at the end of the day, I think what you really bring up is the fact that we have a duopoly here. And if that's the case and we think the 737 Max is going to get back up into production and up in the air at some point in 2020, how much of that eventuality do you think is priced in right now, what multiple is Boeing trading at and how much will the eventual success of the 737 getting back in the air at some point, let's call it the first half of next year is in there, and how risk -- how derisked does the stock look today?DENARDI: Yes, I think -- I think ultimately it comes back to -- yes, I'm sorry. Go ahead.BARUCH: Go ahead -- go ahead. Sorry.BARTIROMO: Bill, you take it. Go ahead, Bill.DENARDI: Ultimately it comes back to --BARUCH: You know, I'm looking at 20 times multiple. I mean, you can see if someone is -- that's where they're seeing valuing down here and ultimately, again, 20 times multiple, so you can see something come back in online the first half of next year and buyers down here are going to see that progress later in the next year.BARTIROMO: All right, go ahead, Joe. Sorry about that. Yes, I just do -- I know you follow the airlines, Joe. And wanted to make sure that you were on track with where you were following. But please weigh in.DENARDI: No, I think ultimately it comes back to Boeing's ability to get rates back to where they thought they would be. That's ultimately I think what investors are most concerned about and I think as it relates to airlines, you know, that's going to have a pretty meaningful impact on supply growth in the U.S.Southwest represents, you know, call it 20 percent of domestic capacity, 10 percent of their own capacity, roughly should be on the Max right now. And so how quickly they're able to get those aircraft back into service has a pretty big impact on supply trends.MCDOWELL: But what -- this is Dagen McDowell, Joe. Would Southwest bet on Airbus at a time when this administration is in a trade fight? I'm not talking about China, but that $7.5 billion award from the World Trade Organization over this long-running fight over the subsidies to Airbus. Would Southwest really bet on a com -- in that duopoly that competitor overseas that could be in the middle of a fight with the president?DENARDI: That's a really good point. I think that's probably a consideration for Southwest.I mean, look, at the end of the day, Southwest would prefer to not do anything. They would prefer to remain as a single fleet type and continue to do what they've been doing. It's resulted in them being the most successful airline in the industry. The point that we're trying to make is if they look a few years down the road -- they've expressed frustration that this year their supply is down year over year, while the rest of the industry is up four to five percent. That means that they are giving customers to other airlines. And they've accepted that to this point.But if they lose confidence in Boeing's ability to give them the Maxes that they need to grow and do what they want to do, then they don't have many options other than either to try and convince Airbus to give them delivery slots which probably don't exist, or to do something inorganic and there aren't many airlines in the U.S. that the DOJ would allow Southwest to buy, I think. JetBlue would be one of them.And so I think Southwest has to balance this, the risks that you brought up with the risk that maybe their capacity is constrained for a prolonged period of time when capacity at their competitors is not.BARTIROMO: Is anybody surprised that this stock is sort of pushing to go positive right now? Caterpillar has given up -- I'm sorry, Boeing has given up much of the losses that we saw earlier and, Bill, they're sticking with this expectation that the 737 Max up, it just went positive, gets back in the air in the fourth quarter. Are you buying that? And look at the stock now, up on the session; it's up a quarter percent.BARUCH: Well, they laid that groundwork yesterday. And really my thesis here was seeing that they wanted to get ahead of poor earnings and they did get ahead of what was overall seem poor earnings. But they're sticking with the fact that you're going to see this come back on the quarter and next this quarter.So, if they follow through, yes, there's a -- there's a lot higher the stock can go, there's a lot of support down here. But remember, Friday was a very poor day for this stock. And what we're running into is that price action from Friday.So it has a -- has a tall task to start recovering all of that. You don't really want to change this price action. You're going to see a lot of gyrations back and forth. And again, this is one number, but -- and if I understand correctly, there still is no true guidance out there. And if there's no true guidance out there, you're still going to see a lot of expectations waffle around.BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, they're talk -- they're talking about costs going up and they're talking about the 737 returning to the air in the fourth quarter but we don't see a guidance for the next year, that's true. Bill Baruch, Joseph DeNardi, good to see you both gentleman. Thank you so much.DENARDI: Thank you.BARTIROMO: We'll keep watching the story. And as you know, Caterpillar was a miss; that stock is down. But Boeing is now up. We'll see what that means for the markets. We're still expecting a 90 point selloff at the start of trading this morning for the Dow Industrials.Coming up, we are bracing for the holidays, I'll be speaking with the CEO of UPS David Abney on how his company is prepping for the peak shipping season.And then Lexus plugged in the automaker unveils its first ever electric vehicle. The photos and when you can power up, next up.CASONE: Welcome back to MORNINGS WITH MARIA. I'm Cheryl Casone with some headlines for you.Chipotle out with sizzling earnings after the bell. But it is not all good news. Shares initially climbed after its latest results came in better than expected but the stock is losing ground this morning, down almost a little more than 1-1/2 percent.Online sales soared 88 percent during the quarter but delivery costs also rose. That said; Chipotle is up more than 90 percent so far this year.Meantime, Snap is trading higher in the premarket, stock up almost two percent; the parent of Snapchat reported a narrow than expected loss and revenue which beat the streets estimate. The number of active users increased by seven million. That did top expectations from analysts.Well, Facebook is investing $1 billion to tackle the affordable housing crisis in California. Company says it's going to build 20,000 housing units over the next 10 years. Experts say the Bay Area economy has created one home for every 10 new jobs over the past decade. A lot of those are high paying jobs. That has caused home prices to skyrocket.Facebook has been blamed for helping create this crisis, bringing tens of thousands of those higher paid workers into the Bay Area.Lexus is plugging into the future. The automaker says it's going to unveil its first electric vehicle next month. And it's already showing off a concept car, the LF-30, there it is. It features a lot of futuristic tech like gesture control and artificial intelligence to adjust all the settings on the car and of course, yes, it drives itself.All right, we've got a lot more coming up this morning. Holiday shipping almost here. Maria going to be speaking with UPS CEO David Abney coming up next on prepping for the peak season as customers hit that online store and all that shopping starts. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The holiday shopping season already heating up, meaning holiday shipping season is on deck as well. A lot of that shipping falling to UPS. The company maintains its relationship with Amazon after it dumped FedEx, helping growth.Joining me right now is the CEO of UPS, David Abney. David, it's great to have you. Thank you so much for joining us.DAVID ABNEY, CEO, UPS: Nice to be here, Maria.BARTIROMO: You just characterized your quarter as the best quarter in the company's history.ABNEY: It absolutely was.BARTIROMO: Tell us about it.ABNEY: And it was balanced across all three sectors which is very important to us. I think the sector that's gotten the most attention is the U.S. domestic business, very, very strong. For this quarter compared to last year at the same time, we reduced our unit cost 2-1/2 percent which is something that I don't remember seeing before. And that resulted in the operating profit for the U.S. business grew 26 percent, so just an excellent quarter.BARTIROMO: How did you -- how were you able to get a handle on costs so well, and decline those?ABNEY: It really is the result of a lot of work that we've done. It's our strategies. It's our strategic imperatives that we've focused on. It is the investments that we have made in automating our buildings and optimizing our routes. So we're really getting the payback from those investments. And then at the end, its execution and our people just did an excellent job executing.BARTIROMO: You are headed into now one of the most important times of the year, obviously. Are you expecting a surge in volumes around the holidays and what's your expectation for growth around that?ABNEY: We do believe it's going to be a busy holiday season. Four less workdays between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year which just means that there's less days for a lot of the promotions that start right around Thanksgiving.So we have built up, we have added this year five million additional square feet in buildings. That's 400,000 packages an hour that we can run over last year. And we've added 11 aircraft which is good, because with the change from second day to next day, we needed the additional lift. So we have it.BARTIROMO: Going into the quarter, with the resignation of your COO, can you give us the impact there and what you're expecting?ABNEY: Yes, I think what you have to keep in mind; Jim has been with us 35 years. So it was definitely a retirement and well-deserved, did an excellent job. He's going to work through us through peak. We have a solid bench of people too. So while we're going to miss Jim, obviously this organization keeps going and we have good people in the wing.BARTIROMO: So David, the last time we spoke we were sort of right smack in the middle of this trade fight, whether it's China, the uncertainty over USMCA. What has that done in terms of your market expectations and where we are with regard to this trade impacting overall growth, overall manufacturing?ABNEY: There's been bright spots since we talked and then there's things that are still ongoing. So it's -- you know, I think it has more of an effect of customers looking to change their trade patterns. And so we have to look at how we move our assets around to adjust to those trade patterns.A good example is our 747-8, our biggest aircraft. We were had them planned to go to China to the U.S. since the U.S. lane has reduced due to the trade war, we've actually moved one of those planes, China to Europe. And it's those kinds of things we do.USMCA, we think is a bright spot. We think that Lighthizer's done a great job of getting bipartisan support, really believe that will be ratified.China to U.S., there's -- the latest talks seem to be going in the right directions, so we're hopeful there.And then with Brexit, we're just having to watch. It's kind of a day-to- day news breaker right now. But we'll see.BARTIROMO: Yes, we're all waiting to see what happens there. Your sense of the B2B business right now which is so important for UPS, the small and mid-cap businesses, how would you characterize things?ABNEY: That is our primary focus is to lean in and to make sure that we take care of the small and mid-size businesses. What they want is one thing, really. And that is to be able to compete from a logistics standpoint with the big e-tailors and retailers.So we just introduced a digital access program and partnership with Shopify and with Stuffs.com and others. What that does is it gives access to their 1.5 million small businesses into our network.BARTIROMO: Wow.ABNEY: And so it's really it's a significant move and that is our focus is to help small and mid-size businesses compete.BARTIROMO: And I assume that would mean you're also affecting costs pretty efficiently as well with this -- with your new technology.ABNEY: We are. And that technology allows us to connect to these programs. B2B is going to be multiple packages per stop and that's what really makes a difference.And the fact that we're automating our buildings and optimizing our routes, all of that helps B2B. And it's one of the reasons that we had such a good quarter.BARTIROMO: Tell us after -- about the drone business. UPS expanding its Flight Forward drone program after becoming the first company to gain FAA approval to transport medical supplies by drone. Really an interesting development.ABNEY: Yes, we put a stake in the ground that we were going to be the first to get this certification from the FAA and we've worked real hard to do that.Then we put a stake that we were going to be the first to scale it and because a lot of people may have wondered, could UPS take the market lead here, and we absolutely showed that we did. We announced partnerships with AmerisourceBergen with Kaiser Permanente and with CVS, so all three just really outstanding companies that we will be progressing our drone usage. And then we will go outside healthcare pretty quickly too.BARTIROMO: That is amazing.ABNEY: But the initial focus is healthcare.BARTIROMO: So you are approved to move supplies at WakeMed in Raleigh North Carolina and University Of Utah Health in Salt Lake City. Is that the goal to get more and more of those kinds of customers and partnerships to move these medical supplies?ABNEY: Yes, that's the initial phase is to -- any of these campus type environments, we chose healthcare but it could be other campus type environments.But the CVS, what makes it so interesting, it's the first retail partnership we have done and we're going to start testing quickly about actually taking shipments such as pharmaceuticals from a local CVS store and delivering it to homes. So --BARTIROMO: That's such a convenience.ABNEY: It will be. And if it's something that you need very quickly, I mean, there's no faster delivery than drone deliveries. So we think it plays an important role.BARTIROMO: All right, so look ahead, David, to the next year or three. Where does the growth come from at UPS?ABNEY: International still would be big growth area for us. Europe by the way, as we're continuing to gain market share, we're doing very well there.BARTIROMO: Are you seeing any growth in Europe?ABNEY: Yes, we are. And we're kind of against the mode. And so that's going well for us.BARTIROMO: All right, David, it's great to have you.ABNEY: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. David Abney, UPS. We'll be right back.Load-Date: October 23, 2019End of Document

Digital Isolator Market Is Driven by the Thriving Automotive Industry for High Voltage BatteryiCrowdNewswire (English)September 24, 2019 Tuesday 10:00 AM GMTCopyright 2019 iCrowdNewswire, LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1574 wordsBodyThe global digital isolator market size stood at $1.5 billion in 2018 and is projected to grow with a CAGR of 6.8% all through the forecast period 2019-2025.Innovative CMOS-based digital isolators have become an ideal solution in a power-hungry world. The industrial market is one of the most common applications of isolation. System requirements such as signal level shifting, component protection, user safety, and adherence to safety regulations are acting as the primary drivers, which are increasing the demand for isolation components in the industrial market. In precise analog measurement systems, the ground shift is a frequent problem in industrial applications, can be solved by using digital isolators, because these isolation components enable additional functionality and also ensure safe operation of the system. Digital isolation devices are in demand to satisfy the safety regulations even though maximizing the benefits of modern CMOS technology.

The S&P 500 (-0.01%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.2%), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%) finished near their flat lines.The small-cap Russell 2000 (+1.3%), which is home to many energy and financial stocks, outperformed the broader market.The market entered today on the heels of a two-week rally, with some investors beginning to feel less concerned about growth prospects and trade relations with China. For instance, data has shown the U.S. consumer to be resilient in the face of trade tensions, which could see a reprieve with trade talks coming up next month.This positive sentiment was manifested in the higher oil prices ($57.87/bbl, +$1.42, +2.5%) and the selling in the Treasury market on Monday. In turn, the S&P 500 financials (+1.5%) and energy (+1.9%) sectors were today's leaders, which were further boosted by their perceived value-oriented nature, as opposed to the crowded positioning in the information technology sector (-0.7%).The 2-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.62%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 98.32.The Dow Jones Transportation Average (+2.0%), which is a trade-sensitive group and is often viewed as a proxy for economic growth, also outperformed. The defensive-oriented real estate (-0.9%), health care (-0.9%), and utilities (-0.6%) sectors joined the tech sector as today's laggards.Separately, Saudi Arabia replaced its oil minister with a member of the royal family, which traders believed could portend favorable policy for oil prices. A less appreciated factor contributing to the outperformance in the energy sector was the relatively higher dividend yields that many energy companies provide yield-hunting investors.In corporate news, activist shareholder Elliot Management disclosed a $3.2 billion stake in AT&T (T 336.79, +0.54, +1.5%), sharing a plan with the company it thinks could boost the stock to $60 by the end of 2021. Much of the initial enthusiasm waned throughout the session, leaving shares of AT&T near their session lows.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit Report for July:Consumer credit increased by $23.3 bln in July (Briefing.com consensus $18.2 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $13.8 bln (from $14.6 bln) in June. That is the largest expansion since July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is the recognition that revolving credit expanded at its fastest pace since November 2017. That could mean one of two things: (1) consumers are using revolving credit more because they lack the cash to cover spending on basic needs or (2) consumers are using revolving credit more because they feel confident about repayment capabilities due to feelings of job security. Only future economic data will tell the real tale, but in the context of a U.S. growth outlook, the expansion in consumer credit in July is apt to be taken at face value as an an encouraging sign.Looking ahead, investors will receive the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +21.9% YTDS&P 500 +18.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.0% YTDRussell 2000 +13.0% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1771/1084. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1875/1201.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: September 10, 2019End of Document

The S&P 500 (-0.01%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.2%), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%) finished near their flat lines.The small-cap Russell 2000 (+1.3%), which is home to many energy and financial stocks, outperformed the broader market.The market entered today on the heels of a two-week rally, with some investors beginning to feel less concerned about growth prospects and trade relations with China. For instance, data has shown the U.S. consumer to be resilient in the face of trade tensions, which could see a reprieve with trade talks coming up next month.This positive sentiment was manifested in the higher oil prices ($57.87/bbl, +$1.42, +2.5%) and the selling in the Treasury market on Monday. In turn, the S&P 500 financials (+1.5%) and energy (+1.9%) sectors were today's leaders, which were further boosted by their perceived value-oriented nature, as opposed to the crowded positioning in the information technology sector (-0.7%).The 2-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.62%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 98.32.The Dow Jones Transportation Average (+2.0%), which is a trade-sensitive group and is often viewed as a proxy for economic growth, also outperformed. The defensive-oriented real estate (-0.9%), health care (-0.9%), and utilities (-0.6%) sectors joined the tech sector as today's laggards.Separately, Saudi Arabia replaced its oil minister with a member of the royal family, which traders believed could portend favorable policy for oil prices. A less appreciated factor contributing to the outperformance in the energy sector was the relatively higher dividend yields that many energy companies provide yield-hunting investors.In corporate news, activist shareholder Elliot Management disclosed a $3.2 billion stake in AT&T (T 336.79, +0.54, +1.5%), sharing a plan with the company it thinks could boost the stock to $60 by the end of 2021. Much of the initial enthusiasm waned throughout the session, leaving shares of AT&T near their session lows.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit Report for July:Consumer credit increased by $23.3 bln in July (Briefing.com consensus $18.2 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $13.8 bln (from $14.6 bln) in June. That is the largest expansion since July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is the recognition that revolving credit expanded at its fastest pace since November 2017. That could mean one of two things: (1) consumers are using revolving credit more because they lack the cash to cover spending on basic needs or (2) consumers are using revolving credit more because they feel confident about repayment capabilities due to feelings of job security. Only future economic data will tell the real tale, but in the context of a U.S. growth outlook, the expansion in consumer credit in July is apt to be taken at face value as an an encouraging sign.Looking ahead, investors will receive the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +21.9% YTDS&P 500 +18.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.0% YTDRussell 2000 +13.0% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1771/1084. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1875/1201.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: September 10, 2019End of Document

Some consolidation appears to be taking shape after a recent stretch of gains, while the market awaits some key events later this week.For the moment, the narrative in the market's mind is that U.S. consumer spending could continue to support growth and that trade tensions with China may not escalate before their trade talks in October. China's Premier Li Kegiang reportedly repeated Beijing's willingness to make trade progress.At the same time, the market is holding steady in front of an ECB policy decision on Thursday and the Retail Sales Report for August on Friday, which could alter the market's assumptions about growth. Today, though, many investors will tune in to Apple's (AAPL 213.73, -0.44, -0.2%) annual product event at 1:00 p.m. ET, where it will likely unveil its latest iPhone.In economic data, investors will receive the JOLTS - Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey for July at 10:00 a.m. ET.

The S&P 500 (-0.01%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.2%), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%) finished near their flat lines.The small-cap Russell 2000 (+1.3%), which is home to many energy and financial stocks, outperformed the broader market.The market entered today on the heels of a two-week rally, with some investors beginning to feel less concerned about growth prospects and trade relations with China. For instance, data has shown the U.S. consumer to be resilient in the face of trade tensions, which could see a reprieve with trade talks coming up next month.This positive sentiment was manifested in the higher oil prices ($57.87/bbl, +$1.42, +2.5%) and the selling in the Treasury market on Monday. In turn, the S&P 500 financials (+1.5%) and energy (+1.9%) sectors were today's leaders, which were further boosted by their perceived value-oriented nature, as opposed to the crowded positioning in the information technology sector (-0.7%).The 2-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.62%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 98.32.The Dow Jones Transportation Average (+2.0%), which is a trade-sensitive group and is often viewed as a proxy for economic growth, also outperformed. The defensive-oriented real estate (-0.9%), health care (-0.9%), and utilities (-0.6%) sectors joined the tech sector as today's laggards.Separately, Saudi Arabia replaced its oil minister with a member of the royal family, which traders believed could portend favorable policy for oil prices. A less appreciated factor contributing to the outperformance in the energy sector was the relatively higher dividend yields that many energy companies provide yield-hunting investors.In corporate news, activist shareholder Elliot Management disclosed a $3.2 billion stake in AT&T (T 336.79, +0.54, +1.5%), sharing a plan with the company it thinks could boost the stock to $60 by the end of 2021. Much of the initial enthusiasm waned throughout the session, leaving shares of AT&T near their session lows.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit Report for July:Consumer credit increased by $23.3 bln in July (Briefing.com consensus $18.2 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $13.8 bln (from $14.6 bln) in June. That is the largest expansion since July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is the recognition that revolving credit expanded at its fastest pace since November 2017. That could mean one of two things: (1) consumers are using revolving credit more because they lack the cash to cover spending on basic needs or (2) consumers are using revolving credit more because they feel confident about repayment capabilities due to feelings of job security. Only future economic data will tell the real tale, but in the context of a U.S. growth outlook, the expansion in consumer credit in July is apt to be taken at face value as an an encouraging sign.Looking ahead, investors will receive the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +21.9% YTDS&P 500 +18.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.0% YTDRussell 2000 +13.0% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1771/1084. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1875/1201.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: September 10, 2019End of Document

Yesterday's "value" trade has weakened a bit with the S&P 500 financials sector (-0.5%) sliding into the red.The energy sector, which is up 1.7%, continues to uphold its end of the value bargain. Another gain in the price of oil ($58.63/bbl, +0.80, +1.4%) has been a nice support for the group.Separately, shares of Boeing (BA 363.00, +4.35) are up 1.2%, giving the price-weighed Dow (-0.4%) some support.10:25 ETDow -65.90 at 26769.59, Nasdaq -49.23 at 8038.24, S&P -15.08 at 2963.35[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades down 0.5% as the retreat in technology shares continues.The broader information technology sector is down 1.3%, and the consumer discretionary sector is down 1.2%. The underpeformance in Microsoft (MSFT 135.22, -2.26, -1.6%) and Amazon (AMZN 1814.95, -16.40, -0.9%) today has reflected broader efforts to take profits from cyclical stocks that have outperformed.Other notable laggards include Ford Motor (F 9.13, -0.42, -4.4%) and Wendy's (WEN 19.67, -2.28, -10.5%). Moody's downgraded Ford's senior unsecured rating to "junk status," citing a weak financial outlook. Wendy's is down after it lowered its earnings guidance to reflect its efforts to launch a breakfast menu nationwide.10:00 ETDow -68.99 at 26766.5, Nasdaq -76.19 at 8011.28, S&P -18.86 at 2959.57[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.6%, and the Russell 2000 trades lower by 0.4%.Just in, the July Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey showed that job openings declined to 7.217 million from a revised 7.248 million in June (from 7.348 million).09:40 ETDow -66.98 at 26768.51, Nasdaq -61.64 at 8025.83, S&P -15.02 at 2963.41[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages begin the day on a lower note. The S&P 500 is down 0.4%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.7%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows the information technology (-1.2%) and health care (-1.0%) sectors leading today's decline. The energy (+1.1%) and financials (+0.3%) sectors are the lone sectors up today amid higher oil prices ($58.08, +0.23, +0.4%) and higher U.S. Treasury yields. The groups might also be benefiting from a value-oriented trade.The 2-yr yield is up three basis points to 1.60%, and the 10-yr yield is up three basis points to 1.65%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.1% to 98.36.09:15 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -7.10. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -33.80.The stock market is on pace to open slightly lower with the S&P 500 futures trading seven points, or 0.2%, below fair value following a dull pre-market session.Apple's (AAPL 213.76, -0.41, -0.2%) annual product event at 1:00 p.m. ET today is an obligatory news headline, although expectations aren't too high this year.Elsewhere, some eyebrows have been raised after Wendy's (WEN 20.51, -1.44, -6.6%) announced plans to launch a breakfast menu next year, Moody's downgraded Ford Motor's (F 9.15, -0.39, -4.1%) senior unsecured rating to "junk status," and HD Supply Holdings (HDS 39.00, -1.82, -4.5%) lowered its FY20 guidance.Other than that, there isn't a lot of "new" macro news today. Investors might look to see if yesterday's "value" trade plays out again, where recent underperforming stocks outperform.08:50 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -6.90.

China reported hotter than expected inflation figures for August due to an ongoing pork shortage. Jilin Transportation Investment Group elected to not exercise a call option on a perpetual note and will instead pay a higher coupon, which is likely to invite concerns about the group's cash position.

Much of the initial enthusiasm waned throughout the session, leaving shares of AT&T near their session lows.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit Report for July:Consumer credit increased by $23.3 bln in July (Briefing.com consensus $18.2 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $13.8 bln (from $14.6 bln) in June. That is the largest expansion since July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is the recognition that revolving credit expanded at its fastest pace since November 2017. That could mean one of two things: (1) consumers are using revolving credit more because they lack the cash to cover spending on basic needs or (2) consumers are using revolving credit more because they feel confident about repayment capabilities due to feelings of job security. Only future economic data will tell the real tale, but in the context of a U.S. growth outlook, the expansion in consumer credit in July is apt to be taken at face value as an an encouraging sign.Looking ahead, investors will receive the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +21.9% YTDS&P 500 +18.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.0% YTDRussell 2000 +13.0% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1771/1084. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1875/1201.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: September 10, 2019End of Document

The underpeformance in Microsoft (MSFT 135.22, -2.26, -1.6%) and Amazon (AMZN 1814.95, -16.40, -0.9%) today has reflected broader efforts to take profits from cyclical stocks that have outperformed.Other notable laggards include Ford Motor (F 9.13, -0.42, -4.4%) and Wendy's (WEN 19.67, -2.28, -10.5%).

China reported hotter than expected inflation figures for August due to an ongoing pork shortage. Jilin Transportation Investment Group elected to not exercise a call option on a perpetual note and will instead pay a higher coupon, which is likely to invite concerns about the group's cash position.

Some consolidation appears to be taking shape after a recent stretch of gains, while the market awaits some key events later this week.For the moment, the narrative in the market's mind is that U.S. consumer spending could continue to support growth and that trade tensions with China may not escalate before their trade talks in October. China's Premier Li Kegiang reportedly repeated Beijing's willingness to make trade progress.At the same time, the market is holding steady in front of an ECB policy decision on Thursday and the Retail Sales Report for August on Friday, which could alter the market's assumptions about growth. Today, though, many investors will tune in to Apple's (AAPL 213.73, -0.44, -0.2%) annual product event at 1:00 p.m. ET, where it will likely unveil its latest iPhone.In economic data, investors will receive the JOLTS - Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey for July at 10:00 a.m. ET.

The S&P 500 (-0.01%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.2%), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%) finished near their flat lines.The small-cap Russell 2000 (+1.3%), which is home to many energy and financial stocks, outperformed the broader market.The market entered today on the heels of a two-week rally, with some investors beginning to feel less concerned about growth prospects and trade relations with China. For instance, data has shown the U.S. consumer to be resilient in the face of trade tensions, which could see a reprieve with trade talks coming up next month.This positive sentiment was manifested in the higher oil prices ($57.87/bbl, +$1.42, +2.5%) and the selling in the Treasury market on Monday. In turn, the S&P 500 financials (+1.5%) and energy (+1.9%) sectors were today's leaders, which were further boosted by their perceived value-oriented nature, as opposed to the crowded positioning in the information technology sector (-0.7%).The 2-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.62%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 98.32.The Dow Jones Transportation Average (+2.0%), which is a trade-sensitive group and is often viewed as a proxy for economic growth, also outperformed. The defensive-oriented real estate (-0.9%), health care (-0.9%), and utilities (-0.6%) sectors joined the tech sector as today's laggards.Separately, Saudi Arabia replaced its oil minister with a member of the royal family, which traders believed could portend favorable policy for oil prices.

Much of the initial enthusiasm waned throughout the session, leaving shares of AT&T near their session lows.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit Report for July:Consumer credit increased by $23.3 bln in July (Briefing.com consensus $18.2 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $13.8 bln (from $14.6 bln) in June.

The S&P 500 (-0.01%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.2%), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%) finished near their flat lines.The small-cap Russell 2000 (+1.3%), which is home to many energy and financial stocks, outperformed the broader market.The market entered today on the heels of a two-week rally, with some investors beginning to feel less concerned about growth prospects and trade relations with China. For instance, data has shown the U.S. consumer to be resilient in the face of trade tensions, which could see a reprieve with trade talks coming up next month.This positive sentiment was manifested in the higher oil prices ($57.87/bbl, +$1.42, +2.5%) and the selling in the Treasury market on Monday. In turn, the S&P 500 financials (+1.5%) and energy (+1.9%) sectors were today's leaders, which were further boosted by their perceived value-oriented nature, as opposed to the crowded positioning in the information technology sector (-0.7%).The 2-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.62%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 98.32.The Dow Jones Transportation Average (+2.0%), which is a trade-sensitive group and is often viewed as a proxy for economic growth, also outperformed. The defensive-oriented real estate (-0.9%), health care (-0.9%), and utilities (-0.6%) sectors joined the tech sector as today's laggards.Separately, Saudi Arabia replaced its oil minister with a member of the royal family, which traders believed could portend favorable policy for oil prices. A less appreciated factor contributing to the outperformance in the energy sector was the relatively higher dividend yields that many energy companies provide yield-hunting investors.In corporate news, activist shareholder Elliot Management disclosed a $3.2 billion stake in AT&T (T 336.79, +0.54, +1.5%), sharing a plan with the company it thinks could boost the stock to $60 by the end of 2021. Much of the initial enthusiasm waned throughout the session, leaving shares of AT&T near their session lows.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit Report for July:Consumer credit increased by $23.3 bln in July (Briefing.com consensus $18.2 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $13.8 bln (from $14.6 bln) in June. That is the largest expansion since July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is the recognition that revolving credit expanded at its fastest pace since November 2017. That could mean one of two things: (1) consumers are using revolving credit more because they lack the cash to cover spending on basic needs or (2) consumers are using revolving credit more because they feel confident about repayment capabilities due to feelings of job security. Only future economic data will tell the real tale, but in the context of a U.S. growth outlook, the expansion in consumer credit in July is apt to be taken at face value as an an encouraging sign.Looking ahead, investors will receive the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +21.9% YTDS&P 500 +18.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.0% YTDRussell 2000 +13.0% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1771/1084. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1875/1201.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: September 10, 2019End of Document

The S&P 500 is down 0.6%, the Dow is down 0.3%, and the Nasdaq is down 0.7%.Semiconductor stocks are struggling today, evidenced by the losses seen in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-0.7%). Applied Materials (AMAT 49.82, -0.84, -1.7%) has shown relative weakness. On the other hand, the Dow Jones Transportation Average (+0.9%) is seeing continued strength from yesterday.Separately, HD Supply Holdings (HDS 37.44, -3.38, -8.3%) has dropped 8% after the company issued downside guidance for the third quarter and lowered its FY20 guidance.

Yesterday's "value" trade has weakened a bit with the S&P 500 financials sector (-0.5%) sliding into the red.The energy sector, which is up 1.7%, continues to uphold its end of the value bargain. Another gain in the price of oil ($58.63/bbl, +0.80, +1.4%) has been a nice support for the group.Separately, shares of Boeing (BA 363.00, +4.35) are up 1.2%, giving the price-weighed Dow (-0.4%) some support.10:25 ETDow -65.90 at 26769.59, Nasdaq -49.23 at 8038.24, S&P -15.08 at 2963.35[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades down 0.5% as the retreat in technology shares continues.The broader information technology sector is down 1.3%, and the consumer discretionary sector is down 1.2%. The underpeformance in Microsoft (MSFT 135.22, -2.26, -1.6%) and Amazon (AMZN 1814.95, -16.40, -0.9%) today has reflected broader efforts to take profits from cyclical stocks that have outperformed.Other notable laggards include Ford Motor (F 9.13, -0.42, -4.4%) and Wendy's (WEN 19.67, -2.28, -10.5%). Moody's downgraded Ford's senior unsecured rating to "junk status," citing a weak financial outlook.

The S&P 500 is down 0.4%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.7%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows the information technology (-1.2%) and health care (-1.0%) sectors leading today's decline. The energy (+1.1%) and financials (+0.3%) sectors are the lone sectors up today amid higher oil prices ($58.08, +0.23, +0.4%) and higher U.S. Treasury yields. The groups might also be benefiting from a value-oriented trade.The 2-yr yield is up three basis points to 1.60%, and the 10-yr yield is up three basis points to 1.65%.

That could mean one of two things: (1) consumers are using revolving credit more because they lack the cash to cover spending on basic needs or (2) consumers are using revolving credit more because they feel confident about repayment capabilities due to feelings of job security. Only future economic data will tell the real tale, but in the context of a U.S. growth outlook, the expansion in consumer credit in July is apt to be taken at face value as an an encouraging sign.Looking ahead, investors will receive the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for August and the JOLTS - Job Opening report for July on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +21.9% YTDS&P 500 +18.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.0% YTDRussell 2000 +13.0% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1771/1084. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1875/1201.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: September 10, 2019End of Document

The S&P 500 (-0.01%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.2%), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%) finished near their flat lines.The small-cap Russell 2000 (+1.3%), which is home to many energy and financial stocks, outperformed the broader market.The market entered today on the heels of a two-week rally, with some investors beginning to feel less concerned about growth prospects and trade relations with China. For instance, data has shown the U.S. consumer to be resilient in the face of trade tensions, which could see a reprieve with trade talks coming up next month.This positive sentiment was manifested in the higher oil prices ($57.87/bbl, +$1.42, +2.5%) and the selling in the Treasury market on Monday. In turn, the S&P 500 financials (+1.5%) and energy (+1.9%) sectors were today's leaders, which were further boosted by their perceived value-oriented nature, as opposed to the crowded positioning in the information technology sector (-0.7%).The 2-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield increased seven basis points to 1.62%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 98.32.The Dow Jones Transportation Average (+2.0%), which is a trade-sensitive group and is often viewed as a proxy for economic growth, also outperformed. The defensive-oriented real estate (-0.9%), health care (-0.9%), and utilities (-0.6%) sectors joined the tech sector as today's laggards.Separately, Saudi Arabia replaced its oil minister with a member of the royal family, which traders believed could portend favorable policy for oil prices. A less appreciated factor contributing to the outperformance in the energy sector was the relatively higher dividend yields that many energy companies provide yield-hunting investors.In corporate news, activist shareholder Elliot Management disclosed a $3.2 billion stake in AT&T (T 336.79, +0.54, +1.5%), sharing a plan with the company it thinks could boost the stock to $60 by the end of 2021. Much of the initial enthusiasm waned throughout the session, leaving shares of AT&T near their session lows.Monday's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit Report for July:Consumer credit increased by $23.3 bln in July (Briefing.com consensus $18.2 bln) after increasing a downwardly revised $13.8 bln (from $14.6 bln) in June.

Discussions are underway with the Berkshire Hathaway CEO's team, he continued, and he's hoping to "reschedule very soon and then we will update all the guests."Sun, a protégé of Alibaba founder Jack Ma, invited crypto bosses such as Litecoin creator Charlie Lee and Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire to the charity meal,            as well as President Donald Trump. He dropped out            three days before it was scheduled to take place, citing a bout of kidney stones.However, Sun publicly apologized for overhyping himself on Chinese social media, and Bloomberg reported Tron employees were briefly detained by authorities in China,            fueling conspiracies he was in trouble with the Chinese government."I think it's gonna happen and I'm excited about it," Sun said on the stream, promising to share more details next quarter. "So just stay tuned."Sun also discussed his proposed partnership with "Andrew Yang and the Yang Gang" on the stream.During the last Democratic debate, the presidential candidate pledged to provide a universal basic income of $1,000 a month to 10 Americans for the next year. Sun announced he would give the same amount to 100 people next year, invite one of the "lucky 100" to the Buffett lunch, and allow Yang to assist him in selecting the recipients."I think I will [direct message] him on Twitter," Sun said on the stream. "If we have any discussion I will definitely update you, our community."Sun also trumpeted Tron's Nitron summit, which Kobe Bryant attended this year as a keynote speaker. He wants to invite celebrities "at the same level" as the former Los Angeles Lakers star to next year's event, he said.NOW WATCH: Jeff Bezos is worth over $160 billion - here's how the world's richest man makes and spends his moneySee Also:• Cruise ship workers reveal the 7 most annoying things you can do as a passenger• The impeachment inquiry into Trump has rattled global markets and poses 'a serious setback' to resolving the trade war• Acclaimed short seller Jim Chanos explains why he's betting against a healthcare business loved by Warren BuffettLoad-Date: September 26, 2019End of Document

Six of the crypto bosses have publicly accepted Sun's invite, including            eToro boss Yoni Assia and            Litecoin creator Charlie Lee. However, finding a new date for the lunch that fits everyone's schedules has proven to be a challenge, Tron communications director Cliff Edwards told Blocktv."It took about two months for us to get all nine people to come to San Francisco and sit in one room for five hours with Warren Buffett," Edwards said. "We are in the process of corralling all of those nine people again to get it back on track."Both Buffett's team and the Glide Foundation, the homeless charity that received the proceeds from the lunch auction, were "pretty nice" about the delay, Edwards added. "It was a long time in the making and we sort of pulled the rug out from under them with just a few days to go, but they understood."Sun blamed a bout of kidney stones for his decision to delay the lunch. However, reports of Tron employees being detained in China, plus a groveling public apology by Sun on Chinese social media, fueled conspiracies that the crypto boss was in trouble with the Chinese government for excessive self-promotion.NOW WATCH: Nxivm leader Keith Raniere has been convicted.

He was so dismayed by the state of the "fermenting sewer" that he wrote a letter to the Times urging a cleanup."If we neglect the subject, we cannot expect to do so with impunity; Nor should we be surprised if, in many years, a hot season gives us a taste of the madness of our carelessness," he wrote.Three years later, a heat wave hit London and Faraday's warning became a shocking reality. The Great Stink, as it became known, forced Parliament to pass a bill to restore the river. The task was tasked with Joseph Bazalgette, retaining walls were built along the Thames to enclose an extensive sewerage system.This remarkable feat of civic engineering should inspire us to face the Great Stenor of our times emanating from the open sewer that is the internet. For years, users have been throwing urinals of informational dirt into cyberspace without respecting public hygiene. No wonder the internet has become a political and social danger to health.Social media diseases infect societies everywhere. The persecution of the Rohingya population in Burma was fueled by online hate campaigns. Elections around the world, including those of the supposedly mature democracies of the US and the UK, were influenced by obvious digital manipulation. Trolling threatens many women policies and cyberbullying teen students has destroyed lives.Among the big challenges is dealing with this online dirt while preserving freedom of expression and the remarkable promise of our connected world. Who is going to build a sewer system for the digital age?Large tech companies late recognized the problem and finally seem to act seriously in trying to deal with this scourge. They have written smart algorithms and hired thousands of moderators to flag and remove offensive content.Twitter and Facebook shut down hundreds of accounts of Chinese trolls trying to provoke protesters in Hong Kong. Facebook is setting up a 40-person supervisory board to provide a new form of supranational governance, an initiative that has already sparked skepticism.In August, network provider Cloudfare terminated his contract with 8chan, a forum that displayed white supremacist propaganda, and denounced it as a "sewer of hate." Scientists are looking at ways to reshape social media and take the fangs away from the "online hate ecosystem."Politicians slowly figure out how to update free speech laws for the internet age. And smart journalists, such as Maria Ressa, executive director of Rappler's website in the Philippines, lead efforts to improve the credibility and influence of professional journalism.Most of these collective efforts are worthwhile and necessary, but they can never be enough. The scale of the challenge is colossal, as around 4.4 billion people are now connected to the internet. Every minute of the day, these users post 350,000 tweets and upload 300 hours of video to YouTube.We will never be able to stop those people who want to post fake or hateful content. But we can certainly go further to redesign the market to reward those who post socially valuable information and reduce people who promote viral misinformation.Dhruv Ghulati, an investment banker who became an entrepreneur, is one of those whotry to do that by changing the way the global online advertising market works worth $333 billion.The company that runs, Factmata, can quickly and algorithmically allocate a confidence score to millions of pieces of online content, depending on toxicity, objectivity, political bias, and so on. Its ultimate goal is to create a new metric for the advertising industry that includes content quality, not just virality.Advertisers currently primarily buy ads online based on CPMs, or the cost per thousand clicks or visits. But that kind of programmatic advertising hardly takes into account, or does not take into account, the nature of the content. The goal of Factmata is to introduce a quality component into this metric, creating a Q-CPM, a type of nutritional label for information."Fundamentally, there's a pricing problem," Ghulati says. "The value that society derives from a piece of information is different from the value that the market attributes to that same information. The market value is determined solely by its propensity to serve ads."The obstacles to creating such a metric are obvious and discouraging. Algorithmic determination of "quality" would also trigger endless controversy. But it's clear that advertisers need to take much more responsibility for where their ads appear and who they reward online.On its own, this would create a powerful engine for change.Fake accountsSocial media twitter and Facebook discovered and suspended what they describe as a network of fake accounts believed to have been operated by the Chinese government.DiscordBoth firms revealed their investigations into the coordinated information operation last Monday, which apparently intended to sow political discord around the protests taking place in Hong Kong.UndermineTwitter noted that 936 accounts created in China were discovered that sowed discord in Hong Kong in an attempt to undermine "the legitimacy and political positions of the movement."Manipulation"All accounts have been suspended for a series of violations of our platform manipulation policies," Twitter said on the blog.PreventionTwitter said these accounts were only the most active parts of this campaign and that a "larger network and spam" of approximately 200,000 that had been proactively suspended before they were substantially active.Load-Date: September 3, 2019End of Document

Ping An Energizes Smart Healthcare With Technology, Healthcare Ecosystem to Be a Future HighlightBusiness WireSeptember 16, 2019 Monday 9:56 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Business Wire, Inc.Length: 860 wordsDateline: SHENZHEN, China BodyNot long ago, the Chinese government launched an initiative to support Shenzhen in building a pioneering zone. It supports Shenzhen in building major innovation carriers such as 5G, AI, life information and biomedical laboratories, and exploring the establishment of international center for scientific and technical information and the academy of medical sciences.As a Shenzhen-based company, how does Ping An Group grasp these opportunities and use smart healthcare to truly benefit the people? Geoff Kau, co-president of Ping An Smart City and president of Ping An Health Technology, revealed the answer for us.Fundamental Technologies + Four Application Scenarios = Unique AdvantagesPing An ultimately benefits hundreds of millions of patients through supporting the construction of medical institutions. Kau explains that we use AI and cloud technologies to provide end-to-end solutions for pre-, mid-, and post-treatment in different level medical institutions.It is worth noting that the underlying technology platform that Ping An relies on involves the largest knowledge base in China, including drug library, risk factor library, disease library, treatment prescription library, and expert database of doctor and hospitals.The application is divided into four phases:First, disease prediction, which is dominated by 35 chronic diseases, includes some infectious diseases. Cooperate with Chongqing and Shenzhen to predict the incidence of influenza, hand, foot and mouth disease with the accuracy rate up to about 88%, and the accuracy rate of high incidence about 92%.Second, disease screening. For example, the data of the uploaded physical examination report is structured by OCR, then the customized prediction is realized through the risk model. Through three-dimensional retinal scanning, the image screening ophthalmic OCT can observe 17 focuses with the accuracy rate of above 97.6%, such as sugar net, glaucoma, cataract, and age-related macular.Third, the diagnosis and treatment engine. Doctor assistant AskBob is a smart assisted auxiliary diagnosis tool covering 1,800 diseases. For example, it can give the examination recommendations based on the electronic medical records; more than 29 million medical literature data can be structured, and intelligent comparisons can be made for cases to facilitate self-learning by doctors.Fourth, chronic disease management. The Ping An knowledge base has collected common problems concerned by more than 70 million patients and keep updating. The base engine of the Q&A is built by machine training, which achieves over 90% satisfaction. Ping An also has an automatic follow-up engine, such as timing calls for diabetics, supervising blood glucose measurement and insulin injection.At present, Ping An focuses on three types of diseases including cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases and endocrine diseases. Ping An hopes to perfect end-to-end capability building in these three areas in two to three years.Research Strength is the Core of Smart Healthcare DevelopmentAs a technical team, talents are the base of scientific research. Ping An Smart Healthcare currently owns more than 700 R&D personnel with 65% technicians, and established Institute of Medical Science and Technology with Tsinghua University. In the past two years, it has won six awards only in the field of medical imaging.Kau believes that there are many players in a single field in the market, but Ping An focuses on end-to-end solutions, integrating government public health departments, hospitals, and primary medical institutions. In addition, based on information technology, Ping An Smart City collects data with the intelligent brain as an entry point and benefits from the internal inspection and testing center, thus forming a synergized ecosystem.However, the concept of diagnosis and treatment relying on AI has not been fully accepted. Kau believes that user's mentality, their acceptance and regulatory policies are the key factors to promote the progress of the industry.Boxing Combinations to Fight a Good FightAs a pioneer, Shenzhen has hatched many of the world leading companies and technologies. In April this year, Ping An and Shenzhen Municipal Health Commission signed a strategic cooperation agreement. The company cooperates with the CDC to monitor the Shenzhen Health Index, conducts research cooperation with the Ophthalmology Medical Union, the Cancer Hospital and the Fuwai Hospital, helps more than 500 private medical institutions to build an integrated platform for service supervision in the pilot areas of Longhua District, and upgrades the e-health accounts of Shenzhen residents to let everyone have a virtual family doctor. In addition, Ping An also hopes to energize the Community Health Center through AskBob.Kau said that the company hopes to use boxing combinations rather than a single punch to exploit its advantages and drive medical and health industry development in Shenzhen. "In the future, we believe that the AI medical market will usher in a new round of integration."View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190916005383/en/CONTACT: Media:Zhengqi GaoPing An TechnologyGaozhengqi089@pingan.com.cn+86 21 38642313http://www.businesswire.comLoad-Date: September 17, 2019End of Document

The S&P 500 opened just 0.3% higher, and it quickly pushed to session highs amid news that the EU and UK are nearing a draft Brexit deal and that General Motors (GM 36.26, +0.76, +2.1%) and the UAW could also reach a deal soon.

"People familiar with the matter" told Bloomberg News that China may struggle fulfilling part of its agreement to purchase $50 billion of U.S. agricultural goods unless President Trump lifts retaliatory tariffs.U.S. Treasuries finished near their session lows, leaving yields slightly higher. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.77%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 98.31. WTI crude declined 1.4%, or $0.76, to $53.55/bbl.Tuesday's economic data was limited to the Empire State Manufacturing Survey for October, which increased to 4.0 (Briefing.com consensus -1.0) from 2.0.

Chacha debuts their fully automated intelligent production lines through their Transparency Factory Global Live Webcast campaign; 100,000+ viewers watch the website in the first five minutes of the launchPR NewswireSeptember 5, 2019 Thursday 11:42 PM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 592 wordsDateline: HEFEI, China, Sept. 5, 2019 BodyPR Newswire The Chacha Transparency Factory Global Live Webcast campaign was launched on September 4. Within five minutes of the launch, the event was viewed upwards of 100,000 times. Tens of thousands of posts from the viewing audience during the webcast demonstrating their support for Chacha and goods "Made in China" showed the degree to which the webcast went a long way in breaking down the information barrier between shoppers and the companies that make the products that they buy. The webcast was watched over one million times by the end of day one.Besides the early announcement of the event on Facebook and Instagram, Chacha also hosted the webcast live on the NASDAQ screen overlooking New York's Times Square, effectively realizing simultaneous, planet-wide distribution.Quality products are the result of the strictest of process control. During the course of the live webcast, the various stages of the production process could be viewed from 10 cameras positioned to heighten viewability and deliver real-time presentation of the sourcing area, production, packaging, sorting and other stages of the process. For the first time ever, the core production area was open to audiences worldwide.By way of the event, Chacha displayed its world leading advanced equipment production line to the public. The three-dimensional professional baking equipment jointly designed and produced by Chacha and Switzerland's Buhler is equipped with four-stage temperature control and a low temperature baking feature that brings out the crispy taste of the nuts, enhancing the fresh and natural quality of the final product. The intelligent nut granulator automatically distributes and controls the ratio and weight of each bag of nuts and their dried counterparts according to the recommendations of dietary experts in terms of nutritional equilibrium. The nitrogen-filled packaging system that assures a "powder-grade" level of preservation has been achieved for Chacha's Small Yellow Bags of daily nuts. The oxygen content in the product is controlled to not exceed 1%, ensuring the freshness and retention of the flavor through a triple guarantee of the absorption of the oxygen that is present, alongside a drying agent and nitrogen-filled packaging.With nine top-of-the-line manufacturing plants, certified by the FDA in the United States and BRC A in the EU, its "key techniques for storage and processing and quality preservation of dried nuts" has been awarded the Second Prize for National Scientific and Technological Progress by the State Council of China. The production plants have been named as one of the Pilot Demonstration Projects for Intelligent Manufacturing of Nuts by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China, and a Professional National Nut Processing Technology Research and Development Center by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of China.As the first nut brand to be included as a fundamental element of the Chinese government's program for improving the health of the country's population, Chacha's R&D department has been working on the technological aspects of production to incorporate the freshness concept into every stage of production, with the unremitting goal of constantly providing consumers with safe, fresh and tasty nut-based snacks. View original content to download multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chacha-debuts-their-fully-automated-intelligent-production-lines-through-their-transparency-factory-global-live-webcast-campaign-300913091.htmlSOURCE Chacha FoodCONTACT: Wang Tong, +86-131-3228-5862Load-Date: September 6, 2019End of Document

London Stock Exchange rejects Hong Kong takeover bidAssociated Press InternationalSeptember 13, 2019 Friday 3:43 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 368 wordsByline: By KELVIN CHAN, AP Business WriterDateline: LONDON BodyLONDON (AP) - The London Stock Exchange on Friday rejected an unsolicited takeover bid from its Hong Kong counterpart, citing "fundamental concerns" about the offer.The London Stock Exchange Group said strategic and regulatory problems were among the reasons it turned down the unexpected proposal by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd., which would have created a $70 billion company.One potential roadblock was concern in Britain about the possibility of the Chinese government influencing one of the symbols of global capitalism. At least half of Hong Kong Exchanges' board and the chairman are nominated by the city's government, whose leader is ultimately appointed by China's communist rulers.The cash-and-shares offer would have valued the London Stock Exchange Group at 29.6 billion pounds ($36.9 billion). It was conditional on the group scrapping a plan to buy financial data provider Refinitiv for $27 billion."Given the fundamental flaws in your proposal, we see no merit in further engagement," Chairman Don Robert said in a letter to Hong Kong Exchanges CEO Charles Li and Chairwoman Laura Cha.One flaw it cited was a lack of "strategic merit." Robert said it would be a "significant backward step" compared with the Refinitiv acquisition. Refinitiv's appeal is its data, viewed as a lucrative new business operation that would help the London exchange move on from being a simple trading platform.Hong Kong Exchanges said it was disappointed that the London Stock Exchange "declined to properly engage," adding it had hoped to show how its proposal was better than the Refinitiv deal.The London Stock Exchange, which also owns the Milan exchange and the Russell Indexes in the U.S, noted the risk of a drawn-out approval process by U.K., U.S. and European Union regulators scrutinizing the bid."There is no doubt that your unusual board structure and your relationship with the Hong Kong government will complicate matters," Robert wrote.The London exchange said it also turned down the offer because three quarters of it was in the form of shares and the proposal fell "substantially short of an appropriate valuation."Shares of the London Stock Exchange Group rose 2% in afternoon trading.Load-Date: September 14, 2019End of Document

Compared with the same period last year, the company's output of PV cells and components, the sales income of related PV products and the corresponding sales profit all increased.As one of the top 10 PV module manufacturers in China, Risen Energy has engaged in the research, development and production of solar crystal silicon cells and modules as well as the construction and operation of photovoltaic power stations for many years, accumulating a deep technical reserve and developing many core technologies. Through the technical reserve and accumulation of equipment, processes and materials relating to heterojunction (HJT), Risen Energy has mastered HJT manufacturing technology, and successfully developed high-efficiency HJT cell components.On August 19, Risen Energy held a groundbreaking ceremony for its 2.5GW high-efficiency HJT cell and module project in Ninghai, a county within the city of Ningbo in Zhejiang province. The project is expected to be completed in 2021 and will add sales revenue of 5 billion yuan (approx. US$700 million) once it commences full production. The company's HJT cells have a conversion efficiency exceeding 23% and include an integrated half-cut, imbricate, double-glass and high-reflectivity backsheet as part of the cell's construction. Through the application of high-efficiency bifacial HJT cell technology, Risen Energy's HJT components can generate electricity on both sides of the panel and provide investors with a 10-30% higher level of income from the power generated.  Besides the HJT cells, Risen Energy's R&D team has also successfully developed the second-generation half-cut technology of ultra-high light utilization and ultra-low power loss through the joint optimization of advanced battery passivation and high efficiency component packaging. After being tested by independent third-party testing and certification organization TUV SUD, the company's photoelectric conversion efficiency for its Jäger HP 72-cell sized modules reached 21%, and is among the highest across the sector. The maximum conversion efficiency for its MBB monocrystal cell has exceeded 23.00%, with an average efficiency reaching 22.73%. The company plans to achieve full mass production of MBB technology within this year.At the same time, rapid expansion into markets outside of China also provides important support for Risen Energy's profit growth. At present, the company's global business footprint has expanded to Europe and the United States, Southeast Asia, Oceania and Asia. In countries and regions bordering the route of the Chinese government's "Belt and Road Initiative", most notably, Kazakhstan and Ukraine, the company also achieved significant results.Risen Energy ranked second in shipments to the European market in the first half of 2019, accounting for more than 10% of China's shipments of solar equipment to the region. Besides Ukraine, the company's shipments ranked first to the Dominican Republic, accounting for more than 50% of modules shipped there, making it a leader in component exports to the Caribbean nation. View original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/risen-energy-releases-q3-report-net-profit-soars-237-34-300946124.htmlSOURCE Risen Energy Co., LtdCONTACT: Tina Feng, tina@risenenergy.com, +86-13736192549Load-Date: October 29, 2019End of Document

The S&P 500 (-0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.1%) and Nasdaq Composite (-0.3%) closed slightly lower, while the Russell 2000 (+0.1%) inched higher.The positive reaction to today's batch of earnings reports was limited to shares of companies that reported, namely Bank of America (BAC 30.18, +0.45, +1.5%), United Airlines (UAL 89.70, +1.82, +2.1%), and J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT 115.65, +4.05, +3.6%), as opposed to Tuesday's earnings-driven rally. Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors closed near their flat lines.The energy sector (-1.5%) was today's laggard despite an increase in oil prices ($53.42/bbl, +0.63, +1.2%), followed by the information technology sector (-0.7%) amid weakness in the software stocks. The consumer discretionary sector (+0.4%) outperformed despite an unexpected 0.3% m/m decline in retail sales for September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%).The relatively conservative spending did follow an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August, which presumably allayed an overreaction among sellers. Still, the headline figure could feed into the slowdown narrative for the U.S. economy, especially when uncertainty remains on the U.S.-China trade front.On Wednesday, China threatened unspecified countermeasures against the U.S. after the House of Representatives approved legislation to support pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. The Senate has yet to vote on the measures, but the situation could complicate the completion of the first phase of a trade deal with the U.S.In other potential deals, General Motors (GM 36.65, +0.39, +1.1%) and the UAW reached a tentative agreement that could end the monthlong strike at GM. McKesson (MCK 144.84, +6.67, +4.8%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.07, +1.17, +2.4%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 86.05, +2.85, +3.4%) began talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal.U.S. Treasuries finished the session on a higher note, leaving yields slightly lower. The 2-yr yield and the 10-yr yield both declined two basis points each to 1.59% and 1.75%, respectively. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.3% to 98.02.Reviewing Wednesday's batch of economic data, which featured Retail Sales for September:Total retail sales declined 0.3% month-over-month in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) following an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August. Excluding autos, retail sales declined 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.2% (from 0.0%) in August.The upward revisions for August cushioned some of the headline blow, yet the key takeaway from the report is that it highlights some relatively conservative consumer spending activity in September that will feed into the slowdown narrative building for the U.S. economy.Total business inventories were unchanged month-over-month in August (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after a downwardly revised 0.3% increase (from 0.4%) in July. Total business sales were up 0.2% following a downwardly revised 0.2% increase (from 0.3%) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that the gap between inventory growth on a yr/yr basis (+4.2%) and sales growth (+1.1%) remains, which should help keep prices in check.The NAHB Housing Market Index for October increased to 71 from 68 in September.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index ticked up 0.5% following a 5.4% increase in the prior week.Looking ahead, investors will receive Housing Starts and Building Permits for September, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for September, the Philadelphia Fed Index for October, and the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims on Thursday.Nasdaq Composite +22.4% YTDS&P 500 +19.3% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.8% YTDRussell 2000 +13.1% YTD16:13NFLX Netflix beats by $0.04, reports revs in-line with U.S. subs below guidance and international subs slightly above; guides Q4 subs, EPS and revs below consensus (286.28 +2.03)Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $1.09 per share excluding an unrealized gain from euro denominated bonds, $0.04 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.05; revenues rose 31.2% year/year to $5.25 bln vs the $5.25 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus. Total paid net adds of 6.8m increased 12% year over year and was an all-time Q3 record. Operating margin of 18.7% (up 670 bps year over year) was above guidance due to timing of content and marketing spend, which will be more weighted to Q4'19. In the US, paid net adds totaled 0.5m in Q3 vs. our 0.8m forecast, and year to date paid net adds are 2.1m vs. 4.1m in the first nine months of 2018. Since our US price increase earlier this year, retention has not yet fully returned on a sustained basis to pre-price-change levels, which has led to slower US membership growth. revenue growth has been accelerating as US ARPU increased 16.5% year over year in Q3. International paid net additions totaled 6.3m in Q3, a 23% increase vs. 5.1m in the year ago quarter, and slightly above our 6.2m guidance forecast. The US dollar strengthened vs. several key currencies over the course of the quarter, which resulted in the variance between our forecasted vs. actual international revenue. International ARPU, excluding the impact of F/X, rose 10% year over year. We're making strides in our key markets and, while we have much more work to do in Asia in the coming years, we are seeing encouraging signs of progress.Co issues downside guidance for Q4, sees EPS of $0.51 vs. $0.85 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; sees Q4 revs of $5.442 bln vs. $5.51 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.For Q4, we're expecting consolidated revenue to increase 30% year over year with 9% streaming ARPU growth. We're forecasting 7.6m global paid net adds (vs. 9.5 mln estimates and 8.8m last Q4), with 0.6m in the US and 7.0m for the international segment. This implies full year 2019 paid net adds of 26.7m, down from 28.6m last year. While we had previously expected 2019 paid net adds to be up year over year, our current forecast reflects several factors including less precision in our ability to forecast the impact of our Q4 content slate, which consists of several new big IP launches (as opposed to returning seasons), the minor elevated churn in response to some price changes, and new forthcoming competition. Our long term outlook on our business is unchanged. We're on track to achieve our full year 2019 operating margin goal of 13%. In 2020, we'll be targeting another 300 basis points in operating margin expansion, consistent with the annual margin improvement we've delivered each year since 2017. Competition: There may be some modest headwind to our near-term growth, and we have tried to factor that into our guidance. In the long-term, though, we expect we'll continue to grow nicely given the strength of our service and the large market opportunity. For the full year 2019, we're still expecting FCF of ~-$3.5 billion. With our quickly growing revenue base and expanding operating margins, we will be able to fund more of our content spending internally. As a result, we're expecting free cash flow to improve in 2020 vs. 2019 and we expect to continue to improve annually beyond 2020. Starting with our Q4'19 earnings report in January 2020, we plan to disclose revenue and membership by region16:12CRZO Carrizo Oil & Gas provides third quarter operational update; expects production volumes of 69,500-69,600 Boe/d (7.81 +0.14)Production volumes during the third quarter of 2019 are currently expected to be 69,500-69,600 Boe/d, an increase of approx. 6% from the second quarter.

The S&P 500 (-0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.1%) and Nasdaq Composite (-0.3%) closed slightly lower, while the Russell 2000 (+0.1%) inched higher.The positive reaction to today's batch of earnings reports was limited to shares of companies that reported, namely Bank of America (BAC 30.18, +0.45, +1.5%), United Airlines (UAL 89.70, +1.82, +2.1%), and J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT 115.65, +4.05, +3.6%), as opposed to Tuesday's earnings-driven rally. Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors closed near their flat lines.The energy sector (-1.5%) was today's laggard despite an increase in oil prices ($53.42/bbl, +0.63, +1.2%), followed by the information technology sector (-0.7%) amid weakness in the software stocks. The consumer discretionary sector (+0.4%) outperformed despite an unexpected 0.3% m/m decline in retail sales for September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%).The relatively conservative spending did follow an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August, which presumably allayed an overreaction among sellers. Still, the headline figure could feed into the slowdown narrative for the U.S. economy, especially when uncertainty remains on the U.S.-China trade front.On Wednesday, China threatened unspecified countermeasures against the U.S. after the House of Representatives approved legislation to support pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. The Senate has yet to vote on the measures, but the situation could complicate the completion of the first phase of a trade deal with the U.S.In other potential deals, General Motors (GM 36.65, +0.39, +1.1%) and the UAW reached a tentative agreement that could end the monthlong strike at GM. McKesson (MCK 144.84, +6.67, +4.8%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.07, +1.17, +2.4%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 86.05, +2.85, +3.4%) began talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal.U.S. Treasuries finished the session on a higher note, leaving yields slightly lower. The 2-yr yield and the 10-yr yield both declined two basis points each to 1.59% and 1.75%, respectively. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.3% to 98.02.Reviewing Wednesday's batch of economic data, which featured Retail Sales for September:Total retail sales declined 0.3% month-over-month in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) following an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August. Excluding autos, retail sales declined 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.2% (from 0.0%) in August.The upward revisions for August cushioned some of the headline blow, yet the key takeaway from the report is that it highlights some relatively conservative consumer spending activity in September that will feed into the slowdown narrative building for the U.S. economy.Total business inventories were unchanged month-over-month in August (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after a downwardly revised 0.3% increase (from 0.4%) in July. Total business sales were up 0.2% following a downwardly revised 0.2% increase (from 0.3%) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that the gap between inventory growth on a yr/yr basis (+4.2%) and sales growth (+1.1%) remains, which should help keep prices in check.The NAHB Housing Market Index for October increased to 71 from 68 in September.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index ticked up 0.5% following a 5.4% increase in the prior week.Looking ahead, investors will receive Housing Starts and Building Permits for September, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for September, the Philadelphia Fed Index for October, and the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims on Thursday.Nasdaq Composite +22.4% YTDS&P 500 +19.3% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.8% YTDRussell 2000 +13.1% YTD16:13NFLX Netflix beats by $0.04, reports revs in-line with U.S. subs below guidance and international subs slightly above; guides Q4 subs, EPS and revs below consensus (286.28 +2.03)Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $1.09 per share excluding an unrealized gain from euro denominated bonds, $0.04 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.05; revenues rose 31.2% year/year to $5.25 bln vs the $5.25 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus. Total paid net adds of 6.8m increased 12% year over year and was an all-time Q3 record. Operating margin of 18.7% (up 670 bps year over year) was above guidance due to timing of content and marketing spend, which will be more weighted to Q4'19. In the US, paid net adds totaled 0.5m in Q3 vs. our 0.8m forecast, and year to date paid net adds are 2.1m vs. 4.1m in the first nine months of 2018. Since our US price increase earlier this year, retention has not yet fully returned on a sustained basis to pre-price-change levels, which has led to slower US membership growth. revenue growth has been accelerating as US ARPU increased 16.5% year over year in Q3. International paid net additions totaled 6.3m in Q3, a 23% increase vs. 5.1m in the year ago quarter, and slightly above our 6.2m guidance forecast. The US dollar strengthened vs. several key currencies over the course of the quarter, which resulted in the variance between our forecasted vs. actual international revenue. International ARPU, excluding the impact of F/X, rose 10% year over year. We're making strides in our key markets and, while we have much more work to do in Asia in the coming years, we are seeing encouraging signs of progress.Co issues downside guidance for Q4, sees EPS of $0.51 vs. $0.85 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; sees Q4 revs of $5.442 bln vs. $5.51 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.For Q4, we're expecting consolidated revenue to increase 30% year over year with 9% streaming ARPU growth. We're forecasting 7.6m global paid net adds (vs. 9.5 mln estimates and 8.8m last Q4), with 0.6m in the US and 7.0m for the international segment. This implies full year 2019 paid net adds of 26.7m, down from 28.6m last year. While we had previously expected 2019 paid net adds to be up year over year, our current forecast reflects several factors including less precision in our ability to forecast the impact of our Q4 content slate, which consists of several new big IP launches (as opposed to returning seasons), the minor elevated churn in response to some price changes, and new forthcoming competition. Our long term outlook on our business is unchanged. We're on track to achieve our full year 2019 operating margin goal of 13%. In 2020, we'll be targeting another 300 basis points in operating margin expansion, consistent with the annual margin improvement we've delivered each year since 2017. Competition: There may be some modest headwind to our near-term growth, and we have tried to factor that into our guidance. In the long-term, though, we expect we'll continue to grow nicely given the strength of our service and the large market opportunity. For the full year 2019, we're still expecting FCF of ~-$3.5 billion. With our quickly growing revenue base and expanding operating margins, we will be able to fund more of our content spending internally. As a result, we're expecting free cash flow to improve in 2020 vs. 2019 and we expect to continue to improve annually beyond 2020. Starting with our Q4'19 earnings report in January 2020, we plan to disclose revenue and membership by region16:12CRZO Carrizo Oil & Gas provides third quarter operational update; expects production volumes of 69,500-69,600 Boe/d (7.81 +0.14)Production volumes during the third quarter of 2019 are currently expected to be 69,500-69,600 Boe/d, an increase of approx. 6% from the second quarter.

Adjusted EBITDA is currently estimated to be approximately 3 percent below budget, primarily due to the delay in Elba's in-service date, lower commodity prices and volumes impacting the CO2 segment, and the impact of 501-G settlements, partially offset by the strong performance of the West Region Natural Gas16:06CGNX Cognex acquires industrial machine vision software developer SUALAB (48.88 -0.26)SUALAB is a Korean-based developer of vision software using deep learning for industrial applications.

All Rights ReservedLength: 745 wordsBodyWASHINGTON, D.C., Oct. 30 -- The House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman issued the following statement:Representative Eliot L. Engel, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, delivered the following opening remarks today at a full committee markup of H.R. 2153, H.Res. 189, H.Res. 230, H.R. 1771, H.Res. 410, H.Res. 349, H.R.4754, S.178, H.Res. 585, H.R. 554, H.R. 2881, H.R. 3763, H.Res. 446, H.R. 1819, H.R. 4802, H.R. 4862, H.Res. 649, H.Res. 546:"I'm pleased to support all of the bipartisan measures before us today, and I thank our members for their hard work. I'll keep my remarks brief and highlight just a few of the 18 bills and resolutions."First, House Resolution 585 from Mr. Suozzi, which reaffirms Congress's support for the historic peace that the Good Friday Agreement brought to Ireland. This is an issue particularly close to my heart. I remember my first trip as a member of Congress in 1989, traveling to Ireland, traveling to Belfast during the dark days of the Troubles."The Good Friday Agreement-and the fulfillment of every obligation under that Agreement-is the only way to ensure that those times of violence and division never return. That's why I'm so alarmed by the current situation with Brexit, which could reintroduce a hard border between the North and the Republic - a dangerous prospect not only for the peace process, but for the economic stability of the island and for the rights of the border communities."With this resolution, Congress sends a clear signal to the U.K. and the E.U. that any Brexit deal must protect the Good Friday Agreement and all its components. I strongly support this good measure and I hope all members will join me in moving it forward."Next, I'll move on to two good measures that deal with 5G, a technology that has the potential to revolutionize so many sectors, from transportation to health care to entertainment. So, there will be massive economic benefits for those who can quickly take full advantage of the new technology."But it also comes with big risks. As people become more dependent on wireless communications and generate even more data about their lives, the adoption of 5G will bring national security, cybersecurity and privacy challenges."That's why there's such broad, bipartisan consensus that it's important to assert American leadership in 5G technology-to compete with China and others on the international stage and simultaneously to protect the networks of the United States and its allies from spying eyes and cyberattacks."We have two bills in front of us today that address the future of 5G in a meaningful way."First, we have Ms. Spanberger's Secure 5G and Beyond Act of 2019, an overarching bill that requires the Administration to develop a security strategy for 5G systems and infrastructure in the United States, to assist allies and partners to do the same, and to protect the competitiveness of US companies."And we have Ranking Member McCaul's Promoting United States International Leadership in 5G Act, which calls for a plan to promote US leadership at international standards-setting bodies for 5G."I'm pleased to support both of these measures that address this critical technology issue for the United States."I'd also like to highlight the Keeping Girls in School Act, authored by Ms. Frankel. When women and girls have access to education, they lift up entire communities, with better health outcomes, economic wellbeing, and security for everyone. This bill calls on USAID to address the barriers to keeping girls in school around the world. It's a strong measure I'm proud to support."Finally, I'll turn to Mr. Sherman's amendment in the nature of a substitute to Senator Rubio's Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act. Mr. Sherman's amendment - based on his UIGHUR Act-shows the Chinese government that Congress will not condone the horrific human rights abuses against the Uyghurs in Western China. It builds upon the good work of Mr. Smith, Mr. Suozzi, and our Senate colleagues by adding sanctions and export restrictions to make sure U.S. technology isn't being used by Beijing to oppress and mistreat China's ethnic and religious minorities."I strongly support all the measures we are considering today, and I urge all members to join me and do the same."Click play to view the video or follow this linkhttps://youtu.be/d3oXOlzhiGw For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at contentservices@htlive.comLoad-Date: October 31, 2019End of Document

Mr. Sherman's amendment - based on his UIGHUR Act--shows the Chinese government that Congress will not condone the horrific human rights abuses against the Uyghurs in Western China. It builds upon the good work of Mr. Smith, Mr. Suozzi, and our Senate colleagues by adding sanctions and export restrictions to make sure U.S. technology isn't being used by Beijing to oppress and mistreat China's ethnic and religious minorities."I strongly support all the measures we are considering today, and I urge all members to join me and do the same."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6909875 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: October 31, 2019End of Document

Analysts at CFRA have summarized their opinion as follows:We raise our 12-month target by $2 to $45, 15.3x our '20 EPS estimate and a slight discount to the three-year mean of 16.2x, but a premium to the five-year mean of 14.1x. Our EPS estimates are $2.67 for '19 (was $2.57) and $2.95 for '20 (was $3.26). HLF posts Q3 adj-EPS of $0.73 vs. $0.74, in line with consensus. HLF also announces that John Agwunobi, the current Co-President and Chief Health Officer, will become CEO in March '20. Sales came in stronger than expected due to an improvement in China compared to the first half of '19. HLF started to host more meetings and take on other strategic initiatives, such as its partnership with Tencent, to once again spur growth in this region. China's e-commerce market is the largest in the world, and with the Chinese government providing HLF with grants to encourage investments in China, we think HLF can soon bounce back to growth in this key market. The Mexico market was a little less encouraging, with volume now down 7% two quarters in a row.Load-Date: October 31, 2019End of Document

Helium Market - Growth, Trends, and Forecast (2019 - 2024)PR NewswireSeptember 11, 2019 Wednesday 8:05 AM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 766 wordsDateline: NEW YORK, Sept. 11, 2019 BodyPR NewswireMarket OverviewThe market for helium is expected to register a CAGR of 3.69% during the forecast period of 2019-2024. Major factors driving the market are the increasing consumption of helium in the electronics and semiconductor industry and the growing usage in healthcare system. However, the high cost of the extraction process and the stringent government regulations concerning helium use are likely to hinder the growth of the market studied.Read the full report:https://www.reportlinker.com/p05815059/?utm_source=PRN- Gas phase helium dominated the market in 2018, and it is also projected to register the highest CAGR during the forecast period.- Development of efficient storage and transport methods for gases is anticipated to provide numerous opportunities over the forecast period.- North America dominated the market with the largest consumption, followed by Asia-Pacific and Europe. However, Asia-Pacific is likely to register the highest CAGR through the forecast period.Key Market TrendsElectronics Industry to Drive the Market Growth- The electronics and semiconductor industry is a significant consumer of helium. Helium is used as the sleeve in rods that create LCD screens. It is also used as a protective gas for flushing vessels, during the processing of semiconductor chips, and as a cooling gas during the growth of silicon crystals.- Helium is also considered vital for the manufacturing of optic fiber cables, as the presence of helium in the atmosphere prevents bubble trapping inside the fiber cables. Hard drives are filled with helium, in order to achieve large amounts of disks and high data storage capacity.- Due to the increasing focus on the adoption of small size, the use of semiconductor chips or integrated circuits is increasing at a high rate, not only for the computers and smartphones but also for memory chips and image sensors.- The mass production of electronic devices in Taiwan, China, and India is responsible for the high demand for helium in the region. Moreover, the Chinese government is aiming to raise up to USD 31.5 billion, to invest in domestic chip companies, in order to build a world-class semiconductor industry, which is likely to further propel the growth of the helium market.North America to Dominate the MarketNorth America accounted for the largest share of the market, with the United States alone consuming a share of more than 33% of the global market (more than the entire Asia-Pacific region). The United States is the world's largest and most powerful economy. In terms of size, the electronics market in the United States is the largest market. Owing to the rapid pace of innovation in the advancement of technology and R&D activities in the electronics industry, there is a high demand for newer and faster electronic products. Owing to the usage of advance technology, the increasing number of R&D centers, and rising demand from consumers, the helium market is expected to grow over the forecast period. The United States expenditure in healthcare stood at USD 3.48 trillion in 2017, and is further expected to increase in 2018. The increasing geriatric population and the increasing requirement for medical facilities for the treatment of chronic diseases have been supporting the growth of the healthcare sector, as well as the consumption of helium in the country, over the forecast period.Competitive LandscapeThe helium market is highly consolidated, with the top four players accounting for approximately 85% of the total market. The major market players include Air Products and Chemicals Inc., Air Liquide, Linde plc (Praxair Technology Inc.), Taiyo Nippon Sanso Corporation, Iwatani Corporation, Messer Group, etc. With the merger of Linde AG and Praxair Technology Inc. closed in Oct 2018, the combined entity is a global industrial gas leader with a market capitalization of approximately USD 90 billion.Reasons to Purchase this report:- The market estimate (ME) sheet in Excel format- Report customization as per the client's requirements- 3 months of analyst supportRead the full report:https://www.reportlinker.com/p05815059/?utm_source=PRNAboutReportlinkerReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution.

Apple rejects crowdsourced map app used by Hong Kong protestersStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeOctober 7, 2019 MondayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: HI TECH; Pg. 1Length: 330 wordsByline: Sandy MccarthyBodyThe HKmap Live was basically an app package of a crowdsourced pin-dropper, like so many out there, for protest routes and locations, themes and police presence, so the developers argue that Apple could simply ban Waze on those grounds, too.This is the feedback the developers got from Apple, which they shared in a tweet.Many accused Apple of hypocrisy after HKMap relayed the rejection. "Our app is for info, and we do not encourage illegal activity", they said.According to market research firm App Annie, Amazon Prime Video was the No. 4 most popular entertainment app in the App Store for iPhones in the U.S.as of October 3, after TikTok, Netflix and Hulu - and Prime Video was the No. 1 app for iPads in the category.While Hong Kong's police chief defended the officer's actions, saying he acted in self-defense, the shooting drew criticism from U.S., British, and European officials.Naomi Osaka takes down Ashleigh Barty in China Open final - WTA TourCurrently, Andreescu is projected to jump to No. 4 in the rankings next week, while Osaka would fall to No. 6. Naomi Osaka battled back from behind to beat world number one Ashleigh Barty in the final of the China Open.Apple has not commented on this but this looks to be a mistake of some sort on the part of the App Store.Though the app has been removed from the App Store, anyone can still access the web-based version of HKmap Live here. It also noted that anything can be used for illegal purposes in the wrong hands and that the app is designed only to provide information.The app denial is raising speculation that Apple is complying to pressure from the Chinese government, which is notorious for using online censorship and propaganda to squash and discredit dissent.Kuma believes the issue is more about "bureaucracy rather than political stance", noting that Google finished reviewing the app in a day or two. "Maybe this really is Apple sucking up to China", she tweeted."It reports locations and does nothing else".Load-Date: October 7, 2019End of Document

The S&P 500 (-0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.1%) and Nasdaq Composite (-0.3%) closed slightly lower, while the Russell 2000 (+0.1%) inched higher.The positive reaction to today's batch of earnings reports was limited to shares of companies that reported, namely Bank of America (BAC 30.18, +0.45, +1.5%), United Airlines (UAL 89.70, +1.82, +2.1%), and J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT 115.65, +4.05, +3.6%), as opposed to Tuesday's earnings-driven rally. Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors closed near their flat lines.The energy sector (-1.5%) was today's laggard despite an increase in oil prices ($53.42/bbl, +0.63, +1.2%), followed by the information technology sector (-0.7%) amid weakness in the software stocks. The consumer discretionary sector (+0.4%) outperformed despite an unexpected 0.3% m/m decline in retail sales for September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%).The relatively conservative spending did follow an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August, which presumably allayed an overreaction among sellers. Still, the headline figure could feed into the slowdown narrative for the U.S. economy, especially when uncertainty remains on the U.S.-China trade front.On Wednesday, China threatened unspecified countermeasures against the U.S. after the House of Representatives approved legislation to support pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. The Senate has yet to vote on the measures, but the situation could complicate the completion of the first phase of a trade deal with the U.S.In other potential deals, General Motors (GM 36.65, +0.39, +1.1%) and the UAW reached a tentative agreement that could end the monthlong strike at GM. McKesson (MCK 144.84, +6.67, +4.8%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.07, +1.17, +2.4%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 86.05, +2.85, +3.4%) began talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal.U.S. Treasuries finished the session on a higher note, leaving yields slightly lower. The 2-yr yield and the 10-yr yield both declined two basis points each to 1.59% and 1.75%, respectively. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.3% to 98.02.Reviewing Wednesday's batch of economic data, which featured Retail Sales for September:Total retail sales declined 0.3% month-over-month in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) following an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August. Excluding autos, retail sales declined 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.2% (from 0.0%) in August.The upward revisions for August cushioned some of the headline blow, yet the key takeaway from the report is that it highlights some relatively conservative consumer spending activity in September that will feed into the slowdown narrative building for the U.S. economy.Total business inventories were unchanged month-over-month in August (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after a downwardly revised 0.3% increase (from 0.4%) in July. Total business sales were up 0.2% following a downwardly revised 0.2% increase (from 0.3%) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that the gap between inventory growth on a yr/yr basis (+4.2%) and sales growth (+1.1%) remains, which should help keep prices in check.The NAHB Housing Market Index for October increased to 71 from 68 in September.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index ticked up 0.5% following a 5.4% increase in the prior week.Looking ahead, investors will receive Housing Starts and Building Permits for September, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for September, the Philadelphia Fed Index for October, and the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims on Thursday.Nasdaq Composite +22.4% YTDS&P 500 +19.3% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.8% YTDRussell 2000 +13.1% YTD16:13NFLX Netflix beats by $0.04, reports revs in-line with U.S. subs below guidance and international subs slightly above; guides Q4 subs, EPS and revs below consensus (286.28 +2.03)Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $1.09 per share excluding an unrealized gain from euro denominated bonds, $0.04 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.05; revenues rose 31.2% year/year to $5.25 bln vs the $5.25 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus. Total paid net adds of 6.8m increased 12% year over year and was an all-time Q3 record. Operating margin of 18.7% (up 670 bps year over year) was above guidance due to timing of content and marketing spend, which will be more weighted to Q4'19. In the US, paid net adds totaled 0.5m in Q3 vs. our 0.8m forecast, and year to date paid net adds are 2.1m vs. 4.1m in the first nine months of 2018. Since our US price increase earlier this year, retention has not yet fully returned on a sustained basis to pre-price-change levels, which has led to slower US membership growth. revenue growth has been accelerating as US ARPU increased 16.5% year over year in Q3. International paid net additions totaled 6.3m in Q3, a 23% increase vs. 5.1m in the year ago quarter, and slightly above our 6.2m guidance forecast. The US dollar strengthened vs. several key currencies over the course of the quarter, which resulted in the variance between our forecasted vs. actual international revenue. International ARPU, excluding the impact of F/X, rose 10% year over year. We're making strides in our key markets and, while we have much more work to do in Asia in the coming years, we are seeing encouraging signs of progress.Co issues downside guidance for Q4, sees EPS of $0.51 vs. $0.85 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; sees Q4 revs of $5.442 bln vs. $5.51 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.For Q4, we're expecting consolidated revenue to increase 30% year over year with 9% streaming ARPU growth. We're forecasting 7.6m global paid net adds (vs. 9.5 mln estimates and 8.8m last Q4), with 0.6m in the US and 7.0m for the international segment. This implies full year 2019 paid net adds of 26.7m, down from 28.6m last year. While we had previously expected 2019 paid net adds to be up year over year, our current forecast reflects several factors including less precision in our ability to forecast the impact of our Q4 content slate, which consists of several new big IP launches (as opposed to returning seasons), the minor elevated churn in response to some price changes, and new forthcoming competition. Our long term outlook on our business is unchanged. We're on track to achieve our full year 2019 operating margin goal of 13%. In 2020, we'll be targeting another 300 basis points in operating margin expansion, consistent with the annual margin improvement we've delivered each year since 2017. Competition: There may be some modest headwind to our near-term growth, and we have tried to factor that into our guidance. In the long-term, though, we expect we'll continue to grow nicely given the strength of our service and the large market opportunity. For the full year 2019, we're still expecting FCF of ~-$3.5 billion. With our quickly growing revenue base and expanding operating margins, we will be able to fund more of our content spending internally. As a result, we're expecting free cash flow to improve in 2020 vs. 2019 and we expect to continue to improve annually beyond 2020. Starting with our Q4'19 earnings report in January 2020, we plan to disclose revenue and membership by region16:12CRZO Carrizo Oil & Gas provides third quarter operational update; expects production volumes of 69,500-69,600 Boe/d (7.81 +0.14)Production volumes during the third quarter of 2019 are currently expected to be 69,500-69,600 Boe/d, an increase of approx. 6% from the second quarter.

S&P Futures are back above that critical 3000 level and currently trading around the 3004 area. This is just off the session high of 3006.50 and left the overnight low sitting at 2985.25.In Asia, both the Nikkei and Shanghai closed fractionally lower on the day. The Shanghai opened higher but could not manage to maintain gains despite reports that the Chinese government is mulling loosening restrictions from foreign investors. The Nikkei was led lower by tech stocks. Tokyo Electron fell 9% after chip peer ASML saw weakness following earnings on Wednesday. In Europe, the major bourses are witnessing a mixed tape with the FTSE outpacing the region. The status of Brexit talks remain the key focus. The British Pound has seen a volatile session and up nearly 1%. This has not weighed on the FTSE, however. Outside of the UK, the markets have seen more of a cautious environment. Automakers are notably stronger with Daimler and BMW both showing gains of greater than 0.5%.Market UpdatesS&P Futures vs Fair Value: +14.010 yr Note: 1.79%USD/JPY: 108.90 +0.13EUR/USD: 1.1117 +0.0045Europe: FTSE +0.6% DAX +0.3% CAC -0.1%Asia: Hang Seng +0.7% Shanghai -0.1% Nikkei -0.1%Gold (1488.90 -5.10) Silver (17.44 +0.01) Crude (53.18 -0.18)17:49EGO Eldorado Gold reports preliminary Q3 results; production guidance for 2019 remains unchanged (7.39 +0.16)Total gold production was 101,596 ounces for the third quarter and 276,376 ounces year-to-date. Guidance for 2019 remains unchanged. Recent test results from Kisladag confirm that recoveries from leaching deeper material over 250-day cycles support an extension of mine life beyond the company's current three-year guidance. Waste stripping to support a mine life extension will commence prior to the end of October. Test work is still ongoing to determine the ultimate heap leach recovery of this material and thus the ultimate length of the mine life extension. Waste stripping over the remainder of 2019 is expected to minimize production interruptions in 2020 and beyond. Estimated expenditure for waste stripping in 2019 is $4 mln. Production at Olympias was lower than plan. During the third quarter, measures to increase production volumes were continued in key areas of the operation and will support the ramp up towards 2020 and beyond.

The S&P 500 (-0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.1%) and Nasdaq Composite (-0.3%) closed slightly lower, while the Russell 2000 (+0.1%) inched higher.The positive reaction to today's batch of earnings reports was limited to shares of companies that reported, namely Bank of America (BAC 30.18, +0.45, +1.5%), United Airlines (UAL 89.70, +1.82, +2.1%), and J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT 115.65, +4.05, +3.6%), as opposed to Tuesday's earnings-driven rally. Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors closed near their flat lines.The energy sector (-1.5%) was today's laggard despite an increase in oil prices ($53.42/bbl, +0.63, +1.2%), followed by the information technology sector (-0.7%) amid weakness in the software stocks. The consumer discretionary sector (+0.4%) outperformed despite an unexpected 0.3% m/m decline in retail sales for September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%).The relatively conservative spending did follow an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August, which presumably allayed an overreaction among sellers. Still, the headline figure could feed into the slowdown narrative for the U.S. economy, especially when uncertainty remains on the U.S.-China trade front.On Wednesday, China threatened unspecified countermeasures against the U.S. after the House of Representatives approved legislation to support pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. The Senate has yet to vote on the measures, but the situation could complicate the completion of the first phase of a trade deal with the U.S.In other potential deals, General Motors (GM 36.65, +0.39, +1.1%) and the UAW reached a tentative agreement that could end the monthlong strike at GM. McKesson (MCK 144.84, +6.67, +4.8%), Cardinal Health (CAH 49.07, +1.17, +2.4%) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC 86.05, +2.85, +3.4%) began talks to settle opioid litigation for $18 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal.U.S. Treasuries finished the session on a higher note, leaving yields slightly lower. The 2-yr yield and the 10-yr yield both declined two basis points each to 1.59% and 1.75%, respectively. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.3% to 98.02.Reviewing Wednesday's batch of economic data, which featured Retail Sales for September:Total retail sales declined 0.3% month-over-month in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) following an upwardly revised 0.6% increase (from +0.4%) in August. Excluding autos, retail sales declined 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.2% (from 0.0%) in August.The upward revisions for August cushioned some of the headline blow, yet the key takeaway from the report is that it highlights some relatively conservative consumer spending activity in September that will feed into the slowdown narrative building for the U.S. economy.Total business inventories were unchanged month-over-month in August (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after a downwardly revised 0.3% increase (from 0.4%) in July. Total business sales were up 0.2% following a downwardly revised 0.2% increase (from 0.3%) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that the gap between inventory growth on a yr/yr basis (+4.2%) and sales growth (+1.1%) remains, which should help keep prices in check.The NAHB Housing Market Index for October increased to 71 from 68 in September.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index ticked up 0.5% following a 5.4% increase in the prior week.Looking ahead, investors will receive Housing Starts and Building Permits for September, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for September, the Philadelphia Fed Index for October, and the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims on Thursday.Nasdaq Composite +22.4% YTDS&P 500 +19.3% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +15.8% YTDRussell 2000 +13.1% YTD16:13NFLX Netflix beats by $0.04, reports revs in-line with U.S. subs below guidance and international subs slightly above; guides Q4 subs, EPS and revs below consensus (286.28 +2.03)Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $1.09 per share excluding an unrealized gain from euro denominated bonds, $0.04 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.05; revenues rose 31.2% year/year to $5.25 bln vs the $5.25 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus. Total paid net adds of 6.8m increased 12% year over year and was an all-time Q3 record. Operating margin of 18.7% (up 670 bps year over year) was above guidance due to timing of content and marketing spend, which will be more weighted to Q4'19. In the US, paid net adds totaled 0.5m in Q3 vs. our 0.8m forecast, and year to date paid net adds are 2.1m vs. 4.1m in the first nine months of 2018. Since our US price increase earlier this year, retention has not yet fully returned on a sustained basis to pre-price-change levels, which has led to slower US membership growth. revenue growth has been accelerating as US ARPU increased 16.5% year over year in Q3. International paid net additions totaled 6.3m in Q3, a 23% increase vs. 5.1m in the year ago quarter, and slightly above our 6.2m guidance forecast. The US dollar strengthened vs. several key currencies over the course of the quarter, which resulted in the variance between our forecasted vs. actual international revenue. International ARPU, excluding the impact of F/X, rose 10% year over year. We're making strides in our key markets and, while we have much more work to do in Asia in the coming years, we are seeing encouraging signs of progress.Co issues downside guidance for Q4, sees EPS of $0.51 vs. $0.85 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; sees Q4 revs of $5.442 bln vs. $5.51 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.For Q4, we're expecting consolidated revenue to increase 30% year over year with 9% streaming ARPU growth. We're forecasting 7.6m global paid net adds (vs. 9.5 mln estimates and 8.8m last Q4), with 0.6m in the US and 7.0m for the international segment. This implies full year 2019 paid net adds of 26.7m, down from 28.6m last year. While we had previously expected 2019 paid net adds to be up year over year, our current forecast reflects several factors including less precision in our ability to forecast the impact of our Q4 content slate, which consists of several new big IP launches (as opposed to returning seasons), the minor elevated churn in response to some price changes, and new forthcoming competition. Our long term outlook on our business is unchanged. We're on track to achieve our full year 2019 operating margin goal of 13%. In 2020, we'll be targeting another 300 basis points in operating margin expansion, consistent with the annual margin improvement we've delivered each year since 2017. Competition: There may be some modest headwind to our near-term growth, and we have tried to factor that into our guidance. In the long-term, though, we expect we'll continue to grow nicely given the strength of our service and the large market opportunity. For the full year 2019, we're still expecting FCF of ~-$3.5 billion. With our quickly growing revenue base and expanding operating margins, we will be able to fund more of our content spending internally. As a result, we're expecting free cash flow to improve in 2020 vs. 2019 and we expect to continue to improve annually beyond 2020. Starting with our Q4'19 earnings report in January 2020, we plan to disclose revenue and membership by region16:12CRZO Carrizo Oil & Gas provides third quarter operational update; expects production volumes of 69,500-69,600 Boe/d (7.81 +0.14)Production volumes during the third quarter of 2019 are currently expected to be 69,500-69,600 Boe/d, an increase of approx. 6% from the second quarter.

India is trying to build the world's biggest facial recognition systemCNN WireOctober 17, 2019 Thursday 11:54 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1835 wordsByline: By Julie Zaugg, CNN BusinessDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  In July, Bhuwan Ribhu received some very good news. The child labor activist, who works for Indian NGO Bachpan Bachao Andolan, had launched a pilot program 15 months prior to match a police database containing photos of all of India's missing children with another one comprising shots of all the minors living in the country's child care institutions.He had just found out the results. "We were able to match 10,561 missing children with those living in institutions," he told CNN. "They are currently in the process of being reunited with their families." Most of them were victims of trafficking, forced to work in the fields, in garment factories or in brothels, according to Ribhu.This momentous undertaking was made possible by facial recognition technology provided by New Delhi's police. "There are over 300,000 missing children in India and over 100,000 living in institutions," he explained. "We couldn't possibly have matched them all manually."Locating thousands of missing children is just one of the challenges faced by India's overstretched police force in a nation of 1.37 billion people.India has just 144 police officers for every 100,000 citizens, compared to 318 per 100,000 citizens in the European Union. In recent years, authorities have turned to facial recognition technology to make up for the shortfall.New Delhi's law enforcement agencies adopted the technology in 2018, and it's also being used to police large events and fight crime in a handful of other states, including Andhra Pradesh and Punjab.But India's government now has a much more ambitious plan. It wants to construct one of the world's largest facial recognition systems. The project envisions a future in which police from across the country's 29 states and seven union territories would have access to a single, centralized database.National databaseThe daunting scope of the proposed network is laid out in a detailed 172-page document published by the National Crime Records Bureau, which requests bids from companies to build the project. Interested parties had until October 11 to submit their proposal.Currently unnamed, the project would match images from the country's growing network of CCTV cameras against a database encompassing mug shots of criminals, passport photos and images collected by agencies such as the Ministry of Women and Child Development.The platform would also enable searches based on photos uploaded from newspapers, images sent in by the public or artist sketches of suspected criminals. It would also recognize faces on closed-circuit cameras and "generate alerts if a blacklist match is found," according to the tender document.Security forces would be equipped with hand-held mobile devices enabling them to capture a face in the field and search it instantly against the national database, through a dedicated app.The new facial recognition platform "can play a very vital role in improving outcomes" when it comes to identifying criminals, missing persons and bodies, according to the document published by the National Crime Records Bureau. It will also help police forces "detect crime patterns" and aid in crime prevention, it adds.India's crime rate is high, particularly within the poor areas dotting urban centers. In 2016, there were 709.1 offenses per 100,000 people in 19 big cities, compared to the national average of 379.3, according to the most recent official figures. A foreign companyIt is not known how many companies have submitted bids to install India's national facial recognition system, nor how long the government will take to consider their applications.About 80 representatives of vendors took part in a pre-bid meeting, which took place in the National Crime Records Bureau's Delhi office at the end of July, according to minutes of the meeting seen by CNN. They discussed how the national database would be integrated with local police platforms and whether it should be able to identify people who have had plastic surgery."To be eligible to bid, a company has to have completed at least three facial recognition projects globally," explains Apar Gupta of the Internet Freedom Foundation, an NGO which has put forward a legal notice to cancel the call for bids. "This disqualifies most Indian companies."The successful bidder will most likely be a consortium made up of a foreign company and a local partner --- another requirement featured is for at least one of the bidding parties to be based in India. IBM, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and Accenture have all shown interest, according to Sivarama Krishnan, who leads cybersecurity at PricewaterhouseCoopers India. CNN reached out to all three companies, but none of them were willing to comment.Having a foreign company set up such a critical part of India's security apparatus could raise "national security issues," worries Gupta.In 2018, a controversy erupted when Ajay Maken, an opposition politician in New Delhi, accused the local government of having awarded a contract, through an Indian company, to provide nearly half of the CCTV cameras it plans to install in the capital to Prama Hikvision, a joint venture between Chinese company Hikvision and Indian company Prama Technologies, citing the risk for espionage.Ashish P. Dhakan, Prama Hikvision's CEO, confirmed that the company was supplying more than 140,000 CCTV cameras to New Delhi and has started installing them earlier this year. "There is no evidence anywhere in the world, including India, to indicate that Hikvision's products are used for unauthorized collection of information," he told CNN. Hikvision has never conducted, nor will it conduct, any espionage-related activities for any government in the world."It is not the company's only project in India. In 2018, Hikvision completed a network of surveillance cameras and command and control centers in Deesa City, Gujarat, according to a press release. In early October, it inaugurated India's largest CCTV factory near Mumbai, with more than 2,000 employees. It describes itself a "market leader" in India for video surveillance solutions.Hikvision has come under increasing scrutiny in the United States. In early October, it was included on a blacklist of 28 Chinese companies and government offices essentially barred from buying US products or importing American technology over their alleged role in facilitating human rights abuses in China's Xinjiang region.'Technologically challenging'Experts doubt whether India can carry off such an ambitious project in such a short time. The system is expected to go live less than eight months after the contract is signed, according to the call for bids."A more realistic time frame would be 12 to 18 months," says Krishnan, who describes the project as "technologically challenging."Creating the centralized platform will not be the hardest part. "India already has a national database with photos of all the criminals prosecuted in the country, which is regularly updated by law enforcement agencies in the states," he explains. "It will just need to be linked up to the country's CCTV system." A pilot project carried out in New Delhi proved this was feasible, Krishnan says.Blanketing the country with enough surveillance cameras --- especially advanced ones equipped with facial recognition technology --- will be a much bigger challenge, he believes. India lags behind other countries in terms of installed security cameras. New Delhi has 10 CCTV cameras per 1,000 people, compared with 113 in Shanghai and 68 in London, according to data compiled by consumer website Comparitech. The figure is far lower in India's rural areas, home to 66% of the country's population."Many villages in the countryside don't have a single surveillance camera," says Krishnan.But the country is catching up fast. New Delhi is about to have 330,000 new cameras installed, said the deputy chief minister of the capital, Manish Sisodia, in July as he kickstarted the process. The project has been touted as a way to improve women's safety in India's largest city, which in recent years has been the site of a number of high profile sexual attacks.Facial recognition cameras were recently introduced in Bangalore airport and are being trialed in Hyderabad airport, according to Reuters. New Delhi airport also recently started using the technology to speed up security checks. "A dozen of India's largest cities are now pretty extensively covered, and 24 more are in the process of expanding their CCTV capabilities," says Krishnan. He adds that most railway stations are now also equipped with surveillance cameras, and the government plans to have them all covered by 2021. "This is meaningful in India: most citizens will at some point in their life walk through a railway station," he said.No legal safeguardsFor privacy advocates, this is worrying. "India does not have a data protection law," says Gupta. "It is also not planning to adopt a specific legal framework for the new facial recognition system, which means it will essentially be devoid of safeguards."He worries India's facial recognition system could become a tool of social policing, used to punish petty offenses such as public littering or to control the whereabouts of ethnic minorities.Further down the line, it might even be linked up to Aadhaar, India's vast biometric database, which contains the personal details of 1.2 billion Indian citizens, enabling India to set up "a total, permanent surveillance state," he adds.CNN reached out to the National Crime Records Bureau but did not receive a response.India has a history of privacy issues. In 2017, India's Supreme Court issued a landmark ruling, decreeing that a right to privacy is part of the fundamental rights enshrined in the country's constitution. The ruling paved the way for the draft Personal Data Protection Bill, which was presented to government last year but hasn't been introduced to Parliament yet. Rights activists had argued that fingerprints and retinal scans collected under Aadhaar violated an individual's right to privacy. Their fears about an invasion of privacy appeared to be confirmed in early 2018 when Aadhaar suffered an alleged breach after reporters said they were able to buy access to citizens' personal details for as little as $8. Seeking to temper criticism of its prized new program, the government added new security measures. Later that year, in a separate ruling, the Supreme Court found the database did not violate the right to privacy.The court did, however, introduce new restrictions on how Aadhaar information could be used, including measures preventing corporate bodies from demanding data.Caught between the need to improve its policing outcomes and to protect its citizen's privacy, India will be walking a tightrope when it comes to building its national facial recognition database.CNN's Manveena Suri and Swati Gupta contributed to this report.TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Activists Push Regulatory, Geopolitical Boundaries for Tie-UpsThe Deal PipelineSeptember 20, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 The Deal, L.L.C. All Rights ReservedLength: 867 wordsByline: by Ronald OrolBodyActivist investor Elliott Management Corp.  https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/19/att-stephenson-not-focused-on-directv-sale-despite-elliott-pressure.html|reportedly believes that a combination of AT&T Inc. s (T) DirecTV and the Dish Network Corp. (DISH) can be approved in today s regulatory environment.If so, it would be the latest example of an insurgent fund manager agitating for blockbuster deals that push the envelope on what can be approved by antitrust regulators in Washington. In other situations, insurgent investors have interjected themselves into mergers that become ensnared in U.S.-China trade negotiations. The Wall Street Journal reported on Sept. 18 that AT&T was exploring ways to divest DirecTV. However, CNBC on Sept. 19 https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/19/att-stephenson-not-focused-on-directv-sale-despite-elliott-pressure.html|reported that, in fact, the communications giant is not focused on selling the pay-TV unit. The CNBC item cited sources noting that Elliott Management is pushing for a divestiture or sale of DirecTV and that the activist fund believes that a Dish-DirecTV merger can get done in today s regulatory environment. Elliott did not return a request for comment.Elliott has suggested that DirecTV and other large assets of the Dallas, telecom giant should be considered for divestment. The fund suggested that it was possible that DirecTV may not have a clear strategic rational for being part of AT&T. Even so, a push to combine DirecTV and Dish could raise clear regulatory issues. AT&T is well aware of them. On Sept. 11, AT&T CFO John Stephens pointed out that a combination of DirecTV-Dish has been  tried from a regulatory perspective  and  hasn t been successful.  In 2002 federal regulators stopped a combination of the businesses. He added that,  I don't know that there's any change in that regulatory perspective, so, I would suggest to you we'd rather focus on the business than focus on regulatory process and approvals.  A combination could raise the ire of antitrust regulators in Washington at a time when state and federal policymakers appear particularly concerned about too much consolidation in the media and communications industry, he notedEven so, activists often seek to push for deals that ultimately end up entangled in a regulatory morass   many of which are ultimately blocked by regulatory agencies. Last year, Starboard Value LP called off a proxy fight at title insurer Stewart Information Services after rival Fidelity National Financial Inc (FNF) agreed to acquire it for $1.2 billion. The same month Starboard liquidated its 10% stake. In September, the title insurers https://pipeline.thedeal.com/article/20001138/index.dl|canceled their merger after the Federal Trade Commission said it would block the deal on antitrust grounds.In 2015, Starboard campaigned to drive a combination of office supply chains Staples and Office Depot, which was later challenged by the FTC and ultimately blocked by a judge. Activists often get involved in driving deals that ultimately face complex cross-border issues. One wonders what will happen to Nvidia Corp. s (NVDA) $125 a share deal to buy Starboard-target Mellanox Technologies Ltd. (MLNX).The activist fund liquidated its position in Mellanox shortly after that transaction was announced in March, but no deal has been consummated and the target s share price has been drifting down   trading recently at $113 a share   over concerns about whether China will approve the deal as the two countries negotiate on trade.David A. Katz, partner at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz in New York argues that if an activist is going to push for a transaction that has having significant antitrust, national security or financing closing risks, "you would think they should be required to hold their shares through the closing of the transaction.  He added that if they aren't willing to keep the stock until closing, then their views should be given less weight. "By selling after the deal announcement and before closing, they have a different risk profile than the other shareholders, and if the transaction fails, the company is damaged but they are long gone," he said. Activists often get involved in existing deals that are later unwound. Recently, Elliott Management pushed Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) to increase the amount it was willing to pay to buy NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI).However, that deal was never consummated   in July 2018 Qualcomm terminated the acquisition, after waiting almost 21 months in hopes of winning the Chinese government s regulatory approval.In late 2014, after Halliburton Co. (HAL) announced it was seeking to acquire Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI) in a blockbuster $35 billion deal. Activist investor ValueAct Capital Partners LP bought significant minority stakes in both companies and agitated for the transaction to be consummated. However, the merger was called off after the Justice Department filed a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in Delaware https://pipeline.thedeal.com/article/13563662/index.dl|seeking to block the merger. For more coverage like this http://thedeal.com/preferencesform|sign up for the Activist Daily.DEAL SIZE$ 50 Billion and UpLoad-Date: September 24, 2019End of Document

Alert for massive hacking not only on iPhone: Android and Windows devices were also affectedCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 3, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 726 wordsBody       According to information from Forbes magazine, attack came from China, specifically from the Xinjiang region. (Photo: Special)A few days ago, researchers at Google's Project Zeroreported that iPhone users had been exposed to massive hacks upon entering various websites. More information on this case revealed that Google'sWindows,from Microsoft and Android,were also victims of this computer attack.According to a forbes magazine publication, the malicious code embedded in the websites similarly affected the most popular systems on mobile devices and on computers for a couple of years, as was the case in the case of the  iOS operating system.From the magazine they reported that the cyber offensive comes from China, especially from the Xinjiangregion, where the Uighur ethnic grouplives, which has been under the watch of the Chinese government for some time.It should be said that this community has been the target of other types of attacks and forms of surveillance. In the area where they dwell, for example, there are a lot of surveillance cameras and facial recognition is a constant.Like iPhones, Android and Windows devices had been affected for a couple of years. (Photo: Reuters)Cooper Quintin, senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, in an interview with Forbes mentioned that it was "likely that the attacks were aimed at spying on the Uighur population both in and outside of it, as well as like people who sympathize and may want to help Uighurs in their struggle for independence."Regarding malware, it was reported, was used to spy,even, visitors from the region and it is because of that reason that the websites equally affected users of iOS, Android and Windowssystems.According to another of the sources cited by Forbes, the attacks were updated to different operating systems as the Uighur community changed the use of its technology.One relevant point about the note the magazine published is that the information was released through an interview where the source asked for anonymity,so it is not known whether the revelation comes from Project Zero.The information was revealed to the magazine by an anthymized source. (Photo:File)"In the release of the report, Google was very specific in mentioning that the attacks exploited iPhone-exclusive vulnerabilities,but they haven't revealed similar information to us," a Microsoft spokesman said.The same source then added that Microsoft has a strong commitment to investigating reported security issues and, "if new information is disclosed, we will take appropriate action as needed to help keep customers protected."What's known about the iPhone caseAccording to Motherboard, Vice's technology division, this could be one of the biggest attacks against users of Applesmartphones, since in addition to the number of people affected, it is important information that was accessed, because from the malware you could spy on whatsApp, iMessage or Telegram conversations.Another important point about this attack was the wide field of action,because according to the specialists, this type of offensives are usually more specific and are carried out through individual links. In this case, the experts mentioned that the compromised sites recorded thousands of visits each week.Vulnerabilities mainly affected instant messaging applications. (Photo:Twitter)Ian Beer,security researcher at Project Zero,explained that "just visiting the hacked site was enough for the server to infect the device and, if the offense was successful, an implant was installed monitoring" through which information was taken out.Since February,the Google team mentioned contacting Apple workers to report on these vulnerabilities by which Cupertino's company, Califronia got only seven days for fix the error when the normal period for such matters is 90 days,reflecting the seriousness of the matter.Apple reported that the frailties had been patched in iOS Update 12.1.4,but no source has named specific sites where malicious code was used to attack users.In the publication of the Project Zero report reporting on Apple's vulnerabilities, Ian Beer felt that hidden bugs were still likely to exist and there was more to be discovered: "For this campaign we've seen, it's almost certain that there are others that have not yet been identified and are currently in action."Load-Date: September 4, 2019End of Document

Skyworth Group H1 net profit grows nearly 20%, gross profit margin increases to 19.7%PR NewswireSeptember 1, 2019 Sunday 11:25 PM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 429 wordsDateline: SHENZHEN, China, Sept. 1, 2019 BodyPR NewswireSkyworth Group (00751.HK) released its 2019 interim results after-hours on August 27. The group booked turnover of 17.23 billion yuan (approx. US$2.4 billion) for the period, with gross profit margin increasing to 19.7% from 17.3% a year earlier. Profit before tax and net profit stood at 562 million yuan (approx. US$78.6 million) and 348 million yuan (approx. US$48.6 million) for the six months, up 46% and 20.4% year on year, respectively.During the period, the company invested 908 million yuan (approx. US$127 million) in the R&D of several high-quality smart products in a move to enhance competitiveness, up significantly by 20.6%. The company's financial position was further optimized, with book value of capital rising to 4.265 billion yuan (approx. US$596 million) as of June 30, 2019, a significant improvement of 28.7% from December 31, 2018.In the first half, Skyworth Group continued to implement its transformation strategy: in the multimedia side of the business, Internet content revenue surged 39.3% from the same period last year, with activated smart TV users exceeding 38 million and the daily average number of active users reaching 13.85 million. The company aggressively leveraged its first-mover advantages by adjusting the color TV product portfolio and the customer database structure, accelerating the market penetration of OLED TV, and enhancing market share by rolling out high-end products to consolidate its position across the industry.Driven by smart system technologies, the digital set-top boxes business grew, while smart home, IoT and security engineering segments were launched, opening up new growth paths.Following the adoption of a strategy focused on the high end of the consumer electronics sector, the firm's smart electronics business received a general upgrade in terms of market positioning, brand, scale and price. The sales channels portfolio was further optimized, providing coverage across all sales channels from large chain home appliance stores to e-commerce sites and traditional shops in China's smaller towns and cities, giving a boost to the rise in both turnover and sales volume.With technical, market and brand advantages, Skyworth is expected to fully benefit from actions undertaken by Chinese government at the beginning of the year to speed up the development of a nationwide 4K/8K UHD video industry. View original content to download multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/skyworth-group-h1-net-profit-grows-nearly-20-gross-profit-margin-increases-to-19-7-300910120.htmlSOURCE SkyworthCONTACT: Liang Zhenxong, +86-139-2515-2466Load-Date: September 2, 2019End of Document| About LexisNexis | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions | Copyright © 2021 LexisNexis Page 27 of 474Bright Scholar Schedules Unaudited Financial Results for Fourth Fiscal Quarter and Fiscal Year 2019 Ended August 31, 2019  Page 29 of 474Corporations Tiptoe around Hong Kong  Page 35 of 474House Commerce Subcommittee Issues Hearing Memo on Legislating to Secure Wireless Future  Page 52 of 474AI and Health Care; Warren and Sanders Wealth Tax Proposals; Fortnum and Mason CEO on their Success; U.S.-Trade Uncertainty Remains a Headwind for Stocks; Presi....  Page 56 of 474NEW AMERICA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL FELLOWS CLASS OF 2020 IN NEW AMERICA'S 20TH ANNIVERSARY YEAR, THE FELLOWS PROGRAM WILL BE SUPPORTING 12 BOOKS,  Page 59 of 474FTSE Russell Announces Results of Country Classification Review for Equities and Fixed Income  Page 61 of 474Rubio, Colleagues Urge Review of U.S. Export Controls Regarding Developments in Hong Kong  Page 63 of 474RUBIO, COLLEAGUES URGE REVIEW OF U.S. EXPORT CONTROLS REGARDING DEVELOPMENTS IN HONG KONG  Page 65 of 474SENATORS URGE REVIEW OF U.S. EXPORT CONTROLS REGARDING DEVELOPMENTS IN HONG KONG  Page 67 of 474SENATORS URGE REVIEW OF U.S. EXPORT CONTROLS REGARDING DEVELOPMENTS IN HONG KONG  Page 70 of 474Sen.
