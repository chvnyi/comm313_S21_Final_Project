SPANBERGER: UNITED STATES AND NATO PARTNERS MUST STRENGTHEN CYBER DEFENSES AMID 5G THREATS FROM CHINAStates News ServiceMay 9, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 678 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the office of Virginia Rep. Abigail Spanberger:U.S. Representative Abigail Spanberger today called on the United States and its North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) partners to recognize the national security threats posed by an increased Chinese telecommunications presence in Europe.According to a recent report, Huawei's growing influence as a leading supplier of 5G technology in Europe could be exploited by China to engage in espionage, monitor foreign corporations and governments, and support Chinese military operations. To combat the potential cyber threats associated with a Huawei 5G monopoly, the report recommends that non-Chinese companies invest in 5G research and developmentand it calls on European companies to reconsider the integration of Huawei technology into their 5G infrastructure.During a hearing focused on China's expanding influence in Europe and Eurasia, Spanberger underscored security concerns regarding Huawei's 5G development, Chinese intelligence operations, and the potential vulnerabilities to U.S. and European cyber infrastructure. Additionally, she called on U.S. and European officials to prioritize 5G research and development as a component of a tough, smart strategy to check Chinese influence around the world. Click here to watch her remarks."As cell phones make the 5G transition, we need to recognize the real risks that this emerging technology presentsincluding the threat of espionage. As a former CIA case officer, I am particularly concerned about Huawei's coordination with Chinese intelligence agencies and the Chinese military," said Spanberger. "Because of this known cooperation, we need to take concrete steps to protect the cyber infrastructure of our homes, businesses, intellectual property, and defense systems. Today, I stressed that the expansion of Huawei should not be perceived as 'business as usual,' but it should be viewed as a strategic move by an intelligence adversary. We need to remain vigilant in addressing this threatand as a Member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, I'll keep fighting to raise awareness about 5G manipulation, strengthen the integrity of our networks, and improve our overall security."The 2018 report from the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence (CCDCOE) warned that integration of Huawei as a 5G provider could create long-term negative consequencesand rolling back this process could be expensive, time-intensive, and too late to prevent potential security breaches. During the hearing today, Spanberger referenced these concerns and outlined the clear national security threat that Huawei's European expansion poses to the United States.Spanberger serves as Vice-Chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee's Subcommittee on Europe, Eurasia, Energy, and the Environmentin which today's hearing was held.BACKGROUNDSince arriving in the U.S. House, Spanberger has worked to reaffirm the U.S. commitment to NATO, support key allies in Europe, and promote the NATO member states' shared mission of mutual security. Spanberger is a cosponsor of the NATO Support Act, which passed overwhelmingly in the U.S. House in January. And during a March 2019 hearing, Spanberger called on Congress to recognize the security contributions of NATO and to reaffirm the alliance's indispensable role in promoting U.S. national security, economic strength, and successful diplomatic engagement efforts.Spanberger is also promoting diplomacy, human rights, and humanitarian assistance as key components of U.S. foreign policy in the Asia-Pacific. During a February 2019 hearing, Spanberger pushed for the administration to pursue effective denuclearization steps with North Korea, respect the assessments of career public servants in the intelligence community, and hold North Korea accountable for its human rights abuses amid ongoing talks. Click here for a video of her remarks.As a Member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Spanberger also serves on the Asia, the Pacific, and Non-Proliferation Subcommittee.###Load-Date: May 9, 2019End of Document

CHINA CUSTOMS MAKES ITS BIGGEST TUSK BUSTStates News ServiceApril 18, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 531 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: BEIJING, China BodyThe following information was released by the General Administration of Customs of the People's Republic of China:Customs officers display confiscated elephant tusks.China Customs officers have seized 2,748 ivory tusks weighing a combined 7.48 metric tons after cracking a major smuggling case. It was the biggest haul of tusks ever recorded in an anti-smuggling bust conducted independently by customs officers, the General Administration of Customs said on Monday.The case was solved in March after a combined operation of different customs offices lasting three months. A total of 238 customs officers took part from cities around the country, including Hefei, Nanjing, Beijing, Fuzhou and Qingdao. Twenty suspects were detained for further investigation, according to Sun Zhijie, director of the administration's anti-smuggling bureau.Sun said the tusks, illegally shipped from African countries, were imported into China labeled as wood. Most of the ivory was hidden in an abandoned factory by the smugglers, Sun said. Busts were made in several locations, which were not disclosed. The case is still under investigation.Since early this year, 182 smuggling cases involving endangered species have been investigated, the administration said on Monday. More than 500 tons of endangered animals and animal products were seized, 8.48 tons of which was ivory tusks or products made of ivory. In those cases, 171 suspects were detained.The Chinese government suspended imports of ivory and all ivory products in 2015 and ended commercial processing and sale of ivory at the end of 2017. The ban has had significant positive effects, with fewer people purchasing ivory, according to a report jointly released last year by the World Wildlife Fund and TRAFFIC, an NGO that tracks the global trade in wild animals."We will strengthen our anti-smuggling efforts, continuing to work with international organizations and departments and allowing no tolerance of those illegal activities," said Hu Wei, deputy director of the administration.Hu said the administration also will promote anti-smuggling and wildlife protection knowledge among the public, and it welcomes public supervision or reports of smuggling.As social networks and online stores have become increasingly important tools for wildlife smugglers, the administration has beefed up its anti-smuggling work online this year.Customs officials are working on cases involving another 100 tons of endangered wildlife and wildlife products, of which about 300 kilograms are tusks and ivory products.Last year, the administration purchased advanced screening and detection equipment to improve the efficiency of its anti-smuggling work, according to Wang Wei, director of the administration's ports supervision department.People caught entering China with endangered wildlife or wildlife products worth less than 200,000 yuan ($29,800) face up to five years in prison. If such contraband goods are worth more than 1 million yuan, the penalty upon conviction is a minimum of 10 years in prison.One ivory tusk is currently worth 250,000 yuan on average on the black market, and ivory products can go for 41,000 yuan per kilogram, Wang said.Load-Date: April 18, 2019End of Document

San Francisco made the right call by banning facial recognition technology - for nowThe Stanford Daily: Stanford UniversityMay 21, 2019 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 785 wordsByline: Alex DurhamBodyThis past week, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors announced that it would ban the usage of facial recognition by police and other agencies. This is a declaration that seems at odds with the ethos of a city usually at the forefront of technological innovation, but follows a trend of California cities putting restrictions on the use of the technology.The ban goes a bit further than just an outright ban of the technology, though. State departments that wish to install any new technology that collects people's information have to submit a policy plan to officials along with a surveillance impact report. Based on those documents, the city will then either allow them to use the technology or not. For those departments that already use a type of surveillance technology that collects citizen data, they have to submit a specific ordinance that outlines their usage of the technology and allow the city to audit their use of it on a yearly basis. City officials said this move was largely meant to "ensure the safe and responsible use of surveillance technology."This ban continues a trend that has appeared across the globe in the past few months: the questioning of the ethics of facial recognition technology. The conversation began when it became public that China was allegedly using, and had been using for some time, facial recognition technology on its citizens, but more specifically to single out a specific minority group: the Uighurs, a largely Muslim minority. According to a report from the New York Times, the Chinese government was keeping tabs on the comings and goings of the Uighurs for the purpose of search and review- the first recorded usage of AI technology for the purpose of racial profiling.After this instance came to light, it is no wonder that the city of San Francisco felt the need to reassess its surveillance technology. The example in China highlights the opportunity to use facial recognition for racial profiling in a way the world has never seen before, and so reviewing its use in cities in the US may be the best way to to avoid discrimination of the kind perpetrated by the Chinese government.There are two sides to the San Francisco decision, though. Some argue that abolishing use of the technology was the right thing to do, but others believe the stance is too extreme and that it hinders the ability of police departments to catch suspects. Of these two stances, I believe that San Francisco made the right choice by abolishing the use of the technology - for now.To understand why, all we have to do is look at both China, and how the technology was used against Chinese people, and New York, where the government is struggling to deal with its police departments using facial recognition technology. The New York Police Department is now juggling a lawsuit brought by Georgetown Law's Center on Privacy and Technology who want the NYPD to turn over information regarding their use of facial recognition technology. This is because almost nothing is known about the technology at the moment: it's unclear what kind of facial recognition technology is being used, who it is being shared with (if anyone), and what sort of databases are being used to store the information. These are basic questions that people should have answers to because not having those answers is a serious privacy concern. These are questions San Francisco will also have to find answers to if they want to reimplement the technology in the future, as well as any city planning on using it.While I believe that San Francisco is in the right to ban facial recognition at the moment, I think it could be reinstated in the future because of the benefits it provides to criminal investigations. This could only happen once there is a more comprehensive understanding of the technology and how it is being used, though. We should have answers to basic questions about what kind of information is being stored and whether it is being shared with anyone other than the government. There should be strict regulations on who gets to use the technology and how it used should be put in place. The more difficult aspect to control would be the will of the government and its employees, and how they choose to use the information.

CRU: Whose Tungsten Projects will Satisfy Growing DemandPR NewswireMay 1, 2019 Wednesday 4:00 AM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 603 wordsDateline: LONDON, May 1, 2019 BodyPR NewswireTungsten is a vital ingredient used in a wide range of final products. Its special qualities in some key end-uses make it difficult to replace. However, it is not a demand concern that keeps market participants worried, but one more fundamental to any resource market: will there be enough supply? In this Insight we explore the current supply outlook and review some of the major risks to the supply base.Tungsten is a high-priced commodity, which is consequently used only in products where its performance justifies the cost of the raw material. This includes cemented carbides, high alloy steels and superalloys, electrical and electronic applications. Due to this wide range of applications, total tungsten demand is driven by a combination of developments in the broader world economy (industrialisation).The tungsten industry has undergone tremendous change. In the last quarter of the twentieth century, sales from the US and later ex-Soviet government stockpiles, plus uncoordinated production from many small-scale Chinese mines, led to oversupply in the tungsten market. This resulted in market prices being depressed to the point where all but a handful of mines outside of China closed.Western processors and consumers consequently became increasingly reliant on Chinese tungsten concentrates and other products. However, in the 2000s the Chinese government sought to restrict the export of tungsten products, resulting in higher prices and concerns over the security of supply for non-Chinese tungsten processors and consumers.Since 2013, the world (ex-China) refined tungsten market balance has been negative and relatively static at roughly -13,000 t/y (tonnes per year). With the depletion of stockpiles and this negative balance holding up prices, in the last two years, industry attention has turned again to tungsten. Decreases in supply from existing producers have exacerbated supply shortages and have been caused by a variety of factors, including environmental regulations in China.Will supply growth be sufficient?China remains the largest supplier of tungsten so what happens in China has important repercussions for overall tungsten supply growth. The depletion of Chinese domestic resources is fostering doubts about China's long-term ability to supply and CRU forecast Chinese production will continue to decrease.Read the full story:https://www.crugroup.com/knowledge-and-insights/insights/2019/whose-tungsten-projects-will-satisfy-growing-demand/Read more about CRU:http://bit.ly/About_CRU About CRUCRU offers unrivalled business intelligence on the global metals, mining and fertilizer industries through market analysis, price assessments, consultancy and events.Since our foundation by Robert Perlman in 1969, we have consistently invested in primary research and robust methodologies, and developed expert teams in key locations worldwide, including in hard-to-reach markets such as China.CRU employs over 280 experts and has more than 11 offices around the world, in Europe, the Americas, China, Asia and Australia - our office in Beijing opened in 2004 and Singapore in 2018.When facing critical business decisions, you can rely on our first-hand knowledge to give you a complete view of a commodity market.

Huawei says US sanctions will cost it billions in revenueAssociated Press InternationalJune 17, 2019 Monday 3:57 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 839 wordsByline: By DAKE KANG and YANAN WANG, Associated PressDateline: SHENZHEN, China BodySHENZHEN, China (AP) - Huawei's founder said Monday that the Chinese telecom giant's revenue will be $30 billion less than forecast over the next two years, as he compared the company to a "badly damaged plane" as a result of U.S. government actions against it."We never thought that the U.S.'s determination to attack Huawei would be so strong, so firm," Ren Zhengfei, who is also the CEO, said during a panel discussion at the company's headquarters in Shenzhen, China.Ren said Huawei will reduce capacity and expects revenue of about $100 billion annually for the next two years, compared with $105 billion in 2018. In February, he said the company was targeting $125 billion in 2019.Huawei's overseas cellphone sales will drop by 40%, Ren said, confirming a Bloomberg report published Sunday. But the Chinese market is growing rapidly, he said, and Huawei will not allow restrictive measures to curb its research and development.Huawei is embroiled in a trade dispute between China and the U.S., which has accused Chinese companies such as Huawei of committing forced technology transfers and stealing trade secrets. Last month, the U.S. placed Huawei on its "Entity List," which effectively bars American companies from selling components to Huawei without government approval.U.S. suppliers are taking a hit, too. Micron Technologies, Qualcomm, Qorvo and Skyworks Solutions have all listed Huawei as a major customer. Last week, chipmaker Broadcom reduced its 2019 revenue forecast by $2 billion, saying customers are trimming orders because of the trade tensions, including the U.S. curbs on sales to Huawei. Broadcom previously estimated full-year revenue of $24.5 billion. The research firm IHS Markit said Micron and Western Digital will also suffer, as they lose a leading buyer of memory chips and storage devices.Huawei is expected to face challenges finding alternative suppliers for components, though IHS says Micron and Western Digital could eventually be replaced by South Korean and Taiwanese suppliers.More broadly, U.S. businesses are expressing alarm at the Trump administration's aggressive policies toward China. Hundreds of companies, trade groups and individuals have written the U.S. trade representative to protest the administration's plan to extend tariffs of up to 25% on the $300 billion worth of Chinese sales to the United States that haven't already been hit by import taxes.Some are showing up in person for seven days of hearings that begin Monday. They want the administration to cancel the tariffs - or at least spare the imports they rely on.Washington claims Huawei poses a national security threat because it is beholden to China's ruling Communist Party. But American officials have presented no evidence of any Huawei equipment serving as intentional conduits for espionage by Beijing. Huawei's placement on the Entity List is widely seen as intended to persuade resistant U.S. allies in Europe to exclude Huawei equipment from their next-generation wireless networks, known as 5G.Ren denies that Huawei would share user data with the Chinese government if ordered to do so. He said Monday there are no backdoors in its equipment that anyone could access, and that Huawei is willing to enter into a no backdoor agreement with any nation that wants one.Huawei has brought a lawsuit in the U.S. this March challenging the constitutionality of a national security law which prevents the U.S. government and its contractors from using Huawei equipment. The complaint, filed in Plano, Texas, where Huawei's American operations are headquartered, alleges that the law singles out Huawei for punishment while denying the company due process.The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Huawei is asking Verizon to pay licensing fees for more than 200 of its patents. While Huawei declined to comment on the matter, company spokesman Joe Kelly said it will hold a briefing later this month on being more aggressive about collecting intellectual property licensing fees.Ren said during the panel discussion that Huawei will not use its many patents as a "weapon," but did not rule out seeking royalties for usage.He emphasized that Huawei will not stop collaborating with other countries and businesses.The company's current situation "is not caused by American businesses, but rather by certain politicians' different perspectives," Ren said. "I think both sides will suffer. No one will win."The panel, organized by Huawei, also included Nicholas Negroponte, the founder of the media lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and writer and investor George Gilder.In December, Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou - Ren's daughter - was arrested in Vancouver at the request of U.S. authorities. The U.S. alleges that Meng misled American banks about the company's business dealings with Iran, and that Huawei used a Hong Kong shell company to sell equipment in Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions. An extradition hearing is expected to begin in January.___Wang reported from Beijing.Load-Date: June 18, 2019End of Document

Chairman Blunt Issues Statement at Hearing on FY 2020 Budget Request For NIHTargeted News ServiceApril 11, 2019 Thursday 7:11 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 742 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Senate Appropriations subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies issued the following statement by Chairman Roy Blunt, R-Missouri, at a hearing to review the fiscal 2020 budget request for the National Institutes of Health:"Good morning. Thank you, Dr. Collins and the Institute Directors, for appearing before the Subcommittee today to discuss the National Institutes of Health's FY2020 budget request."As Chairman of this Subcommittee, re-prioritizing funding for the National Institutes of Health after a decade of stagnation has been my number one priority."Over the past four years, we have increased funding by $9 billion or 30 percent."This increase has funded significant progress on vaccines for Ebola and Zika, developed blood tests to detect different types of cancer, and led to the first-ever drug specifically for postpartum depression. In my home state of Missouri, NIH research has demonstrated that interactive therapy can reduce rates of childhood depression, discovered an enzyme responsible for the spread of cancer, and supported research aimed at improving cancer immunotherapy."I am disappointed the FY2020 budget request cut the agency by $4.9 billion or 13 percent. This is not a choice I will make when we write the FY2020 Labor/HHS appropriations bill."While my commitment to biomedical research remains strong, I am deeply concerned about an issue I think NIH and the entire research community needs to take more seriously. Foreign governments are initiating systematic programs to influence the American research enterprise."There is a Chinese government program to recruit NIH-funded researchers to steal intellectual property, cheat the peer-review system, establish shadow laboratories in China, and help the Chinese government obtain confidential information about NIH research grants."I understand and support the need to balance protecting against foreign threats with the collaboration and open access that has long been prioritized in the medical research community."And in almost every case, talented foreign researchers have benefited the U.S. research community and moved medical research forward. As I have said many times, I believe that any foreign student coming to the United States for advanced education should be able to stay in the U.S. after that training is complete."However, we must recognize that not everyone is well intentioned. We know from an ongoing FBI investigation that the Chinese government is trying to undermine the U.S. research infrastructure. This is a serious threat to NIH peer-review system, to universities and research institutions' intellectual property, and to corrupting a system that has long been held as the gold standard in research worldwide."The NIH Advisory Committee has recommended several steps, including implementing a broad education campaign about the requirement to disclose foreign sources of funding and developing enhanced cybersecurity protocols. While I appreciate the Advisory Committee's recommendations, I do not think NIH has made the research community fully aware of the exact threats they face, and more importantly, how to combat them. In fact, NIH has only sent one letter to the community on the subject. The research community needs to understand that this is a serious, immediate, and specific threat, and that some foreign governments will use any means necessary to obtain a competitive advantage over the U.S."In this vulnerable environment, I think it is prudent for NIH to be even more cautious about ensuring systems and protocols are in place to protect the research community. But I am unconvinced that is happening now."Moving forward, I want to see clear steps taken to ensure all NIH grantees are trained to understand their roles and responsibilities within current policy. NIH needs to evaluate their peer-review system and internal controls through a lens that takes into account national security threats. And, finally, those who inappropriately share information from the peer-review process or illegally share intellectual property need to be held accountable."While the number of individuals that are part of China's Thousand Talents program may be few, this program has uncovered a systematic flaw. We must take this threat seriously and NIH should take definitive steps today to maintain the integrity of the NIH system."[TheHill]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6693671 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: April 12, 2019End of Document

ON WORLD ENVIRONMENT DAY, WORLD TURNS SPOTLIGHT ON AIR POLLUTIONStates News ServiceJune 5, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1746 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: HANGZHOU, China BodyThe following information was released by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP):Governments, industry, communities and individuals around the world today commemorated World Environment Day, the United Nations' biggest annual event for positive environmental action, encouraging worldwide awareness and commitment to protect our planet.This year's celebrations, held under the theme 'Beat Air Pollution', called upon people to explore renewable energy and green technologies, and improve air quality in cities and regions across the world. More than 6 billion people one-third of them children regularly breathe air that is so polluted it puts their health and well-being at risk.Spearheaded by China, the official host of the global World Environment Day celebrations, UN Environment's campaign to #BeatAirPollution culminated into a record number of registered events and commitments."Protecting our blue skies may be difficult, but our future relies on it," Joyce Msuya, acting Executive Director of UN Environment, said during the global celebrations in Hangzhou. "And they are our blue skies. It doesn't matter if you're in Beijing or Beirut, when we look up we see the same sky. And I think when we look to China, we see many examples of how to protect it."Over the past decade, the Chinese government has taken drastic measures to limit air pollution in its biggest cities, bringing back blue skies in Beijing, Shanghai and other megacities, benefitting the health of millions.By implementing far-reaching measures at the national- and state-level government, such as 100 per cent electric public transportation, curtailing outputs from factories and allocating more than US$10 billion to address air quality, several cities saw the concentration of PM 2.5 drop dramatically.The President of the People's Republic of China, Xi Jinping, conveyed his congratulations on the occasion of World Environment Day, saying, "Humankind only has one planet. Environmental conservation and sustainable development are the common responsibility of all countries. Ecological civilization is built into China's national development architecture and strategy. China will work with any and all to implement the 2030 agenda to protect our only planet."A global call for actionIn the weeks leading up to World Environment Day, photos and videos of people on every continent covering the lower half of their faces with masks, scarfs, their hands or even flowers, food, and clothing flooded social media channels.Each image, accompanied by the hashtag #BeatAirPollution, came with a call for global action and a personal pledge to make individual lifestyle changes to reduce air pollution such as swapping car rides for bike rides, reducing meat intake or powering down electronic equipment when not in use."Today, we face an equally urgent crisis. It is time to act decisively," UN Secretary-General Antnio Guterres said in his official message for World Environment Day. "My message to governments is clear: t ax pollution; end fossil fuel subsidies; and stop building new coal plants. We need a green economy not a grey economy."Events around the worldAir pollution goes to the heart of social justice and global inequality. According to the World Health Organization, 97 per cent of cities in low- and middle-income countries with more than 100,000 inhabitants do not meet air quality guidelines. That percentage falls to 49 in high-income countries.World Environment Day events on every continent drew attention to this issue, and united communities against a global health threat that affects individuals, indiscriminate of age, religion or nationality.EuropeIn Europe, celebrations kicked off with the launch of the report 'Air Pollution and Human Health: The Case of the Western Balkans' in Sarajevo, accompanied by the presentation of the 'Sarajevo Air' app, that helps citizens avoid polluted areas while walking or cycling. The Celebrations on the continent further included a kids marathon in Kazakhstan and an eco-trail run in Geneva, the Festival de l'environnement in Brussels and the launch of a World Environment Day themed song.AfricaBeing first and foremost a celebration of environmental beauty, Kenya marked World Environment Day with a fashion show featuring striking pieces from local eco-conscious designers. A bike ride through the center of the capital, Nairobi, was followed by the official celebrations, which included a ceremonial tree planting exercise, cultural performances and art exhibitions.A number of African countries South Africa, Rwanda, Morocco, Tanzania, Senegal, Cote d'Ivoire, Egypt, Ethiopia, Niger, Nigeria, Algeria also commemorated the day with official events.West AsiaAcross the Middle Eastern nations of Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Oman, youth-led flashmobs drew attention to the issue of air pollution right before the start of the Eid-Al Fitr festivities. Celebrations in Bahrain started on the 3rd of June with the planting of 150 Neem trees, and a mass cycling event in partnership with the Embassy of India in Bahrain.North AmericaIn North America, rock fan favorites Dave Matthews Band were designated as UN Environment Goodwill Ambassadors for their efforts in reducing the environmental footprints of their tours. Over the past 15 years and 578 concerts, the band together with partner REVERB has avoided 55,000,000 kg of CO2 and 478,000 single-use plastic bottles.In New York, climate, health and building experts discussed air pollution as a global health emergency and a leading environmental threat to the city, while almost 90 third grade students at the School for Environmental Studies and Community Wellness in Brooklyn gathered to compose "Love Letters to the Air," an arts-integrated, creative letter-writing project that promotes positive change for our planet.Latin America and the CaribbeanIn Ecuador, regional host of World Environment Day, young people planted 1,000 native trees minutes from the crater of the Pululahua, one of the few inhabited volcanoes in the planet. In Haiti and Mexico, UN Environment hosted film festivals on the environment. The Mexican state of Guanajuato saw further celebrations, including a nighttime bike ride.Cycling was also on the agenda in Peru, where a massive bike ride was organized in the capital, Lima, to commemorate World Environment Day. In Brazil, 10 states organized bike rides over the course of a week, while the city of So Paolo formally launched the implementation of a national network for air quality monitors.Asia and the PacificCelebrations in host country China commenced with a visit to Anji county, near Hangzhou, where President Xi Jinping famously declared that "green is gold". Here, the Champions of the Earth-winning Zhejiang Rural Revival Programme had transformed a former mining and industrial wasteland into a prosperous region and healthy landscape. A delegation from UN Environment visited a county court, where the judiciary is making innovative strides in environmental justice, including allowing cases to be opened and mediated by mobile phone.Nearby Nanjing then showcased Zhejiang province's futuristic environmental monitoring centre during a visit the following day.Global host city Hangzhou demonstrated its own environmental advancements, including the city's electric buses, which now constitute 70 per cent of the bus fleet. Visiting the Xixi Wetland Park, the delegation saw the results of the rejuvenation of a wetland area, which has brought back hundreds of bird, plant and insect species to the area.During the main celebrations on June 5th, China's Vice Premier Han Zheng conveyed a message from President Xi, reiterating China's commitment to beat air pollution and willingness to share China's experiences and practices with other countries. Other senior Chinese officials, including Environment Minister Li Ganjie and Zhejiang Party Secretary Che Jun also reiterated China's commitment to the environment and global cooperation on climate change. Senior UN Environment representation and other delegates then together presented China's Ecological Civilization and volunteer awards to winners.Other World Environment Day celebrations in Asia and the Pacific took place in Myanmar, where the President launched the country's environmental and climate change policies, India, where the Agra government announced their clean air plan and Thailand, where events attended by the Governor of Bangkok and top officials from the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment saw musical performances, activities and panel discussions on air pollution.BreatheLife commitmentsNine governments at the national and municipal level made commitments to bring air quality to safe levels by 2030, by joining the BreatheLife campaign, a joint initiative by UN Environment, the World Health Organization, the Climate and Clean Air Coalition and the World Bank.By committing to BreatheLife, Bogota (Colombia), Lalitpur and Kathmandu (Nepal), Honduras, Bogor City (Indonesia), the Republic of Moldova, Monaco, Montevideo (Uruguay) and Mexico demonstrate their dedication to collaborate on the clean air solutions that will help us get to a World Free of Air Pollution faster. The new commitments bring the number of cities, regions and countries in the BreatheLife network to 63, representing 271.4 million citizens around the world.NOTES TO EDITORSFor news and stories about World Environment Day celebrations, as well as more information about air pollution, visit: www.worldenvironmentday.globalSocial media coverage of the celebrations around World Environment Day are visible on social media: @UNEnvironment www.facebook.com/unenvironmentResources for media are available hereAbout UN Environment:UN Environment is the leading global voice on the environment.

Huawei is a matter of national security for the United StatesCE Noticias Financieras EnglishApril 7, 2019 SundayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 694 wordsBody US National Security officials are contemplating a future scenario in which the Chinese company Huawei will have a significant share of the global telecommunications market. On the other side of the coin, they are also trying to design some strategy with which they manage to thwart espionage and hacking actions.  "We're going to have to find a way to manage the risks in the 5G world, made up of a network that includes technology we can not trust," said Sue Gordon, deputy director of the US Intelligence Community. "We're just going to have to solve that."  Members of the intelligence agencies have not given up their campaign, with which they urge other countries to block Huawei, a firm with close ties to the Chinese government, through its 5G network, which will drive everything from cars driven by robots until military operations.  Security agencies know that many countries already use Huawei's low-cost equipment and they also know that 5G technology will be one of the attractions offered by the Chinese company, whose technological speed will be up to 100 times faster than the current one presented by the companies. 4G platforms.  "You have to assume there's a dirty network," Gordon said during an intelligence conference at the University of Texas at Austin last week. "That's what we're going to have to brag about the world."  US officials have begun to discuss the forms of encryption and the use of segmented network components. Several years ago, the main telecommunications providers in the United States began designing functions of the 5G network, aimed at keeping domestic systems safe from espionage and cyber attacks by adversaries and criminals.  "China is a strategic competitor and Huawei plays for the local team," said Scott Kennedy, an adviser to the Center for Strategic and International Studies.  National security  Gordon's comments, surprising because of their sincerity, reveal the need to prepare for a future with a dominant Huawei in the networks, and also reflect the pressures that officials have to persuade allied countries that national security interests long term should prevail over short-term economic benefits.  The founder of Huawei, Ren Zhengfei, insists that his company has never enabled the Chinese government's espionage and does not plan to do so. "Over the past 30 years we have never done that, and in the next 30 years to come we will never do it," he told CBS News last February.  The German intelligence agency has also asked the ministers of Angela Merkel not to use the 5G network on Huawei phones. But there, as in other European countries, the calls are competing with an aggressive price cut by Huawei.  "I can not understand why German telecommunications providers are so naive about Huawei," said a senior German security official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss this sensitive issue. "If the Chinese authorities want to intervene (the networks), Huawei can not refuse and that is a problem."  Huawei controls the 4G market in Africa, much of the Middle East, southern Europe and parts of Southeast Asia. "Huawei has a desire to dominate the 5G market," said James Lewis, an expert in cybersecurity and technology policy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "There's no way to keep them out at allparts. "  The four major US companies, AT & T, Verizon, Sprint and T-Mobile, committed to the Trump government not to use the Huawei products and the other Chinese firm, ZTE, to launch the 5G network.  Threats  The Secretary of State. Mike Pompeo, threatened his allies from Budapest, in February, in case they use the Huawei equipment.  The US ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, sent a letter to German officials in March, saying that the United States would limit the intelligence exchange with Berlin if Huawei is allowed to provide its 5G network.  The US intelligence exchange "is a matter of life and death for us," said the German security official. Last year, for example, the US transmitted information to the Germans that helped them trace an alleged terrorist plot.  Huawei has come to reform geopolitics.

Trump Declares US National Emergency To Protect Communications NetworkLive Briefs PRO Global MarketsMay 16, 2019 Thursday 1:42 AM ESTCopyright 2019 MT Newswires All Rights ReservedLength: 773 wordsBody US President Donald Trump on Wednesday declared a national emergency aimed at protecting US communication networks, in a move regarded as part of a broader effort to keep the Chinese telecom giant Huawei out of the US market.The move is consistent with Trump's commitment to protect the information and communications technology and services of the US, a White House statement said.The national emergency declaration is contained in an executive order Trump signed. It gives the Commerce Department the power to stop US companies from doing business with certain foreign suppliers.While the order doesn't expressly mention China or Huawei - a major player in the rollout of the next-generation 5G network - they are widely perceived as the target.A separate action by the Department of Commerce adding Huawei and its affiliates to the "entity list" - a list of companies considered to potentially pose a risk to national security or foreign policy interests - reinforced that perception.The department announced the addition on Wednesday shortly after Trump signed the executive order, saying it stemmed partly from activities related to the indictment of Huawei by the Justice Department in January.There have been 190 additions to the "entity list" since the start of the Trump administration, the statement said.Trump's order is not restricted to a single technology, meaning other information communications technologies could be affected."The president has made it clear that this administration will do what it takes to keep America safe and prosperous, and to protect America from foreign adversaries who are actively and increasingly creating and exploiting vulnerabilities in information and communications technology infrastructure and services in the United States," the statement said.Huawei responded on Thursday that the company was willing to engage with the US government and come up with "effective measures to ensure product security.""Restricting Huawei from doing business in the US will not make the US more secure or stronger; instead, this will only serve to limit the US to inferior yet more expensive alternatives, leaving the US lagging behind in 5G deployment, and eventually harming the interests of US companies and consumers," a company statement said. "In addition, unreasonable restrictions will infringe upon Huawei's rights and raise other serious legal issues," it said.The US had previously banned government agencies from contracting with Huawei or other companies that use its equipment amid worries that Huawei could use its dominance in the global 5G market to pass on information to the country's intelligence services. The US has also encouraged its European allies to sever ties to Huawei.Ajit Pai, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, welcomed the executive order and agreed that China was the target."We need to have a crystal clear view of the threats that we face," Pai told Fox News. "The order shows that we take these threats seriously."He also noted that the FCC last week moved to deny China Mobile USA's application to offer telecom services in the US, saying the Chinese government-owned company poses a security risk. The application raised substantial and serious national security and law enforcement risks, Pai said.In January the US government alleged in an indictment that Huawei stole trade secrets from T-Mobile USA, charging the company's US affiliate with attempted theft of trade secrets, wire fraud, obstruction of justice and other offences that occurred from 2012-14.The US Department of Justice also charged Huawei with violating US sanctions against Iran. Huawei has denied all the charges.The indictment alleged the company's chief financial officer, who was arrested in December in Canada, committed numerous crimes. Canadian officials arrested Meng on a US warrant, and US authorities are seeking her extradition.China's Foreign Ministry has complained about the indictment of Meng, saying the US should stop the "unreasonable suppression" of Chinese companies.Washington is already engaged in an economic dispute with Beijing over trade. The two sides were close to a huge trade deal when China violated incremental agreements reached over months of negotiations, causing talks to break down last week, according to Trump.China's Foreign Ministry earlier this week cited demands Washington had added prior to the breakdown.The US last week increased tariffs to 25% on USD200 billion worth of Chinese products and Trump is looking "very strongly" at imposing another round that would affect USD325 billion worth of Chinese goods.By Gretel Johnston, dpaLoad-Date: May 17, 2019End of Document

Thanks so much for joining us.I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Tuesday, June 4th.Your top stories right now just before 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.Breaking news this morning. President Trump's historic U.K. visit, day two. He's meeting with British Prime Minister Theresa May right now. And in the next hour they will be holding a joint news conference. We're going to take you there live to London for that news conference at 8:45 a.m.We're watching trade this morning, a lot of focus there. President Trump could face a rebuke from his own party over the tariffs potentially on Mexico as the country considers retaliation. Meanwhile the administration is defending its stance on China as well.Plus, Joe Biden unveiling his energy platform. The details on that plan that would go well beyond President Obama's policies on energy.a bit of a tech wreck going on on Wall Street. We're seeing the stocks bounce from real big losses yesterday. New regulatory concerns putting pressure on major names in the sector. Facebook yesterday down 7.5 percent. The parent of Google, Alphabet down better than 6 percent. The Nasdaq sliding into correction territory in fact.We're taking a look at a rebound on Wall Street. This morning stocks are bouncing, take a look. Dow Industrials up right now 106 points, that's one half of 1 percent. The S&P was up 11. And the Nasdaq this morning right now up 31 points after stocks were little changed except for the Nasdaq yesterday.Industrial average was up just 4 points at the close yesterday. The S&P was down 7. But the Nasdaq, look at that hit that it took as a result of the weakness in tech, down 120 points yesterday at 4:00 on Wall Street, one and two thirds percent.In Europe this morning, markets are fractionally better on the morning. The FT100 is up 10 points. The CAC 40 in Paris is up 4 points. And the DAX index in Germany up 95. That's almost 1 percentIn Asia overnight, markets were lower. As you see, the worst performer was China. Shanghai composite down about 1 percent.Brady's trademark fight -- the Patriots' quarterback thinks the phrase "Tom Terrific" belongs to him. But one sports franchise well, has other ideas. We have the details coming up on that.All those stories coming up this morning. And joining me to break it all down: Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell; the Wall Street Journal's global economics editor Jon Hilsenrath; and Fox News contributor, columnist at "The Hill" Liz Peek. Great to see everybody this morning.LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning. Nice to be here.JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL EOCNOMICS EDITOR, "WALL STREET JOURNAL": Great to be here.BARTIROMO: Well, we're going to hear from Jay Powell at about a five to 10:00 or so this morning, at the conference in Chicago.We just had some retail earnings out. There was a miss on Tiffany and it looks Land's End's was better than expected. We saw those on the screen. So very much a bifurcated retail sector continues.HILSENRATH: Consumers ought to be doing ok in this environment. Unemployment is very low. Inflation is very low. Incomes are rising, wages are rising.PEEK: And sentiment is great.HILSENRATH: There's a lot of concern right now about how trade is going to affect the economy. Consumers ought to be a strong point.You know, one of the other things I wanted to mention is we have jobs numbers coming out in a few days on Friday. I think that's going to be a big day for the market.BARTIROMO: You think we'll see a good number?HILSENRATH: Well, I'm looking out for what's happening in the manufacturing sector. Manufacturing output has been -- was down a lot in the first quarter and we have to see if that's leading to layoffs. You know, manufacturing had a really good run of hiring. Has that lost its momentum?MCDOWELL: The expectation on manufacturing jobs is an addition of 4,000 but the estimates are kind of all over the place, from down 4,000 to up 10,000. The overall expectation for jobs is 185,000 jobs added with the unemployment rate holding at 3.6 percent and most critically the 3.2 percent year over year income growth -- personal income growth.HILSENRATH: Right. And those would be excellent numbers.MCDOWELL: Right.HILSENRATH: If the numbers hit Wall Street's expectations it would be excellent. With these concerns about manufacturing, you know, you just have to look out for a negative number. Anything in the positive territory is good news.BARTIROMO: -- which is why we watch the purchasing managers' index. Even in China was seeing the purchasing managers' index has come in below 50.HILSENRATH: Globally manufacturing is being hit by all this trade.PEEK: You know, right now, the ISM and the United States is still looking at expansion. The rate of growth has certainly slowed but it's not going backwards -- you know.MCDOWELL: It's the lowest level since before President Trump was elected which was a little unnerving.HILSENRATH: And if you look at the output numbers that the fed puts out, we had a contraction in manufacturing in three of the first four months of the year. So we have to keep an eye on it.BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean really.Coming up this morning, my exclusive interview with the CEO of Walmart, Doug McMillon joining us this morning, give us his take on trade and the impact on business and certainly the customer today, the retail consumer. Wisconsin Congressman Sean Duffy is here this morning, along with California Congressman John Garamendi. Retired Army Lieutenant Colonel Allen West joining us as well; and Pedego Electric Bikes CEO Don DiCostanzo joining us this morning as well. We're going to check out the electric bikes coming.Don't miss a moment of it this morning.And we kick it off this hour with this top story.President Trump's state visit to the United Kingdom, the President sitting down with British Prime Minister Theresa May for a business breakfast this morning with business leaders. He highlighted the potential for a trade deal with Britain.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think we'll have a very, very substantial trade deal. It would be a very fair deal. And I think that this is something that your folks want to do, my folks want to do and we want to do. And we're going to get it done.I would just like to congratulate you on having done a fantastic job on behalf of the people of the United States.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: The President's visit being met with backlash, meanwhile. Thousands of protesters taking to the streets of London this morning.Joining us right now in a Fox Business exclusive is the CEO of Duff & Phelps Noah Gottdiener. And Noah -- it's great to have you on the program this morning.NOAH GOTTDIENER, CEO, DUFF & PHELPS: It's nice to be here.BARTIROMO: Thanks so much for joining us.GOTTDIENER: My pleasure.BARTIROMO: Your reaction to everything going on this morning in London. We're about to hear from the President and the prime minister in news conference at 8:45.GOTTDIENER: Yes. Well, it's certainly fun to watch. I would say that what we're seeing with Brexit and trade wars is just -- this is just another manifestation of the geopolitical uncertainty and volatility in the world. And business leaders have to figure out how to navigate through that climate, which is something that we do at Duff & Phelps.So thinking about how do these things -- how does Brexit, how do trade wars affect the value of your business. Which is something that we advise companies on. Where should they raise money? How much should they raise? Those type of issues are of critical importance.BARTIROMO: One critical issue is obviously the tariffs and the trade situation where we are. We understand what's happening in terms of China because there are bigger issues there, could be national security issues, not just an economic story.GOTTDIENER: Right.BARTIROMO: But putting tariffs on Mexico as a way to get the Mexicans to do something about the border wall, your reaction to that -- the border rather, stopping the migrants from coming in, as well as the impact overall on the economy.GOTTDIENER: Yes, listen. Again, I would just say it just heightens the level of geopolitical uncertainty. Volatility, that's the world that business leaders are living in right now. Mexico tariffs, no tariffs, who knows what's coming next. And how do you navigate through all that.And what I'm advising our clients is to be diversified. To have businesses around the world to be prepared for economic downturn and there's no way of predicting what will come next.HILSENRATH: There's a lot of talk this morning about some kind of trade deal between the U.S. and the U.K. Now, we have London and New York which are two of the biggest financial centers in the world. Is there something in a trade deal that could particularly benefit the financial sector? You're in the financial sector -- that you're looking for.Are you looking for something to come out of these talks that could really help New York and London as financial centers?GOTTDIENER: Well, it's interesting. I mean, we just did a study, by the way, on what is the major financial center of the world. And it has flipped from London to New York and will probably flip back. So, you know, hard to say. But you know, New York and London will go back and forth on this and other cities are rising in importance as well.HILSENRATH: And how is Shanghai doing in that, you know? So there's all this, you know, fighting between the U.S. and China about economic preeminence. Is Shanghai posing any kind of threat to the U.S. in financials?GOTTDIENER: I would say one of the most interesting things that came out of the survey that we conducted was that many respondents said that Hong Kong may take that -- overtake both New York and London in the next five years. And other cities that have come up are shanghai was mentioned but Frankfurt has come up and Dublin which is another very interesting possibility has come up as well. We happen to have quite a few folks in Ireland, in anticipation of the rising importance of Dublin.MCDOWELL: I just want to remind people that today is the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre where pro-democracy protesters, students were massacred by the Chinese government.PEEK: And Hong King was -- right. By the minute.MCDOWELL: And I just wanted to remind people when they question why President Trump is finally trying to take on the malfeasance and misbehavior of China, this is the kind of mentality that you are dealing with.(CROSSTALKING)BARTIROMO: And the Chinese will not know anything about that 30-year anniversary. There won't be any information flow whatsoever. They will cut off Google. And Google has operated there with the understanding that their info and their flow of information will be censored.(CROSSTALKING)HILSENRATH: One of the ideas of 30 years of U.S. policy towards China was that if we engage them economically they would develop, you know, humans rights and democracy and it hasn't happened. And the President is saying well, you know, we have to come up with a new strategy.PEEK: I have a question for you.GOTTDIENER: Sure.PEEK: As you have been advising companies and they were looking at the possibility of Brexit, I don't -- I think companies were sort of moving operations to Germany, to France. If there is --GOTTDIENER: And Ireland.PEEK: -- and Ireland.If there is a hard Brexit, if we actually see them tumble out of the E.U., are companies going to be really that much affected? Or are they sort of in a defensive position now to accommodate that?GOTTDIENER: I think a lot of companies have been preparing for quite a while for Brexit one way or another, hard or not. So I think it's kind of happened already in anticipation.PEEK: So President Trump has gone over there with a very aggressive message, which is I wouldn't pay the E.U. this $49 billion or whatever it is. I would just take the chance and get out of the thing and do a deal. I mean if you were Theresa May or if you were -- forget Theresa May -- if you were the incoming government, would you begin to sort of walk that path?GOTTDIENER: I'm not sure -- I'm just not sure the incoming government has much of a choice at this point.PEEK: Yes. Perhaps not.BARTIROMO: In terms of the broad issues that this market is focusing on, it's obviously trade, it's also technology.GOTTDIENER: Yes.BARTIROMO: Silicon Valley under the microscope. We want to talk about the biggest names in tech, they got slammed yesterday on Wall Street.GOTTDIENER: Right.BARTIROMO: Look at these names down 7 percent, 6 percent amid a regulatory threat. Congress, the Justice Department and the FTC, federal trade commission all setting their sights on the industry's largest companies, Facebook and Google. Your reaction?Are we going to see a different regulatory environment these companies face?GOTTDIENER: We will, for sure. And I would say that the issues facing big tech are so complex and they include privacy, trade practices, just simply how social media affects our children which we see every day.And all these issues are all sort of mixed up together and big tech has managed to actually unify Republicans and Democrats --BARTIROMO: Right.GOTTDIENER: -- against them which is quite an accomplishment if you think about it.BARTIROMO: Right.Elizabeth Warren and Ted Cruz both want to break up --GOTTDIENER: Both, both. So one area that I would comment on is privacy which has been a big area that's come to the floor as a result of big tech. So GDPR has been a big development in Europe and we're going to see some sort of privacy legislation in the United States.HILSENRATH: Want to tell everybody what GDPR is?GOTTDIENER: It's a legislation regime for ensuring privacy of personal information. And it is extremely onerous. And one of the things that I would point out is the law of unintended consequences.So it is very expensive for companies to implement, so small companies will have more trouble implementing some sort of privacy law than big companies and might have sort of the opposite impact that one might expect.BARTIROMO: Interesting. Completely different than what you saw with the regulatory environment with the banks where the big banks really didn't get much regulatory relief for a long time, still haven't by the way --GOTTDIENER: Right.BARTIROMO: -- but the smaller banks actually were benefiting quite a bit.GOTTDIENER: Right.PEEK: But they did get bigger, interestingly -- the big banks, right. So I mean, that's why Zuckerberg I think was always sort of like yes, we welcome regulation because he know that's the smaller companies in the space are going to get clobbered by that. It's sort of an interesting end run-around.BARTIROMO: Noah -- it's great to get your insights this morning.GOTTDIENER: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Noah Gottdiener joining us this morning. Tune in today at 8:45 a.m. when Fox Business is taking you live to London for the President's joint news conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May. That's live, don't miss that coming up.But first Climate in focus -- 2020 hopeful Joe Biden rolling out a plan to tackle global warming. We're taking a look at that when we come back.And then trademark fight -- Patriots' quarterback Tom Brady charging the phrase "Tom Terrific" belongs to him. One sports franchise disagreeing this morning. We've got those details right after this.Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Joe Biden releases his climate plan.Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now -- Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Yes -- Maria.2020 hopeful Joe Biden presenting a 22-page agenda he says tackles climate change and builds economic opportunity with new green jobs. The former vice president says his goal for the U.S. is zero net emissions by 2050. But it's got a price tag, $1.7 trillion over 10 years.Now Biden's campaign says the money will come from undoing tax cuts that were of course, enacted by President Trump.All right, everybody. Good news for the whole panel. Have that extra cup of coffee. California state regulators have ruled that coffee does not require a cancer warning. The safety of coffee has been in dispute in the state of California after a judge said that coffee has to carry the warning because of a chemical created during the roasting process.Meanwhile you're going to love this. A new study by the British Heart Foundation says drinking up to 25 cups of coffee a day is still safe for the heart until somebody says it's bad for your blood pressure but we'll leave it at that.All right. Now Amazon taking a shot at Walmart. Amazon says its free one day delivery has been added to more than 10 million items and it's growing. The announcement just weeks after Walmart announced it was offering next day delivery to online shoppers. But the option only available to 220,000 products in Phoenix, Las Vegas and southern California. Walmart's CEO, Doug McMillon, joining Maria for an exclusive interview at 8:20 Eastern time this morning.And Maria -- those are all your headlines. Have some more coffee. Go for it.BARTIROMO: 25 cups. That's crazy. Thank you so much -- Cheryl.Biden's plan, Dagen -- what do you think?MCDOWELL: They've got to have some plan, right? Everybody has got to have something to say. But will these things -- will these things ever go anywhere? No.HILSENRATH: I mean I would say the numbers don't add up. You can't pay for a $1.7 trillion plan by undoing a very small part of the tax cut which is the tax cuts for the wealthy. A lot of those tax cuts went to business, which is helping to spur the economy and middle income households. He's not going to undo the middle income tax cuts. So you can't pay for it just by --BARTIROMO: It's really the corporate rate that we're talking about which was at 35 percent, now at 21 percent. It's had a real impact on economic growth. Undoing that -- what will that do to the economy?PEEK: Can we also just admit that trying to get rid of fossil fuels in any foreseeable future is just an impossibility. We're not even close on, you know, replacing transporting, use of fossil fuels.If you look at California, gasoline prices there are is a dollar per gallon more than any other place in the country. They're about to start having rolling black outs again because they have not invested in pipelines and drilling and all the rest of the stuff.That's what we're going to see nationwide if any of these very far left candidates are able to impose their green ideals on this country.MCDOWELL: But they're basically telling the American people we're going to eliminate millions of jobs. People who work in the energy business, who work in the oil business, we're getting rid of your jobs. How did that work out for Hillary Clinton when she looked at that coal miner and said we're going to get rid of your job but we'll replace it with something else.BARTIROMO: Right.MCDOWELL: And by the way, Natural gas is also a fossil fuel and that's one of the reasons that we are leading the globe in emissions reduction because of our conversion to natural gas. There are plentiful amount of it here and are switching our power plants.BARTIROMO: Do they not understand that -- Dagen? I mean this is such an important point that you make about natural gas. I don't know that the candidates even understand what's going on with natural gas in this country.PEEK: And they think by the way, that electric cars don't use any fuel. I mean, they don't know where the electricity is coming from a lot of times. It's coming from fossil fuels. So it is an ignorant -- it's a complex industry. And most of the people talking about it really don't have much understanding about it.BARTIROMO: Quick break, and then trade's impact on business. We're talking to one American bike maker about tariffs ahead. How much that bike will cost you, post tariffs.Then Beyonce's roaring debut-- the superstar wowing fans in the Lion King's new trailer. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We are looking at global trade this morning.Mexico is now considering retaliation as Democrat and Republican officials tell "Politico" the President may have to declare a second national emergency to impose those tariffs. Tensions also with China have been flaring up as Beijing issues a travel warning to the United States. The U.S. Treasury is also defending the President's negotiation strategy.Bicycles are one industry taking a hit in the ongoing trade impasse. Joining us right now is the CEO of Pedego Electric Bikes. He's the CEO and co-founder -- Don DiCostanzo. Don -- it's great to have you on the program.DON DICOSTANZO, CEO, PEDEGO ELECTRIC BIKES: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Thanks so much for joining us. Well we are going to look at your bike in a second. But first off, tell us about the trade situation and how it's impacting your business, how it's impacted you over the last year.DICOSTANZO: Well, a little over a year ago, Europe announced a tariff on electric bikes of 81 percent. So that caused us to look at other locations. And in May of last year I went to Vietnam to explore that as a possibility because there's three places in the world that make electric bikes. One is China, the other it Vietnam and Taiwan in Taipei or Taiwan.And so we looked at Vietnam and thought it was a workable solution. So we moved our production there.For Europe, we began the process last May. And when the tariffs came in for the U.S., we ended up accelerating our program, moving all of our production from China to Taiwan and Vietnam.BARTIROMO: How hard of a transition was it for you to go from producing in China to producing in Vietnam and Taiwan?DICOSTANZO: Well, the good news is the infrastructure was already in place and a bicycle is just a subtotal of about 50 items on a bill of materials. So we just shifted that production.A lot of the components are made -- our motors come from a Japanese company, our batteries come from a Korean company. So everything is globally sourced.HILSENRATH: Do you do any production in China anymore?DICOSTANZO: We do not.HILSENRATH: Completely not. So there's this question about who pays for tariffs when we impose them. Sometimes the big benefit goes to a country like Vietnam which is kind of caught in the middle.DICOSTANZO: Well, that's a very good point. They're the big benefactor of all this. But they already had infrastructure in place to make bicycles so they're going to be a big --HILSENRATH: Are your competitors moving there too?DICOSTANZO: Our bigger competitors can't because there's not enough infrastructure there to do it. And our smaller competitors can't afford it. So we're kind of in a sweet spot.BARTIROMO: Had you not moved your production, you would have raised prices or did you already raise prices?DICOSTANZO: We would have had to raise prices. We were able to mitigate price -- just a slight price increase for some supply chain costs but we only had a very minor price increase.MCDOWELL: Why not make the bikes in the United States?DICOSTANZO: That's a great question. In fact I'm part of a coalition that we're trying to do that. The challenge is that when I started in this business I wanted to make the bikes here in the U.S. and I found out that was impossible because it was 11 percent duty on bringing the parts in and there is no duty on bringing the whole bicycle in. So right away it would have been put me at an 11 percent disadvantage. Add the labor cost here and then my bikes would have not been competitive.HILSENRATH: Do you think tariffs are going to drive production to the United States?DICOSTANZO: Absolutely, without any question. The whole industry is moving toward that. We're trying to set up, establish manufacturing here of the frames. That's the biggest challenge because the frames are all made offshore. If we can get the frames made here and we're putting a bill forth in Congress to allow that the parts be exempt from many types of tariffs.PEEK: Hopefully you're lobbying for exactly that. But then there must be parts manufacturers in the U.S. who wanted those duties imposed, right.DICOSTANZO: Very few. Unfortunately the bicycle industry moved to China in the 1990s. It took about 10 years to --BARTIROMO: Why -- because it was so much cheaper?(CROSSTALKING)DICOSTANZO: The labor costs. The people who tried to stay here went bankrupt. Schwinn went bankrupt because they tried to continue to make the bikes here and they weren't competitive. So everything evolved there and now it's going to take us a few years to get it back. But because of automation, we're going to be able to make these parts here again in the U.S.HILSENRATH: Some people say that some of industries -- furniture, bicycles -- are gone. That we've lost so much infrastructure we can't bring them back. Is that true?DICOSTANZO: I disagree with that. It depends on what you mean by manufacture. We can certainly assemble the bikes here. We can put all the pieces together here. We already do it to a degree in our assembly facility in California.HILSENRATH: But you say with automation. So it's going to be machines doing that work, not people. It's not going to lead to a lot of new jobs.MCDOWELL: Reading my mind.DICOSTANZO: Yes. But -- there will be a higher skilled level of people that need to operate these machines. I've been to the Tesla factory. Those cars come in in sheet aluminum and they go out the other end in production and there's a lot of people involved in that.Yes, they've got lots of equipment but there is a lot of people involved and those are much higher paying jobs than the people just on the assembly line putting a screw or --PEEK: And you're creating value.DICOSTANZO: Exactly.PEEK: I mean, you know, the value added now is in the United States.(CROSSTALKING)BARTIROMO: By the way -- we're seeing a real mix in terms of retail earnings this morning. We had a big miss on Tiffany and yet you've got others that are beating. So are you seeing the kind of consumer demand that you would expect from an economy where unemployment is as low as it is?DICOSTANZO: Well, we had a record month last month. We continue -- we break records every single month. There's a big demand for something that's alternative, anything electric is hot today. Electric bikes are certainly a hot item. And people don't buy them -- they buy them for transportation. But they primarily They primarily buy them to have fun.HILSENRATH: What does the President need to do to revive American industry and American jobs in manufacturing? He's done the tariffs on China. What else does he need to do to get those plants to start moving to the United States?DICOSTANZO: So the tariffs are a perfect step. But we also have other outside people like the Europeans. It's difficult for us to do business in Europe. We have to have restrictions on what they're allowed to do and what they're not allowed to do.But to bring jobs back here, we need to make it a fair and even playing field. I think the tariffs are the first step.HILSENRATH: You're with him on this agenda?DICOSTANZO: Absolutely.PEEK: You're manufacturing in California. A lot of businesses have been leaving California, I believe. Are you intending to stay in the state? The high taxes are not -- are not a problem for your company?DICOSTANZO: Well, from a business perspective, I look at it, is it possible and is it practical? And in California, it's certainly possible, the question is, is it practical? It may make more sense for us to do our assembly if we get in full scale assembly to move to Nevada or Texas or some other state that has a more friendly assembly.BARTIROMO: A smart conversation here, Don. We wish you could be here all day.PEEK: I know.BARTIROMO: Because it's exactly the conversation that we love having. Thank you so much for joining us.DICOSTANZO: Thank you for having me.BARTIROMO: Congrats to you, Don DiCostanzo joining us there.Coming up, a hero's journey home, a former Navy SEAL using extreme sports to transition back to civilian life.And then the battle of the Toms, Patriots' great Tom Brady's efforts to trademark his nickname getting some resistance this morning. Details after this.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, June 4th. Your top stories right now 07:34 a.m. on the East Coast.Breaking news this morning, President Trump's historic U.K. visit day two. His meeting with British Prime Minister Theresa May right now. Next hour, the two will be holding a joint news conference and we will take you there live to London between President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Theresa May.Trade is certainly in focus once again. The president could face a rebuke from his own party over the Mexico tariffs. The country is considering now retaliating. Meanwhile, the administration is defending its stands on China as well.Futures this morning pointing to at a higher opening.

S&P 500 up nine and the NASDAQ up 25 right now, bouncing after a really a tech wreck yesterday.Yesterday the major indices were flat with the exception of the NASDAQ because of a tech wreck on Wall Street, hitting the NASDAQ hard. The NASDAQ was down 120 points as you see and this is why. You had Amazon down 4-2/3 percent. Facebook down 7-1/2 percent. The parent company of Google, Alphabet down six percent yesterday. They all got creamed on new regulatory concerns on the major names, pushing the NASDAQ into correction territory by the way, yesterday.In Europe this morning, stocks are higher.

Worst performer was China, Shanghai Composite down about one percent.Tesla's multimillion dollar move, how the automaker sold tax credits to drive in hundreds of millions of dollars.Then Mets fans angry at Tom Brady, why the quarterback's move to trademark a nickname is causing a bit of a stir with some baseball fans. All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning.But first, a unique form of therapy for a former Navy SEAL, transitioning back to civilian life. He's using his combat experience to excel in extreme sports. His efforts the inspiration for a new start-up, Kristina Partsinevelos decided to tag along for a therapy session. Kristina, good morning to you.KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria. You have Brandon Webb who started this company. He was max Navy SEAL and Sniper but I want to get straight to the package so you can hear more of the story instead of me just recapping it for you. Let's listen in.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)PARTSINEVELOS: For most people, therapy sessions happen on a leather couch. For Brandon Webb, it's his 1985 Socata Epsilon. Webb spent time in Iraq and Afghanistan as a Navy SEAL sniper. And for all too many war veterans, returning home from the military means coping with post-traumatic stress disorder. To help combat that anxiety, Webb found an outlet.BRANDON WEBB, CEO AND GEAR CURATOR, CRATE CLUB: For me, flying is very therapeutic. I got a shot of adrenaline but it's kind of like yoga and meditation. Because you're forced -- it force -- you're just forced to concentrate on one thing and you can't think about anything else. So it's kind of mind eraser.PARTSINEVELOS: Stunt flying isn't his only escape, Webb also loves heliskiing. Most recently Webb and a group of friends took a helicopter to Chamonix, a dangerous off-trail region in the Alps. Webb is constantly seeking out that next adrenaline high.By managing his PTSD, Webb has also found his return to civilian life easier and has utilizes experiences to successfully launch several businesses.WEBB: I've been able to like take the stuff that I love and kind of mix it with my past, you know, military background and create this kind of cool content company that we monetize with commerce.PARTSINEVELOS: One of those startups is crate club, a mail order subscription service that's essentially Navy SEAL in a box. Outdoor survival goods approved by combat veterans.So, can I get my therapy session with you then?WEBB: Of course and I don't charge that much.PARTSINEVELOS: Taking to the skies over Manhattan, Webb didn't disappoint with the adrenaline. Doing a 360 loop the loop off the coast of Manhattan, followed by an up-close view of the Statue of Liberty. But Webb understands that this therapy may not be for everybody. He just knows it works for him.WEBB: It's my way of getting into entrepreneurship and flying and aviation and then kind of like taking what I learned in the military and just for me it's been a positive way to kind of deal with my own transition.(END VIDEOTAPE)PARTSINEVELOS: There you have it. I was obviously very excited with being up in the air for that therapy session. But overall, it's really important to raise awareness for mental health and how he found solace in a community, the aviation community and then from there he was able to launch a pretty successful company CrateClub.US. Some really cool stuff on there, survival kits and all that. But nonetheless, I had a great time which is selfishly just saying that. It was a lot of fun.BARTIROMO: Very cool. Thanks, Kristina.PARTSINEVELOS: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Kristina Partsinevelos there.And joining us right now is retired U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel, former congressman and author of the book, Hold Texas, Hold The Nation, Allen West. Colonel, it's great to see you.LT. COL. ALLEN WEST (RET.), FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: It's good to be with you , Maria.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. Your reaction?WEST: Well, you know, one of the reasons why I wear this ring is because on average 20-22 veterans still today are lo -- taking their lives in the United States of America. And this is called the #22killring. And we have to look after these veterans.Later on this month, we'll go down to the Cayman Islands and we take a bunch of veterans who on adaptive training, diving, they have lost limbs, they have spinal cord injuries. And those are the types of things that we need to look to do. So the organization called Dive Pirates and I'm just thrilled to be affiliated with it.MCDOWELL: President Trump really was focused on the suicide rates among veterans and the state of the V.A., particularly when he was running. What has he done in terms of improving the way that our veterans are treated in the medical system, but also in terms of trying to combat the number of suicides?WEST: Well, I think the important thing was the accountability because that was lacking in the V.A. system. Because now you can actually fire people for their lack of good treatment of our veterans. But it's the accessibility also. No veteran should be told that you must go and travel 150 or 200 miles to get to a V.A. medical center or clinic. They should be able to have access to quality healthcare wherever they are, that's an important thing.PEEK: And is that possible now that they can go to a private doctor or whatever? I mean, there was some controversy about that approach. Is that working now?WEST: It's getting better. It's not perfect. But at least we are -- you know, chipping away at the block. The V.A. is a -- is a behemoth. There's no doubt about it. And so I think that -- and it's funny, because the other side does not want to talk about the V.A. because that's really their model of healthcare they'd like to have in the United States of America.BARTIROMO: We have so many issues to talk to you about but we want to go to the border crisis. A federal judge is handing the Trump administration a win this morning, rejecting a lawsuit from the House challenging border wall funding. The judge is ruling that Congress lacks the authority to sue in this case.Meanwhile, lanes are back open at the San Sedro border crossing in San Diego that's after Customs and Border Patrol agents were involved in a shooting last night. A driver attempting to enter the U.S. failed to stop for an inspection.Colonel, your thoughts on what's taking place at the border today. We were at the border about a month ago in El Paso. And it was actually quite stunning to see the children there, being put in the positions that they are in.WEST: Absolutely. And I've been down to the McAllen sector as well which has seen an incredible increase. And what the -- a lot of the drug cartels and people are doing, they're using these children because they know that we are accepting people as family units and after 20 days, you know, they're released into the United States society.So, they're actually recycling kids to come across the border with certain family, quote, unquote, units and then they get them back across and then they get with another group. So this has been an incredible stress that we put to on the border patrol.Now we even seen TSA agents had to be pulled over airports to go down the hill. But as we're looking here at these crossing zones, what's happening out in these other areas where we are pulling away resources to be focused on these crosses zones.HILSENRATH: So Colonel, the president is opening a new front in this effort to tighten the border with Mexico and that's by talking about imposing tariffs. Is that the right strategy? Should we be using tariffs to fight an immigration battle?PEEK: And what can Mexico do?WEST: Well, I mean, I think that Mexico -- you know, there should be a buffer. I mean, when you go down there to the border, you know, these folks are just walking right on up and they're just walking across.So you know, from our border back into Mexico five or 10 miles, there should be some type of control that the Mexican government is not exercising. I mean, you can stand there and look right down a path and see people just walking across.Now, I'm not going to criticize the president because I don't sit down and have all these classified briefings. Maybe he feels that this is a tactic he has to use. But I think one of the critical things we could do is start taxing remittances that are being sent back to these individuals. And I think that we have to stop having these you know, these carrots that we're giving. Because we tell them, just come across the border and this is what you're going to get, you're going to get these social welfare programs and what have you. So I think that's some of the things we have to start looking at as well.MCDOWELL: But if you have tariffs that weaken an economy in Mexico that was already contracting in the first quarter, Colonel, that you make a situation potentially worse for the United States.WEST: Well, sure.MCDOWELL: Because if you have a lack of jobs in Mexico and you deprive the nation of resources to stop the illegal immigrants from crossing from Central America into Mexico and into the United States, it puts us in a worse situation, not a better one.WEST: Yes, I don't know if the president is saying that this is one of those tough stances I've got to start off with and get people to walk back down. But we've got to get Mexico's attention because there's no reason why they should just be opening up and allowing people to transit through their country to come into the United States illegally.PEEK: Does it seem possible that we could actually have sort of centralized locations, two or three in Mexico, where asylum seekers would go?WEST: Absolutely.PEEK: American run but Mexican protected in a sense compounds where people could go apply for asylum and stay there instead of staying in the United States. Because that seems like a reasonable outcome than seeing them --WEST: And again, that was one of the things that exist.BARTIROMO: When you're seeking asylum, you know, you're supposed to seek asylum in the first country that you reach.PEEK: Right.WEST: Absolutely.BARTIROMO: The Mexico, but they're bypassing that because they're obviously looking for economic opportunities. Which is all good -- well and good but the fact is, is they're getting -- they're jumping the line. There are other people waiting for those economic opportunities in the legal way.WEST: There's a right way to do it.HILSENRATH: Would people actually stop at these centers or go straight to the border?WEST: Well, that's where you got to work with Mexico to tell them, you send them to the border. Remember there was an activist judge who said that the Trump administration could not have Mexico do that.PEEK: Right, so I presume we're appealing that or that the government is appealing that decision.WEST: Well, I just think that's none of that judge's business.PEEK: And that's it, there's that.BARTIROMO: Very fascinating stuff. Colonel, please come back soon.WEST: Absolutely.BARTIROMO: You're not with us enough. So we appreciate you joining us this morning.WEST: Thank you so much, Maria.BARTIROMO: Colonel Allen West there.We have breaking news right now, Fiat Chrysler and the French government reportedly resolving key differences on a Renault merger deal. Fiat Chrysler shares are rising this morning on the idea that it will be merging, partnering with Renault. Fiat now up 3-3/4 percent.We are awaiting comments from President Trump and British Prime Minister Theresa May, they will hold a bilateral meeting right now inside of 10 Downing Street. We will bring you their joint news conference in about an hour from now. Stay with us on that.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Facebook shareholders are pushing back. Cheryl Casone with headlines now, Cheryl.CASONE: Pushing back hard, Maria. Good morning again. Shareholders overwhelmingly backing two proposals to weaken CEO Mark Zuckerberg's power. This happened during last week's annual meeting. According to an SEC filing, 68 percent of outside shareholders voted to remove Zuckerberg as chairman in favor of an independent chair. Shareholders are angry about Zuckerberg's handling of Facebook's privacy scandals. The votes are basically symbolic. Zuckerberg has 60 percent of the voting power at the company, but still a headline to mention. The stock is slightly higher in the premarket right now.Tesla making at least $1.7 billion selling tax credits to other car companies. General Motors and Fiat Chrysler just closing the stated dollar worth. They purchased the credits from Tesla to make up for shortfalls in their own zero emissions vehicle sales. This is the first time that automakers are acknowledging that they're turning to Tesla for help to comply with these intensifying environmental regulations. Take a look at shares of Tesla. As you can see, higher by 1-1/4 percent in the premarket.Well, Mercedes-Benz expanding its vehicle subscription service to a third U.S. city. Welcome to the fold, Atlanta. Joining national in Philadelphia in the pilot program. This lets users choose among 50 models for a monthly fee. Other luxury car companies offering similar subscription programs have had, well, some mixed results. But Atlanta is the U.S. headquarters of Mercedes-Benz.OK, IHOP is drifting out of their breakfast lane, sort of. They're going to rename their burgers, pancakes in honor of the brand-new menu offerings. IHOP's been trying to pop up the burgers for a year now. Last year, of course you remember this, they briefly changed their name to IHOB with a B. Costumers weren't happy. They told the chain to stick to breakfast. So, they decided to create a burger. Maria, it's got a pancake in the middle of it. So there's that.BARTIROMO: Pancakes and burgers, come on.CASONE: All together in one big old stack.BARTIROMO: Well, we are talking about them, so there you go.MCDOWELL: There is -- what's really the difference between chicken, fried chicken and waffles? Again, this is burgers and pancakes all in one.HILSENRATH: They tried to rename themselves. Now they're renaming their burgers.BARTIROMO: Right, it's all marketing.HILSENRATH: Sounds like these guys have an identity crisis.BARTIROMO: Yes, I agree.Coming up, Tom versus Tom, Patriots' quarterback Tom Brady trying to trademark Tom terrific. One sports franchise is pushing back on that, though. That's next. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. New York Mets fans throwing a penalty flag toward Patriots' quarterback Tom Brady. Jared Max with sports now, Jared.JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria. For some New Yorkers it's a terrific reason to like the New England quarterback even less. Tom Brady trying to steal a Mets legend nickname. 10 years before, Tom Brady was born, Tom Seaver was the 1967 National League Rookie of the Year. When as a New York Met, he earned the nickname Tom Terrific, a name synonymous with Seaver for more than half a century.But this did not stop the sixth time Super Bowl champ Tom Brady last week for filing for trademark protection for the name Tom terrific. So he can use it to self-clothing, trading cards and such. New Yorkers say why don't you just try to trademark Brady Bunch while you're at it.Today in New York City, there's going to be a rally, 05:00 eastern time. And folks are encouraged to trash their Tom Brady gear. But they call it the Boston T.V. Party, T.P. 12 is that a brand maybe wasn't enough.Speaking of branding, Toronto Raptors Kawhi Leonard has filed suit against Nike. Kawhi claims that Nike went behind his back and copyrighted his personal logo, the Klaw logo. Kawhi claims he designed this over a number of years and agreed to let Nike tweak it and sell it on merchandize but not for them to claim ownership which was granted by the copyright office in May 2017. Kawhi who ended his endorsement with Nike over this wants his logo back.Never before have fans of St. Louis gotten to see their St. Louis Blues win a Stanley Cup final game in St. Louis until last night. Game number four, Blues hosting the Bruins third period tied to two until Ryan O'Reilly creates mayhem for Boston, his second goal of the night. The Blues had an empty netter. They win 4-2 and the series is tied at two.Boston also lost a defenseman Zdeno Chara, headed to the dentist chair. Chara had to get stitched up after he caught a puck in the mouth last night and had to leave the game, ouch.Quarter finals, the French Open today. If Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer win, they will meet in the semifinals. Nadal trying to win his 12th French Open playing Kei Nishikori today. Roger Federer going for the 21st Grand Slam title takes on StanWawrinka.Oh, and Sloane Stephens, one of three American women in the quarter finals today, she will playing Johanna Konta.Maria, you know, just for the record, Tom terrific actually was a cartoon that was part of the "Captain Kangaroo" show that started in the late 50s.BARTIROMO: That's what Liz said. Yes, people are not happy about this, Jared.MAX: Obviously, I'm a Tom Brady fan, always have been. This one rubs me the wrong way.BARTIROMO: Thanks Jared. Catch Jared's sports reports on Fox News Headlines, 24/7 or on Sirius Radio XM 115.Still ahead, my interview with the CEO of Wal-Mart, Doug McMillon is with us this morning, next hour, MORNINGS WITH MARIA, stay with us.Load-Date: June 4, 2019End of Document

Reports Huawei to supply UK networks draw criticismAssociated Press InternationalApril 24, 2019 Wednesday 1:53 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 385 wordsByline: By DANICA KIRKA, Associated PressDateline: LONDON BodyLONDON (AP) - British officials downplayed reports that Prime Minister Theresa May will allow China's Huawei to supply parts of the U.K.'s new internet network, a decision that goes against U.S. pleas to ban the firm as it could help Beijing's spying efforts.British media reported Wednesday that the government will let Huawei work on "non-core" parts of the 5G network, such as antennas, as the country adopts the next generation technology that will provide faster service and connect a broader array of devices to the internet.The decision by the National Security Council was first reported by the Daily Telegraph, which didn't provide a source for the information.Margot James, the government minister for digital and creative industries, said in a tweet that the government hasn't made a final decision, "despite Cabinet leaks to the contrary."Ciaran Martin, head of the National Cyber Security Centre, said at a security conference in Glasgow that the government would announce the decision as part of a larger package of measures designed to ensure the 5G network is as secure as possible."There's a lot more to 5G security than just whether particular companies get particular contracts," he said. "There's a whole framework of improvement we need to make."The United States has been lobbying allies like Britain to exclude Huawei from all 5G networks, noting that the Chinese government can force the company to give it backdoor access to the data on its networks.Huawei officials have denied that the company is a security risk, saying that they have no links to the Chinese government and operate like any other international company.But a key U.K. lawmaker said that allowing Huawei to be involved would increase the risk of cyber espionage by China.Tom Tugendhat, chairman of Parliament's foreign affairs committee, told the BBC that it is very difficult to separate core and non-core components of the 5G network because the technology represents an "exponential increase" in speed and capability.Tugendhat said that while he doesn't doubt the integrity of Huawei officials, they are still bound by Chinese law."This does mean that it is unwise to cooperate on an area of critical national infrastructure, like telecoms, with a state that can best be described as not always friendly," he said.Load-Date: April 25, 2019End of Document

Two charged with stealing aviation secrets from GEUPIApril 24, 2019 Wednesday 10:05 AM ESTCopyright 2019 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 410 wordsByline: NICHOLAS SAKELARISDateline: Dec. 31 BodyA former General Electric engineer and a Chinese businessman have been charged with economic espionage, accused of stealing aircraft turbine designs.A 14-count indictment unsealed Wednesday accuses the men of plotting to steal intellectual property from GE and transfer it to China, . Xiooquin Zheng, 56, of New York has been charged with stealing design models, engineering drawings and configuration files related to steam and gas turbine engines.Zheng pleaded not guilty and was released pending trial. He worked at GE Power &amp; Water in Schenectady, N.Y.Zhaoxi Zhang, 47, of Liaoning Province, China, was also charged. He's believed to be in China. Zhang is Zheng's nephew and business partner.The secrets could be worth millions of dollars."The indictment alleges a textbook example of the Chinese government's strategy to rob American companies of their intellectual property and to replicate their products in Chinese factories, enabling Chinese companies to replace the American company first in the Chinese market and later worldwide," Assistant Attorney General John Demers said. "We will not stand idly by while the world's second-largest economy engages in state-sponsored theft."Michael Wessel, a member of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, said the technology the men were trying to steal goes "to the heart of China's deficit in turbine technology."China hasn't been able to produce jet engines to support its own military and external commercial sales.A few years ago, GE had a joint venture with Chinese-owned AVIC, an aerospace company. AVIC would sell its aviation software in exchange for sales of jet engines."Now it looks like China came back and stole what they don't want to buy," Wessel said.The indictment accuses Zheng of stealing the secrets and emailing them to Zhang to benefit Liaoning Tianyi Aviation Technology, Nanjing Tianyi Avi Tech and other entities, including research institutes and universities. The two men are accused of receiving financial support from the Chinese companies."American businesses spend many hours and large amounts of money developing unique technology," FBI Assistant Director  said. "When such technology is stolen, it can be devastating to U.S. businesses and can result in American workers losing their jobs. China continues to support behavior that violates the rule of law. This case demonstrates the FBI will continue to pursue China's efforts to steal American technology."Load-Date: April 25, 2019End of Document

Focus On Latest Trade News May Lead To Higher Open On Wall StreetCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJune 4, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 2283 wordsBody       The major U.S. index futures are pointing to a higher opening on Tuesday after China's Ministry of Commerce said the U.S.-China trade dispute can only be resolved through further trade talks. Concerns about the economic impact of the trade dispute have recently weighed on the markets, with the recent collapse of U.S.-China trade talks helping to drag the major averages down to multi-month lows. While no new talks are scheduled, a spokesperson for China's Commerce Ministry said, "The Chinese side always believes that the differences and frictions between the two sides in the economic and trade field will ultimately need to be resolved through dialogue and consultation." However, the spokesperson said future talks need to be based on "mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit" and called on the U.S. to "abandon its wrong practices and work in tandem with the Chinese side." The release of the statement comes as both sides have been seeking to blame the other for the breakdown in trade talks last month. In a statement, the U.S. Trade Representative and the U.S. Treasury Department accused China of pursuing a "blame game" while at the same time claiming China had "back-pedaled on important elements of what the parties had agreed to." Technology stocks moved sharply lower over the course of the trading session on Monday, leading to a steep drop by the tech-heavy Nasdaq. The Dow, on the other hand, spent the day bouncing back and forth across the unchanged line. The Nasdaq plunged 120.13 points or 1.6 percent to 7,333.02, ending the session at its lowest closing level in nearly four months. The S&P 500 also fell 7.61 points or 0.3 percent to 2,744.45, while the Dow inched up 4.74 points or less than a tenth of a percent to 24,819.78. The steep drop by the Nasdaq came as tech stocks came under pressure on the heels of reports of antitrust investigations involving several big-name companies. Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) tumbled by 6.1 percent after a report from the Wall Street Journal indicated the Justice Department's antitrust division has been laying the groundwork for an investigation of the company in recent weeks. Shares of Facebook (FB) also plummeted after the Journal said the Federal Trade Commission will lead any antitrust investigation into the social media giant under an arrangement that gives the Justice Department chief oversight of Google. Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) also moved notably lower amid reports the U.S. government's antitrust enforcement agencies have reached an agreement on oversight of the country's top tech companies. Trade concerns also continued to weigh on the markets after an official document from the Chinese government blamed the U.S. for the escalating trade dispute between the world's two largest economies. The white paper, issued by China's State Council Information Office, argued the U.S. is "solely responsible" for the collapse of trade talks. China accused President Donald Trump's administration of continually changing its demands, arguing the setbacks in the talks were all the result of "U.S. breach of consensus and commitments, and backtracking." At a press conference in Beijing on Sunday, Chinese Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen denied Trump's claims that China had been the side seeking to renegotiate a nearly completed agreement. "Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed," Wang said, noting that China remains willing to resolve the trade dispute but only with an agreement that benefits both countries. The escalating global trade tensions led St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard to suggest a reduction in interest rates "may be warranted soon." Bullard said that the Fed faces an economy that is expected to grow more slowly going forward and warned the slowdown could be sharper than expected due to ongoing global trade regime uncertainty. "In addition, both inflation and inflation expectations remain below target, and signals from the Treasury yield curve seem to suggest that the current policy rate setting is inappropriately high," Bullard said in remarks to the Union League Club of Chicago on Monday. He concluded, "A downward policy rate adjustment may be warranted soon to help re-center inflation and inflation expectations at target and also to provide some insurance in case of a sharper-than-expected slowdown." President Donald Trump has been pushing the Fed to lower rates and Bullard's comments suggest igniting a global trade war may lead the central bank to grant the president's wish. In U.S. economic news, the Institute for Supply Management released a report showing the pace of growth in manufacturing activity unexpectedly saw a continued slowdown in the month of May. The ISM said its purchasing managers edged down to 52.1 in May from 52.8 in April, dropping to its lowest level since hitting 51.7 in October of 2016. While a reading above 50 still indicates growth in the manufacturing sector, economists had expected the index to inch up to 53.0. Software stocks showed a substantial move to the downside over the course of the trading session, dragging the Dow Jones U.S. Software Index down by 3.2 percent to a nearly three-month closing low. Considerable weakness also emerged among retail stocks, as reflected by the 1.6 percent drop by the Dow Jones U.S. Retail Index. On the other hand, significant strength remained visible among gold stocks, with the NYSE Arca Gold Bugs Index spiking by 5 percent to its best closing level in well over a month. The rally by gold stocks came amid another sharp increase by the price of the precious metal. Chemical stocks also moved sharply higher over the course of the session, driving the S&P Chemical Sector Index up by 3.9 percent Commodity, Currency Markets  Crude oil futures are falling $0.39 to $52.86 barrel after slipping $0.25 to $53.25 a barrel on Monday. Meanwhile, after jumping $16.80 to $1,327.90 ounce in the previous session, gold futures are dipping $1.10 to $1,326.80 an ounce.  On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 108.22 yen compared to the 108.07 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Monday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.1236 compared to yesterday's $1.1241. Asia Asian stock markets closed mostly lower on Tuesday as worries about rising trade tensions and the impact on global economic growth sapped risk appetite. Tech stocks in Asia followed their U.S. counterparts lower as news of antitrust probes into big tech companies stoked concerns about the sector.  Chinese shares closed lower, extending recent losses amid escalating U.S.-China trade tensions. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index slumped 27.80 points or 1 percent to 2,862.28, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index lost 132.34 points or 0.5 percent to finish at 26,761.52. Japanese shares closed roughly flat with a slightly negative bias in choppy trading amid worries about global economic growth and a stronger safe-haven yen. The benchmark Nikkei 225 Index edged down 2.34 points or less than a tenth of a percent to finish at 20,408.54, falling for the fifth straight session. The major exporters closed mixed on a stronger yen. Mitsubishi Electric advanced almost 3 percent and Panasonic added 0.3 percent, while Sony declined more than 1 percent and Canon dipped 0.3 percent.  Index heavyweight Softbank Group lost more than 3 percent, extending losses from the previous session, while Fanuc rose more than 2 percent and Fast Retailing added 0.3 percent. Meanwhile, Australian shares rebounded from the previous session's losses to close modestly higher, buoyed by the Reserve Bank of Australia's decision to cut interest rates for the first time since August 2016.  The RBA reduced its key interest rate by a quarter point to a historic low, as was widely expected. The board of the Reserve Bank of Australia voted to lower the cash rate to 1.25 percent from 1.50 percent.  The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index rose 11.90 points or 0.2 percent to finish at 6,332.40, while the broader All Ordinaries Index added 5.90 points or 0.1 percent to close at 6,416.70.  Among the major miners, Rio Tinto and BHP Group advanced more than 1 percent each and Fortescue Metals rose 0.6 percent. Gold miners extended gains after gold prices rose for the fourth straight session overnight. Evolution Mining added more than 2 percent and Newcrest Mining rose 0.4 percent. The big four banks advanced after the RBA's decision to cut interest rates. ANZ Banking, Westpac, National Australia Bank and Commonwealth Bank closed higher in a range of 0.4 percent to 0.8 percent. On the other hand, oil stocks mostly fell after crude oil prices extended losses to a fourth straight session. Oil Search slid 1 percent and Woodside Petroleum declined more than 1 percent. Tech stocks followed their U.S. counterparts lower. Altium fell more than 4 percent, Afterpay Touch Group declined almost 4 percent and WiseTech Global edged down 0.2 percent. Coca-Cola Amatil said it would sell its Victoria-based SPC fruit and vegetable processing business to the Shepparton Partners Collective for A$40 million. The company's shares gained more than 2 percent. Mirvac Group's shares added 0.7 percent after the property group said it has agreed to pay A$33.5 million for 40 rental apartments to be built opposite Melbourne's Queen Victoria Market. Incitec Pivot has signed agreements to continue manufacturing operations at its Gibson Island facility in Queensland up to 2022. The fertilizer producer's shares rose 1 percent. Meanwhile, Seoul stocks snapped a three-day winning streak to close lower as weak GDP data and rising trade tensions dented investor sentiment. The benchmark KOSPI Index edged down 0.88 points or less than a tenth of a percent to 2,066.97. The Bank of Korea said in Tuesday's preliminary reading that South Korean gross domestic product was down 0.4 percent in the first three months of 2019. That's down from the 0.3 percent decline suggested in last month's advance estimate and follows the 0.9 percent increase in the fourth quarter of 2018. Market heavyweight Samsung Electronics dipped 0.8 percent, home appliance maker LG Electronics fell almost 3 percent, and memory chipmaker SK Hynix lost more than 2 percent. Europe European stocks have moved mostly higher on Tuesday, with investors betting on hopes central banks will reduce interest rates in order to spur growth.  Australia today reduced its key interest rate by a quarter point to historic low, aiming to create more jobs and bring inflation to target. Investors expect several other central banks around the globe to follow suit. While the German DAX Index has surged up by 1.4 percent, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index and the French CAC 40 Index are both rising by 0.4 percent. Shares of insurer AXA are notably higher after AXA Asia Pacific Ltd., a unit of the group, said it would buy the financial planning business of Challenger Financial Group Ltd for $95 million and in exchange for AXA's annuity portfolio. Bouygues has also moved to the upside after the company reported a 14 percent increase in first-quarter operating profit, driven by large infrastructure contracts and healthy margins at its telecoms unit. On the other hand, shares of financial services provider Hargreaves Lansdown have tumbled after high profile fund manager Paul Woodford suspended trading in his flagship investment fund due to investor exodus. In economic news, U.K. like-for-like retail sales declined unexpectedly in May, falling 3 percent year-on-year. Sales were expected to grow 0.8 percent. Total sales dropped by 2.7 percent. Survey data from IHS Markit showed construction activity in the U.K. also contracted unexpectedly in May. The IHS Markit/Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply construction Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 48.6 in May from 50.5 in April. According to preliminary estimates from Eurostat, eurozone headline inflation eased far more than expected in May to its lowest level in over a year, slowing to 1.2 percent from 1.7 percent in April. Economists had forecast 1.5 percent price growth. Another report from Eurostat said the euro-area unemployment rate dropped to the lowest level since 2008 in April. The unemployment rate came in at 7.6 percent versus 7.7 percent in March.  U.S. Economic Reports Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is scheduled to deliver opening remarks at the Chicago Fed's Conference on Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools And Communication Practices in Chicago, Illinois, at 9:55 am ET. At 10 am ET, the Commerce Department is due to release its report on new orders for manufactured goods in the month of April. Factory orders are expected to drop by 0.9 percent in April after jumping by 1.9 percent in March. Fed Governor Lael Brainard is scheduled to moderate a panel discussion on "What Does Full Employment Look Like for Your Community or Constituency?" at the Chicago Fed Conference at 3:45 pm ET. Stocks In Focus Shares of Coupa Software (COUP) are seeing notable pre-market strength after the business software company reported an unexpected fiscal first quarter profit and raised its full-year guidance. Truck maker Navistar (NAV) may also move to the upside after reporting better than expected fiscal second quarter results and boosting its full-year revenue forecast. On the other hand, shares of Box (BOX) are likely to come under pressure after the cloud storage company reported a narrower than expected fiscal first quarter loss but lowered its revenue guidance for the year. Luxury jewelry retailer Tiffany (TIF) may also see initial weakness after reporting weaker than expected fiscal first quarter revenues and same-store sales.        Load-Date: June 4, 2019End of Document

Chiedi requesting oversight on potential payments made to U.S. entities with partnerships to companies with ties to the Chinese government:We note that the Letter named the Company as a for-profit company from China with ties to the Chinese government.  In fact, we are an international company with our global headquarter in Cambridge, MA in the United States.  The majority of our senior management members (including the Chairman, the CEO, the CSO and CTO) and the majority of our board members are U.S. citizens, and the super majority of our equity interests are held by non-Chinese shareholders.     With respect to the concern of genomic data storage in the Letter, we would like to emphasize that we always separate the genomic data storage for our business in the U.S. and our business in China.  For our U.S. business, we currently use a leading U.S. cloud service provider; and for China-based business, we currently use a leading Chinese cloud service provider (which is not Huawei). We would also like to take this opportunity to reiterate our commitment to preserving the data security and privacy of our partners, customers and users, and we take that commitment very seriously. We continuously work with our customers and industry and government stakeholders to ensure our platform and services adhere to the highest standard in the industry and satisfy all compliance requirements.  View original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/wuxi-nextcode-clarifications-to-public-letter-sent-to-department-of-health-and-human-services-acting-inspector-general-joanne-m-chiedi-300865510.htmlSOURCE WuXi NextCODELoad-Date: June 12, 2019End of Document

Sharing Economy International Reports Full Year 2018 ResultsPR NewswireApril 18, 2019 Thursday 6:30 AM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 3183 wordsDateline: WUXI, Jiangsu Province, China, April 18, 2019 BodyPR NewswireSharing Economy International Inc. ("SEII" or "the Company") (OTC Markets: SEII), a clean technology and sharing economy company that designs, manufactures and distributes of proprietary high and low temperature dyeing and finishing machinery to the textile industry, and is engaged in the development of sharing economy platforms and rental related businesses, today announced its financial results for year ended December 31, 2018."In 2018, our legacy dyeing and finishing business continued to face numerous challenges such as difficult economic conditions, rising raw materials costs and forced closures by the Chinese government which adversely impacted our financial results for the year. We also recorded $8.6 million in impairment losses related to patent use rights and the disposition of manufacturing equipment along with an $8.9 million loss on our solar farm equity method investment following the Chinese government's halt on new solar farm installations and reduced subsidies for solar farms already under construction," said Mr. Jianhua Wu, Chairman and CEO of SEII. "Given the challenges facing our existing manufacturing operations, we continue to look for new growth opportunities for the Company. In 2018, we established new sharing economy businesses in peer-to-peer errand services, coworking and 3D virtual tours, and are making good progress in developing our online rental sharing business in Asia."Mr. Parkson Yip, Vice President of SEII, commented, "While the development of our sharing economy businesses is dependent on additional capital to fund their growth, we made great strides over the last year. In 2018 we launched BuddiGo, our sharing platform that provides on demand delivery of items including packages, flowers, cakes and food delivery by 'buddies' who can spare idle time to run errands in the Hong Kong market. During the year we had over 1,200 individuals officially registered as sell-side buddies and they completed over 500 delivery orders. Meanwhile, 3D Discovery generated over $0.2 million in revenue in 2018 and continues its work on Autocap, a mobile app which allows users to create an interactive virtual tour of a physical space by using a mobile phone camera. Finally, through our agreement with ECrent, we continue our prelaunch activities for our peer-to-peer rental sharing economy in Asia. We remain optimistic about the future of this business and are hopeful it will make a meaningful contribution to our topline in 2019."Full Year 2018 ResultsRevenue for 2018 decreased by 30.9% to $9.5 million, compared to $13.5 million for 2017.  The Company's dyeing and finishing business generated substantially all revenue in 2018, since the forged rolled rings and related products and petroleum and chemical equipment businesses were discontinued in 2016 and the new sharing economy businesses are still in an early stage.  Revenues declined due to an anticipated slowdown in shipments of low-emission airflow dyeing machines as many companies in the dyeing industry had already upgraded to new models and did not require additional equipment, and orders for new low-emission airflow dyeing machines slowed down in 2018 and 2017 as potential customers did not have the financial resources or credit to purchase equipment.  In addition, apparel factories and other factories have been shut down throughout the last year by China's environmental bureau, which has been cutting electricity and gas supply to determine compliance with China's environmental laws, which contributed to the decline in revenues.Gross loss for 2018 was $4.4 million, compared to a gross loss of $156,000 for 2017.  Gross margin was negative 46.4% during 2018 compared to negative 1.2% for 2017. The gross margin for 2018 was primarily impacted by the reduced scale of operations resulting from lower revenues, which is reflected in the allocation of fixed costs, mainly consisting of depreciation, to cost of revenues, and an increase in labor and raw material costs.Operating expenses increased by 135.0% to $28.4 million, compared to $12.1 million in 2017.  The increase was primarily due to higher professional fees in the form of stock-based compensation related to implementing a new business plan with the objective of improving long-term growth, an increase in salaries to support new business opportunities, temporary rent expense and an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts. In addition, the Company recorded impairment losses of approximately $1.9 million related to the write-off its patent of use rights in September 2018 and approximately $6.3 million related to the disposition of manufacturing equipment in December 2018.Other expense was $9.3 million, compared to other expense of $188,000 in 2017. The increase was primarily due to an $8.9 million loss in equity investment in Shengxin, a developer and designer of solar farms in China. In April 2018, Shengxin secured and invested in a large solar PV project in Guizhou province, paid RMB40.0 million for the project rights and also engaged a local contractor to proceed with building the project. However, on June 1, 2018, the Chinese government halted installation of new solar farms for the remainder of the year and reduced subsidies for projects already under construction. Due to significant doubt about the status of this project and recoverability of the Company's investment, the Company fully impaired the value of its investment during the third quarter of 2018.Loss from continuing operations was $42.1 million, or $(7.15) per basic and diluted share, compared to loss from continuing operations of $12.8 million, or $(6.99) per basic and diluted share in 2017.Gain from discontinued operations (Refer to "Discontinued Operations" discussion below) was $16,000, or $0.00 per basic and diluted share.  This compares to loss from discontinued operations of $98,000, or $(0.05) in 2017.Net loss for 2018 was $41.1 million, or $(7.15) per basic and diluted share, compared to net loss of $12.9 million, or $(7.04) per basic and diluted share, in 2017.   Basic and diluted earnings per share were based on 5,753,698 and 1,832,900 weighted average shares outstanding, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. All share and per share information has been adjusted to reflect a 1-for-4 reverse stock split effective March 20, 2017.Financial ConditionAs of December 31, 2018, SEII held cash and cash equivalents of $0.9 million compared to $1.0 million at December 31, 2017.  Accounts receivable were $4.3 million compared to $9.1 million at December 31, 2017.  Inventories were $6.4 million compared to $4.6 million at December 31, 2017.  The Company had $2.3 million in short-term bank loans payable at December 31, 2018, down slightly from $2.5 million at December 31, 2017. Working capital was $10.6 million at December 31, 2018 compared to $13.5 million at December 31, 2017.   Stockholders' equity was $35.4 million at December 31, 2017. In 2018, the Company used $2.5 million in cash flow from operations. The Company used $72,000 in cash flow from investing activities, and generated $2.0 million in cash flow from financing activities, primarily due to proceeds $0.9 million in from the sale of a convertible note, proceeds from the sale of common stock of $0.3 million and advances from a related party of $1.4 million.Discontinued OperationsOn December 30, 2016, the Company sold and transferred 100% of the stock of Wuxi Fulland Wind Energy Equipment Co., Ltd. ("Fulland Wind") to an unrelated party and discontinued the Company's forged rolled rings and related components business. Additionally, the Company's management decided to discontinue its petroleum and chemical equipment segment due to significant declines in revenues and the loss of its major customer. As such, the assets and liabilities of these two segments have been classified on the consolidated balance sheet as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 and the operating results have been classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for all years presented.About Sharing Economy International Inc.Sharing Economy International Inc., through its affiliated companies, designs, manufactures and distributes a line of proprietary high and low temperature dyeing and finishing machinery to the textile industry.

The commercial dispute between China and the EU will pay consumers: IMFCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 24, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 211 wordsBody       Newspapers La Jornada  Friday, May 24, 2019, p. 22  Washington. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned on Thursday that the escalation of trade conflict between the United States and China will threaten the global growth of 2019, which will increase prices for consumers.  In a blog, the IMF's chief economist, Gita Gopinath, warned that the economic damage would be even worse if US President Donald Trump imposes tariffs on all goods imported from China, since that will subtract approximately one third of a percentage point. of the global gross domestic product in the short term.  He also stressed that consumers in the United States and China are unequivocally the losers of commercial tensions.  Meanwhile, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei of lying about his company's ties to the Chinese government, which in turn said that the White House should put an end to its mistakes if wants to continue negotiating.  Meanwhile, the SD Association vetoed Huawei the use of SD and MicroSD memory cards; Toshiba reported that it stopped sending electronic devices and Microsoft removed the MateBook X from its online store.  For its part, Huawei confirmed that the company plans to launch its own operating system later this year. Load-Date: May 24, 2019End of Document

BRITAIN'S THERESA MAY UNDER PRESSURE TO REVERSE HUAWEI DECISIONStates News ServiceApril 28, 2019 SundayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 839 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the Voice of America (VOA):Jamie DettmerBritish Prime Minister Theresa May is being urged by members of her own party and senior intelligence officials to reverse a provisional decision to allow the Chinese technology giant Huawei a role in building parts of Britain's 5G mobile network.They fear giving Huawei even a limited role in developing the country's fifth-generation wireless network risks imperiling Britain's participation in the "Five Eyes" intelligence-sharing arrangement, the U.S.-led Anglophone intelligence pact linking Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Britain.The lobbying for a reversal of the decision is likely to intensify following the publication this week of a report co-authored by a Conservative lawmaker and a former British security adviser that argues, despite Beijing denials, that Huawei is ultimately owned by an entity answerable to the "Chinese party-state apparatus."The report by the London-based Henry Jackson Society says allowing the company access to Britain's next-generation mobile-phone network would compromise security. According to the report, Huawei is 99 percent owned by the Huawei Investment and Holding Trade Union Committee, part of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, a state body.Vice President Mike Pence and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have urged all Western allies to shun Huawei on security grounds, fearing the Chinese telecoms giant will act as a Trojan horse for China's espionage agencies, allowing them to sweep up data and gather intelligence.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo speaks at a news conference at the State Department in Washington, Feb. 1, 2019.In February, Pompeo warned, "If a country adopts this [Huawei] and puts it in some of their critical information systems, we won't be able to share information with them, we won't be able to work alongside them." A U.S. State Department has been sent from Washington to brief British ministers Monday in more detail about American security concerns.Last week, it emerged from leaks that Prime Minister May had decided during a meeting of the country's National Security Council to allow Huawei to build some so-called "non-core" parts of Britain's 5G data network. Her decision came despite the disapproval of some intelligence chiefs and the country's defense and foreign secretaries, Gavin Williamson and Jeremy Hunt, who both fear serious impact on Anglo-American relations.FILE - People look at display models of Huawei Mate20 smartphone series at a launch event in London, Britain, Oct.16, 2018.U.S. warningsThe U.S. National Security Agency has warned that approving Huawei's involvement risks handing China a "loaded gun." A White House official told VOA the issue will likely be raised during U.S. President Donald Trump's state visit to Britain in June.Australia and New Zealand have decided to block or heavily restrict Huawei's involvement in the development of their 5G networks. Huawei denies being controlled by the Chinese government and says its equipment can't be used for espionage purposes. And the Chinese ambassador to Britain, Liu Xiaoming, said Sunday the company has a "good track record" on security.He argued in an article written for Britain's Sunday Telegraph that any blocking of Huawei would be discriminatory and protectionist. "The last thing China expects from a truly open and fair 'global Britain' is a playing field that is not level," he wrote.The envoy urged Britain to ignore U.S. warnings.May's decision has been dubbed naive by some senior members of her ruling Conservative party. Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the British parliament's foreign affairs panel, has warned that allowing Huawei to build some of the 5G infrastructure will "cause allies to doubt our ability to keep data secure" and erode the trust underpinning "Five Eyes."British government officials say under the provisional plan Huawei's participation would be restricted to building transmission equipment, including rooftop aerials and base stations, and wouldn't involve anything to do with core infrastructure, where billing and customer details are stored. Some British cyber-security officials say this would be sufficient to mitigate any security risks; others say the distinction is manginess.The dispute over Huawei is playing out during a visit to China by Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond, who's hoping to expand economic ties with China ready for when Britain leaves the European Union.In Beijing Friday, Hammond praised the "truly epic ambition" of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a massive trillion-dollar trade, investment and infrastructure program launched in 2015 to spur trade along land and sea routes linking Asia, Africa and Europe.Some observers suggest Theresa May's Huawei decision should be seen in the light of Britain's search for post-Brexit deals to replace the expected losses resulting from the country's departure from the European Union. British government officials say there's no connection.Load-Date: April 28, 2019End of Document

WORKING WITH OTHER MARKETS: PATHWAYS, SUBMISSIONS AND STRATEGIESStates News ServiceApril 3, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1426 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: ROCKVILLE, MD BodyThe following information was released by the Regulatory Affairs Professionals Society:Feature articles in March explored working with other markets including global regulatory pathways in China, Japan and New Zealand, the regulation of animal drugs and veterinary medical devices and the complex regulatory pathway for drugs to treat orphan/rare pediatric diseases. Other articles explored risk management and medial device software.Global Regulatory PathwaysSenior regulatory consultant, Yingying Liu, discusses Chinese pharmaceutical regulatory issues from two perspectives: the regulatory organizational structure of the responsible government bodies and the regulatory legislative system in Chinas New, Faster Marketing Authorization Approval Program. Liu reviews changes initiated by the Chinese government aimed at manufacturing and marketing significantly more drugs and encouraging faster delivery of novel drug accessibility to patients in China. Topics include clinical trial review and approval, marketing authorization applications and special pathways.The Chinese Pharmaceutical Market Today discusses recent pharmaceutical regulatory changes in China aimed at improving the speed of drug innovation, development and clinical trials testing in an effort to get drugs to Chinese patients faster. Regulatory expert Mingping Zhang explores the specific policy changes after the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) was renamed the National Medical Products Administration, (NMPA) and subsequently joined the International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH). The author reviews recent regulations aimed at expanding sites for clinical trials, accelerating the clinical trials process and providing better clinical trial data integrity.Regulatory experts Bill Sietsema, Hiroshi Takagi, Tetsuro Seki, Mayumi Miyata, Atsuhiko Kawamoto and Doug Losordo review the latest revision of Japans Pharmaceuticals, Medical Devices and other Therapeutic Products (PMD) Act and outline the history and benefits of the SAKIGAKE designation system. In Japans SAKIGAKE Designation System, the authors share details about the criteria for SAKIGAKE designation and the procedures and timing of SAKIGAKE designation.The current regulatory scheme for medicines in New Zealand (NZ) comprises the 1981 Medicines Act 1981 and the Medicines Regulations 1984. The NZ government intends to replace this out-dated regulatory scheme with a new, comprehensive regulatory scheme that covers all therapeutic products and is aligned with international regulatory norms. Renowned professor and program director at the University of South Wales, Orin Chisholm explores New Zealands efforts to update its current pharmaceutical regulatory legislation in place since the early 1980s. New Zealands New Regulatory Regime for Therapeutic Products outlines many of the outdated provisions in the 1981 Medicines Act and the 1984 Medicines Regulation, provides a look at key changes built into the draft of the Therapeutics Products Bill (now open for comment until 18 April 2019) and presents a comprehensive table comparing the 1980s legislation and regulations to provisions in the draft of the new Bill.Animal DrugsAnimal drugs and human drugs are regulated similarly in many aspects. However, there are significant differences between them requiring specialized training and experience for planning and submitting animal drug applications to regulatory bodies. In addition, while many countries have similar regulations governing human and animal drugs, the regulatory authority for animal drugs may be under the health authority, including FDA, EMA, Health Canada, South African Health Product Regulatory Authority or Ministry of Agriculture (e.g., Brazil, China, Japan). Biomedical regulatory expert Grace Gowda shares her knowledge in Planning and Submission Considerations for Animal Drugs, and discusses the comprehensive planning and streamlining submission considerations by animal health companies to decrease development cost and registration time for animal drugs. The planning and submission considerations are not limited to one country or region but are for worldwide registration of the animal drug. The author covers regulatory pathway considerations, technical requirements and quality, safety and efficacy. The article does not cover vaccines or pesticides.Global regulatory experts Fabrizio Bertani, Melinda Mayfield, Viviana Mascilongo and Sharnee Nichols provide their perspective on the changing regulatory framework for veterinary medical devices .In Veterinary Borderline Products, Veterinary Medical Devices and In Vitro Diagnostics: Global Regulatory Overview, the authors site specific examples and related guidelines for manufacturers and distributors within Europe and territories in Switzerland and the UK.Orphan/Rare DiseasesBecause pediatric medicines and treatments for orphan/rare diseases are considered for unmet medical needs, there has been little development in this area. This was due in part because of the difficulty in conducting clinical trials for rare diseases and concerns associated with a possible smaller return on investment following launch as compared to medicines licensed for common diseases. Parexel experts Bridget Heelan, Victor (Long) Cheng , Nobuyuki Yamagata share their experiences in the complex design of regulatory pathways for orphan/rare pediatric diseases in China, Europe and Japan. While these regions do not have specific regulatory pathways for rare paediatric diseases as separate entities, the relevant paediatric regulations and pathways for approval are explored. Regulatory Pathways for Orphan/Rare Pediatric Diseases: Global Overview touches on legislation, criteria for orphan drug designation and regulation, reviews and expedited pathways, incentives and advantages for applicants, such as exclusivity and protection, and gaining marketing approval.Risk ManagementOver the last 10 to 15 years, with the publication of ICH Q9, risk assessment became a regulatory requirement in the pharmaceutical industry, as well as all areas of medical product development. The concept is expanding over the whole of the life science industry and even the ubiquitous ISO 9001-2015 quality standard is leading practically all businesses to implement risk assessment as a part of their quality system. It is an area always under development and there is a need for continued discussion and exchange of experiences. To address the issue, risk expert Milena Samban explores the need for risk management in the healthcare industry from a personal viewpoint in the article Risk Management: A Difficult to Implement Regulatory Requirement.Medical Device SoftwareThree global regulatory experts, Melissa Walker, Sara Jafari and Bakul Patel share their insights into what software can be considered a medical device at the 2018 RAPS Regulatory Convergence. Computer software used in healthcare device applications developed for demographic data gathering, physical examinations or therapies are increasingly part of the regulatory landscape. In their article, Is Your Software a Medical Device? the experts explore whether and when computer software, used in a variety of ways in healthcare is, in itself, a medical device. The authors report on recent software and application regulations in both the European Union where medical device regulations were recently revised and the US, where the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for determining how and when software may or may not be considered a medical device.Whats Coming in AprilAprils theme is a global look at biosimilars, and weve lined up some of the top regulatory experts to share their insights on similarity approach for complex drugs: biologics and Non-Biological Complex Drugs (NBCDs), comparing data requirements for the approval of biosimilars versus reference medicines and optimizing clinical trials to support the marketing approval of biosimilars. Other articles will explore manufacturing controls at commercial scalea major hurdle for the cell and gene therapy industry, Chinese health policy and regulatory authority overview, the importance of risk management for over-the-counter drugs andMRD as a surrogate endpoint for product development in Multiple Myeloma: FDA vs EMA guidance.

Wall Street Volatility Likely To Persist Amid Lingering Trade WorriesCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 22, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1815 wordsBody       The major U.S. index futures are pointing to a lower opening on Wednesday following the notable advance seen over the course of the previous session. Stocks are likely to move back to the downside as traders continue to worry the trade dispute between the U.S. and China is escalating into a full-fledged trade war. A report from the South China Morning Post said Chinas is re-examining the entire bilateral economic relationship between the U.S. and China. The SCMP said Chinese government advisers are highlighting the risk of sourcing critical supplies from an increasingly hostile U.S. following the Trump administration's recent move to blacklist Chinese tech giant Huawei. Mei Xinyu, a fellow at the research institute under China's Ministry of Commerce, told the SCMP that Beijing should prepare for the worst-case scenario to defend its rights in climbing up the global value chain through technological catch-up. "Even if a deal is reached, it could be torn apart [by President Donald Trump] easily at any time," Mei said, comparing the current trade talk deadlock to the Panmunjom peace talks during the Korean War. Potentially adding to the trade concerns, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin recently told CNBC's Ylan Mui the U.S. has no plans to go to Beijing to resume trade negotiations. Later in the session, trading may be impacted by reaction to the release of the minutes of the latest Federal Reserve meeting. The minutes may shed additional light on the outlook for interest rates but could also be viewed as old news considering the constantly shifting developments on the trade front. With the markets continuing to show intense sensitivity to trade-related news, stocks showed a strong move back to the upside during the trading day on Tuesday after moving mostly lower over the course of Monday's session. The major averages ended the day firmly in positive territory. The Dow climbed 197.43 points or 0.8 percent to 25,877.33, the Nasdaq jumped 83.35 points or 1.1 percent to 7,785.72 and the S&P 500 advanced 24.13 points or 0.9 percent to 2,864.36. The rebound on Wall Street came in reaction to news that the U.S. Commerce Department has temporarily eased trade restrictions on Chinese tech giant Huawei. The Commerce Department issued a temporary license authorizing specific, limited engagement in transactions involving the export, re-export, and transfer of items to Huawei for 90 days. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the temporary reprieve grants "operators time to make other arrangements and the Department space to determine the appropriate long term measures for Americans and foreign telecommunications providers that currently rely on Huawei equipment for critical services." "In short, this license will allow operations to continue for existing Huawei mobile phone users and rural broadband networks," he added. The move by the Trump administration led U.S. tech giant Google to reverse an earlier decision and announce it will continue to work with Huawei over the next 90 days. Tech stocks rebounded on the news after falling sharply in the previous session amid reports of companies cutting off supplies to Huawei. Meanwhile, traders largely shrugged off a report from the National Association of Realtors showing an unexpected drop in existing home sales in the month of April. NAR said existing home sales dipped by 0.4 percent to an annual rate of 5.19 million in April after plunging by 4.9 percent to a rate of 5.21 million in March.  The continued decrease came as a surprise to economists, who had expected existing home sales to jump by 2.7 percent to a rate of 5.35 million. Semiconductor stocks turned in some of the market's best performances on the day after falling sharply in the previous session. Reflecting the rebound by the sector, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index spiked by 2.1 percent after plunging by 4 percent on Monday. Substantial strength also emerged among biotechnology stocks, as reflected by the 2.2 percent jump by the NYSE Arca Biotechnology Index.  Natural gas, steel, computer hardware and oil service stocks also saw considerable strength on the day, moving higher along with most of the other major sectors. Commodity, Currency Markets  Crude oil futures are tumbling $0.86 to $62.27 a barrel after edging down $0.08 to $63.13 a barrel on Tuesday. Meanwhile, after falling $4.10 to $1,273.20 an ounce in the previous session, gold futures are rising $3.40 to $1,276.60 an ounce. On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 110.34 yen compared to the 110.50 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Tuesday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.1170 compared to yesterday's $1.1161. Asia Asian stocks ended Wednesday's session on a muted note despite the U.S. temporarily lifting a ban on American businesses working with Chinese telecom giant Huawei. Markets kept an eye on the minutes of the latest Federal Reserve meeting due out later in the day as a protracted trade war threatens to depress global economic growth.  The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has lowered the 2019 global growth outlook as escalating trade disputes hurt manufacturing and investment decisions.  In its latest Economic Outlook, the Paris-based think tank forecast 3.2 percent growth for 2019 versus 3.3 percent estimated in March. China's Shanghai Composite Index ended down 14.26 points or 0.5 percent at 2,891.70 as trade tensions continued to linger. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index inched up 48.70 points or 0.2 percent to 27,705.94. In a speech in Jiangxi, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for the people to "start again" and begin a modern "long march," in a dramatic sign that Beijing is preparing for a protracted trade war with the U.S. Japanese shares ended largely unchanged after the New York Times reported that the Trump administration is considering placing limits on Chinese video surveillance firm Hikvision's ability to buy U.S. technology. Investors also reacted to mixed economic data and comments by Bank of Japan board member Yutaka Harada that monetary easing should be strengthened further without delay. Japanese exports fell for a fifth straight month in April, in a sign of weakness in external demand. On the positive side, the country's core private-sector machinery orders rose for the second straight month. The Nikkei 225 Index crept up 10.92 points or 0.1 percent to 21,283.37, while the broader Topix closed 0.3 percent lower at 1,546.21. Exporters such as Canon, Sony and Panasonic closed lower despite a weaker yen. Index heavyweights Softbank and Fanuc slid around half a percent, while Fast Retailing rose 1 percent.  Australian shares inched higher even as overall gains remained limited amid fears that a protracted trade war between the United States and China could harm demand for Australian products.  The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index rose 10.60 points or 0.2 percent to 6,510.70, while the broader All Ordinaries index ended up 13.70 points or 0.2 percent at 6,598.10. Banks ended flat to slightly lower after the country's financial regulator said it may impose additional capital requirements on some financial institutions. Westpac Banking Corp shares climbed 1.1 percent.  Mining heavyweights BHP and Rio Tinto eked out modest gains amid record higher iron ore prices. Smaller rival Fortescue Metals Group slumped over 8 percent on going ex-dividend.  Gold miner Evolution Mining dropped 2.4 percent and Northern Star declined 1.9 percent as gold prices held near a two-week low.  Construction materials supplier James Hardie rallied 2.2 percent as Australia's prudential regulator eased lending criteria for home loans. Seoul stocks recovered from an early slide to end modestly higher for the day. The Kospi rose 3.61 points or 0.2 percent to 2,064.86. Europe European stocks are trading mixed on Wednesday as global trade tensions linger and investors look ahead to the release of the Fed meeting minutes for direction.  Investors remain worried about a protracted U.S.-China trade war after the New York Times reported that the Trump administration is considering placing limits on Chinese video surveillance firm Hikvision's ability to buy U.S. technology. Ahead of the release of the Fed minutes, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said there is a case for lowering interest rates if inflation doesn't appear on track to rise back to desired levels. While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index is just above the unchanged line, the German DAX Index and the French CAC 40 Index are down by 0.4 percent and 0.5 percent, respectively. Royal Mail has jumped after announcing it would introduce a second daily delivery of parcels, to be fully operational by 2023. Online trading major IG Group Holdings has also moved sharply higher on the day after unveiling a plan to drive growth. On the other hand, British retailer Marks & Spencer has tumbled after it reported a 10 percent drop in full-year profit, marking a third straight decline. In economic news, U.K. consumer price inflation accelerated in April, while output price inflation eased slightly, figures from the Office for National Statistics revealed. U.S. Economic Reports New York Federal Reserve Bank John Williams is scheduled to deliver opening remarks at the Economic Press Briefing on Homeownership and Housing in New York at 10 am ET. At 10:10 am ET, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic and Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan are due to give opening remarks at the Dallas Fed's Technology-Enabled Disruption: Implications for Business, Labor Markets and Monetary Policy conference in Dallas, Texas. The Energy Information Administration is scheduled to release its report on oil inventories in the week ended May 17th at 10:30 am ET. Crude oil inventories are expected to decrease by 2.5 million barrels after jumping by 5.4 million barrels in the previous week. At 2 pm ET, the Fed is due to release the minutes of its latest monetary policy meeting, which may shed additional light on the outlook for interest rates. Stocks In Focus Shares of Qualcomm (QCOM) are moving sharply lower in pre-market trading after a federal judge ruled the communications chip maker violated antitrust, suppressing competition and using its dominant position to exact excessive licensing fees. Home improvement retailer Lowe's (LOW) is also likely to come under pressure after reporting weaker than expected fiscal first quarter earnings and lower its full-year profit forecast. Shares of Nordstrom (JWN) are also likely to see initial weakness after the department store operator reported first quarter results that missed estimates on both the top and bottom lines and cut its full-year guidance.  On the other hand, shares of Target (TGT) are moving significantly higher in pre-market trading after the retail giant reported better than expected first quarter results.        Load-Date: May 22, 2019End of Document

The Huawei Drama Is a Gift to U.S. Tech CompaniesAtlantic OnlineMay 21, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 827 wordsByline: Alexis C. MadrigalBodyThe two biggest geopolitical rivals in the world have begun to land blows in the battle to control the world's most important consumer technologies: the next-generation wireless internet and the mobile devices that will use it.Last week, Donald Trump's administration placed Huawei on a            blacklist, which makes it difficult for American companies to do business with the Chinese smartphone and network-equipment maker. American intelligence officials have openly worried that Huawei's equipment could and would be compromised by Chinese intelligence officials. How the ban might actually intersect with the world's deeply interwoven technological systems is still unclear, especially after the announcement            of a temporary reprieve. But in the most recent major development, Google will cut off some of Huawei's access to its mobile operating system, Android,            according to reports.Step back from the details of the back-and-forth-of intelligence-official whisper campaigns,            delicate negotiations and smoke signaling between Western allies, Canadian officials            detaining Huawei's CFO (who is also the founder's daughter), and            complex corporate-espionage schemes-and look at the bigger contours of the fight. Huawei calls what's happening a "           well-coordinated geopolitical campaign," and it may well be right.Huawei's connections to the Chinese military and state-security apparatus have raised the hackles of American intelligence officers and politicians since 2005, when a congressional report noted that "industrial espionage is an active tool of China's strategy for technological development." So why is this story blowing up now?The easy answer is to look at Huawei itself. The company has shown            tremendous growth and innovation capability,            becoming the market leader in some types of wireless-infrastructure equipment. Wireless infrastructure is            more important than it used to be, too.But there is an American side to this battle over control of the global internet infrastructure-and it's not purely based in security concerns. Beginning six years ago, when Edward Snowden revealed the extent of            American internet surveillance, and then through the            downward spiral of trust in Facebook, accelerating in            the aftermath of the 2016 election, and expressed most purely in recent            antipathy toward Uber, the tech industry is no longer America's darling. There was a tech mythology centered on the salutary power of innovation, and            it collapsed.Already, tech appears to be            exacerbating inequality. Long term, artificial intelligence could            multiply that impact.Now, no matter what your politics, it's            good politics to punch the tech industry. Some Democratic presidential candidates are            pushing to break up big tech companies, and President Trump is collecting            social-media grievances.So what's a highly profitable industry to do?American tech needs a new narrative about its importance to the nation, and there is no better position for the companies than as the stalwart defenders against our greatest geopolitical rival, China. The greater the frenzy about Huawei and the Chinese tech challenge, the better for a challenged industry.The Chinese threat helps the tech industry answer tough questions that have been raised about its impact on Western democracies.Worried about tech's surveillance of your everyday activities? Well, the Chinese have an            even more invasive surveillance system.Don't like the            (near-)monopolistic position that tech companies have in their core markets? If you hurt American Big Tech, you're only opening up the field for Chinese entrants.           Want to break up Facebook? Its toughest challenger since Snapchat, the beloved new            social-media app TikTok, is owned by            a Chinese company, ByteDance.Want to ratchet up the congressional pressure on tech companies to give            far-right viewpoints stronger oversight? Tech can point to the Chinese government, which is known to            censor and shape political discourse online, as a kind of anti-pattern, the bottom at the end of the interventionist slippery slope.Worried about the            breakneck developments in AI and their            deployment across the national-security apparatus?            But the Chinese.            But the Chinese!            But the Chinese!?American power players love nothing more than a hegemonic challenge to catalyze and justify their actions. For most of the post-World War II era, much of scientific and technological development has been routed through            the lens of the Cold War. Historians have shown how it warped priorities in fields as disparate as            biomedicine and            oceanography, and, of course, in            the DARPA-backed development of the networking technologies that turned into the internet.There is certainly some truth to the threat the United States faces from Chinese competitors backed by their country's resources. But the reason this story will dominate headlines for the foreseeable future is not the underlying reality of the Chinese position in technology, but its political utility for politicians and CEOs alike.Load-Date: May 22, 2019End of Document

Google Halts Plan to Sever Ties With HuaweiUSNEWS.comMay 21, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 U.S. News & World Report All Rights ReservedSection: CIVIC; National News; Vol.; No.Length: 366 wordsByline: Alan NeuhauserHighlight: The announcement came as the U.S. Commerce Department granted a 90-day reprieve to the Chinese telecom giant, whose close ties to the Chinese government have sparked concerns about spying.BodyGoogle on Tuesday announced that it is halting its plans to sever ties with the Chinese telecom giant Huawei. [SEE:The Week in Cartoons for May 20-24]The about-face comes roughly 24 hours after Google roiled the tech sector and global markets by stating that it would cut ties with Huawei, the world's second-largest smartphone maker by market share, in light of the Trump administration's decision to place Huawei on the so-called Entity List, an export blacklist comprised of companies and other groups deemed to pose a threat to U.S. national security interests. However, the U.S. Commerce Department on Monday granted at least a temporary reprieve, issuing a 90-day license that allows internet service providers and mobile phone companies to continue working with Huawei through Aug. 19. The move is ostensibly designed to allow Google to continue providing updates to Huawei devices, helping protect users from security risks, and to keep phone networks online. "Keeping phones up to date and secure is in everyone's best interests and this temporary license allows us to continue to provide software updates and security patches to existing models for the next 90 days," Google said in a           statement. The Commerce department has said it will review whether to extend the license period. Huawei was one of 69 groups added to the Entity List. [READ:China Values Free Trade Slightly More Than the U.S.]The decision to bar Huawei from receiving U.S. exports marked the latest escalation in the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China. The company has a close relationship with the Chinese government, prompting concerns about spying. It spent about $11 billion last year buying components from U.S. firms such as Micron Technology, Intel and Qualcomm, according to CNBC, about 15% of the $70 billion that Huawei spent buying components worldwide. Close to half the company's phones went to markets outside China. Alan Neuhauser covers law enforcement and criminal justice for U.S. News & World Report.

Inhofe, R-Oklahoma, on June 11.Continues from Part 2 of 3National Security Agency Cyber Centers of Academic ExcellenceThe committee is aware of the National Security Agency (NSA) National Centers of Academic Excellence (CAE) in Cyber Defense and Cyber Operations, a joint NSA and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) program to promote higher education and research in cyber defense and produce professionals with cyber defense expertise. The committee is encouraged by the university participation in this program and believes that this program is critical to developing a cyber workforce for the Department of Defense (DOD).The committee notes that these academic institutions have met designated criteria for selection and have constructed their programs around cyber technologies and techniques that are critical to intelligence, military, and law enforcement organizations. The committee believes that these NSA CAEs are a resource that should be more effectively engaged by the Department to provide mission-critical support to the DOD, including in cybersecurity research, cyber operational training, cyber strategies and best practices, supply chain and security economics, and cyber domain studies. The committee believes that the work of, as well as the workforce emerging from, these academic institutions should be more widely used to meet DOD needs. The committee believes that emphasis should be placed on institutions that have received all three NSA CAE designations: cyber defense education, cyber defense research, and cyber operations.Therefore, the committee directs the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering and the Chief Information Officer to provide a briefing to the congressional defense committees by January 1, 2020, on the current and potential future utilization of the NSA CAE institutions as feeder schools, research partners, and key partners of the DOD cyber enterprise. The briefing shall include, at a minimum, an evaluation of additional ways that the DOD could employ the capabilities of NSA CAE institutions and recommendations for programs that could be established to further strengthen the partnership between the DOD and the NSA CAEs.Nuclear Posture Review implementationThe 2018 Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) states that the B83-1 and B61-11 nuclear bombs will be retained in the stockpile, due to their ability to hold at risk a variety of protected targets, at least until suitable replacements are identified. The committee understands that, as part of its implementation of the NPR, the Department of Defense is conducting an assessment of hard and deeply buried targets and options to credibly hold those targets at risk consistent with deterrence requirements. The committee directs the Secretary of Defense to brief the Senate Armed Services Committee on the results of this review not later than 60 days after the date of the enactment of this Act.Pilot program authority to enhance cybersecurity and resiliency of critical infrastructureSection 1650 of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (Public Law 115-232) established a pilot authority for the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Secretary of Homeland Security, to provide technical cyber personnel to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to enhance cooperation, collaboration, and unity in government efforts to protect critical infrastructure. The committee believes that a robust partnership between the Department of Defense (DOD) and the DHS is critical to both organizations. The committee is pleased to learn of the use of this authority during the defense of the 2018 midterm elections and encourages the Departments to continue use of this authority. The committee also encourages the Departments to expand the use of this authority to include DOD support to DHS for red-teaming and tabletop exercises, cybersecurity assessments of commercial critical infrastructure relevant to DOD installations, and other mutually beneficial activities.Reducing barriers to service in U.S. Space ForceThe committee acknowledges the absolute necessity of recruiting the Nation's best talent in science, technology, engineering, and math to serve in the U.S. Space Force in order sustain a competitive advantage in the space domain. Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to craft the personnel regulations of the U.S. Space Force with the intent to open accession into the U.S. Space Force to the widest possible pool of talent while meeting military standards by limiting, to the maximum extent possible, restrictions based on physiological conditions. The committee directs the Secretary of Defense to brief the congressional defense committees, not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, on the medical and physical standards and requirements that will apply to members of the U.S. Space Force, the justification associated with each requirement, and a comparison to the current requirements that exist in the U.S. Air Force. This briefing should also include any recommended changes to statute that may inhibit efforts to make the broadest recruiting pool available to the U.S. Space Force.Report on Mobile User Objective SystemThe Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) is the Department of Defense's (DOD) next-generation narrowband military satellite communications system designed to provide increased narrowband communications capacity and capability. The committee is concerned that synchronizing delivery of the MUOS space and ground segments with the Army's compatible Handheld, Manpack, and Small Form Fit Radios remains a challenge.Consequently, the committee directs the Comptroller General of the United States to review: (1) The challenges to enabling effective use of MUOS satellites and what the Department is doing to address them; (2) Planning efforts underway to determine a MUOS follow-on capability; and (3) What the Department is doing to avoid disconnects in fielding satellite and ground segments going forward. The committee directs the Comptroller General to brief its preliminary observations to the congressional defense committees no later than March 1, 2020, with a final report to follow on a mutually agreed upon date.Report on using existing intelligence sensors for ballistic missile defenseThe committee notes that ballistic missile threats are evolving in complexity and that the U.S. Strategic Command Commander has stated that our ability to see and characterize a missile threat is the most important aspect of a successful missile defense system for the U.S. homeland. The committee recognizes that, while there are challenges associated with developing, procuring, and deploying new sensors capable of meeting enhanced and evolving threats, the U.S. intelligence community has numerous ground- and sea-based sensor platforms currently performing measurement and signature intelligence (MASINT) collection that provide missile tracking data. The recent Missile Defense Review describes such "existing intelligence-gathering sensors with a demonstrated capability to track offensive missiles that could be incorporated into U.S. homeland and regional missile defense architectures." It is the committee's understanding that these are very capable sensors, providing key intelligence regarding missile development that is used by the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) to design and acquire missile tracking and defense systems and performing multiple missions including MASINT, space surveillance, and missile defense. The committee encourages the Department of Defense and the intelligence community to collaborate and optimize existing U.S. MASINT sensors to improve our ability to see and characterize missile threats to enhance the defense of the U.S. homeland.Therefore, the committee directs the Director of the MDA, in coordination with the intelligence community, to provide a report to the committee no later than December 1, 2019, detailing the ability to integrate current U.S. ground- and sea-based MASINT sensors into the U.S. homeland missile defense architecture. The report shall include the existing participation of U.S. intelligence sensor assets in the ballistic missile defense system, including intelligence support to defense system design and acquisition, as well as the operational impacts, costs, and timelines associated with activating a U.S. homeland missile defense mission for each sensor.Security and resiliency of decision-making technologiesThe committee remains concerned that America's adversaries continue to enhance their cyber capabilities with the intention of penetrating the Department of Defense's (DOD) secure communications infrastructure. To counter this challenge, the committee encourages the DOD to ensure that critical decision- making technologies remain secure and resilient in the face of current and future cyber threats.When developing an acquisition strategy and analysis of alternatives for the construction of or upgrades to those command and control centers with combat, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance responsibilities, the committee directs DOD procurement and acquisition officers to consider mission effectiveness and operational suitability, including factors such as: (1) The security risk of components and devices responsible for the routing and dissemination of information and mitigation measures like the isolation of network communications and integrity of firmware or software; (2) The security risk of components and devices that are not sourced and manufactured domestically; and (3) Physical, logistical, or operational measures to mitigate insider threats.Social network analysis for counterterrorismExtremists and terrorist organizations are using internet- based tools like social media and digital communication as a means to spread propaganda and to target U.S. security interests around the world. The committee notes that universities, colleges, and other academic institutions perform important research on the use of these online tools by extremists and terrorist organizations and that such research may be beneficial to the Department of Defense's (DOD) understanding of this rapidly evolving operating environment and DOD's development of related strategies. As such, the committee encourages the DOD to continue its collaboration with these universities, colleges, and academic institutions on these efforts, as appropriate.Software defined networking and network and cybersecurity orchestrationThe committee included a provision in the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (Public Law 115-232) that directed the Principal Cyber Adviser (PCA), the Chief Information Officer (CIO), and the Commander of U.S. Cyber Command (CYBERCOM) to designate a network on which to conduct a demonstration and evaluation of commercial technology to enable network nodes and security systems to communicate with one another and to be orchestrated to ingest, publish, subscribe, tip and cue, and request and direct information and actions from each other.The committee has since learned that the National Security Agency (NSA) has conducted a multi-year effort to define and enable Integrated Adaptive Cyber Defense (IACD) in cooperation with commercial industry, the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, and the Department of Homeland Security. The IACD effort has been working to mature the very technology that the committee intended the Department of Defense to demonstrate: commercial companies are offering cybersecurity orchestration tools and services for connecting together all cybersecurity systems, agents, applications, and appliances deployed on a network and synchronizing their actions with a high degree of automation and agility. These orchestration platforms also provide capabilities to rapidly create new workflows and event sequences.The committee is also aware of initiatives underway within the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) to adopt and adapt commercial and open source tools and services for software-defined networking (SDN) for provisioning, access, configuration, and agile control of networks, data centers, and clouds. DISA SDN architects believe that cybersecurity orchestration should nest under and ultimately be connected to and be controlled by a "global orchestration" engine at the enterprise network level.The committee believes that these capabilities are critical and should be carefully evaluated for integration into command and control nodes like the Joint Cyber Command and Control platform, the cybersecurity service provider operations centers, and network operations centers. In addition, the Cyber Protection Teams should be able to connect into the orchestration control plane for orchestration of network sensors and agents.The committee directs the PCA, in coordination with the CIO, the Joint Staff J6, and the Commander of CYBERCOM, to: review the capabilities and offerings of the companies that the NSA has nurtured around cybersecurity orchestration technology; review the DISA-led SDN and network orchestration initiatives; and develop a plan, an architecture, and requirements for integrating these technologies and capabilities into the Department of Defense Information Network, the cloud strategy, and the operational cyber defense systems of the Department. The committee directs the Secretary of Defense to brief the congressional defense committees on the status of this effort by February 15, 2020.Space Fence Site 2The committee recognizes the importance of delivering actionable battle management knowledge to warfighters as they defend space assets as well as the criticality of providing space situational awareness (SSA) data to enable safe space traffic management and to avoid future collisions that could render certain orbital regimes unusable. The importance of space assets to both national defense and the world economy, the development of multiple new mega-constellations, consisting of thousands of satellites, and the growing threats to space assets by China, Russia, and other nations demand more accurate and timelier battle management/SSA data. The Space Fence is the Department of Defense's newest and most capable SSA system that can provide unparalleled capabilities, both in Low Earth Orbit where the new mega-constellations including the Space Sensor Layer are being built and satellites are most vulnerable, and in Geosynchronous Earth Orbit where satellites have persistent strategic advantages.The committee is aware that the Department's Space Fence contract includes an option for a second Space Fence site and directs the Secretary of the Air Force to consider funding the option and beginning construction of Space Fence Site 2 in fiscal year 2021. The system has a stable design with high technology and manufacturing readiness levels, and the cost estimate is considerably less than Space Fence Site 1 due to knowledge gained during construction of the first site. Space Fence Site 2 would increase resiliency of the Space Surveillance Network, improve accuracy, timeliness, and custody of low altitude objects, increase southern hemisphere coverage, and significantly enhance deep space coverage. The committee directs the Secretary to provide a report to the congressional defense committees, not later than February 28, 2020, on the decision as to whether to fund a second Space Fence site and the reasons for such a decision.Space industrial base of the People's Republic of ChinaThe committee recognizes the critical importance of the emerging small satellite and small launch vehicle sectors to the future economic competitiveness and national security of the United States. However, the committee is concerned about the rapid growth of the Chinese commercial space sector that is supported by the Chinese government through technology assistance, state-backed venture investments (including investments in U.S. companies that ultimately lead to intellectual property leakage to the People's Republic of China), state-backed industrial espionage, and major national initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative.The committee understands that in the last 4 years more than 60 small commercial space companies have emerged in China. These companies are focused on leveraging the technology advancements of low-cost small satellites and launch vehicles to lead and dominate global markets. As a result, these companies have been able to enter the international marketplace with costs that are 3 to 4 times less than comparable U.S. companies.Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to provide, not later than March 15, 2020, a briefing on the current state of the small satellite and small launch industry in China, to include an assessment of the role of Chinese government support in the growth of these companies and a set of recommended steps and investments the Secretary should take to ensure that the Department of Defense has long-term access to world-leading small satellite and small launch technologies and capabilities from U.S. companies.Status of Military Ground User Equipment receiversThe committee is concerned with the compatibility of Military Ground User Equipment (MGUE) with the Global Positioning System III enhanced Military Code (M-Code), including obsolescence issues in existing receivers and issues associated with a trusted microelectronics base.Therefore, the committee directs the co-chairs of the Council on Oversight of the Department of Defense Positioning, Navigation, and Timing Enterprise to submit a report, no later than February 1, 2020, to the congressional defense committees, on the number and extent of the military systems that will require the MGUE receiver replacement compatible with the GPS III enhanced M-Code, the cost of replacement for these systems, and the timing of the replacement of these receivers with MGUE cards.The committee directs the Comptroller General of the United States to review the report and provide an inventory and assessment of fielded systems that can either accept the new MGUE cards, allow reprogramming of the systems with new software to utilize GPS III M-Code, or require a full replacement with updated hardware. The evaluation must include a timeline of the expected usable lifespan of each system and a verdict as to whether the replacement has been assigned, programmed, and loaded in the procurement cycle for the affected equipment. The committee directs the Comptroller General to relay these findings in the form of a briefing to the congressional defense committees at a time mutually agreed upon by both parties.Tactically responsive space launch operationsThe committee recognizes the importance of integrating and synchronizing new commercial small launch services into the National Security Space Enterprise. The committee also supports the testing, training, and operationalization of these capabilities to provide options for on-orbit reconstitution within the space warfighting domain.Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, to develop a plan to leverage and analyze commercial space launch capabilities and to integrate these capabilities into Department of Defense (DOD) space operations. The Secretary shall provide a briefing to the congressional defense committees, not later than March 1, 2020, on such plan. The briefing shall address:(1) The establishment of responsive launch operational tactics, techniques, and procedures to improve the Air Force's capability to rapidly reconstitute and improve resilience for defense satellite system launches;(2) The operational benefits that this effort will provide to the military departments and combatant commanders, to include the strategic benefit of performing tactically responsive space launch demonstrations at military installations in strategic geographic locations such as the Indo-Pacific region;(3) The amount of funding and other resources required by the DOD to employ a contingency capability for rapid reconstitution and tactically responsive space launch; and(4) Such other matters as the Secretary considers appropriate.Terminal High Altitude Area Defense transition and requirementsThe committee recognizes that the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) develops, tests, and fields systems to defend the United States and its forces, allies, and partners against enemy missiles. While the track record of previous transitions of such systems to the Services is poor, the committee believes that transitioning acquisition and sustainment from the MDA to the military departments is essential for successful operations, effective alignment of assets with requirements, and financial transparency.Section 1676 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 (Public Law 114-91), as amended, required the Secretary of Defense to submit a report on the plan to transition any MDA missile defense system that has reached Milestone C approval or equivalent to the military departments. The committee notes that the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) program began the production and fielding phase in 2012 and, as such, is long overdue for transition to the Department of the Army. Per the requirements of section 1676, the Secretary's plan for transitioning eligible systems was due to the congressional defense committees no later than December 12, 2018, but that report has not yet been submitted.The committee believes that the Army should be responsible for procuring and sustaining THAAD batteries and, as such, elsewhere in this Act all THAAD procurement and operation and maintenance funding is found in the budget of the Department of the Army. Research, development, test, and evaluation funds remain within the MDA's budget in order to facilitate the MDA's ongoing work on further system improvements and on the integration of THAAD into the rest of the missile defense architecture.Further, the committee notes that the existing validated THAAD requirement is nine batteries but only seven have been procured by the MDA and manned by the Army. The committee understands that this requirement may change due to a study tasked by the 2019 Missile Defense Review. Because THAAD batteries are already some of the highest-demand, lowest- density assets in the Army and because the committee believes that these units are crucial for the defense of U.S. and allied forces, the committee believes that procurement should be promptly aligned to the requirement.The committee understands that it may be possible to synchronize U.S. procurement with foreign military sales in order to achieve economies of scale in production. The committee therefore expects that the Army will request procurement funds for an eighth battery in fiscal year 2021 and a ninth in fiscal year 2022. The committee also expects the Army to make the necessary investments in order to facilitate interceptor production at the level needed to meet requirements. Finally, the committee expects the Army to devote sufficient end strength in its future planning to fully meet the battery requirement.DIVISION B--MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AUTHORIZATIONSSummary and explanation of funding tablesDivision B of this Act authorizes funding for military construction projects of the Department of Defense (DOD). It includes funding authorizations for the construction and operation of military family housing as well as military construction for the reserve components, the Defense Agencies, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Security Investment Program. It also provides authorization for the base closure accounts that fund military construction, environmental cleanup, and other activities required to implement the decisions made in prior base closure rounds. It prohibits any future base realignment closure rounds.The tables contained in this Act provide the project-level authorizations for the military construction funding authorized in division B of this Act and summarize that funding by account.The fiscal year 2020 budget requested $11.2 billion for military construction and housing programs. Of this amount, $9.7 billion was requested for military construction, $1.3 billion for the construction and operation of family housing, $278.5 million for base closure activities, and $144.0 million for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Security Investment ProgramThe committee recommends the authorization of appropriations for military construction, housing programs, and base closure activities totaling $11.2 billion. The total amount authorized for appropriations reflects the committee's continued commitment to investing in the recapitalization of DOD facilities and infrastructure.Short title (sec. 2001)The committee recommends a provision that would designate division B of this Act as the "Military Construction Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020."Expiration of authorizations and amounts required to be specified by law (sec. 2002)The committee recommends a provision that would establish the expiration date for authorizations in this Act for military construction projects, land acquisition, family housing projects, and contributions to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Security Investment Program as of October 1, 2024, or the date of the enactment of an act authorizing funds for military construction for fiscal year 2025, whichever is later.Effective date (sec. 2003)The committee recommends a provision that would provide an effective date for titles XXI through XXVII and title XXIX of October 1, 2019, or the date of the enactment of this Act, whichever is later.TARGETED NEWS SERVICE, Harwood Place, Springfield, Virginia, USA: Myron Struck, editor; 703/304-1897; editor@targetednews.com; https://targetednews.com-1397158Load-Date: June 21, 2019End of Document

Continue reading Treasury Secretary says US could ease restrictions on Huawei with progress on trade dealThe United States could ease off its restrictions on embattled Chinese telecom Huawei, says US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, if the US and China make progress in coming up with a trade deal, according to Reuters.Mnuchin made the comments on Sunday, saying that  I think what the president is saying is, if we move forward on trade, that perhaps he'll be willing to do certain things on Huawei if he gets comfort from China on that and certain guarantees. But these are national security issues. Those comments come after President Donald Trump issued an executive order in May that allows the government to forbid US companies from selling technology to foreign firms deemed a risk to national security. That order has caused considerable headaches for Huawei, which has long been targeted by the US intelligence community as security threat, citing potential ties to the Chinese government. The result has led numerous US tech firms to stop selling components and software to Huawei, which in turn has led China to threaten to retaliate with a blacklist or other  permanent  consequences.Alongside those comments, the White House's acting budget chief, Russell T. Vought, wrote a letter to Vice President Mike Pence and Congressional officials, asking for a delay in the implementation of the National Defense Authorization Act, which Trump signed into law last fall, and which bans the government and contractors from using components from Huawei, ZTE, or a number of other Chinese communications companies.The row comes amidst a larger trade war between the US and China, in which the two countries have leveled tariffs against one another as the Trump administration attempts to leverage a better trade deal from China and to reduce its trade deficit. Efforts at a new trade deal have stalled lately, and Mnuchin indicated that Huawei's predicament could be a negotiating tactic to push China towards a more favorable deal with the US.  If China wants to move forward with the deal,  he said,  we're prepared to move forward on the terms we've done. If China doesn't want to move forward, then President Trump is perfectly happy to move forward with tariffs to rebalance the relationship. Tags:  See Campaign:            https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/9/18658629/us-china-trade-war-huawei-restrictions-negotiation-tactics-tariffs-treasury-secretary-steven-mnuchinContact Information:Andrew LiptakTags:,            Artificial Intelligence Newswire,            Wire,            United States,            EnglishLoad-Date: June 11, 2019End of Document

The wet chemicals market for electronics and semiconductor applications is highly concentrated, with top five players accounting for over 60% of the market share in 2018PR NewswireJune 24, 2019 Monday 6:09 PM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 962 wordsDateline: NEW YORK, June 24, 2019 BodyPR NewswireMarket OverviewThe wet chemicals market for electronics and semiconductor applications is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.36% during the forecast period of 2019 - 2024. Rising demand from modern technology industries and surging demand for hydrogen peroxide from the semiconductor industry are expected to drive the growth of the market studied.Read the full report:https://www.reportlinker.com/p05786706/?utm_source=PRN- However, sudden dip in the semiconductor industry and waste management of semiconductors are anticipated to hinder the growth of the market studied.- By product type, the hydrogen peroxide segment accounted for the largest share of 25 %, in 2018.- By geography, Asia-Pacific dominated the global market. In 2018. It also expected to register the fastest CAGR of 7.05% over the forecast period.Key Market TrendsIncreasing Demand for Hydrogen Peroxide- The hydrogen peroxide chemical is estimated to hold the highest share in the global market, on account of its extensive use in the semiconductor industry as a wet chemical, from the long-established applications in the etching of printed circuit boards to the more recent application of ultra-high purity grades in the semiconductor production.- The manufacturing and processing of semiconductor wafers mainly involve wet chemistry steps, where hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is used in combination with other chemicals for cost-effective cleaning and etching. The main application of hydrogen peroxide in the electronics industry include:- In the first step of RCA cleaning, it is used with ammonia (removal of organic impurities and particles on wafers)- In the third step of RCA cleaning, it is used with hydrochloric acid (removal of metallic impurities on wafers)- Finally, with sulfuric acid in "piranha acid", for residual organic film removal- High purity hydrogen peroxide is a key chemical in the manufacturing of semiconductor chips. The demand for ultra-pure hydrogen peroxide increases with the increase in the complexity of computer chips and the miniaturization of circuits in them.- Due to rapid expansion in the electronics industry, the demand for electronic chemicals used to clean and etch large-scale integrated circuits and semiconductors has also surged. To offset that demand, companies have started investing in new hydrogen peroxide production plants.- For instance, in 2018, Solvay announced to open a new electronic grade hydrogen peroxide plant in China. With an annual capacity up to 24,000 metric ton, the new facility is likely to supply the semiconductor industry with an essential chemical agent for the production of integrated electronic circuits.- All the aforementioned factors, in turn, are expected to increase the demand for wet chemicals in the electronics and semiconductor applications.Asia-Pacific Region to Dominate the Market- Asia-Pacific region dominated the global market share in 2018. With growing demand for the electronics in the countries such as China, India, and Japan, the usage of wet chemicals is increasing in the region.- The semiconductors market in China is currently lagging behind. Currently, China is the net importer of semiconductor chips with China manufacturing less than 20% of semiconductors used. As part of the country's ambitious "Made in China 2025" plan, the Chinese government has announced their decision to reach output of USD 305 billion by 2030, and therefore meet 80% of its domestic demand. In 2018, China imported semiconductor chips worth USD 312 billion.- Similarly, over 90% of the IC's that are currently being used by China are either imported or domestically manufactured by foreign chipmakers. In 2018, the total imported volume of integrated circuits in China was about 417.60 billion units, representing an increase of 10.80% Y-o-Y over 2017.

Due to rapid expansion in the electronics industry, the demand for electronic chemicals used to clean and etch large-scale integrated circuits and semiconductors has also surged. To offset that demand, companies have started investing in new hydrogen peroxide production plants. However, sudden dip in the semiconductor industry and waste management of semiconductors are anticipated to hinder the growth of the market studied. By product type, the hydrogen peroxide segment accounted for the largest share of 25%, in 2018. By geography, Asia-Pacific dominated the global market in 2018. It is also expected to register the fastest CAGR of 7.05% over the forecast period.Download FREE sample report Wet Chemicals Market for Electronics & Semiconductor Applications - Growth, Trends, and Forecasts (2019-2024)Asia-Pacific Region to Dominate the Market:Asia-Pacific region dominated the global market share in 2018. With growing demand for the electronics in countries such as China, India, and Japan, the usage of wet chemicals is increasing in the region. The semiconductors market in China is currently lagging behind. Currently, China is a net importer of semiconductor chips with China manufacturing less than 20% of semiconductors used. As part of the country's ambitious "Made in China 2025" plan, the Chinese government has announced their decision to reach output of USD 305 billion by 2030, and therefore meet 80% of its domestic demand. In 2018, China imported semiconductor chips worth USD 312 billion. Similarly, over 90% of the IC's that are currently being used by China are either imported or domestically manufactured by foreign chipmakers. In 2018, the total imported volume of integrated circuits in China was about 417.60 billion units, representing an increase of 10.80% Y-o-Y over 2017. The total imported value of these integrated circuits was about USD 312.06 billion, representing an increase of 20% Y-o-Y over 2017. The Chinese government has declared to invest above USD100 billion over the following decade to catch up with the United States in semiconductor technology. Some of the cities which have announced their plans for the production facilities for semiconductors include Chongqing, Shanghai, Beijing, Chengdu, Hefei, Shenzhen, Wuhan, Xiamen and Liaoning, and Shaanxi.

Natural Health Trends Reports First Quarter 2019 Financial ResultsGlobeNewswireMay 7, 2019 Tuesday 6:00 AM PTCopyright 2019 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: COMPANY ANNOUNCEMENT; CALENDAR OF EVENTS; EARNINGS RELEASES AND OPERATING RESULTS; STOCK MARKET NEWS; MAJOR SHAREHOLDER ANNOUNCEMENTSLength: 1648 wordsBodyHONG KONG, May  07, 2019  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Natural Health Trends Corp. (NASDAQ: NHTC), a leading direct-selling and e-commerce company that markets premium quality personal care, wellness and "quality of life" products under the NHT Global brand, today announced its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2019.First Quarter 2019 Financial Highlights• Total revenue of $19.3 million decreased 63% compared to $52.4 million in the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to a decline in Greater China revenue.• Gross profit was $14.1 million compared to $.1 million in the first quarter of 2018. As a percent of total revenue, gross profit was 73% compared to 81% in the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to product promotions and higher logistics costs.• Operating loss was $2.7 million compared to operating income of $10.0 million in the first quarter of 2018.• Net loss was $1.9 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, compared to net income of $8.8 million, or $0.78 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2018.• The number of Active Members¹ decreased 11% to 87,340 at March 31, 2019, compared to 97,840 at December 31, 2018, and decreased 8% compared to 95,040 at March 31, 2018.¹ Natural Health Trends defines Active Members as those that have placed at least one product order with the Company during the preceding twelve-month period.Management Commentary"As we previously disclosed, in response to the Chinese government's announcement of its 100-day campaign in January, as was the case with many peer companies, we voluntarily suspended our member activities," commented Chris Sharng, President of Natural Health Trends Corp. "The suspension covered more than 90% of the number of days in the first quarter, which also included the Chinese New Year holidays. We have made it our priority to fully cooperate with the government and to proactively ensure we continue to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable laws in China. While our financial performance was adversely impacted by this initiative during the quarter, we strongly support the actions taken by the Chinese government to root out bad products and deceptive practices in order to protect Chinese consumers."Mr. Sharng further commented, "While the 100-day campaign expired in late April, there has been no official conclusion to end the program. We have great confidence in our ability to navigate the business through uncertain times and to renew growth once the macroclimate improves. While we are cautious as it relates to our overall performance for the remainder of 2019 given the uncertain trade and regulatory environment, we were pleased with the outcome of our successful major event in Hong Kong at the end of March and ongoing support of our market leaders. We were also thrilled to have launched NHT Global in India and remain encouraged by the continued growth we have been experiencing in Latin America, led by Peru."Corporate DevelopmentOn April 29, 2019, the Company received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC stating that the Company has regained compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), which requires timely filing of all required periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The letter was sent to confirm the Company's compliance with the rule following the April 26, 2019 filing of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.Balance Sheet and Cash Flow• Net cash used in operating activities was $11.4 million, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $11.1 million in the first quarter of 2018.• Total cash and cash equivalents were $118.7 million as of March 31, 2019, down from $132.7 million as of December 31, 2018.• As of March 31, 2019, $32.0 million of the stock repurchase program previously approved on July 28, 2015 and increased on January 13, 2016 remained available for future purchases, inclusive of related estimated income tax.First Quarter 2019 Financial Results Conference CallManagement will host a conference call to discuss the first quarter 2019 financial results today, Tuesday, May 7, 2019 at 1:30 p.m. Eastern Time.

Dow drops nearly 300 points as Wall Street braces for deeper trade warCNN WireMay 23, 2019 Thursday 8:13 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 973 wordsByline: By Chris Isidore and Matt Egan, CNNDateline: NEW YORK (CNN Business) BodyNEW YORK (CNN Business) --  Wall Street is coming to grips with the idea that the US-China trade war will get worse before it gets better.The Dow dropped 286 points, or 1.1%, on Thursday on fears about the tariff battle slowing global growth and dinging corporate profits. The index recovered somewhat toward the end of the day --- at one point it was down nearly 450 points.The S&P 500 slumped 1.2%, while the Nasdaq lost 1.6%.China-sensitive stocks like Apple, Boeing and Nvidia tumbled. Trade war fears helped set off a 6% plunge in oil prices --- crude's worst day since Christmas Eve. And that drove energy stocks like Hess and Halliburton sharply lower."You can't have the world's two largest economies in a long, drawn-out mutually destructive trade war and not slow the global economy," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities Corporation.Nervous investors plowed money into ultra-safe government bonds, driving the yield on the 10-year Treasury yield to just 2.31% --- the lowest since late 2017. The VIX volatility index spiked 18%, while the CNN Business Fear & Greed Index dropped further into "fear" territory."There is a bit of tariff exhaustion. People are tired of hearing about it," said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. Tariffs through the 2020 election?Wall Street firms have begun warning in recent days that President Donald Trump is likely to follow through on his threat to impose a 25% tariff on all remaining US imports from China. That kind of escalation would mark an all-out trade war scenario that few thought was possible just a few weeks ago.Nomura's baseline scenario now assumes the new tariffs will go into effect before the end of the year, lowering GDP growth by 0.3 percentage points from late 2019 into 2020. The tariffs, which will for the first time hit consumer goods including smartphones and PCs, will simultaneously raise inflation, Nomura said in a report on Thursday.Worse, there are few signs that the trade war will be over soon because no formal negotiations are scheduled. "Without a clear way forward during an intensifying 2020 US presidential election," Nomura chief US economist Lewis Alexander wrote on Thursday, "we see a rising risk that tariffs will remain in effect through end-2020."Tensions over HuaweiTrade tensions have increased for several weeks as the United States and China both raised tariffs on each other's goods, and the United States placed restrictions on US firms doing business with Chinese tech giant Huawei on grounds of national security.Tech stocks bore the brunt of the pain, as the technology sector could be particularly hard-hit if the trade war escalates.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the dispute over Huawei could deepen.He reiterated the security risk the Trump Administration says is posed by Huawei's technology and said he expects other international companies to elect not to use their products."If you put your information in the hands of the Chinese communist party, it's de facto a real risk to you. They may not use it today, they may not use it tomorrow," Pompeo said in an interview with CNBC on Thursday. "To say they [Huawei] don't work with the Chinese government is a false statement."But Chinese officials suggested that the dispute over Huawei could block trade negotiations in the escalating trade war. "If the US would like to continue to talk, it should show its sincerity and correct its wrong actions," said Gao Feng, spokesman for China's Ministry of Commerce. "Only on the basis of equality and mutual respect, the talks can be continued."Markets in China closed sharply lower with the Shanghai Composite and the Hang Seng both ending more than 1% lower.Dreary economic numbersThe latest economic data underscore the high-stakes involved in the US-China trade war. American business activity tumbled to a three-year low in May due in large part to concerns about tariffs, according to a report released on Thursday by IHS Markit. New manufacturing orders declined for the first time since August 2009. "Growth of business activity slowed sharply in May as trade war worries and increased uncertainty dealt a further blow to order book growth and business confidence," IHS Markit said. Ian Winer, former head of equities at Webush Securities, placed the blame squarely on trade."Stunningly bad manufacturing data," Winer said. "This uncertainty is what cripples an economy."The retail sector has been hit particularly hard by the rising US-China tensions. Best Buy dropped 5% on Thursday after warning it may have to raise prices because of the trade war."The decision to lay tariffs all over the place ... has threatened the global expansion," Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, wrote in a note to clients. "We've sprayed bullets (tariffs) into the sky and while some may drop on the intended target, many go where they weren't meant to land."Oil crashesUS oil prices plummeted nearly 6%, tumbling below $58 a barrel, as trade war concerns and bearish inventory data weighed on oil prices. The energy sector was the worst performer in the S&P 500, tumbling more than 3%. Concho Resources, Devon Energy and Marathon Oil fell 5% or more.Stocks were also sharply lower across Europe, where mounting worries about Brexit, the state of UK Prime Minister's Theresa May's government and European parliamentary elections also weighed on investor confidence."Brexit is a complete unknown. No one is sure what to do with it or how long it will take," said TD Ameritrade's Kinhan.Some of this week's losses may have been exacerbated by lower trading volumes and reluctance to place big trades ahead of the holiday weekend. US stocks are closed on Monday for Memorial Day.TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Huawei s phone business would be decimated without Google s AndroidiCrowdNewswire (English)June 1, 2019 Saturday 8:10 AM GMTCopyright 2019 iCrowdNewswire, LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1243 wordsBody                   The news from Sunday night that Google would be complying with a US government edict and suspending business with Huawei is one of the most dramatic moments in Android's history.

Continue reading Huawei's phone business would be decimated without Google's AndroidThe news from Sunday night that Google would be complying with a US government edict and suspending business with Huawei is one of the most dramatic moments in Android's history. Huawei, China's most prolific smartphone vendor, had started 2019 with explosive double-digit growth and was on a path to eclipse Samsung as the world's number one phone maker by the year's end. Without Google's Android support, however, that's simply not going to happen   not in 2019 or 2020 or any other date in the future.Whether this proves to be the most consequential moment in Android's history has yet to be determined. This could all be just a short-lived scare tactic from a Trump administration trying to demonstrate to the Chinese government its willingness to take drastic measures. Or Huawei might be left on the US blacklist indefinitely, spawning a wide variety of potential scenarios, none of which bode well for the company's future as a smartphone vendor.As things stand, Huawei is losing its licensing agreement with Google for the provision of Google Play Services and access to the Google Play Store on new Huawei Android devices. Existing customers won't be affected, though without Google resuming business with Huawei, they also won't get any further Android OS updates. (Honor, Huawei's wholly owned subsidiary, looks to be subject to the same fate). This is devastating to Huawei's hopes of selling any smartphones outside of China.Deprived of Google's software, Huawei would be selling featherless chickensHuawei still has the option to use the open-source variety of Android, but Google has been gradually whittling all of the attractive components away from the Android Open Source Project (AOSP). The genuine full-fat Android experience of today   featuring Google Maps, YouTube, and, most crucially, the full ecosystem of third-party Android apps   is dependent on Google's licensing assent. Deprived of Google's software, Huawei would be selling featherless chickens to smartphone buyers used to having Play Store access. In Europe, even the finest hardware wouldn't convince consumers to buy a phone without an app ecosystem. Google wields enormous market power through its Play Store, significant enough for the European Commission to conduct an antitrust investigation.In its native China, Huawei already operates without the Play Store, owing to Google's absence from the market. But even there, Huawei would suffer from not having a close working relationship with Google. All of its fellow Chinese rivals would get earlier access to the next version of Android while Huawei would have to wait for the AOSP code to be made available to the public. The Chinese consumer is probably the least sensitive to operating system updates and upgrades, given how WeChat has evolved to be an OS and ecosystem atop Android, but Huawei would still be at a disadvantage in one of the world's most competitive phone markets.There's no positive spin to this situation for Huawei. Trying to sell smartphones without Google's cooperation in the modern age is a spectrum that goes from bad to disastrous. Windows Phone, Palm OS, MeeGo, Symbian, Bada (later Tizen), and BlackBerry OS are just a few of the mobile OS corpses that Android's rise has produced. App-less operating systems simply do not stand a chance against the contemporary iOS-Android duopoly.Putting a brave face on the situation, Huawei's official response has been to underline its contributions to the global popularity of Android, reassure current Huawei and Honor phone owners that they'll continue receiving security updates, and promise to  continue to build a safe and sustainable software ecosystem.  Notably, there's no mention of Android in the closing of Huawei's remarks.Huawei has been aware of the possibility of hostile action from the US government for years, and its consumer division boss Richard Yu recently disclosed that it's developed its own alternatives to Android and Windows. On the mobile front, that could be a fork of the AOSP flavor of Android or an entirely new operating system, built up from scratch. In both cases, Huawei would have a mighty struggle to convince any app developers to build apps for its separate platform. If Amazon, with all its clout and influence, couldn't do it for the Amazon Appstore on Android, Huawei stands even less of a chance. Rational app developers are hardly going to flock to a new platform that's born of adversity and thrust into a maelstrom of political conflict.As to the Huawei Mate X foldable phone, the company would be well advised to hold off from releasing it until it has its full Android privileges restored. If it does.The world's two leading economies are locking horns, and Huawei finds itself in the middle of that clashThe best-case outcome from the present situation, which might be considered most likely if it wasn't for the volatility of the current US leadership, is that China and the US reach a new trade agreement that thaws relations and grants Huawei respite from these punitive sanctions. To have a healthy smartphone business, Huawei needs Google's Android support. Google also benefits richly from Huawei's breakneck pace of innovation, and let's not forget that Apple's iPhone business is literally built in China. Every sensible incentive pushes the US and China to collaborate. However, the US president seems intent on playing the greater madman.So what happens if the US-China trade hostilities don't improve? Huawei's in-house operating system efforts would redouble, and, whether that OS is complete or not, we're likely to see it distributed on the company's next flagship. Selling Android phones in the old way isn't an option without Google as a collaborator. The undesirable externality would be that a huge number of people across Europe and Asia, who might have rightly expected at least another Android OS version update, would find themselves with lesser devices than they paid for. Samsung would be among the few beneficiaries from this confrontation, having been losing market share to Huawei across global phone markets.The world's two leading economies are locking horns in an unprecedented manner, and Huawei finds itself in the middle of that clash. The company's global reputation will suffer from this incident, no matter how quickly it's resolved, as both consumer and commercial customers will be wary about buying into a company that might at any point be left without an OS upgrade plan. A resolution to the ongoing trade dispute between the US and China is now more urgent than ever. However, China is unlikely to react positively to the bullying tactics of the US. And that means Huawei's phone business may be in limbo for a while yet.Tags:  See Campaign:            https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/20/18632266/huawei-android-google-ban-phone-business-futureContact Information:Vlad SavovTags:,            Artificial Intelligence Newswire,            Wire,            United States,            EnglishLoad-Date: June 2, 2019End of Document

Do the Latest Trade Tensions Put Nvidia's Mellanox Acquisition at Risk?RealMoneyMay 6, 2019 Monday 3:09 PM EDTCopyright 2019 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 553 wordsByline: Kevin CurranHighlight: Nvidia's biggest acquisition is in the hands of Chinese regulators at an inopportune time.BodyNvidia's  latest acquisition still needs a key sign-off in China. That could prove problematic given the recent political posturing of President Trump.CEO Jensen Huang made a big bet on the future of datacenters with a $6.9 billion splash for Mellanox Technologies  earlier this year, noting the importance of diversifying the gaming-heavy revenue base of the company, which has been susceptible to volatility amidst crypto use cases."The emergence of AI and data science, as well as billions of simultaneous computer users, is fueling skyrocketing demand on the world's datacenters," Huang said of the deal in March. "Addressing this demand will require holistic architectures that connect vast numbers of fast computing nodes over intelligent networking fabrics to form a giant datacenter-scale compute engine.""We believe that there will be opportunities to cross-sell and enhance our broader solution set over time given each company's technology assets and customer bases in high-performance computing, enterprise and hyperscale," said CFO Colette Kress in a conference call elaborating on the deal's rationale.Despite near term headwinds noted by Intel  in datacenter, many recognize that datacenters will be a long-term drier of growth for semiconductor companies and as such will be a vital area to attack for Nvidia. Mellanox gives Nvidia a much needed edge in this segment.While the idea of a deal is largely welcomed by Nvidia and bullish analysts covering the stock, it might not receive a warm welcome in China.The national regulators will most likely be worried about consolidation of technology suppliers that would have outsized control over these next generation technologies. Considering the Chinese government itself is a massive customer, there remains reason to doubt the deal.Problematic PrecedentsThe remaining regulatory hurdle is reminiscent of recently stalled blockbuster deals, including Qualcomm's  attempted takeover of NXP Semiconductors  which failed in China, and Broadcom's  hostile coup on Qualcomm that was stalled by U.S. rulings.Both deals were killed by combatants in the ongoing trade war for their implied impact on national security and violations of antitrust regulations as the trade war tit for tat built to a fever pitch in 2018.Qualcomm's bid for NXP was also rumored to be a casualty of the trade barrier battle, coming in response to bans on Chinese smartphone producer ZTE  . It is worth noting that Chinese officials rejected this theory and affirmed that the rejection related to antitrust laws.President Xi also  .Nonetheless, the resurgence of trade concerns come at an inopportune time for Nvidia as it fields shareholder lawsuits domestically and continues to await Chinese regulatory approval."Our two companies are complementary, and we build computers, we don't build communications systems,"  . "The nature of the work that we do is very different."He added that the innovation available by capitalizing on synergies between the two companies should not only be welcomed by consumers, but by governments and regulators as well.Whether or not Chinese regulators see it that way remains to be seen, but the "trumped up" trade situation isn't exactly encouraging.(Nvidia is a holding in Jim Cramer's  .

Stocks May See Further Downside Amid Lingering Trade ConcernsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 23, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1888 wordsBody       The major U.S. index futures are pointing to a lower opening on Thursday, with stocks likely to extend the downward move seen in the previous session. Lingering trade concerns are likely to weigh on Wall Street amid further indications of rising tensions between the U.S. and China. During a weekly briefly, Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesman Gao Feng said the Trump administration must "show sincerity and correct their wrong actions" if the U.S. wants trade talks to continue. "Negotiations can only continue on the basis of equality and mutual respect," Gao said, noting that China is closely monitoring developments and preparing a necessary response. U.S. and China trade talks collapsed earlier this month as President Donald Trump followed through on a threat to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25 percent from 10 percent. The Trump administration also blocked U.S. companies from doing business with Chinese telecom giant Huawei but recently gave the company a 90-day reprieve. With both sides seemingly unwilling to back down, traders are becoming increasingly wary of the impact of the trade dispute on the global economy. Following the notable upward move seen on Tuesday, stocks gave back some ground during the trading day on Wednesday. Selling pressure was relatively subdued, however, limiting the downside for the major averages. The major averages ended the session off their worst levels of the day but still firmly in the red. The Dow slid 100.72 points or 0.4 percent to 25,776.61, the Nasdaq fell 34.88 points or 0.5 percent to 7,750.84 and the S&P 500 dipped 8.09 points or 0.3 percent to 2,856.27. The moderate weakness on Wall Street came as traders continued to worry the trade dispute between the U.S. and China is escalating into a full-fledged trade war. A report from the South China Morning Post said Chinas is re-examining the entire bilateral economic relationship between the U.S. and China. The SCMP said Chinese government advisers are highlighting the risk of sourcing critical supplies from an increasingly hostile U.S. following the Trump administration's recent move to blacklist Chinese tech giant Huawei. Mei Xinyu, a fellow at the research institute under China's Ministry of Commerce, told the SCMP that Beijing should prepare for the worst-case scenario to defend its rights in climbing up the global value chain through technological catch-up. "Even if a deal is reached, it could be torn apart [by President Donald Trump] easily at any time," Mei said, comparing the current trade talk deadlock to the Panmunjom peace talks during the Korean War. Adding to the trade concerns, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC's Ylan Mui the U.S. has no plans to go to Beijing to resume trade negotiations. Stocks remained mostly lower following the release of the minutes of the latest Federal Reserve meeting, which suggested the central bank is in no rush to alter the path of interest rates. The minutes showed members agreed that a patient approach to determining future adjustments to rates would likely remain appropriate for "some time." Citing an environment of moderate U.S. economic growth and muted inflation pressures, the Fed expects to remain patient even if global economic and financial conditions continued to improve. The Fed decided to leave interest rates unchanged at the two-day meeting ended May 1st, as uncertainties affecting the U.S. and global economic outlooks had receded but inflation pressures remained muted. Oil service stocks showed a substantial move to the downside on the day, dragging the Philadelphia Oil Service Index down by 3.3 percent. The sell-off by oil service stocks came as the price of crude oil for July delivery plunged following the release of a report showing an unexpected weekly increase in crude oil inventories. Considerable weakness was also visible among semiconductor stocks, as reflected by the 2.1 percent slump by the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index.  Qualcomm (QCOM) posted a steep loss after a federal judge ruled the communications chip maker violated antitrust law. Natural gas, transportation, and steel stocks also saw notable weakness on the day, while strength emerged among pharmaceutical and utilities stocks. Commodity, Currency Markets  Crude oil futures are tumbling $1.40 to $60.02 a barrel after plunging $1.72 to $61.42 a barrel a barrel on Wednesday. Meanwhile, an ounce of gold is trading at $8.10 to $1,282.30 compared to the previous session's close of $1,274.20. On Wednesday, gold ticked up $1. On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 110.03 yen compared to the 110.36 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Wednesday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.1141 compared to yesterday's $1.1150. Asia Asian stocks ended broadly lower on Thursday as fears the U.S.-China trade conflict is spiraling into a technology cold war dashed hopes of a deal before or at the G20 summit to be held next month in Japan.  China's Shanghai Composite Index slumped 39.19 points or 1.4 percent to 2,852.52 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell tumbled 438.81 points or 1.6 percent to 27,267.13 amid the stand-off between the world's two largest economies.  Japanese shares ended notably lower as tech stocks sold off on reports the U.S. is considering sanctions on video surveillance firm Hikvision. The Nikkei 225 Index dropped 132.23 points or 0.6 percent to 21,151.14, while the broader Topix closed 0.4 percent lower at 1,540.58. Index heavyweight SoftBank Group plunged 5.3 percent after announcing it would postpone launching new smartphones made by Huawei Technologies Co. Tech stocks such as Advantest, TDK Corp and Tokyo Electron lost 2-7 percent.  Inpex Corp. plummeted 5 percent as oil extended the drop from the previous session amid surging U.S. crude inventories.  On the other hand, Daiichi Sankyo Co rose over 1 percent on a Nikkei report that the drugmaker is in talks with several companies to sell its wholly owned over-the-counter drug unit for around 100 billion yen ($900 million).  In economic news, the manufacturing sector in Japan fell into contraction in May, the latest survey from Nikkei revealed in its preliminary report - posting a manufacturing PMI score of 49.6, down from 50.2 in April. Australian markets declined on fears of a protracted U.S.-China trade war. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index dipped 18.90 points or 0.3 percent to 6,491.80, while the broader All Ordinaries Index ended down 13.80 points or 0.2 percent at 6,584.30. Mining heavyweight BHP fell 2 percent and Rio Tinto shed 0.7 percent despite record high iron ore prices. Fortescue Metals Group rose 1 percent after falling sharply the previous day on going ex-dividend.  The big four banks fell between 1.1 percent and 2.3 percent. Energy stocks Woodside Petroleum, Oil Search, Origin Energy and Santos gave up 1-2 percent as oil prices extended bigger falls from the previous session. Construction materials supplier Adelaide Brighton soared 6.3 percent after Australia's prudential regulator proposed easing of certain lending criteria for home loans. Wesfarmers advanced 1.6 percent on news it has moved a step closer to acquiring lithium miner Kidman Resources.  Seoul stocks ended lower amid the intensifying trade dispute between the U.S. and China. The benchmark Kospi slid 5.27 points or 0.3 percent to 2,059.59. SK Hynix and Posco fell over 1 percent. Europe European stocks have come under pressure on Thursday as trade worries persist and the European Parliament elections kicked off in polls that could challenge the Brussels consensus. British chip designer ARM joined the growing list of global companies to disengage with Huawei, raising concerns a protracted trade war could derail global economic growth. The British pound is lingering near four-month lows after a key ally resigned from Prime Minister Theresa May's cabinet late on Wednesday, adding to pressure on her to step down. A report from The Times said May is likely to announce her departure from office on Friday. While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index has slumped by 1.3 percent, the French CAC 40 Index and the German DAX Index are both down by 1.7 percent. Miners BHP, Glencore and Antofagasta have moved notably amid an escalating trade dispute between the U.S. and China.  German automaker Daimler and lender Commerzbank have also moved to the downside on the day on going ex-dividend.  Deutsche Bank has also tumbled after saying it has found a glitch in computer systems that retroactively scan corporate clients' transactions for suspicious activity. On the other hand, Merlin Entertainments has jumped after U.S. activist investment group ValueAct urged the owner of Madame Tussauds and Legoland to go private.  Serco Group has also soared after agreeing to buy the Naval Systems Business Unit and related contracting entities from Alion Science & Technology Corp. for $225 million. In economic news, German GDP grew 0.4 percent sequentially in the first quarter after staying flat in the fourth quarter and contracting 0.2 percent in the third quarter of 2018, detailed results from Destatis showed.  The German headline IFO business climate index dropped to 97.9 in May from 99.2 last month.  The euro area private sector expanded in May but the pace of growth remained subdued, survey data from IHS Markit showed. The composite output index rose marginally to 51.6 in May from 51.5 in April. The index was forecast to rise to 51.7. U.S. Economic Reports First-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits unexpectedly edged lower in the week ended May 18th, according to a report released by the Labor Department. The report said initial jobless claims dipped to 211,000, a decrease of 1,000 from the previous week's unrevised level of 212,000. The modest decrease came as a surprise to economists, who had expected initial jobless claims to inch up to 215,000. At 10 am ET, the Commerce Department is scheduled to release its report on new home sales in the month of April. New home sales are expected to drop to an annual rate of 675,000 in April after jumping to a rate of 692,000 in March. The Treasury Department is due to announce the details of next week's auctions of two-year, five-year, and seven-year notes at 1 pm ET. At 1 pm ET, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly and Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan are due to participate in a policymaker roundtable at a Dallas Fed conference. Stocks In Focus Shares of NetApp (NTAP) are moving sharply lower in pre-market trading after the data storage company reported weaker than expected fiscal fourth quarter results and provided disappointing guidance. Credit monitoring giant Equifax (EFX) could also see initial weakness after Moody's slashes its rating outlook on the company to negative from stable due to cybersecurity issues. On the other hand, shares of L Brands (LB) are seeing significant pre-market strength after the Victoria's Secret parent reported fiscal first quarter results that exceeded analyst estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Cosmetics company Avon Products (AVP) is also jumping in pre-market trading after agreeing to be acquired by Brazil's Natura in a deal valuing the company at $3.7 billion.        Load-Date: May 23, 2019End of Document

The other wall of TrumpCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 24, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 606 wordsBody The trade war between the United States and China has a disturbing facet. That of the wall that Donald Trump intends to raise in front of the fifth generation internet network or 5G. Follow the logic of the Chinese, really. The Great Wall, built and rebuilt by several dynasties for more than a millennium, was intended to protect the empire from attacks by nomads from Mongolia and Manchuria. The national emergency now dictated by Trump against the efforts of the Chinese Huawei company responds to the same criteria: protect the interests of the United States on the eve of the fourth industrial revolution.  Every wall has a defensive purpose. Trump's confrontation with Mexico, one of his obsessions, tries to persuade immigrants from that country and the Northern Triangle of Central America (Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador). The other, the technology, seeks to curb the predominance of China in the telecommunications market. The imminent development of a new generation of Internet, more expeditious and effective, represents for Trump "a race that the United States has to win". Textual words about an issue that considers national security before the possibility that Huawei is a spy of the government of Xi Jinping. Without googling Xi reinforced his power in the 19th Congress of the Communist Party, in 2017, with the mission of promoting the rebirth of his country. The slogan "Made in China 2025" contrasts with Trump's, "America First." China, a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) since 2001, presumes that it is "an attack on the liberal order." It distills capitalism abroad, but it keeps its wall of censorship and control of people at home. Above all, digital control, with restricted access to usual websites in other areas. In the most populated country on the planet, few conjugate the verb googling.  The house arrest in Canada of the vice president and daughter of Huawei founder Meng Wanzhou, waiting to be extradited to the United States under the charge of violating sanctions against Iran, was another chapter of the technological war. It happened on the same day as the G-2 within the G-20, the December summit between Trump and Xi in Buenos Aires in which they agreed to a three-month truce. That truce was due to the mutual increase of tariffs on products imported from both countries. He was hiding the other one. The background, the technology.  China asked the European Union for help in the face of the risk of its companies going through a similar situation. Huawei, a sort of country brand, buys components and services in the United States, whose signatures are also affected. Trump's thing has as a precedent a declaration of Congress in 2012: Republicans and Democrats then branded threats to national security Huawei and another Chinese telecommunications company, ZTE, because "it is impossible to ensure that they are independent of the Chinese Government." They exposed among their foundations unfair commercial practices, such as the theft of intellectual property.  China's effort to impose the 5G network, appealing to European companies that compete with the North American ones, poses a challenge. That the United States stops sharing intelligence information with Europe on suspicion of being spied on by China. A window for terrorism. Bytes instead of bombs, which cold war with walls in digital version. The first in history could be the one built by order of the Roman emperor Hadrian in the north of the British Isles to preserve his own of the Picts (Caledonian) tribes. It was the year 122.

Continue reading Digital Cash is Here to Stay Saying Bye Bye Conventional WalletsFor decades, payments companies such as PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and banks have overcharged consumers with expensive transaction and transfer fees. P2P payment giant Alipay, owned by Alibaba(NYSE: BABA) is free for smaller users but can grow to 1.2% depending on your transaction volume. But, even with Alipay, global transfers are restricted, tightly controlled and monitored by the Chinese government. Even with the new TransferWise service, consumers can t seem to escape processing fees. And it s not just traditional currencies that suffer from high transfer fees. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum charge steep fees when it comes to cashing out to fiat money. Riot Blockchain, Inc.(NASDAQ:RIOT) announced plans to launch a regulated crypto exchange in the U.S., in the wake of a recent massive rally enjoyed by Crypto. Litelink Technologies Inc. (CSE:LLT) (OTC:LLNKF) s wholly owned subsidiary uBUCK Technologies SEZC is about to revolutionize the digital payments industry and allows consumers to earn rewards via an integration of Datable Technology Corp. s (TSX-V:DAC) (OTC:TTMZF) loyalty program.uBUCK could change the rules forever with the coming launch of uBUCK Pay, the world s first worldwide decentralized online payments platform offering a stable token with a pin voucher solution that serves as a payment alternative for consumers, businesses and merchants. Users of uBUCK Pay will now be able to transfer uBUCK cash to friends, family, vendors and business associates around the world   all without paying a single penny in transfer fees.Worldwide money transfers are instantly processed in near real-time and are 100% free on this platform. This is essentially the holy grail of overseas transfers that countless people and multinational businesses around the world have been seeking since the dawn of globalization, and that new technologies such as cryptocurrencies could never truly deliver on.In fact, free worldwide money transfers make Litelink Technologies Inc. s (CSE:LLT) (OTCPK:LLNKF) uBUCK a game-changing platform with true disruptive potential. Catering to fiat and crypto, this platform is open to users across the spectrum.The company has just signed an agreement to integrate the loyalty and rewards program of Datable Technology Corp. s(TSX-V:DAC) (OTCPK:TTMZF)into the uBUCK Pay platform. This would effectively allow account holders of uBUCK Pay to earn rewards for every purchase and payment they make within the uBUCK Pay digital wallet or on their uBUCK Mastercard, another bonus to uBUCK s payment convenience.The beauty of this platform lies in the U.S. dollar backed stable tokens called uBUCK cash. Being a stable utility token makes it incredibly flexible and secure, allowing users to transfer funds worldwide, shop anywhere in the world and earn points while they re at it. Built on the decentralized, distributed ledger of the record-breaking fast Waves blockchain platform, it enjoys the same security as Crypto but none of the volatility thanks to being a stable token.With uBUCK, you can shop with your virtual multi-currency wallet or a physical card. Users can use their uBUCK Black Elite Mastercard online or offline anywhere Mastercard is accepted. Such an offering easily beats out any and all payment competitors, including digital payments platforms such as cryptocurrencies, Alibaba s Alipay, Western Union, PayPal or PayPal subsidiary Venmo.Truly Disruptive FintechInternational fund transfers have always been difficult. Chinese digital wallets such as WeChat Pay or Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) s Alipay payment service, are highly convenient   particularly within Mainland China and areas with a large Chinese diaspora. However, international transfers for Alipay are limited to 30,000RMB (USD $4,361), with a fee of 50RMB (USD $7.27) per transfer. WeChat has even stricter limits. In addition, only Chinese citizens are allowed to send money through the app at least for now. Meanwhile, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) charges $4.99 for international transfers plus another 2.9% plus 30 cents per transaction if funded by a credit or debit card. Paypal also charges 1% of the amount transferred, up to a $10 maximum for instant transfers with an eligible linked debit card.Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have held the promise of secure, cheap and quick transfers, but the bitcoin network is slow and their blockchain fees can get very expensive if there is congestion on the network. Cryptocurrency is notoriously difficult for fiat withdrawals given you have to go through the exchange like that being offered by RIOT Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT), which can take anywhere from four to fourteen days. With the recent rally in Crypto, users looking to cash out on their coins can simply purchase uBUCK cash and immediately convert it to U.S. dollars.Another problem with transferring money using cryptocurrencies is volatility. The value of the most popular cryptocurrency coins and tokens fluctuate wildly over time, as they are not asset-backed or stable tokens, and are traded primarily by speculators on digital currency exchanges. Unlike cryptocurrencies, uBUCK is not mineable or tradeable, and its value is backed by the U.S. dollar through pin voucher sales. When users buy uBUCK vouchers, the funds are held in trust, until the user wishes to load their uBUCK Mastercard. uBUCK, therefore, will never fluctuate in price.Loyalty Rewards to Sweeten an Already Sweet DealWith uBUCK s newest strategic partnership with Datable, the potential market exposure of uBUCK will increase a thousand-fold. Considered the top rewards platform on the market, Datable currently features over 30 brands such as Universal, General Mills, Unilever, and Toro. Under the terms of the latest letter of intent with Datable, the uBUCK prepaid cash card will be featured as a reward for consumers to purchase with their points inside every one of Datable s client portals.As uBUCK charges a transaction fee for each purchase, Datable will be sharing the revenue from these transaction fees and card sales. Meanwhile, Datable s referrals will allow uBUCK to potentially gain access to millions of new users who frequent their portals.The introduction of Datable s customer loyalty and rewards program both encourages adoption and fulfills a key marketing function   introducing the tokens to the market via a rewards program they are familiar with. According to Reuters, 80% of Americans already belong to some type of loyalty rewards program, with U.S. consumers holding a whopping 3.8 billion memberships in customer loyalty programs.It s clear that rewards programs have become an incredibly popular feature for even new tech brands, as they offer a loyalty incentive for customers to continue using the service, while consumers and shoppers receive a value-added bonus for something they were already going to do.PayTM s digital wallet has been largely successful due to its customer rewards program.  The company is raising up to USD $2 billion at an $18 billion valuation. The fact that loyalty programs continue to grow despite having been around for so long shows that these systems are demonstrably effective, and can have a significant impact on the bottom line.Litelink Technologies Inc. s (LLT- LLNKF)uBUCK platform stands to absorb a potential influx of new customers upon its launch. It s also something that other digital payment platforms have never offered, which is why loyalty rewards should give uBUCK Technologies SEZC the clear edge in the fight to become a dominant player in the P2P digital payment space.For a FREE research report onLiteLink Technologies Inc.

TRUMP VOWS TO WIN 5G RACEStates News ServiceApril 12, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1138 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the Voice of America (VOA):Steve HermanU.S. President Donald Trump speaks next to Federal Communications Commission Commissioner Ajit Pai during an event on U.S. 5G deployment in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, April 12, 2019.In the race to beat China in the fifth generation of wireless technology, known as 5G, U.S. President Donald Trump is announcing the largest-ever auction of radio frequencies and a $20 billion fund to build a rural fiber-optics backbone. "We cannot allow any other country to outcompete the United States in this powerful industry of the future," Trump said in the White House Roosevelt Room, flanked by a group of telecommunications tower climbers and farmers. "The race to 5G is a race that we must win." Starting Dec. 10, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) will begin auctioning three chunks of millimeter-wave frequencies (upper 37 GHz, 39 GHz and 47 GHz) for cellphone companies to use. Some Trump allies had tried to persuade him to effectively nationalize this technology as a matter of national security.FILE - People stand next to a 5G logo during the Mobile World Congress wireless show, in Barcelona, Spain, Feb. 28, 2018. Trump acknowledged that he considered such a plan opposed by the FCC and others but ultimately backed away from it. "We don't want to do that. It wouldn't be nearly as good, nearly as fast," Trump said. "The idea of state-designed and -operated 5G networks in the U.S. makes no sense on its own terms. A competitive, lightly regulated market is the hallmark of the U.S. system. This has delivered success in 4G and will encourage investment and innovation in 5G," London-based Gabriel Brown, a principal analyst at telecommunications research firm Heavy Reading, told VOA. "It also makes no sense in relation to competition with China these are different markets in different phases of development." Riley Walters, a policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation's Asian Studies Center, agreed, saying the "private sector is the most efficient way to distribute 5G capabilities, even if it's not at the pace nationalization proponents would like to see. Deregulation should help cut the costs for domestic developers to move up their time horizon." Connecting America 5G with speeds 100 times faster than the current 4G mobile internet will allow the emergence of everything from so-called smart cities and farms to self-driving cars. "We want Americans to be the first to benefit from this new digital revolution while protecting our innovators and our citizens," said FCC Chairman Ajit Pai. "We don't want rural Americans to be left behind."FILE - Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai answers a question from a reporter in Washington, Dec. 14, 2017. The $20.7 million Rural Digital Opportunity Fund, to come from existing FCC subsidy coffers, is intended to connect up to 4 million American homes over the next decade. The expensive fiber rollout is seen as essential for carrying wireless network communications back to internet hubs. "Intervention at this level will encourage private investment and accelerate coverage in these hard-to-reach areas the economic and social benefits of rural coverage make it worth intervening to help make the market work," Brown said. "Creating a national fund to support these innovators is a great idea," said Prakash Sangam, the founder of Tantra Analyst, which is involved in marketing and business development of wireless technology. "I also suggest that the U.S. government intervene and facilitate the resolution of conflicts between American technology companies so that they collaborate and effectively compete against the companies sponsored by foreign governments." Security concerns One challenge is the lack of U.S. manufacturers of 5G network equipment, an arena where China's Huawei and ZTE are set to dominate. Trump's 5G goals are in conflict with the Federal Trade Commission's stance on Qualcomm, the world's largest chipmaker. The FTC has sued the American company over anti-competitive pricing, according to technology analyst Patrick Morehead.FILE - A sign advertises 5G at the Qualcomm booth at CES International in Las Vegas, Jan. 9, 2019. "Qualcomm is the country's only hope for 5G and 6G leadership and with the FTC about to potentially hobble it, the U.S. will never be a leader, China will," predicted Morehead, a former industry executive. A State Department senior official on Wednesday said the security concerns about Huawei and ZTE extend to all companies headquartered in China, contending they are effectively "under direction" of the Chinese Communist Party. "It's very important to distinguish how Western democracies operate relative to their private sector companies and vendors, and how the Chinese government operates with its companies," said Ambassador Robert Strayer, deputy assistant secretary for cyber and international communications and information policy. Strayer and other officials have warned that Huawei and ZTE could give China's intelligence services secret access to sensitive communications networks and the ability to send commands to disrupt communications. Trump did not mention the Chinese companies in his remarks Friday, but he said America's 5G networks will "have to be guarded from the enemy."FILE - Attendees take pictures of the new Huawei Mate X foldable 5G smartphone during the Mobile World Congress wireless show, in Barcelona, Spain, Feb. 25, 2019. Riley, at the Heritage Foundation, told VOA that the United States "can still limit the proliferation of imports that have a security concern, but it will be hard for U.S. companies to compete in price in external markets." South Korea last week switched on its nationwide 5G network. South Korea-based Samsung is offering itself as a global alternative to Chinese equipment manufacturers, but it still lags Huawei and ZTE, as well as Sweden's Ericsson and Finland's Nokia. Wireless companies operating in the United States, including ATandT, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon, are deploying 5G this year, but widespread service for the majority of Americans could still be a decade away. The radio spectrum coming up for auction will have very limited range, meaning small cell antennas will have to be mounted on about every fourth utility pole along streets, making 5G practical only in central business districts and other congested locations, such as stadiums, convention centers and shopping malls. Lower frequencies, which are being licensed for 5G in several other countries, would need fewer cell sites, but that spectrum in the United States is held by satellite operators who are reluctant to give it up. "There are proposals to free some of it for fixed wireless, and the mobile industry wants it for 5G," Brown said.Load-Date: April 13, 2019End of Document

Huawei's New Operating System Is Insanely Fast Versus AndroidStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeJune 13, 2019 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: HI TECH; Pg. 1Length: 378 wordsByline: Sandy MccarthyBodyAs per news.mydrivers, Huawei's proprietary HongMengOS is expected to ship on almost 225 million devices by the end of this year if the report is to be believed.As a result, Huawei is trying to reduce reliance on US-based firms and use more parts from Chinese companies, while at the same time accelerating development of its in-house operating system to replace Android and Windows.According to the Global Times, the new mobile operating system was developed along with Tencent representatives, and Oppo Vivovivo were also present to test the new OS. Eventually, when Huaweis ecosystem is developed, it will appear to global upper-tier units, like the eventual Mate 30 and P40 series. And yet another source, one who works for the Chinese government, says that "China is already testing devices with Aurora installed on them". As per the report, this new OS seems to be compatible with all Android apps and is said to have "increased security functions to protect personal data". Google's concerns, however, are that a formidable Android-alternative could prove to be a bad thing for the US. The operating system reportedly going by the name Hongmeng OS (or ARK OS) will come as an alternative to Google's Android OS. Right now, Google's Android is the largest mobile OS in the world followed by Apple's iOS. Just this week, it cancelled the launch of a new laptop.Federal Bureau of Investigation joins probe into mystery deaths in Dominican RepublicA preliminary autopsy for Schaup-Werner showed she suffered from a heart attack, pulmonary edema and respiratory failure. He was in the Dominican Republic vacationing, according to his obituary , which said he died "unexpectedly".Huawei has a back-up OS in case it is cut off from US -made software, Richard Yu, CEO of the firm's consumer division, told German newspaper Die Welt in an interview earlier this year. "[It's] unfortunate... [It] depends on how long the Entity List will be there".Its applications to trademark the OS show Huawei wants to use "Hongmeng" for gadgets ranging from smartphones, portable computers to robots and auto televisions.Huawei's hopes to become the world's top selling smartphone maker in the fourth quarter this year have now been delayed, a senior Huawei executive said this week.Load-Date: June 14, 2019End of Document

Trump's tariff hike menaces strong economyAssociated Press InternationalMay 8, 2019 Wednesday 9:18 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: WASHINGTON DATELINELength: 1117 wordsByline: By PAUL WISEMAN, JOYCE M. ROSENBERG and BARBARA ORTUTAY, AP Business WritersDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) - What trade war?For months, the U.S. economy has shrugged and chugged along as America and China slapped tariffs on tens of billions of dollars of each other's goods in the fiercest trade fight since the 1930s.Growth was steady. The unemployment rate dropped to 3.6%, a 50-year low. Stocks soared to record levels.But President Donald Trump's decision to hike import taxes on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports from 10% to 25% could upend all that."A game changer," Steven Cochrane, chief Asia-Pacific economist at Moody's Analytics, said of the tariffs slated to take effect at 12:01 a.m. Friday. He called the move a "worst-case scenario" that after one year will slash 1.8 percentage points from U.S. economic growth, which was a healthy 2.9% last year. (And it could get even worse. Trump has threatened to extend 25% tariffs to another $325 billion in Chinese imports, covering everything China ships to the United States.)Other economists saw milder consequences."The new tariffs will drive up prices on a broad range of American goods, although the overall impact on (economic) growth and inflation is likely to be modest," said Eswar Prasad, an economist at Cornell University. That's because the United States, with a huge domestic market, is far less dependent on trade than most countries."A bigger concern is that the escalation of the trade war will dampen business sentiment, which in turn would negatively affect investment and long-term growth," Prasad said.Whatever pain there is won't be distributed evenly.Companies that depend on imports from China are especially vulnerable.In Clearwater, Florida, the information technology company Source 1 Solutions is bracing to pay more for electronic components from China, and may have to take on more debt to cover the rising costs. "Every month we get hit with tariff money, we have to pay out," said Robert Hessel, who owns Source 1 Solutions. "Tariffs aren't good for the small businesses that are trying to do what we're doing, importing equipment."Other tech companies are also likely to feel the squeeze.These include Apple, which manufactures its flagship iPhone in China, as well as tiny startups just bringing new products to market and mid-size companies who've had to contend with absorbing the existing tariffs even as they compete with Chinese rivals. Tim Bajarin, president of consultancy Creative Strategies and a longtime Apple expert, said companies have two choices: Eat the cost of the tariffs and absorb a hit to profits - or raise their prices and risk scaring off customers."There are no other options," he said. "The companies are being used as a bargaining chip."Higher tariffs could mean "life or death" for smaller tech companies, said Bronwyn Flores, spokeswoman for the Consumer Technology Association, an industry group that runs the annual CES gadget show. She said she is hearing from these companies the most: "They just can't afford to absorb these costs." She said some are resorting to layoffs or delaying or cancelling new products.The higher duties would cover thousands of Chinese imports - from refrigerators, air conditioners and washing machines to bamboo mats, microphones and cigarette paper. Products on the tariff hit list include infrastructure equipment, components related to the new "5G" wireless networks, the semiconductors used in all sorts of electronic devices, internet infrastructure and wireless products, data center components that are the meat, bones, hearts and brains of many tech products.Flores said some companies are already starting to change manufacturing operations, not renewing leases in China and moving to Malaysia, Mexico and elsewhere. This, of course, presents a whole new host of challenges, upending where they have manufactured for decades and having to hire and train people in a new country.It's that kind of uncertainty that paralyzes business decision-making and drains economic output.Peter Horwitz, who owns the paper and plastics supply company Tiger Packaging in Boca Raton, Florida, said he's been trying to dodge the tariffs - or minimize their impact. "Wherever we can, we've tried to offset the tariff duty either by going to other countries or working with suppliers to absorb the costs," Horwitz said. Shifting manufacturing away from China is also costly - and a gamble. If Trump ever withdraws the tariffs, China would once again be the cheapest source of supply. "We'd all go back," Horwitz said.Retaliation from China is another worry. The official Xinhua news agency reported Wednesday that the Chinese government is threatening "to take necessary countermeasures" in response to a tariff hike. China responded to earlier U.S. tariffs by targeting $110 billion in American imports. Victims included American distillers and lobster fishermen, whose catch was put on China's hit list. In drawing up a list of targets, Beijing focused specifically on soybeans and other farm products in a direct shot at Trump supporters in the U.S. Farm Belt. Hit by sanctions, U.S. soybean exports to China plunged 74% last year.The trade war has pushed the price of soybeans and other farm products lower.Randy Richards, a farmer in Hope, North Dakota, and member of a local bank board, said many farmers can't pay for day-to-day operations so they're borrowing more money, carrying a larger debt load and paying more interest. "How it affects me and how it affects my neighbors is everybody's pushing the limit on what they can afford to borrow," Richards said. "If prices don't improve we're going to see more auction sales."Bryan Klabunde, a corn and soybean farmer in northwestern Minnesota, said farmers are resilient but the uncertainty over the trade war "is catching up" with them. "I have friends who voted for President Trump and some of those farmers are very frustrated right now," said Klabunde, vice president of the Minnesota Farmers Union. "The last week and what's happening with China is putting more stress on them. It's not only stressful on your financial budget but it's stressful on your family."Economists have actually had to scramble to calculate the impact of rising tariffs. Their skill at analyzing trade wars had grown rusty. Until Trump took office, the global trend had been to ever more open trade, not more tariffs and protectionism. Robert Kudrle, an international trade specialist at the University of Minnesota, said he's had to explain tariffs to some audiences."Tariffs were kind of a thing of the past until a few years ago," he said. "Now they're a big deal again."___Dave Kolpack in Fargo, North Dakota, contributed to this report.___Follow Paul Wiseman on Twitter at https://twitter.com/PaulWisemanAPLoad-Date: May 9, 2019End of Document

"Now they're a big deal again."___Dave Kolpack in Fargo, North Dakota, contributed to this report.___Follow Paul Wiseman on Twitter at https://twitter.com/PaulWisemanAPLoad-Date: May 9, 2019End of Document

Huawei's Q1 revenue jumps 39% to $36b despite U.S. pressureStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeApril 26, 2019 FridayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: HI TECH; Pg. 1Length: 369 wordsByline: Sandy MccarthyBodyChinese Technology giant, Huawei has stated that its first-quarter revenue jumped 39 percent to 179.7 billion yuan ($26.81 billion).It gave no earnings in its first ever quarterly results but said profit margin was "slightly higher" than previous year at 8pc.In a statement to Reuters, the company said that 2019 "will be a year of large-scale deployment of 5G around the world" and its carrier business "has unprecedented opportunities for growth". In fact, in Q1, the company says it shipped a massive 59 million smartphone units. It did not disclose its actual net profit.According to The Times, a source informed it that the CIA has accused Huawei of receiving funding from China's National Security Commission, the People's Liberation Army, and a third branch of the Chinese state intelligence network.Though Huawei smartphones are not available to USA consumers, its foldable smartphone will compete with Galaxy Fold of Samsung Electronics Co.The newspaper describes the allegations as the "most serious claim" linking Huawei to the Chinese government.Joe Scarborough's shameful attack on Franklin GrahamCarlson illustrated the point by pointing out the criticism of Vice President Mike Pence by candidate Pete Buttigieg , mayor of South Bend, Indiana.However, the recent revelation adds weight to the USA government's claim that the company is adhering to China's 2017 National Intelligence Law which states that Chinese organizations must "support, cooperate with and collaborate in national intelligence work". The Chinese telecom company has made further inroads in the market for 5G wireless technology.The Chinese firm, which is also the world's No. 3 smartphone maker, said last week the number of contracts it has won to provide 5G telecoms gear increased further despite the United States campaign."Huawei will open a 5G technology lab in South Korea in May", a Huawei official told Aju News. It also claimed to have shipped the most Wi-Fi 6 products globally.Guo Ping, Huawei's chairman said that he expects all three business groups, consumer, carrier and enterprise, to post double-digit growth this year.Huawei has high hopes of becoming the number one smartphone manufacturer in the next two years.Load-Date: April 26, 2019End of Document

Huawei to test 5G network in Cairo during AFCON 2019Stillman Advance: Stillman CollegeApril 23, 2019 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: MARKETS; Pg. 1Length: 392 wordsByline: Jean GarciaBodyThe CIA has warned intelligence officials that Huawei receives funding from China's National Security Commission, the People's Liberation Army and a third branch of the Chinese state intelligence network, a source in Britain told the newspaper.Last year, Australia, Japan, New Zealand and the United States banned the Chinese telecommunications giant from participating in government contracts, citing security reasons, while several other countries said they were also anxious about Huawei's activities.In a report in The Times, an unnamed source says that the CIA has been in contact with United Kingdom intelligence officials to say that the Chinese company has received funding from three different branches of China's state security network.While the USA is pushing for ban on use of Huawei's 5G equipment citing potential security threat, the company has denied these charges.These figures come at a sensitive time for Huawei, as the company faces U.S. allegations of being a platform for the Chinese government to spy on its western adversaries.United States cancels Iran oil waivers in bid to choke off Tehran's exportsAccording to some analysts, the end of the waivers were expected to hit Asian buyers, including China and India, the hardest. U.S. officials have insisted they are not seeking "regime change".Most of the accusations against Huawei have focused on alleged violations of sanctions and the theft of trade secrets. However, Huawei has denied this claim.Huawei has in recent years been testing technology for intelligent connected cars in Chinese cities such as Shanghai, Shenzhen and Wuxi and has signed cooperation deals with a swathe of auto makers including FAW, Dongfeng and Changan.Representatives for the Central Intelligence Agency and Huawei didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.The Shenzhen-based firm, the world's biggest telecoms equipment maker, also said its net profit margin was around 8 per cent for the quarter, which it added was slightly higher than the same period past year. This was also "slightly higher" compared to Q1 previous year.He said that Huawei is particularly interested in the field of training to hone skills of cadres around the world, adding that the company is willing to boost cooperation with Cairo to help the government and private sector achieve technological development.Load-Date: April 23, 2019End of Document

Industry Voices—Madden: Can Huawei survive without American chips?FierceWirelessMay 28, 2019Copyright 2019 Questex Media Group LLC All Rights ReservedSection: ARTICLELength: 591 wordsByline: Joe MaddenHighlight: Huawei executives had a bad week.Their supply of American technology has been cut off.Here's our diagnosis of their condition.BodyHuawei executives had a bad week.Their supply of American technology has been cut off. There's been a temporary reprieve to support existing networks and existing handsets, but new production is still cut off.For ZTE, a similar action was nearly fatal last year, and ZTE only survived because PresidentTrump granted a stay of execution.Huawei is a stronger company than ZTE.Huawei makes its own ASICs and baseband processors, and has armies of engineers with deeper capabilities.Here's our diagnosis of their condition:Mobile Infrastructure: (40% of revenue)Handsets/Consumer devices (50% of revenue)The bottom line:We believe that Huawei can scramble and put together work-arounds, but their products will be janky.All-China base stations may not meet global standards for the fidelity of radio emissions, at least for the first year or two.All-China handsets will probably drop back to covering only 5-10 frequency bands, or will have to get 20% larger to support 20 bands.I've seen a similar story play out before.In 1998,my company (Spectrian) decided to sell 2G amplifiers to a small unknown company called Huawei.I visited multiple times with demonstration hardware, and watched the Huawei engineers swarm over my product.We thought that we could sell them amplifiers for 2-3 years before they learned how to overcome the difficulties of high linearity and high efficiency.In fact, we sold our product for only a few months before Huawei dropped us, and started manufacturing their own unit.Poor performance?No problem.Huawei received a waiver from the Chinese government; they didn't need to meet stringent linearity requirements after all.We decided that a lawsuit would be a waste of time, and we simply walked away.This time around, a waiver from the Chinese government won't cut it.Half of Huawei sales originate outside of China.Without ARM licenses and American chips, Huawei might survive in the domestic China market, but struggle for 2-3 years in global markets before achieving high performance again.Even then, it will be difficult for China, Inc., to reproduce American technology without violating American IP, and their legal battles for the world market could be unsustainable.Can Huawei catch up?Sure, they can spend the next 2-3 years to achieve the level of performance that ARM, Xilinx, and Qorvo can achieve now. But those companies will continue to innovate, and by 2022 they will have better technology than they have today.No matter what Huawei says, they are lacking key technologies, and their future is directly tied to negotiations with Mr. Trump.Joe Madden is principal analyst at Mobile Experts, a network of market and technology experts that analyze wireless markets.

INTERVIEW WITH MICHAEL MORELL ON INTELLIGENCE MATTERS PODCASTStates News ServiceApril 24, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 4665 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, D.C. BodyThe following information was released by the U.S. Department of State:InterviewMichael R. PompeoSecretary of StateQUESTION: Mr. Secretary, welcome to Intelligence Matters.SECRETARY POMPEO: Mike, its great to be with you.QUESTION: It is great to have you on the show, and its particularly great to have you on the show for our one-year anniversary.SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you. Thanks for having me on. I really appreciate the opportunity to be with you.QUESTION: Thanks. We also just passed your one-year anniversary here at State Department, April 26th, so congratulations on that. And just for a little foreshadowing, Im going to ask you a question at the end about your one-year anniversary. But maybe the place to start, Mr. Secretary, is since this is Intelligence Matters with intelligence. Whats your battle rhythm like with regard to your consumption of intelligence? What does your kind of average day look like in terms of consuming intelligence?SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, its a great question, Mike. You know, its changed a little bit since my previous role at CIA. I still I get my material early in the morning just about every day.QUESTION: Do you get it in the car?SECRETARY POMPEO: I get it in the vehicle on my way in, or if Im traveling Ill go to the SCIF space there. Sometimes Ill finish up the reading depending on how much material is for the day Ill finish up the reading while Im here. I have a trained professional whos there with me to assist when I have questions, things I want to inquire about further, or, frankly, things that I see and dont make sense to me, to try to make sure I really can understand what --QUESTION: Is this somebody from the Intelligence Community?SECRETARY POMPEO: Somebody from the Intelligence Community who assists me. So I both have a set of readings and a briefer who assists me in absorbing the information. And then as you know, Mike, things develop during the day as well, so I will often be passed information during the day, short pieces more often, things that have developed that are either events of the day or often intelligence that has come in on things that have occurred previously but we just now have in the developed form that is about a meeting that Im about to take place. So if Im meeting with a foreign leader and theres information related to that, that information comes to me midday as well. And then I usually take home more in-depth pieces in the evening to spend some time reading in my secure space in my home.QUESTION: One of things our listeners may now know is that people at your level get to ask questions, and they get those questions answered usually in 24 hours. So are you a tasker?SECRETARY POMPEO: I am and its a blessing, and the Intelligence Community is phenomenal at doing that. And I do my best not to burden them unduly, but theres things you want to know. Theres things that are very relevant to conversations youre going to have around the world, and to be able to get that information turned that quickly, that accurately, even if in a rough format, is of enormous value.QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, as you know, theres critiques out there about the President as an intelligence consumer, and you were with him every morning when you were CIA director and when he got his PDB briefing. Youre with him now in policy meetings when he gets that intelligence. Could you describe him as an intelligence consumer?SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, sure. Ive said this before: He is religious about taking these briefings. That is, they in my time as CIA director, I can count on one hand the number of times those meetings were cancelled, so it was a true battle rhythm. It was that time was honored. Thats difficult for our chief executive, who has lots of things coming up in on his agenda. So the first thing I think was the rigorousness with which we had access to be able to provide him timely information. We then had a trained professional who was the primary briefer, but in those were senior leaders from all across the USG. It was a small group, four or five of us, who were there during the Presidents briefing as well, both to listen to the things he was hearing so we made sure we had his although wed often seen that information ourselves that same morning but also be able to help answer and frame any questions that came up.So as the CIA director, I talked to him about things that we were doing to help flesh out further information for him. He listened; he asked lots of questions. Ive talked about this before: He was often very focused on economic issues as they related. So there would be good national security policy: Whos got the weapons? What is a particular government leadership thinking? But he would also ask how can we use Americas capacity, Americas economic capacity, to help shape situations to get good outcomes for the United States.QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, the attack in Sri Lanka. Obviously, horrible one of the five worst attacks outside a warzone since 9/11 in terms of deaths and injuries. Obviously horrible in terms of the targets that were attacked, churches and hotels, the softest of targets. As you know, ISIS has claimed responsibility. Do we have any insight yet to whether that was directed or inspired or are we still working through that?SECRETARY POMPEO: Mike, youve lived these incidents before. Theyre its worthy to measure twice and cut once in your analysis in the immediate aftermath. I will say that every indication is that this was at the very least inspired by ISIS, and I think well have more information developed about whether there were any actual connections. The scale, the complexity of the attack certainly would be something that good analysts like yourself would stare at and say we need to dig really hard. The capacity for a local group to pull off a relatively complex simultaneous attack it could happen, but its probably the case that there were others assisting them.QUESTION: And the destruction of the caliphate was an important and significant success, but what does this tell us about ISISs capabilities post-caliphate?SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah. But and again, we dont know exactly the connection to ISIS.QUESTION: Right.SECRETARY POMPEO: But it is fair to say --QUESTION: Assuming its them.SECRETARY POMPEO: -- even apart from the Sri Lanka incident, its absolutely the case that the capacity for ISIS and other radical Islamic terror groups, Sunni terror groups, remains. Their ability to network we have al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula that still has real capacity to put the United States at risk through its expertise. There are lots of pockets we could walk through. But this challenge, this challenge of taking down these networks, is something the United States is going to have to continue to stay right on top of.QUESTION: For a long time.SECRETARY POMPEO: For a long time.QUESTION: For decades, generations.SECRETARY POMPEO: Almost certainly the case that they show no sign of ideologically having wavered from their desire to conduct attacks on the West, and that means were going to have to be vigilant for an awfully long time.QUESTION: So, Mr. Secretary, lets stay on terrorism for a second, but shift to Afghanistan and Syria. So as someone who worked counterterrorism issues for 15 years, Im concerned that not having a physical presence in those places is going to increase the opportunity for al-Qaida in Afghanistan and ISIS in Syria to reappear. Theres a lot of confusion out there about what our policys going to be with regard to continued presence in Afghanistan, continued presence in Syria. Can you give us a sense of where your thinking is on that, where the administrations thinking is?SECRETARY POMPEO: Sure, I certainly can. So we will start with the mission set, right, the mission set the Presidents been unambiguous about, whether it is Afghanistan or Syria. The mission set is very clear: Were not going to allow them to get the caliphate back in either western Iraq or eastern Syria. Were going to continue to apply pressure to the networks wherever we find them, whether thats Southeast Asia, in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, all of the places that we could run through.What that will mean for force posture, what that will mean about what our footprint looks like then, will be based on what we believe is the most effective way to get the outcome that we described. And so theres an inordinate amount of focus on how many Department of Defense uniformed personnel are on the ground. I think its important just to take a step back and say whats the outcome youre trying to achieve now with the various tools that we have, certainly intelligence tools that we have, the capacity to work with partner countries in those regions, to use friends to assist us in getting the outcome we want.Weve been training Afghan security forces. We worked with the SDF in Syria. We will every situation will turn out to be different and we will the Presidents committed we will have the right structure, the right system to push back. And theyll be different in different places because the threat will appear and manifest itself differently, and theyll change over time. So when you hear the President and this is important when you hear the President talk about Afghanistan, we understand the threat and the risk, but the question is now, a decade and a half on in, do we have the right posture broadly speaking there, and if not, can we get to that right place. And if that right place looks like a significant smaller footprint for the United States of America, we are determined to do it, to put less of our young men and women at risk.So the President talks about these endless wars ending. I think thats the right approach. That counterterrorism mission remains.QUESTION: Yeah. So I thought one of the one of the most effective ways to deal with this problem was having partners do it for us, right?SECRETARY POMPEO: Right.QUESTION: Because then were not the ones doing it, right, and thats really important.SECRETARY POMPEO: I talked about that when I answered the last question. We have to have partners, we have to have friends, we have to have allies. We certainly see this on the intelligence side. We use really capable partners and share intelligence to get good, real-time information, and then for the actual effort the disruption of the networks as you well know, we have partners all around the world doing this. Its one of the things that you stare at Sri Lanka and say, well, wholly apart from intelligence failures that may or may not have taken place, did how did how was the network not good enough, the information-sharing network not good enough there in Colombo, in the surrounding regions, to identify this threat in a timely fashion to allow interdiction. We have lots of successes, as you well know, Mike, almost every week. But these failures are unacceptable and we cant simply say this is business as usual. We have to continue to work the system.QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, lets pivot to Iran, which is obviously a big focus of the President, big focus of yours. Why is it so important?SECRETARY POMPEO: So Iran is important in its it turns out to be central to our Middle East policy, our desire to reduce violence and create stability in the broader Middle East context. So when you look at President Trumps strategy in the Middle East, it is: how do you reduce terror risk? Who are the folks with the resources and money? And it turns out as you peel back you peel back the challenge today in Lebanon from Hizballah, you peel back the challenge in Yemen from the Houthis, you look at the risk that Iraq wont be able to stand up and have an independent, sovereign nation those often emanate from the Islamic Republic of Iran. So thats how we arrive at Iran as a central pillar of our Middle East efforts.There are lots of pieces to the effort, and they are some of them are Iran-specific, some of them are broader. But make no mistake about it, we do see the Islamic Republic of Iran as central to the instability we see in the Middle East today.QUESTION: So your strategy is to force them back to the negotiating table to get a better --SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah.QUESTION: -- nuclear deal and to get them to stop messing around in the region, right?SECRETARY POMPEO: Thats right. Not thats right. Not just a nuclear deal, but to get them to behave like a normal nation is the best way to characterize it.QUESTION: Right, and youre increasing the pressure. Youre increasing the pressure by doing away with the handful of oil waivers that were out there. Youre increasing the pressure by designating the IRGC. Just one question on that. So when I was at the agency, it was the Qods Force, right, part of the IRGC, that was the organization that committed terrorism. What was the logic of designating the whole group?SECRETARY POMPEO: So its still true. It is the Qods Force that is their expeditionary force truly driving truly driving the terror element of the Islamic Republic of Irans campaign around the world, underwriting Hizballah, working with the Houthis in Yemen. It is the Qods Force that is most central to that. They work at the direction of the IRGC leadership. And then the second piece of this is the IRGC is also its a mafia family. They also are own roughly 20 percent of the Iranian economy, so theres an the IRGC has penetrated the construction industry, the big pieces of the Iranian economy. So this designation permits us to go after those places where theres real wealth creation opportunity that ultimately gets to the Qods Force, and our mission set is very clear: if we can reduce the capacity of the Qods Force to spend pick a number 700 million to a billion dollars a year on Hizballah, if we can take down that capacity, they wont be able to pay salaries and it will be more difficult for them to generate external terror.QUESTION: The designation gives you real leverage?SECRETARY POMPEO: It does.QUESTION: So the Iranian strategy, to me, at least maybe the analysts at CIA have a different view but the Iranian strategy to me seems to be wait you out. Right, hope that 2020 gives them a different president whos going to rejoin the nuclear deal. Is that your sense? And if thats what theyre doing, how can we how do we put even more pressure on them?SECRETARY POMPEO: So my sense of the Iranian strategy is to develop a resistance economy. I think its probably the case they wish these policies were different and they probably are looking for the moment when therell be new leadership in the United States, and perhaps the United States policies will change. I actually think thats a fools errand. My view across a broad political spectrum inside the United States is there is a consistent view of the risk from the Islamic Republic of Iran. Theres lots of debate about the JCPOA, but more broadly speaking, I think I think everyone gets the terror risk. So I think thats a bad strategy for them, but I suspect its theirs, and Im sure there are people whispering in their ears, Just hang on until theres an election in November of 2020 in the United States and perhaps your fortunes will shift. Our effort in this administration is to make sure that we lay down the right policy for our time on duty, our watch, and Im convinced were truly getting there. You can see it in the things that are happening inside the Islamic Republic of Iran, not only the economic distress, which has is mixed we want good success for the Iranian people but make no mistake about it: Their capacity to distribute terror around the world is reduced from where it was even just 12 months ago.QUESTION: So you know these guys, right, and so at the end of the day, do you think theyre capable of changing, this regime?SECRETARY POMPEO: No, the individuals in this government arent, and I know I hear lots of talk about moderates there. I just dont see it.QUESTION: Moderates moderates in an Iranian context, right?SECRETARY POMPEO: Its moderates who believe in the Islamic element of the republic. And so once youve given up on the capacity for democratic governance and have turned this into an Islamic revolutionary state, I no longer put you in the moderate bucket.Yeah, I think what can change is the people can change the government. I dont I dont see Rouhani changing, Zarif changing. I dont see Qasem Soleimani changing or the new leader of the IRGC. They are who they are; its deeply imprinted. I was with some of the individuals who were held in 1979 in the American embassy just a week before last, and they reminded me that many of the Iranian leaders today are the individuals who beat them. Its the same cast of characters.What were trying to do is create space for the Iranian people. This is a country you know this, Mike this is a country with education, real diversity in their economy. It has a deep cultural history. Theres real opportunity in this place.QUESTION: They could have a real future.SECRETARY POMPEO: They truly could, and the vast majority of the Iranian people, we are convinced, would prefer that, and were trying to help them get in that right place.QUESTION: Okay. Lets switch to North Korea, Mr. Secretary. They say they dont like you. By the way, they dont like me either, and they dont like Intelligence Matters, I hear. Its kind of interesting. Looks like maybe your counterpart just lost his job. We just heard that this morning. Its kind of interesting. But we learned after Hanoi where we stand, right? We put an offer on the table and they said not even close, and they put an offer on the table and we said not even close. We now see Kim Jong-un rattling the cage a little bit, being at this weapons test, whatever that weapons test was, and now meeting with Vladimir Putin. Is that what you think hes doing, trying to put a little bit more pressure on us with these things? Where do you think his head is at the moment? How do you think about that?SECRETARY POMPEO: So we have been down this road a number of times with the North Koreans through history. Youve been involved in some of them. The pattern and practice isnt terribly different this time. Having said that, each time the mistake that the United States made, in my view, and frankly, the world, our partners who were alongside of us at some of these discussions, was we handed them a bunch of money in exchange for too little, and were determined not to make that mistake. I think the North Koreans now see that pretty clearly. Weve had discussions. What happened in Hanoi was a information-gathering exercise for each of us. I think we each learned a great deal. There was lots of nuance that hasnt, frankly, been reported a whole lot, because we certainly arent going to talk about it. But there was a lot more nuance to the conversation than just, hey, they had a position, we had a position, and we walked away. So theres more there to that.We hope that we can build on that. As for the personalization, from Mike Pompeos perspective, that was a mid-level guy in the North Koreans. We are very focused on getting the right set of incentives for both sides so that we can achieve the objective. Its going to be bumpy; its going to be challenging. I hope that we get several more chances to have serious conversations about how we can move this process forward.QUESTION: So in those nuances in Hanoi and in your conversations since, do you see a path to a deal that gets to full denuclearization?SECRETARY POMPEO: I do. I absolutely do. Ultimately, this turns not on the details of that deal where theres lots of room to work our way there, it solely turns on whether Chairman Kim makes the fundamental strategic decision, the one that he has told me half a dozen times he has made, the one hes told the President a handful of times that he has made.There are lots of elements of this. There are many pieces. Its an enormous challenge for that country to make its shift, too. It has, for an awfully long time, told its people that those nuclear weapons were the thing that kept them secure. They now need to shift to the narrative which is those are the things that put them at risk; those are things that cause the challenges for the country. So theres not just a military strategic decision, but a political strategic decision that we think Chairman Kim is prepared to make. Only time will tell for sure, but Ive seen enough to believe that there is a real opportunity to fundamentally shift the strategic paradigm on the peninsula there.QUESTION: And theres not some clock in the Presidents mind in terms of how long hes going to give this?SECRETARY POMPEO: No. Were the Presidents made clear were going to have enough patience to make sure that were really having good faith negotiations and real conversations. And if that breaks down, if that doesnt happen, then well have to obviously change paths. But our mission set is very clear: State Departments in the lead trying to negotiate a solution here. We have great partners in South Korea, Japan, who have been great allies and having these conversations, too. We appreciate all of the work that theyve done. Its in their backyard. It matters to them an awful lot, too, obviously.QUESTION: Speaking of their backyard, China which is a huge issue, as you know the consensus among national security experts is that China poses one of the biggest challenges that weve ever faced. Some say a bigger challenge than the Soviet Union at the end of the day. How do you see that? How do you think about that?SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah. I think its absolutely the case that a country with 1.5 billion people, truly now technologically very, very, capable, presents a real competitive challenge to the United States of America. We see it in many fronts. You watch the trade negotiations that are taking place. The good news is President Trump has been prepared to confront this in ways that previous presidents havent. Perhaps the threat has changed, or perhaps our recognition of the threat has changed. But the Presidents been very clear with President Xi, with whom he has a great relationship, hes been very clear that the trade relationship needs to fundamentally shift and that these other imbalances, whether its forced technology transfer, the theft of intellectual property, challenges in the South China Sea, or taking on the risk from technology, we are pushing back against their predatory lending practices all around the world in every embassy.The United States they understand the threat that China poses not for competition were perfectly happy to compete with a Chinese company and an American company. Well win our fair share. Well lose some. But when they show up with an entity that is truly just a shell for a Chinese Government enterprise with deeply subsidized financing and lending practices that will leave the people of that country in worse condition, were prepared to call that out and help that country understand the risks that presents to them.QUESTION: Now when we faced the Soviet Union, we had a national strategy, right? The whole country was organized in a way to deal with that threat. Do we need that sort of same approach on China over the long term?SECRETARY POMPEO: I think so. Its more complex than that. Russia, in that sense sorry, Soviet Union was hermetically sealed. We didnt have deep important commercial relationships in the same way that we have today. There were some, but it was fundamentally different. That poses a much more complex problem set for the United States. Our economies are deeply intertwined today. Thats a good thing in many respects, right? Its what the United States began in the early 70s, to open up the economic relationship between the countries with the theory that the political situation would follow. That hasnt happened. And so we will continue to develop a strategy that is broad and deep and confronts China at each of those places. And where there is room to cooperate, we will run down that road as well.QUESTION: It seems to me that one of the really important assets we have here is our allies and partners as we try to deal with China, right? And were asking a lot of them. And obviously, we need them in places, but were asking also asking a lot of them in terms of burden sharing, in terms of supporting sanctions that they dont necessarily agree with. So how do you balance that as the Secretary of State when youre having a conversation with them?SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, you smile and shake hands on the things you agree on, and then arm wrestle on those that you dont. And you do so with the seriousness that you recognize theyre a sovereign nation, they have their own interests. We have ours. Some places you just simply agree to disagree, and then you provide friction. Theres a rub there to be sure. But with our true friends, our European partners, those folks who have been around a long time, these are deep, sophisticated relationships that are strong and endure past all of them. People think this is all new. Youll remember from your time, right, weve had big fights about Iraq with the Europeans. Theres a long history of having friends and partners with whom you diverge on a particular issue set, so you lean in hard on those things you work on, and Chinas a perfect example.We built out a big coalition with the ASEAN partners in Asia. The Europeans understand the risk from China. I think their acceptance of that is ever increasing day by day. I think theres a global understanding that something has shifted in China over the last handful of years, that it has gone from a developing country to one now with a very different design. And I think as the world begins to absorb that, I think you will see the coalitions begin to solidify, and the capacity for what we care about Western democratic values, free and open markets, the capacity to trade around the world, security arrangements that provide security for all, freedom of navigation those things are the central pillars of our Western democracies. I think youll see us unite and begin to do the things we need to do to ensure that that value set continues to dominate this century and the next.QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, last question. Youve been terrific with your time. Thank you. Back to your one-year anniversary in this job. So you are the Presidents most senior representative to the rest of the world. You travel to many countries. You have countless meetings with foreign officials. What have you learned about Americas role in the world? The reason I ask is theres a division here in the United States between those who think we should engage less in the world and those who think we should engage more in the world. Whats your sense after a year as Secretary of State?SECRETARY POMPEO: Were irreplaceable in the global firmament for creating the central understandings of what the what ordered liberty throughout the world must look like. Wherever I travel, Mike, its an enormous privilege to serve as Secretary of State. Wherever I travel, people want to meet the American Secretary of State. They dont want to meet Mike, they want to meet the American Secretary of State because they understand that when we show up, America will show up as a force for good. We may disagree. We may have a how to get there tactically, but they understand that Americas not out there solely with some mission to conquer or solely with some mission to create a win/lose proposition for them.Were there to certainly present Americas value set and to get good outcomes for our citizens my first task; the Presidents primary mission but they know we bring with us the capacity for reason and thoughtfulness and process and lawfulness. All the core values of Western democracies are very much embodied in the United States, and theres no one that can replace us in the world with respect to each of those issues.QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, thank you for your time. And give my best to your family.SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you. Bless you too. Have a good day.QUESTION: Thanks.Load-Date: May 3, 2019End of Document

Face off? Americans fear privacy loss to recognition software; Police departments and tech companies are using facial recognition software, and that has profound implications for privacy and anonymity.The Christian Science MonitorJune 20, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 Christian Science Publishing Society All Rights ReservedSection: TechnologyLength: 1293 wordsByline: Eoin O'Carroll Staff writerBodyAs facial recognition becomes more widespread, now appearing at check-ins for international flights, New York City apartment buildings, and even 24-hour convenience stores, more Americans are worried that public anonymity could become a thing of the past.A poll released Wednesday by the market research company Morning Consult and the news outlet Politico, found support for facial recognition technology slipping among registered voters.According to the survey, 42% approve of the technology, compared to 49% in August 2018. On Tuesday, a poll released by the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts found that more than 9 in 10 voters in that state supported a state bill regulating how the government uses facial recognition, with nearly 8 in 10 supporting an outright moratorium.Concerns about the technology - which uses sophisticated machine-learning algorithms to analyze facial features from a photo and match them with other photos that contain the same features -  span the political spectrum. According to the Massachusetts survey, 84% of Democrats, 82% of independents, and half of Republicans favor a moratorium."There are interesting alliances and strange bedfellows in the privacy world," says Kade Crockford, director of the Technology for Liberty program at the ACLU of Massachusetts. "There does remain in the United States thankfully a relatively deep mistrust of government power, which I think is a very healthy thing."Already a feature used in unlocking high-end phones, facial recognition technology offers the promise of a world of seamless check-ins, payments, and other convenient identity checks.And then there's the promise of catching criminals, including suspects who may have been photographed stealing a package from a doorstep or breaking into a car, says Daniel Castro, vice president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a tech-policy think tank in Washington, D.C. "If police are going to have to say in the future, 'Sorry, we can't do anything, we can't run facial recognition to find the person because of a law,' I don't think most people are going to be happy with that," he says.The technology is already being used to combat far more grevious crimes. On Wednesday, Wired reported that a nonprofit combatting human trafficking had developed a tool to match faces in online ads with police evidence to identify child victims of sex abuse.Still, legislators in some cities are not buying the promise of increased security.In May, San Francisco became the first U.S. city to ban the technology by law enforcement. Other cities considering bans are nearby Oakland and Berkeley, as well as Somerville, Massachusetts, a densely populated city in the Boston metro area. The Massachusetts legislature is also mulling a moratorium, backed by the ACLU of Massachusetts, on face recognition and other technology that can identify people at a distance by their voice, gait, or other immutable "biometric" features.Also in May, members of the U.S. House Oversight and Reform Committee showed rare bipartisan unity in voicing deep concerns about the technology, which is built by companies like Amazon, IBM, Microsoft, and Google.And last August, workers at these companies walked out or otherwise staged protests against their employers' contracts with law enforcement, immigration enforcement, and the Pentagon. Facial recognition technology played a prominent role in the protests at Amazon and Microsoft.A surveillance societyCurrently there are no federal laws governing how law enforcement may use facial recognition, nor is it clear how many of the country's roughly 18,000 police departments are currently using it. But the technology is inexpensive and user-friendly: In April, The New York Times surveilled a park in midtown Manhattan for less than $100 and were able to successfully identify passersby."The practice of setting up citywide networks of 'smart' surveillance cameras ... that is, to me, a total surveillance society," says Mx. Crockford (who prefers a gender-neutral attribution). It could "enable government or anyone else to create a permanent and invasive record, not just of one person's habits, associations, and movements, but of every person, and not on one day but on all days."Face recognition, says Mx. Crockford, could undermine an implicit social contract that makes cities what they are. "Cities are spaces of anonymity. ... The growth of the modern metropolis has provided people with a degree of freedom through anonymity that is kind of unprecedented. ... That's why gay people move to cities, because we could be free in those places. I mean relatively free."Cities offer an ability to reinvent oneself, to break with the past to a certain extent, and the ability to do this might be crucial to some peoples' mental well-being. In a paper published last year in the Journal of Medical Ethics, Stanford University psychiatrist Elias Aboujaoude argued that establishing a "modern privacy bill of rights" should be a public health priority."Privacy mediates some very important psychological processes," he says. "When you look at mechanisms such as recovery after a setback for rejuvenation or catharsis ... all have been shown to require privacy."Dr. Aboujaoude cited the positive public health implications of a European Union law that created in 2014 a "right to be forgotten" online. The EU's General Data Protection Regulation, passed last year, further restricts how companies can use people's identifiable information, including images of their faces.Scoring citizens in a 'smart city'China's privacy norms, meanwhile, have been trending in the opposite direction. The country's Social Credit System, a national social and economic reputation system that assigns a score to every citizen, is expected to go online nationwide next year. Already, the system has been used to restrict individuals' travel.A Chinese advertisement for a new 5G network by the state-owned China Mobile illustrates how the Chinese government is promoting facial recognition as an asset to public safety. In the ad, an undercover police officer deploys several aspects of a "smart city," including face surveillance, to arrest a wanted man.We can't assume that such a system won't come to the United States, says Mx. Crockford, pointing out that, for nonwhite citizens in poor neighborhoods, aggressive surveillance by law enforcement is already a feature of daily life."It's all very nice and well for a wealthy white person to say, 'I'm not worried about that. We're not China,'" Mx. Crockford says. "Well, why don't you talk to a young black man from the Bronx about his experience with the government?"Avoiding a race to the bottomSome corporations may welcome greater public oversight of the technology. In a December blog post Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft, argued that 2019 should be the year that governments step in to regulate facial recognition."We don't believe that the world will be best served by a commercial race to the bottom, with tech companies forced to choose between social responsibility and market success," he wrote. "We believe that the only way to protect against this race to the bottom is to build a floor of responsibility that supports healthy market competition."Mr. Castro of ITIF, which receives funding from tech and telecom companies, argues that outright bans on government use could actually worsen the very problems that they aim to solve."It's important for government to be an early adopter of some of these technologies," says Mr. Castro. "They can say it is important for us that these technologies are generally neutral in terms of race, that they are not having significant errors and incentivize industry to prioritize that."Load-Date: June 20, 2019End of Document

Crockford (who prefers a gender-neutral attribution). It could "enable government or anyone else to create a permanent and invasive record, not just of one person's habits, associations, and movements, but of every person, and not on one day but on all days."Face recognition, says Mx. Crockford, could undermine an implicit social contract that makes cities what they are. "Cities are spaces of anonymity. ... The growth of the modern metropolis has provided people with a degree of freedom through anonymity that is kind of unprecedented. ...

Face off? Americans fear privacy loss to recognition software; Police departments and tech companies are using facial recognition software, and that has profound implications for privacy and anonymity.The Christian Science MonitorJune 20, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 Christian Science Publishing Society All Rights ReservedSection: TechnologyLength: 1293 wordsByline: Eoin O'Carroll Staff writerBodyAs facial recognition becomes more widespread, now appearing at check-ins for international flights, New York City apartment buildings, and even 24-hour convenience stores, more Americans are worried that public anonymity could become a thing of the past.A poll released Wednesday by the market research company Morning Consult and the news outlet Politico, found support for facial recognition technology slipping among registered voters.According to the survey, 42% approve of the technology, compared to 49% in August 2018. On Tuesday, a poll released by the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts found that more than 9 in 10 voters in that state supported a state bill regulating how the government uses facial recognition, with nearly 8 in 10 supporting an outright moratorium.Concerns about the technology - which uses sophisticated machine-learning algorithms to analyze facial features from a photo and match them with other photos that contain the same features -  span the political spectrum. According to the Massachusetts survey, 84% of Democrats, 82% of independents, and half of Republicans favor a moratorium."There are interesting alliances and strange bedfellows in the privacy world," says Kade Crockford, director of the Technology for Liberty program at the ACLU of Massachusetts. "There does remain in the United States thankfully a relatively deep mistrust of government power, which I think is a very healthy thing."Already a feature used in unlocking high-end phones, facial recognition technology offers the promise of a world of seamless check-ins, payments, and other convenient identity checks.And then there's the promise of catching criminals, including suspects who may have been photographed stealing a package from a doorstep or breaking into a car, says Daniel Castro, vice president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a tech-policy think tank in Washington, D.C. "If police are going to have to say in the future, 'Sorry, we can't do anything, we can't run facial recognition to find the person because of a law,' I don't think most people are going to be happy with that," he says.The technology is already being used to combat far more grevious crimes. On Wednesday, Wired reported that a nonprofit combatting human trafficking had developed a tool to match faces in online ads with police evidence to identify child victims of sex abuse.Still, legislators in some cities are not buying the promise of increased security.In May, San Francisco became the first U.S. city to ban the technology by law enforcement. Other cities considering bans are nearby Oakland and Berkeley, as well as Somerville, Massachusetts, a densely populated city in the Boston metro area.

Financial Market Behavior, General Mills Earnings: Market ReconRealMoneyJune 24, 2019 Monday 8:23 AM EDTCopyright 2019 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1589 wordsByline: Stephen GuilfoyleHighlight: Markets must choose now between the easy, the tense and the uncertain. What could possibly go wrong?BodyThat Was EasyYou learn as a youngster to walk past the tables of shell game peddling hucksters. Watch the little bean for a minute, or even worse, engage in conversation with these fellows who always seem to set up on crowded sidewalks, and who always seem to know 60 seconds before the police show up, and you will lose what money you showed up with. Financial market behavior must choose now between the easy, the tense and the uncertain. What could possibly go wrong?First, the easy. That was the FOMC's signaled path for the trajectory of monetary policy last week. There is no doubt that both equity and debt markets now move in the same direction upon talk of such policy that would be more in line with what other central banks are doing. The Federal Reserve Bank really is the only force on the planet that can get stocks, bonds, and thanks to a suddenly softer U.S. dollar, commodities to all rise in value in some kind of semi-correlated fashion. By the way, the S&P 500, even after some minor consolidation on Friday is now 7.2% higher for the month of June, good enough if the month ended right now for the best June since 1955. The Brooklyn Dodgers won the World Series that year, just to put in perspective how long it has been. The index saw a gain of 2.2% last week alone despite that sideways to lower Friday action. This brings us to the Tense and then the Uncertain.Tense or Intense?Just how much is at stake as the situation between the U.S. and Iran evolves? Yes, there was certainly a boost enjoyed last week across the tech sector, as investors made a move toward riskier, growth type names in response to the Fed. However, the oversold Energy sector easily led equity markets to the upside. Yes, the weaker dollar helped, but so did turmoil in the Gulf of Oman/Straights of Hormuz neighborhood. As attacks have been made recently both on commercial traffic through the region as well as U.S. military assets, the administration in Washington has shown admirable restraint in not commencing with military retaliation. The mere thought has, however, boosted shares of defense contractors.That said, there apparently has been some kind of offensive cyber attack made against the sites that launched against the U.S. Navy reconnaissance drone last week. It is also expected that further sanctions will be prepared to be administered against the Iranian economy this week. President Trump was clear: "Look, you can't have nuclear weapons. And if you want to talk about it, good. Otherwise you can live in a shattered economy for a long time to come."  How much impact further increasing sanctions will have against an economy that is already considered to be something like 80% negatively impacted is unclear. Does Iran's belligerence spread across the region? Also unclear.I don't expect markets to respond to a higher level of sanctions in the least. The risk here is still out on and over the area's waters, both militarily and to the transport of cargo through the region. Threat of a Black Swan event? Well, we would have seen this coming if something terrible actually happens. We'll call this a bird of a different feather.UncertainAsian markets are well mixed on Monday morning, though I don't really see any major market that has strayed too far from where it closed on Friday night. The good news is that Chinese news agency Xinhua reported on Sunday that President Xi Jinping will attend the G-20 summit later this week in Osaka, Japan. We have that much.This anticipated meeting between the presidents of both the United Sates and China is where the next market move comes from. What comes of this meeting? Leg up? Leg down? You could be looking at the implementation of tariffs on the remaining $300 billion worth of Chinese exports to the U.S. That would be a fairly severe negative force in the marketplace, a marketplace trading close enough to record highs, and indeed poised for some contraction. Keep in mind that Q2 earnings are expected to print now at -2.6% y/y across the S&P 500 on revenue growth of 3.9%. Despite the ongoing trade war, and despite Q2 projections for both earnings and revenue that has been revised lower in recent weeks, the S&P 500 now trades at 16.8 times 12 month forward looking earnings, up from 16.5 times just one week ago.The bottom line going into the G-20 is this: President Trump is now on re-election mode. President Xi, though leader for life, still must perform, and his economy is undeniably slowing quite rapidly. Tariffs already implemented have injured the Chinese economy, and that economy has started to lose business that will likely never return. In short, both leaders would stand to benefit from some kind of limited agreement that accomplishes more in the way of headline generation than in qualitative substance. Will they agree to compromise on such an outcome? I really have my doubts.While both leaders will walk away expressing optimism, the facts are this: President Trump has never backed down from his stance on China. The trade imbalance was the easy stuff. U.S. demands that China stop stealing U.S. intellectual property, China stop subsidizing state owned corporations that compete directly with U.S. interests, China allow for greater foreign access to their own markets will be difficult for China to agree to, as that nation does not even admit to such behavior. One thing the Communist party has always been consistent in, is the exercise of power. Does anyone think the Chinese government actually passes into law, policies that allow for lesser influence over their own markets, even if it makes sense economically? Especially if policing such changes appears to leave the other side in a position of authority?I can't answer that question because I really don't know. I would expect that at some point, this summer the schedule of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods might be expanded incrementally, starting small ... at maybe 10%. Tariffs already implemented are likely why we are about to witness earnings contraction on increased revenue. That's called a margin squeeze where I'm from. The geniuses called tariffs a tax on the consumer. That's only if the consumer is willing and/or able to pay more. Otherwise, tariffs are a tax on the purveyor. This is why the FOMC has signaled as they have. Not because many of us think they made a policy error in December. Though, I think it obvious.Not Sexy, Just SteadyGeneral Mills  reports the firm's fiscal fourth quarter this Wednesday morning. Quite honestly, this is the type of name that perhaps I only take a look at when the corporate calendar is slowing down. On that note, JP Morgan  and Citigroup  don't go to the tape for another three weeks, so if not for the Fed, China, and Iran, this would be the quiet season.You know the General Mills portfolio of brands... Betty Crocker, Chex, Progresso, Green Giant, Yoplait, Pillsbury, Cheerios, Haagen Dazs, and last, but not least... Blue Buffalo for the pets. Nothing flashy. No likely surprises, up or down. 3.7% dividend yield though. That looks a lot nicer in a yield starved world that tries to force risk upon the investor who is trying to make some hay. In order to maintain an accepted level of diversity across my portfolio, there has to be some value as well as growth. I eat Cheerios every day. Green Giant? Almost every day. Progresso? When it's on sale. Basically, I'm a customer.What I see fundamentally is a company that has struggled. Earnings growth has been pedestrian, but there has not been a quarter where such growth contracted year over year since late 2017. Revenue growth has moved from low single digits to high single digits over the past three quarters. Fund ownership stands at only 37%, but has grew significantly (+4.8%) for the March reporting period from that of December.Notably, Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock from a "Neutral" to a "Sell" on May 29th, while also cutting the firm's price target from $42 to $41. I bring that up because the stock plummeted that day on that downgrade, then rallied 12.5% off of the low of that dip, and taking back all of the lost ground over three weeks as the investing public appears to have rejected that call. Take a look.Interestingly, perhaps all that the Goldman Sachs downgrade did, really, was provide a nice handle for a cup pattern that was an incredible year and a half in the making. If I see what I think I see, then the pivot would be the peak of the right side of that cup, or $53.65-ish. Given a cup with a depth of 40%, on top of that 12% handle, is it crazy to think this stock can go to $64 or $65? I would not bet the farm. This could end up a very bad week to be wrong about anything, but it sure looks to me like General Mills is making an attempt at the slow growth, value version of a breakout. See what I mean?My thought is this. A July $55 call will run the investor roughly 99 cents, and there really are no calls at higher strikes priced where one could sufficiently reduce the outlay. July $52.50 puts will still pay about $1.25. That may be worth it. With an equity stake, though not yet announced, there is a considerable likelihood that the firm will pay 49 cents (based on previous payout history) a share sometime in August.Economics (All Times Eastern)10:30 - Dallas Fed Manufacturing Index (June):Expecting 1.9, Last -5.3.Note: There are no significant quarterly earnings scheduled for release today.(J.P.

TODAY IN OPENGOV: MAKE IT A DOZEN.States News ServiceJune 6, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1439 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the Sunlight Foundation:by Matt RumseyIn today's edition, unsurprising conclusions in a new report from the FEC watchdog, a dubious milestone for President Trump, censoring memories in China, and more.washington watchThe lobbyists are coming.In new report, the FEC IG sheds light on how disfunction at the commission has hobbled its internal watchdog. "A new report from the Office of Inspector General at the Federal Election Commission (FEC) provides new information about how the agencys internal watchdog has been hamstrung for months a concerning state of affairs that was also detailed in Issue Ones recent report 'Busted and Broke: Why the Federal Election Commission doesnt work.' In short: The FECs Office of Inspector General has been unable, for many months, to complete audits, investigate criminal and administrative allegations, conduct peer reviews, evaluate personnel, approve budgetary decisions, and conduct mandatory professional trainings. This is further evidence that the agency suffers from systemic dysfunction." (Issue One)Tech companies are boosting their, already significant, lobbying power in anticipation of a looming antitrust fight. "Faced with the growing possibility of antitrust actions and legislation to curb their power, four of the biggest technology companies are amassing an army of lobbyists as they prepare for what could be an epic fight over their futures. Initially slow to develop a presence in Washington, the tech giants Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google have rapidly built themselves into some of the largest players in the influence and access industry as they confront threats from the Trump administration and both parties on Capitol Hill." (New York Times)Virginia Thomas, wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, has big plans to boost President Trump in 2020. "Conservative activist Virginia Ginni Thomas plans to launch a new PAC and 501(c)(4) nonprofit, according to a report published in the Intercept this week. Dubbed American D-Day, the groups will be part of a broader project called Crowdsourcers, with the goal of protecting President Donald Trump. If Thomass name sounds familiar, it may be because she is married to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, who has been on the bench for nearly three decades. But Ginni Thomas has long carved out her own place in conservative politics sometimes to the chagrin of those who say her involvement poses a conflict of interest due to her husbands role." (Open Secrets)This representative wants to know more about why the Boy Scouts lobbied against stricter sexual abuse laws. "Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) is pressing the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) for more information about the organization's lobbying efforts against legislation to extend statutes of limitations for alleged sexual misconduct. Speier, who has been pushing for more information from the group for months, signaled she wanted more answers following the group's latest letter sent Monday that promised to provide information on its lobbying practices by June 17." (The Hill)trumplandAir Force One and a Presidential Limousine in Uruguay. Image credit: Vince Alongi.With stay at Irish golf course, President Trump has now visited an even dozen Trump branded properties as President (Washington Post) Meanwhile, his brief trip to Ireland is costing American taxpayers almost $1 million in limo rental fees. "They are, by all accounts, wheels to die for. JP Ward and Sons, an Irish funeral services home, rents out its fleet of Mercedes E-Class limousines not just to mourners but to anyone who wants to travel in styleThe Trump administration paid the family-owned firm based in Bray, County Wicklow, $935,033 in four tranches, according to USASpending.gov, an official portal that records federal government spending." (The Guardian)Federal judge defers to Supreme Court on Census citizenship question while expressing concerns about "serious" nature of new information in the case. "A federal judge said the allegations that the Trump administration wants a citizenship question on the 2020 census because it would advantage Republicans and white people are serious, but cautioned that he wouldnt interfere with the upcoming Supreme Court decision on the matter. Last week, newly released documents revealed that a Republican strategist known for redrawing electoral maps completed a study in 2015 that showed a census question would be advantageous to Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites. Opponents of the citizenship question, who believe it will lead undocumented people to avoid answering the census and result in inaccurate data, contend this study formed the blueprint for the administrations plan to add the question." (BuzzFeed)House Oversight Committee postpones, but doesn't cancel, contempt vote after Commerce officials agree to discuss the Census. "The House Oversight Committee on Wednesday announced it would postpone voting on subpoenaing the Commerce Department after the agency agreed to allow several current and former officials to be interviewed about adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census. The committee stated that former Senior Adviser and Counsel to the Secretary James Uthmeier, General Counsel Peter Davidson, and Deputy Chief of Staff and Director of Policy Earl Comstock agreed to schedule voluntary interviews. The Commerce Department in a letter dated Monday to the committee stated it would make the officials available to the panel."

Apple is my teacher [and] it is advancing in front of us.The trade talks between the USA and China stalled after the two sides failed to reach an agreement in the latest round of negotiations in Washington in early May.Despite Washington's move to clamp down on Huawei's 5G drive, the company will be able to resolve the issue by either boosting its own chip supply or finding alternatives, the tech giant's founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei, told Bloomberg.The Commerce Department has accused Huawei of being an arm of the Chinese government, saying it is "engaged in activities that are contrary to US national security or foreign policy interest".Speaking to Bloomberg TV, he said: "That will not happen, first of all". Why do students have to object to the teacher? Although no evidence has been released yet, these allegations have dogged the Chinese company till now, even resulting in severe sanctions being placed on it by the USA government.'Should be banned': Rafa Nadal sparks freaky French Open controversyIn his 100th tournament on the surface, en route to which he has authored 429 match wins, with only 39 losses, he has 58 titles. The match was halted with the score at 7-6 (7-1) 5-7 6-4 4-6 5-5 after four hours of play at Roland Garros in Paris.Huawei, the world's second-largest smartphone maker by volume, commands almost 30 percent of the European market, according to industry tracker IDC. He added that Huawei would continue buying US products if the ban was to be lifted.The move prodded several United States corporations, such as Google and Microsoft as well as major semiconductor makers, including Intel, Qualcomm, Xilinx and Broadcom, to follow suit and cut ties with Huawei.China has always maintained the position that any trade consultation with the United States should be based on the principles of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lu Kang said.President Trump has imposed 25 percent tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars in Chinese goods, in what the administration says is an effort to crack down on intellectual property theft and achieve equitable trading terms with China.Trump then continued: "If we made a deal, I could imagine Huawei possibly being included in some form of or some part of a trade deal".Load-Date: May 28, 2019End of Document

Putin, Xi gang up on Trump over trade warsStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeJune 10, 2019 MondayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: WORLD NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 442 wordsByline: Steven ClarkeBodyAt the St. Petersburg forum,Vladimir Putin, Russian leader, condemned USA actions against Huawei, a Chinese multinational technology company headquartered in Shenzhen, Guangdong, China."They are attempting not just to squeeze but to unceremoniously push [Huawei] out of the global market", Putin said.Chinese President Xi Jinping returned to Beijing on Saturday morning after a three-day state visit to Russian Federation where he attended the 23rd St. Petersburg International Economic Forum.President of RussiaVladimir Putin stated that he does not refuse to meet new President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky as Interfax-Ukraine reported. "It's already being called the first technological war of the emerging digital era in some circles". In May, when the trade war between Washington and Beijing escalated, the Trump administration blacklisted Huawei, citing national security concerns.Although both Huawei and the Chinese government have firmly denied these claims, Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and the United States banned Huawei from participating in government contracts in 2018. "Figuratively speaking, it's a path to battles without rules that pit everyone against everyone else", he added.Russian leaderVladimir Putin on Friday renewed calls to revisit the role of the United States dollar in global trade and accused Washington of seeking to dominate the world.Much cooler today, isolated showers possibleStorm chances return Thursday night through most of next weekend, however most storms will occur during the overnight hours. The rain showers behaved mostly as expected today, with much of the action ending by the early afternoon.Putin said that cooperation between the two countries was essential for global stability.Denouncing the "rhetoric of trade wars and sanctions", Putin called for a reevaluation of the role of the U.S. dollar in global trade and condemned America's pressure tactics.China and Russia's leaders say their countries are closer than they've ever been, and that's partly due to what they see as a common threat. Huawei, a Chinese technological giant, signed a deal with MTS - Russia's largest telecoms operator - to develop %G technologies and launch a fifth generation network in Russia.Putin invited Xi to a cruise tour on the Neva River.The fact has proved that China and Russian Federation need to strengthen solidarity and coordination to maintain global strategic stability and the balance of worldwide power, said Wang.Moscow and Beijing´s economic ties have grown in recent years, though they remain heavily weighted in favour of China, which dwarfs Russian Federation in economic and demographic terms.Load-Date: June 10, 2019End of Document

Markets will watch the G-20 summit for signs of a thaw in the U.S.-China trade war. The NATO summit has implications for Lockheed Martin's F-35 program. Nike and FedEx also report earnings along with highly rated stocks Accenture and Paychex.Stocks To WatchD.R. Horton is in a flat base and 5.2% below a 47.12 buy point. NVR has seen its relative strength line rise this year after lagging for most of 2018. The RS line for LGI Homes continues to look bullish, as the stock trades above the 50-day. The RS line for KB Home is starting to wilt. Lennar fell back below its 50-day line Friday. KB Home and Lennar also report earnings in the coming week.G-20 Summit: What's At StakePresident Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are planning an "extended meeting" on the sidelines of the G-20 summit in Osaka, Japan, which begins on Friday. Early indications are that it will be another dinner, like the one in Buenos Aires in early December that led to a five-month cease-fire in the China trade war. While both sides are eager for a deal, there's a vast chasm between U.S. demands and what China is willing to give. Trump wants to keep tariffs in place and peel them back gradually as China clears one hurdle after another, including legal changes to protect intellectual property. China has signaled that it's willing to commit to little other than buying more American exports and won't abide demeaning enforcement measures.This time, the threats of escalation are even greater. The next step for the U.S. is a 25% tax on the remaining $300 billion in Chinese imports, including laptops, iPhones, apparel and footwear. The Trump administration already hit Huawei, the huge Chinese communications equipment company, with an export ban that threatens to crush its mobile phone and networking business outside China. Beijing is ready to hit back with restrictions on the export of rare earths minerals, key to the tech sector. And companies that abide by the U.S. ban on sales to Huawei would land on China's new "unreliable entity" list, with as yet unclear consequences.Nike Near Buy Point Ahead Of EarningsThe athletic gear giant reports fiscal Q4 results after the stock market closes Thursday. EPS is seen sliding 3% to 67 cents even as revenue climbs 4% to $10.16 billion. Nike is currently focusing on innovation and digital transformation. It has also seen solid international growth, with efforts in China a highlight. Last month, key Nike retailer Foot Locker . But rival Under Armour .  on Thursday briefly cleared an 85.62 buy point but pared gains to dip back below that level.JinkoSolar To Report Amid ResurgenceThe China-based solar power company reports Q1 earnings before the market open Friday. Wall Street expects EPS to soar to 23 from 2 cents a year ago as revenue climbs 23% to $895 million. JinkoSolar stock has doubled in price this year and is currently in a buy zone. CFRA Research raised its price target on JinkoSolar, based on growing confidence about a resurgence in demand within China and the U.S. for the second half, coupled with improving conditions in Europe.NATO Meeting Key For F-35, S-400 DealsDefense ministers from NATO members will meet in Brussels on Wednesday and Thursday. Turkish and U.S. defense chiefs could discuss Ankara's purchase of Russia's S-400 air defense system, which the U.S. has warned will result in Turkey's ouster from the Lockheed Martin F-35 program at the end of July. Acting Defense Secretary Shanahan will step down from his role on Sunday and current Army Secretary Mark Epser will assume the role Monday, then head to Brussels.Paychex Near High With Earnings DueThe payroll and HR services provider should see EPS climb 7% to 65 cents as sales grow 13% to $980 million when it reports early Wednesday. Earnings growth slowed to low-single digits in the March quarter. Paychex benefited from outsourcing, but its growing competition includes Paylocity, ADP and Paycom Software. Paychex stock is near all-time highs and extended from a breakout past a double-bottom 71.85 entry in February.Homebuilders To ReportLennar, the largest home-construction company in the U.S. on total revenue, posts earnings Tuesday before the open. EPS is seen falling 28% to $1.13 as revenue slips 6% to $5.11 billion. Entry-level specialist KB Home reports after the close Wednesday, with EPS expected to slide 32% to 39 cents as revenue falls 15% to $935 million. Sentiment among U.S. homebuilders has been wavering, despite declining mortgage rates.FedEx To Report Amid China ProbeThe shipping giant reports late Tuesday, and EPS is seen falling 18% to $4.86, while revenue increases 3% to $17.86 billion. FedEx cut its outlook in March citing slowing economic growth and weaker trade around the world. Key customer Amazon continues to build out a delivery network, adding 15 more cargo plans to its fleet June 19. FedEx has said it  and will instead focus "on serving the broader e-commerce market" where daily volumes look set to double to 100 million packages by 2026. Earlier this month, the Chinese government launched an investigation into FedEx regarding its mishandling of packages of telecom giant Huawei.Accenture Near Highs Before ReportThe Dublin-based global tech consulting and services company reports fiscal Q3 earnings early Thursday. EPS is expected to rise 6% to $1.89 as revenue grows 7% to $11.04 billion, analysts estimate. Accenture has been making acquisitions to speed its push into digital, cloud and cybersecurity products. The stock is hovering near record highs.Constellation Brands' Beer In FocusThe maker or Corona, Modelo and Svedka reports Q1 earnings Friday. Wall Street expects EPS to fall 5% to $2.09, on revenue of $2.063 billion, up 0.8%. The results follow Constellation Brands' plans to sell around 30 of its cheaper wine brands to focus on higher-priced product. Analysts will likely have their eye on its strong beer business, amid what Macquarie analysts in May called a "tidal wave of premiumization" in beer. They might also focus on the state of the company's margins, along with its investment in Canadian cannabis company Canopy Growth. On Friday, Constellation reported a quarterly loss of $106 million, or $78.2 million after including tax benefits, on its stake in Canopy, which reported steeper-than-expected losses.Wallgreens Earnings To DropDrugstore chain Walgreens Boots Alliance reports fiscal third-quarter earnings on Thursday. Analysts expect EPS to slip 7% to $1.43, as revenue inches 0.6% higher to $34.534 billion.Economic IndicatorsOn Tuesday, the Commerce Department reports sales of new homes, and on Wednesday, it releases data on durable goods orders. On Thursday, the National Association of Realtors issues its report on pending home sales. On Friday, the Commerce Department put out data on personal spending and income, including the Fed's preferred inflation gauge.YOU ALSO MIGHT LIKE:Load-Date: June 29, 2019End of Document

Editorials from around New YorkAssociated Press State & LocalJune 12, 2019 Wednesday 10:06 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: STATE AND REGIONAL; Editorial RoundupLength: 2591 wordsByline: By The Associated PressBodyRecent editorials of statewide and national interest from New York's newspapers:Newsday on robocallsJune 8The calls come during dinner. During the workday. Even in the middle of the night.They veer from annoying and laughable to frightening and dangerous.Sometimes, they're offering debt reduction, solar panels or a free trip. Sometimes, they're in Mandarin. Other times, they're allegedly urgent calls from the Social Security Administration or the Internal Revenue Service. The truly despicable ones claim someone you love is in trouble.They have to stop.The Federal Communications Commission voted last week to allow phone companies to block such calls by default, without getting customer permission, though the new rule will include an opt-out provision for customers who don't want such calls blocked. Phone companies can choose whether to participate. They also can decide to charge for the service, which would be unfortunate. But the FCC's move is a start.Robocalls have become so ubiquitous that it's surprising when you go a day without getting one. Those who have landlines often don't answer any calls. On cellphones, the scammers use area codes and locations similar to others that you answer. While the calls are hated for how irritating they are, the bigger concern is just how easily and how often they work, and how many seniors and others fall prey to scams and schemes. According to the Federal Trade Commission, U.S. consumers lost $55 million just to tech support-related scams last year.According to Sen. Chuck Schumer, a stunning 34.8 million robocalls were received in Long Island area codes in April alone. That's more than a million calls a day. The FCC says about 60 percent of the complaints it receives are about robocalls. By some estimates, more than half of robocalls are scams.For years, there's been talk about how to combat the calls, but, disappointingly, there's been little action. Schumer and others have pushed for change, but federal efforts have failed to make a difference. The National Do Not Call registry has been ignored by scammers, and penalties on robocallers who have been caught haven't been sufficient.The FTC and the FCC set regulations on this issue. Now, Congress and both agencies seem close to finding viable solutions. The U.S. Senate last month passed the Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence Act (TRACED). The bill, sponsored by Massachusetts Democrat Ed Markey and South Dakota Republican John Thune, would give the FCC more power to fine robocallers, as much as $10,000 per call, and would add to the timeframe between when a call is placed and when the FCC can find and prosecute such scammers. Perhaps most important, the legislation would require telecommunications firms to establish technology that authenticates which calls are real and which are robocalls or scams, and to stop them before they reach a customer.Fighting robocalls might just be the one issue nowadays that could be truly bipartisan. The TRACED legislation passed the Senate 97-1, with Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) as the sole holdout. Perhaps Paul doesn't own a telephone?Now it's on to the House of Representatives, which should pass the bill, too. We hope President Donald Trump will sign it.But that won't be enough. The FCC's new rule should help, too. It also will allow consumers to decide whether to get calls only from contacts that they specify.Questions on how to execute the FCC's proposed filters remain. Regulators will have to work with the phone companies to make sure filters are flexible, so wanted robocalls - like a school closing or a fraud alert from a credit card company - get through. They'll also have to be aware of whether phone companies start to charge for the service, and, if they do, consider mandating that it be free of charge.Federal officials and advocates also must educate seniors and others who are vulnerable to falling for fraud, while aggressively pursuing and penalizing the scammers.Despite the progress that's being made, however, we're not convinced the FCC's own leadership is fully committed to ridding consumers of this plague. Sometimes, it appears to kowtow to the industries that benefit from lax regulations. Republican FCC Commissioner Michael O'Rielly told an industry group representing debt collectors this month that "Robocall is not a bad word," and argued that federal officials should "stop vilifying automated calls."Most consumers would say otherwise.The scourge of robocalls will end only when telecommunications companies, federal regulators and lawmakers get ahead of the robocallers with technology and regulation, and a constant pursuit of scammers.It's time to hang up on robocalls.Online: https://nwsdy.li/2F69FQR___The Daily News on Transportation Secretary Elaine ChaoJune 12U.S. Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell are in bed with each other, and not just as husband and wife.New revelations of official coziness are a huge problem for Chao, whose leadership of the infrastructure-building agency was already on a shaky foundation. Unless she can explain a slew of suspect decisions, and do it quick, she must step down.Monday, Politico reported that Chao designated a dedicated liaison to help Kentucky and only Kentucky - the state represented by her powerful spouse - with infrastructure grants.Not California, with more people and needs than anyplace else. Not New York, the economic capital, with aging tunnels and bridges. Just the Bluegrass State.So just as McConnell was gearing up for reelection, Kentucky won nearly $80 million in approved grants, including a highway-improvement project that had been previously rejected twice. Convenient.This obscene use of political power puts in sharp focus other curious episodes during Chao's tenure.The New York Times reported that in a 2017 proposed trip to China, Chao - whose family runs an American shipping company with extensive business in China - attempted to have Beijing Embassy staff coordinate travel for at least one family member and have other relatives sit in on meetings with Chinese government officials.Last month, the Wall Street Journal revealed that Chao made $40,000 profiting from sale of stock in the country's largest construction materials supplier - stock she had promised to divest from a year ago.At this point, we're too exhausted to muster much surprise at the discovery of this type of behavior in the Trump Cabinet. But we're not tired enough to take it laying down.Online: https://bit.ly/2F4Odvy___The Adirondack Daily Enterprise on no-bail reformJune 3Have legislators in Albany just erected a massive roadblock to treating the opioid scourge by eliminating bail for low-level drug offenses?It is entirely possible.Consider this situation - which isn't really hypothetical because we have heard of it happening:Someone with an addiction issue is arrested on a low-level charge and taken to their county jail in lieu of a small amount of bail. Unable to post bail, with the help of medication available at the jail and a little bit of time, the addict realizes he or she needs help to get rid of the addiction. The addict volunteers to attend Drug Court and is released from jail without paying bail on the condition that he or she continues with treatment programs.In this circumstance, the inability to post bail has actually been a benefit to both a person and to the community by helping addicts realize they need help.Franklin County, at least, does a drug screening for everyone it takes in and offers treatment. We have been at presentations at which Franklin County law enforcement, social services, medical and drug treatment officials - as well as addicts in recovery - all agreed that there are many pathways to recovery for addicts once they get into the jail and prison system. It's on the outside that we need more treatment access.Without bail or the threat of time in jail, we wonder if fewer people will see a drug arrest as a wake-up call.That's a fear that David Soares, Albany County district attorney, shared with state legislators during testimony in January."I also need to point out the possible impact on drug courts. The way drug courts work right now is that defendants are held on bail and given the option of drug court or jail," Soares told legislators. "If everyone gets presumptive release on drug cases, nobody will go to drug court. We need to carefully examine how we treat drug crimes under any new bail proposal. I know I don't have to tell you how bad the opioid crisis is in our state. Drug courts around have been very successful in helping individuals get the services they need and stay clean."We hope Soares's prediction doesn't come true. Drug courts are a well-used tool here and around the country, proven to reduce recidivism among addicts.Consider, too, the revolving door through which someone is charged, posts quick bail and is back on the streets offending again. The phenomenon happens regularly and is true of low-level dealers who are often charged with crimes other than drug dealing. Bail reform is likely to allow low-level users back onto the streets even more quickly than before. Alaska implemented a comprehensive criminal reform bill in 2016 that placed defendants into pretrial services after a risk assessment was performed. Later dubbed "catch and release," Alaska's governor asked for change to the system in 2018 and then pushed tougher reforms to the legislation in January.Bail reform, as a concept, is not a bad idea. Bail reform as it has been approved in New York very likely may be a bad idea. Democrats in Albany can't say they weren't warned about the issues with the law as it is written. Soares, himself a Democrat who is described as a progressive, warned legislators in pretty stark terms about the flaws in the bail reform legislation. They chose not to heed him. If it turns out that New York follows Alaska's "catch and release" example or, even worse, that counties find out addicts aren't finding their way into treatment, we hope state legislators will use their heads and rewrite the law.Online: https://bit.ly/2F3wODO___The Glen Falls Post-Star on law enforcement monitoring social mediaJune 7The Warren County Sheriff's Office says it has "contracted" with a Burlington-based technology company to use advanced artificial intelligence to monitor social media accounts and alert law enforcement to possible threats toward local schools.We like that schools and law enforcement are looking to alternatives to armed resource officers when it comes to school safety, but we'd like to know more details before going forward. We believe a greater community discussion needs to be had.We wonder if there is still a general expectation that social media posts are private. How many of us really understand our Facebook privacy settings?The company, Social Sentinel, was founded by Gary Margolis, a 30-year veteran of law enforcement and security who had previously served as the chief of police at the University of Vermont.The company describes itself this way on its website:- We study and understand the language of harm and violence. We deploy advanced technology and work with subject matter experts to constantly evolve Social Sentinel's proprietary machine learning methodologies.- Machine learning (AI) algorithms classify data into alerts for immediate attention and insights for a broader context, leading to greater understanding.- We built technology that searches worldwide to make local connections beyond a geo-fence.- We create context by highlighting discussions and trends relevant to your communities right now.It is a compelling solution to not only school violence, but anyone who might be contemplating doing harm to themselves.It's fighting technology with technology. Social Sentinel says it scans through "a billion posts daily to identify ones related to a school's safety, security and wellness." It scans a dozen social media platforms using an ever-evolving "language of harm" library as a baseline of what words to be concerned about.Naturally, even the most advanced computer systems can't be 100 percent accurate about intent. A CBS News report last fall pointed out a case where the post "I gotta kill you all" was flagged. It turned out it was a rap lyric. And one of the flaws of the system is many false positives, so there is an absolute need for someone to review any post that is flagged.The way it works, when Social Sentinel has a concern with a post, it alerts the Sheriff's Office, whose officers decide how to proceed and whether they should try to track down that person.Because law enforcement is involved, there is a concern that the system could be abused.Deciding what is harmless, a bad joke or a real threat can be subjective. It is unclear how law enforcement officials might respond as they investigate.How would a hacked account be handled?Will officers be given advanced training on how to evaluate social media threats? What will be the standards? And once it becomes widely known that social media posts are regularly reviewed, won't the system become less effective? There is also a concern it could be abused by law enforcement. Four years ago, the Lowell Police Department was looking to purchase a similar monitoring system and received objections from the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts' Technology for Liberty Project."People should be able to criticize government in a free society without some cop somewhere writing down everything they say," said director Kade Crockford to the Lowell Sun at the time. We're concerned this is a slippery slope, but it is an option that should be explored.Online: https://bit.ly/2KeJADk___The Dunkirk Evening Observer on China tariffs and rare earth mineralsJune 7Thank you, Beijing, for making it clear to Americans how short-sighted we have been for many years.Chinese officials have issued a new threat as part of their reaction to President Donald Trump's increases in tariffs on some goods imported here from China. His purpose is to force Beijing to lower trade barriers that harm U.S. companies and to curb abuses such as theft of intellectual property.Some of the materials used in electronic devices such as cell phones and electric vehicles are rare minerals. Collectively, they sometimes are referred to as "rare earth."Instead of developing other, secure sources of such minerals, the United States has become dependent to some extent on China, which possesses large quantities of rare earth.Now, the Chinese are hinting that in retaliation for Trump's action, they may cut off our supplies of the minerals.For decades, proponents of a global marketplace approach to economics have assured Americans that is in our best interests in both the short and long terms. So, we have allowed other countries to build up certain critical industries, including energy and steelmaking. In the process, the United States has become dependent on other nations for many products, including some critical to our national security.Yes, that has meant lower prices for some goods, including steel and sometimes, gasoline. It also has resulted in other nations - or groups of them, as with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries for many years - being able to influence both our economic and diplomatic policies by threatening to cut us off and sometimes doing so.China's threat on rare earth is one more reminder of how shortsighted our policies have been.Online: https://bit.ly/2ZuAqqfLoad-Date: June 13, 2019End of Document

RIGHTS GROUP PRESSES ISLAMIC WORLD OVER XINJIANG CAMPS AHEAD OF UN SESSIONStates News ServiceMay 24, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 687 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:The U.S.-based advocacy group Human Rights Watch (HRW) launched a campaign on Friday aimed at persuading Islamic countries to end their silence over the more than a million Muslim Uyghurs languishing in Chinese detention camps in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR).The "Close the Camps" social media campaign has opened during the Islamic world's celebration of Ramadan and is focusing on getting the Xinjiang camps on the agenda of the United Nations Human Rights Council's 41st session, which opens June 24."All Muslims in Xinjiang face pervasive restrictions on their religious practices and endure other rights violations, including collective punishment, restricted movement, and invasive surveillance," said HRW."We're asking the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), its member countries, and other concerned governments to speak up for Xinjiang's Muslims," HRW said.Up to 1.5 million Uyghurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities accused of harboring "strong religious views" and "politically incorrect" ideas have been held since April 2017.Reporting by RFA's Uyghur Service and other media outlets has shown that those in the camps routinely face rough treatment at the hands of their overseers, and endure poor diets and unhygienic conditions.China has come under strong criticism, and calls for sanctions against officials responsible for the camps, from the United States and other Western countries. The Muslim world, with a few exceptions has remained silent.The HRW campaign uses tweets and Facebook posts to prod the OIC into action, asking its members to help call out China and support efforts to monitor the treatment of Uyghurs at the UN rights meeting next month."It's Ramadan. Will the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation stay silent as the Chinese government effectively outlaws the practice of Islam in #Xinjiang? Or will its members have the courage to condemn these outrageous abuses against 13 million Muslims at the UN Human Rights Council?" reads one tweet in the campaign."China is systematically violating the rights of Muslims in #Xinjiang. Will the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation stand up for Muslims facing political indoctrination, collective punishment, restrictions on movement, communications, religion, and surveillance at the UN Human Rights Council?" says another.A third tweet asks "why does the OIC express concern about Islamophobia and attacks on Muslims in New Zealand, Sri Lanka, India, and Myanmarbut not in China?"Though Beijing initially denied the existence of re-education camps, China has tried to change the discussion, describing the facilities as "boarding schools" that provide vocational training for Uyghurs, discourage radicalization and help protect the country from terrorism.China recently organized two visits to monitor re-education camps in the XUARone for a small group of foreign journalists, and another for diplomats from non-Western countries, including Russia, Indonesia, Kazakhstan and Thailandduring which officials dismissed claims about mistreatment and poor conditions in the facilities as "slanderous lies."Samira Alim, a researcher at the Washington-based Freedom House, in December published an essay in The Diplomat, an online foreign policy journal, on why the Islamic world has been vocal on the Palestinian issue and on Danish cartoons accused of insulting their faith, but silent on Uyghurs."Why haven't the 49 Muslim-majority countries been equally vocal on the situation in Xinjiang? Part of the reason may be that the region and its people are on the periphery of the global Muslim community, isolated and far removed from most Muslims' awareness," he wrote.Beyond remoteness, he said, "China's enormous economic influence across the Middle East, Africa, and Asia surely plays a critical role in Muslim leaders' calculations.""Moreover, the governments of many Muslim-majority countries may fear that challenging China on its human rights abuses will cast a spotlight on their own violations," wrote Alim.Reported by RFA's Uyghur Service.

On Tuesday, the USA announced a 90-day reprieve for Google and others to ensure current users of Huawei phones were not affected. While the company develops some of its own chips, it relies on USA firms for other parts.In 2012, Huawei's US sales collapsed after a congressional panel told businesses to avoid its products and those from another Chinese company, ZTE."We are in discussions with Huawei and will provide a further update as soon as we can", the firm said in a statement. These phones will get software updates from Huawei.Claim The Sims 4 and own it foreverAnd for free, what's not to like?

The order, which would ease USA exports to the tech giant, is expected to be published on Wednesday.Load-Date: May 23, 2019End of Document

Heficed Is Expanding in Asia With a New PoP in Hong Kong; Growing demand for IaaS creates opportunities for niche and mainstream network infrastructure providers in Hong KongBusiness WireJune 21, 2019 Friday 1:09 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Business Wire, Inc.Length: 531 wordsDateline: LONDON BodyAfter Amazon Web Services launched their new data centre in Hong Kong this April, all the major players of the network infrastructure industry are now present in the city. Several niche service providers - such as Heficed - are also gaining their footing in the Asia Pacific region due to the demand for more flexible and custom network infrastructure solutions.The global market of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), valued at $15.20 billion in 2016, is expected to develop to $182.27 billion by 2025 at an annual growth rate of 28.2%. Thanks to such a healthy growth percentage, it is no surprise that certain cities are establishing themselves as prime locations for IaaS companies to expand within a given region - Hong Kong being an example of such a city in the Asia Pacific.Even though the behemoths of the tech world dominate both the Asian and the global network infrastructure markets, a constant need for more personal, flexible, and customizable solutions creates niches for smaller providers to thrive in.Heficed, one of the market leaders offering IP address , dedicated server and cloud solutions, serves as an example of this trend. As the company launched its Hong Kong dedicated server location this month, Heficed's CEO Vincentas Grinius commented on the reasons behind the new server location:"The decision of adding Hong Kong as one of our server locations was made to strengthen our positions in the Asia Pacific region. The growing demand for dedicated servers and IP address services creates various opportunities for companies like Heficed that offer custom and flexible network engineering solutions."As global and Asia Pacific network infrastructure markets are steadily growing, specific locations are at the forefront of this growth. New laws passed by China are also influencing the unprecedented location growth of Hong Kong as a top location."A set of laws enacted by the Chinese government in 2017 required that non-Chinese companies operating in the country would store their data locally, and this worked as an extra catalyst for the above-mentioned market growth," added Vincentas Grinius.While the Chinese businesses are using Hong Kong as a point of departure for international expansion, the non-Chinese companies are attracted to developing their infrastructure for the Chinese market without having to set up their physical infrastructure in mainland China.The state of the global, regional and Chinese IaaS markets suggests that service providers of various scale will continue to see Hong Kong as a top server location for developing their business in the APAC region.ABOUT HEFICEDWith its headquarters in London and server locations in every continent, Heficed is an IP address-oriented company offering flexible and custom IP address infrastructure solutions, cloud services and dedicated servers. At the core of Heficed's business is its world's first automated IP address infrastructure engineering platform, which streamlines the process of leasing and managing IP addresses. www.heficed.comView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190621005260/en/CONTACT: Reda Radykereda.r@heficed.com+37062207959http://www.businesswire.comLoad-Date: June 27, 2019End of Document

A Duke study recorded thousands of students' faces. Now they're being used all over the worldThe Duke Chronicle: Duke UniversityJune 12, 2019 WednesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 1099 wordsByline: Jake SatiskyBodyIt was a gloomy day in March 2014. Thousands of students were walking around campus, going to and from their classes, minding their own business.What they might not have known is that on this particular day, Duke researchers were recording them and putting their likenesses into a data set. This data set would be placed on a public website, and it would be downloaded by academics, security contractors and military researchers around the globe.Researchers employed the surveillance footage data to test and improve facial recognition technology, which has been used primarily for public or private security purposes. The data has been linked to the Chinese government's surveillance of ethnic minorities.The data set and the project's Duke website were taken down in April, after Microsoft came under fire for its facial recognition database that had more than 10 million images of roughly 100,000 people. The company's database was exposed in a Financial Times investigation, in which the data set from Duke was also mentioned as "one of the most popular pedestrian recognition training sets."Microsoft has since pulled its data set, and Stanford University also removed one of its public data sets.The takedown of the website from Duke came after media reports spurred an investigation by the Institutional Review Board, wrote Michael Schoenfeld, vice president for public affairs and government relations, in an email to The Chronicle.Schoenfeld explained that the investigation revealed that the Duke study's data was "neither collected nor made available to the public consistent with the terms of the study that had been approved by the Institutional Review Board."The IRB-which reviews all studies involving human subjects-approved a study that would take place in a "defined indoor space" and create a data set that would only be accessible upon researchers' request. Instead, the researchers performed the study outdoors and placed the data on a public website, he wrote."As a result of this significant deviation from the approved protocol, the public website was taken down on April 25, 2019, and there are no plans to reopen it," Schoenfeld added.The data set was especially popular in China, where it was used by private companies and military academies to test their own facial recognition technology. China has used artificial intelligence to monitor and oppress minority ethnic groups, most notably the Muslim Uyghur population."We have no way of knowing how it was used by those who may have accessed it while it was live," Schoenfeld wrote.In September 2016, researchers from Duke and the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia in Modena, Italy published a paper written to help accelerate progress with developing multi-target, multi-camera tracking systems."As MTMC methods solve larger and larger problems," the paper reads, "it becomes increasingly important (i) to agree on straightforward performance measures that consistently report bottom-line tracker performance, both within and across cameras; (ii) to develop realistically large benchmark data sets for performance evaluation; and (iii) to compare system performance end-to-end."In the paper, the researchers presented a data set they had compiled, consisting of more than two million image frames of around 2,000 students from eight cameras placed around campus. The data set was known as the DukeMTMC. The study was funded by the U.S. Army Research Office and the National Science Foundation.The 85 minutes of video from each camera was captured on one day in March 2014, when researchers knew students would be transitioning between classes.Where cameras were located in March 2014 for the DukeMTMC database study. Open Data Commons Attribution License. Courtesy of Megapixels. Source: Ergys Ristani, Francesco Solera, Roger Zou, Rita Cucchiara and Carlo Tomasi.Ergys Ristani, Graduate School '18 and a co-author of the original paper, told the Financial Times that posters were set up around the surveilled area to warn people, and no one asked to be excluded from the data set. It's unclear whether every passerby saw the posters or understood the ramifications.Carlo Tomasi-Iris Einheuser professor of computer science at Duke, Ristani's supervisor and an author of the original paper-declined to comment on the data set."This project is currently under review, so I'd rather not discuss that publicly for the time being," he wrote in an email.Although the site has been taken down, between 2016 and 2019, researchers from the United States, China, Australia, the United Kingdom and other countries downloaded DukeMTMC in order to test their person re-identification software-a technology designed to match images of pedestrians across different cameras and camera angles. It's challenging due to varied body positions and obstructions that mask or shadow faces.Chinese researchers used DukeMTMC more than anyone else, with 143 verified citations, or 47.8% of worldwide verified citations, according to a Megapixels report on the data set. Megapixels is a research project by researcher Adam Harvey and technologist Jules LaPlace that studies facial recognition databases and biometric surveillance. The United States was second with 57.An April article in the New York Times discussed how China is using widespread surveillance and artificial intelligence to racially track and profile the Uyghur ethnic minority. The article listed Yitu, Megvii, SenseTime, Hikvision and CloudWalk as five Chinese companies that have provided police with the necessary facial recognition software.The Megapixels report found that Megvii, SenseTime, Hikvision and CloudWalk have all used DukeMTMC or data sets extended from it to test their research on person re-identification.Additionally, two military academies in China-National University of Defense Technology and Army Engineering University of People's Liberation Army-that are under the control of their top military body, have also tested software on the DukeMTMC data set."Over 2,000 students and visitors who happened to be walking to class in 2014 will forever remain in all downloaded copies of the Duke MTMC data set and all its extensions," Harvey and LaPlace wrote, "contributing to a global supply chain of data that powers governmental and commercial expansion of biometric surveillance technologies."Nathan Luzum and Isabelle Doan contributed reporting.The Chronicle is not finished investigating the DukeMTMC data set.

FedEx sues US Commerce Department over export restrictions that affect HuaweiCNN WireJune 25, 2019 Tuesday 5:39 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 533 wordsByline: By Sherisse Pham, CNN BusinessDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  US delivery company FedEx has filed a lawsuit against the US government, arguing that it should not be required to enforce federal government export bans.The move comes after FedEx mishandled a couple of deliveries for Huawei, and failed to deliver a Huawei smartphone shipped from Britain to the United States. Huawei is the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker and No. 2 smartphone brand. The Trump administration added Huawei to a trade blacklist last month, barring US companies from selling or exporting technology and components to the Chinese tech firm without first obtaining a US government license. The restrictions have disrupted Huawei's global supply chain, and left companies like Alphabet-owned Google, Micron and Qualcomm scrambling to figure out what they can and cannot sell to Huawei. FedEx said in a statement Monday that the US Export Administration Regulations "violate common carriers' rights" by making delivery companies liable for shipments that may violate US restrictions. "FedEx is a transportation company, not a law enforcement agency," the statement said. The regulations "essentially deputize FedEx to police the contents of the millions of packages it ships daily even though doing so is a virtually impossible task, logistically, economically, and in many cases, legally," the company said in its lawsuit."We have not yet reviewed the complaint, but nevertheless look forward to defending Commerce's role in protecting US national security," a Commerce Department spokesperson said Tuesday. FedEx under fire in ChinaBeijing launched an investigation into FedEx earlier this month, after Huawei said the delivery company diverted to the United States two packages intended for the company's offices in China. "FedEx, as a large multinational corporation, should offer the public a reasonable explanation. And they should also take responsibility for their actions," China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Geng Shuang said Monday, in reference to Huawei's dispute with FedEx. On Friday, PCMag reported that FedEx "refused" to deliver a Huawei smartphone sent by one of its UK writers to the magazine's New York office. It was returned to sender, with a label attached saying "parcel returned by FedEx, due to US government issue" with Huawei and the Chinese government, according to PCMag. "The package in question was mistakenly returned to the shipper, and we apologize for this operational error," FedEx spokesperson Maury Donahue said in a statement to CNN Business. She added that the company is trying to minimize disruptions to customers as "we adjust operations to comply with a dynamic US regulatory environment."Asked about the botched deliveries in an interview with Fox News on Monday, FedEx CEO Fred Smith said "Huawei is just emblematic of this problem."FedEx contacted the Department of Commerce and told them that "the increasing use of restrictions on exports and imports by the Commerce Department in various geopolitical and trade disputes creates just an impossible burden on FedEx and common carriers," Smith said. TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Foxconn chairman stepping down amid talks of political bidAssociated Press State & LocalJune 21, 2019 Friday 5:43 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: STATE AND REGIONALLength: 632 wordsByline: By JOHNSON LAI, Associated PressDateline: TAIPEI, Taiwan BodyTAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) - The chairman of Foxconn, the world's largest contract assembler of consumer electronics for companies such as Apple, is stepping down amid speculation he could be planning a presidential run in Taiwan next year.Terry Gou, 68, made the announcement Friday at the company's annual shareholders meeting, where he was surrounded by an enthusiastic crowd while exiting the meeting room.Foxconn board members elected Young Liu, the head of the Foxconn's semiconductor division, as Gou's successor.Gou has yet to formally announce his candidacy and he did not mention it at the meeting.His resignation, effective July 1, is the latest challenge for Foxconn, which has been caught up in the U.S.-China trade war and a U.S. ban on supplying technology components to Chinese tech giant Huawei over security concerns.Gou told journalists he had urged Apple to move its assembly line from mainland China to high-tech Taiwan, after The Wall Street Journal and other media reported that Apple has discussed shifting some of its production from China with its largest suppliers, including Foxconn. Apple didn't respond to requests for comment about those reports."Taiwan holds a very important position in this current U.S.-China trade dispute, in this global economy reform," Gou said. "Taiwan is important for its technologies, geographical location, protection on intellectual property and application of new technologies."But most analysts believe it would take Apple at least two years to pivot completely away from China because its supply chain for assembling iPhones, iPads and other devices is so complicated.Investors have been worrying that the next round of China tariffs being threatened by U.S. President Donald Trump will hurt Apple's sales and profit margins. That's the main reason the company's stock price is hovering about 14 percent below its peak reached last October.Apple is still hoping for a resolution between the U.S. and China that would avert a 25 percent tariff hitting the iPhone and all its other major products.In a recent letter to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, Apple warned the tariffs would hurt the U.S. economy and hinder its ability to compete against its rivals from China that don't sell their products in the U.S. Those rivals include Huawei and Xiaomi, which already have been gaining ground in the global smartphone market.Gou recently has seemed to shift his focus toward a presidential bid, most likely for the opposition, China-friendly Nationalist Party. He would be bringing a pro-business and pro-China stance to what is expected to be a crowded field.Gou ranks among Taiwan's richest people with a fortune estimated by Forbes at $7.8 billion. He says the Nationalists should hold debates to select their candidate.His candidacy would be the first for a Taiwan business mogul and may appeal to Taiwanese dissatisfied with stagnating incomes who would like to see a different, more business-oriented style of leadership.Incumbent President Tsai Ing-wen has been hampered by low public approval ratings and a diplomatic embargo imposed by China, which claims the island as its own territory.However, Gou is likely to face criticism from China skeptics in Taiwan over Foxconn's 12 factories in nine Chinese cities and his close ties to the Chinese government.Foxconn announced in 2017, to much fanfare, that it planned to invest $10 billion in the U.S. state of Wisconsin and hire 13,000 people to build an LCD factory that could make screens for televisions and a variety of other devices. After waffling earlier this year on the company's intentions, Gou recommitted to the project in February after a meeting with President Donald Trump.___AP Technology Writer Michael Liedtke in San Francisco contributed to this story.Load-Date: June 22, 2019End of Document

Foxconn chairman stepping down amid talks of political bidAssociated Press Financial WireJune 21, 2019 Friday 5:37 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 632 wordsByline: By JOHNSON LAI, Associated PressDateline: TAIPEI, Taiwan BodyTAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) - The chairman of Foxconn, the world's largest contract assembler of consumer electronics for companies such as Apple, is stepping down amid speculation he could be planning a presidential run in Taiwan next year.Terry Gou, 68, made the announcement Friday at the company's annual shareholders meeting, where he was surrounded by an enthusiastic crowd while exiting the meeting room.Foxconn board members elected Young Liu, the head of the Foxconn's semiconductor division, as Gou's successor.Gou has yet to formally announce his candidacy and he did not mention it at the meeting.His resignation, effective July 1, is the latest challenge for Foxconn, which has been caught up in the U.S.-China trade war and a U.S. ban on supplying technology components to Chinese tech giant Huawei over security concerns.Gou told journalists he had urged Apple to move its assembly line from mainland China to high-tech Taiwan, after The Wall Street Journal and other media reported that Apple has discussed shifting some of its production from China with its largest suppliers, including Foxconn. Apple didn't respond to requests for comment about those reports."Taiwan holds a very important position in this current U.S.-China trade dispute, in this global economy reform," Gou said. "Taiwan is important for its technologies, geographical location, protection on intellectual property and application of new technologies."But most analysts believe it would take Apple at least two years to pivot completely away from China because its supply chain for assembling iPhones, iPads and other devices is so complicated.Investors have been worrying that the next round of China tariffs being threatened by U.S. President Donald Trump will hurt Apple's sales and profit margins. That's the main reason the company's stock price is hovering about 14 percent below its peak reached last October.Apple is still hoping for a resolution between the U.S. and China that would avert a 25 percent tariff hitting the iPhone and all its other major products.In a recent letter to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, Apple warned the tariffs would hurt the U.S. economy and hinder its ability to compete against its rivals from China that don't sell their products in the U.S. Those rivals include Huawei and Xiaomi, which already have been gaining ground in the global smartphone market.Gou recently has seemed to shift his focus toward a presidential bid, most likely for the opposition, China-friendly Nationalist Party. He would be bringing a pro-business and pro-China stance to what is expected to be a crowded field.Gou ranks among Taiwan's richest people with a fortune estimated by Forbes at $7.8 billion. He says the Nationalists should hold debates to select their candidate.His candidacy would be the first for a Taiwan business mogul and may appeal to Taiwanese dissatisfied with stagnating incomes who would like to see a different, more business-oriented style of leadership.Incumbent President Tsai Ing-wen has been hampered by low public approval ratings and a diplomatic embargo imposed by China, which claims the island as its own territory.However, Gou is likely to face criticism from China skeptics in Taiwan over Foxconn's 12 factories in nine Chinese cities and his close ties to the Chinese government.Foxconn announced in 2017, to much fanfare, that it planned to invest $10 billion in the U.S. state of Wisconsin and hire 13,000 people to build an LCD factory that could make screens for televisions and a variety of other devices.

Trump administration reviewing foreign money to US collegesAssociated Press State & LocalJune 13, 2019 Thursday 10:57 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: STATE AND REGIONAL; Only on APLength: 897 wordsByline: By COLLIN BINKLEY, AP Education WriterBodyThe U.S. Education Department has opened investigations into foreign funding at Georgetown University and Texas A&M University as part of a broader push to monitor international money flowing to American colleges.Both universities are being ordered to disclose years of financial records amid concerns they have not fully reported their foreign gifts and contracts to the federal government, according to letters sent to the schools Thursday and obtained by The Associated Press.The inquiries are part of a broader campaign to scrutinize foreign funding going to universities and to improve reporting by schools, according to a Trump administration official familiar with the effort.More schools probably will face questioning as federal officials focus on an issue they see as crucial to transparency and national security, according to the official, who was not authorized to publicly discuss the investigations and spoke on condition of anonymity.Federal law requires U.S. colleges to report contracts and donations from foreign sources totaling $250,000 or more, but past filings from Georgetown and Texas A&M "may not fully capture" that information, according to the letters.As an example, department officials wrote, both schools should have reported funding related to branch campuses they operate in Qatar, an oil-rich nation in the Mideast that hosts the outposts of several U.S. colleges.The records being sought by investigators go far beyond Qatar, though, and include dealings with China, Russia and Saudi Arabia, and specific companies in those nations.Investigators ordered both schools to disclose funding from Huawei or ZTE, the Chinese tech giants that some U.S. officials call a threat to national security. Georgetown is being asked to detail money it received from any sources in Saudi Arabia or Russia, including Kaspersky Lab, a Russian cybersecurity company.The letters warn that Georgetown and Texas A&M could face legal action and financial penalties if they're found to have broken the rules.If investigators find a violation, it can be referred to the U.S. attorney general's office for action "to compel compliance and to recover the full costs'" of the investigation and enforcement, according to the letters.Georgetown officials said the school is reviewing the letter and will cooperate with the inquiry. The university said in a statement that it "takes seriously its reporting obligations and provides all information as required by the Department of Education every six months."Texas A&M issued a statement saying it takes compliance and security seriously. "We just received the document today from the U.S. Department of Education and are reviewing it. We are fully cooperating with the inquiry."The crackdown follows complaints from some lawmakers that the Education Department hasn't done enough to review foreign funding to colleges. The issue has gained attention amid heightened tensions with China and some other nations.In February, a bipartisan panel in Congress urged U.S. colleges to cut ties with the Confucius Institute, a Chinese language program funded by a branch of the Chinese government. Some critics say it is a threat to U.S. national security and academic freedom.The same panel found that 70% of U.S. schools receiving $250,000 or more from China to operate Confucius Institutes failed to report the funding, and that the Education Department failed to provide adequate oversight.Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, chairman of the panel, told the department in January to issue updated guidance and improve its oversight practices. On Thursday, he applauded the agency for taking action."When U.S. schools take money from foreign governments, the American people deserve to know about it," he said.Colleges have complained that the rules are unclear. In January, the American Council on Education, which represents dozens of college chiefs, asked for clarity on several aspects of the law and noted that the last guidance on the topic was issued in 2004.The group said schools have been given no guidance on how to correct errors in their filings, for example, and said it is unclear if university foundations, which often house colleges' endowments, are subject to the rules. The letters to Georgetown and Texas A&M both say the schools should have reported funding from their foundations and other nonprofits they control.Foreign funding information that schools submit to the Education Department often provides little detail about where the money comes from and none about how it's used. Typically schools report only the amount of money, the date of the agreement, the country it came from and, sometimes, a specific source within that country.According to data submitted by Georgetown, the school has received more than $415 million from abroad since 2012, including $36 million last year.Nearly all of Georgetown's foreign money reported for 2018 came from sources in Qatar, including $33 million from the Qatar Foundation, a nonprofit that has a partnership with Georgetown to support the school's campus in Qatar.Data filed by Texas A&M show that the school has received $285 million from foreign sources since 2014, including $6.1 million last year. All of Texas A&M's reported funding from last year also came through a partnership with the Qatar Foundation.___Follow Collin Binkley on Twitter at https://twitter.com/cbinkleyLoad-Date: June 14, 2019End of Document

A recent survey put together by             Ernst & Young shows that while Americans see their country as the leading AI force, they look at China as the main obstacle to further advancement by the U.S. Among the highlights of the survey of 500 U.S. CEOs and business leaders: -- The data showed that 47% of those surveyed see China as the biggest obstacle to AI advancement in the U.S.-- AI is a field that business leaders also trust, with 85% of respondents saying they are optimistic about the uses of artificial intelligence. More than half say the U.S. is the leader in this space. -- In addition, 87% of respondents said they are expecting their companies to invest in AI this year, while only 13% say this might not happen. -- About a quarter of those surveyed said China comes second in the global AI race after the United States, followed by Japan,            Canada and            Germany. [READ:AI Might Force You to Learn a New Profession Every 10 Years]-- Russia is the second-biggest obstacle in AI development in the U.S. according to 14% of the respondents, followed by Japan (12%), the            United Kingdom (7%) and Canada (5%). About 8 in 10 respondents say the U.S. government is most open to working with companies to adopt AI technology, followed by the Chinese and Japanese governments, respectively.

Google's decision threatens Huawei's positioning in Latin America: EuromonitorCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 20, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 623 wordsBody The announcement that Google plans to withdraw the Android operating system from Huawei devices is a threat to the positioning of this Chinese brand, said Jorge Araya, senior research analyst, consumer electronics at Euromonitor International.  For Araya it is difficult to imagine a product without access to the main services and applications that Google currently offers. However, he considered that it is still too early to venture a significant risk in their sales.  "The category of smartphones in Latin America , led by Samsung, has undergone changes in recent years due to the entry of Asian brands such as Huawei, which has gained market share quickly in Chile and Colombia. The quality of its products, the advantages of the cameras and undoubtedly its price competition has allowed the success that they have in the region today, "said the analyst.  In just five years (2013 to 2018), Huawei's participation in the region's market went from the tenth to the fifth place in the Latin American smartphone companies ranking, performed by Euromonitor International.  In 2018, Huawei had 9.4% of the Latin American market , below LG Corp, which ranked fourth in the Ranking, Lenovo Group (10.3%) and TLC Corp (11.4%); while Samsung accounted for 30.3 percent.  Alphabet Inc. announced this Sunday May 19 that it decided to suspend business with Huawei that required the transfer of hardware and software products to comply with the national emergency decree, signed on May 15, by President Donald Trump to prohibit US companies from using telecommunications equipment, manufactured by companies that pose a risk to national security.  Jorge Araya considered that it is still necessary to know the strategy that Huawei will take on this problem, which is not new for them and for which they have been preparing since mid-2018.  "We still do not know if Huawei will develop a new operating system, but a quick response could reduce the uncertainty of consumers and prevent them from opting for other brands in the short term," said Araya.  In its official position on Google's measures, the Chinese company recalled that it has made substantial contributions to the development and growth of the Android ecosystem around the world.  The Asian company said it will continue to provide security updates and after-sales service to all existing Huawei smartphones and tablets, including those that have already been sold and those that are available for sale.  "Huawei has a complete set of robust and effective business continuity management systems, implemented in all countries where we operate, including Mexico, with these systems, most of our products will continue to serve our Mexican customers, even in extreme conditions. In addition, the products that we have sold and that we currently sell in Mexico will not be affected, "the company told El Economista .  EU delays Huawei sanctions for three months  The US Department of Commerce established a temporary license that will last until August 19 of this year, which restores Huawei's ability to maintain existing networks and provide software updates to mobile phones in use manufactured by the Chinese company.  The license, which was published for inspection and that seeks to help current customers, reduces the restrictions that last weekimposed the United States government on Huawei Technologies Co Ltd for the purchase of US goods.  Meanwhile, the Chinese government announced on Monday May 20 that it will pay attention to the progress of the situation of the Huawei case and "will support Chinese companies in the defense of their legitimate rights through legal methods," according to a newspaper report.

Global stocks subdued as trade dispute remains in focusAssociated Press InternationalMay 15, 2019 Wednesday 11:55 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; Financial MarketsLength: 423 wordsByline: By JOE McDONALD, AP Business WriterDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - Stock markets mostly turned lower in European trading Wednesday over the trade dispute between the U.S. and China, even though President Donald Trump said a settlement was still possible.London's FTSE 100 slipped 0.1% to 7,235 while France's CAC 40 shed 0.4% to 5,321. Despite a report that Germany returned to growth in the first quarter, the DAX slid more than 0.4% to 11,939. Europe's biggest economy grew by 0.4% during the January-March period after a difficult few quarters, thanks to solid consumer spending and boom.On Wall Street, futures for the Standard & Poor's 500 index declined 0.2% to 2,833 while the same for the Dow Jones industrial average also declined 0.2%, to 25,508.Benchmarks in Shanghai and Tokyo closed higher as investors tried to figure out the costs of U.S. and Chinese tariff hikes on hundreds of billions of dollars of each other's goods.Trump threw financial markets into turmoil with his surprise May 5 announcement of plans to raise tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports to 25% from 10%. When that went ahead Friday, Beijing retaliated by raising duties on $60 billion of American goods.Investors worry that in addition to depressing trade, the fight sparked by U.S. complaints about China's technology ambitions might hurt consumer and business confidence, weakening spending and investment.On Tuesday, some markets steadied after Trump said the conflict was a "little squabble" between friends.The Shanghai Composite Index ended up 1.9% at 2,938.68 while Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.5% to 28,268.71 as investors also digested figures showing China's factory output and consumer spending weakened in April as the tariff war intensified.

Global stocks subdued as trade dispute remains in focusAssociated Press Financial WireMay 15, 2019 Wednesday 11:55 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; Financial MarketsLength: 423 wordsByline: By JOE McDONALD, AP Business WriterDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - Stock markets mostly turned lower in European trading Wednesday over the trade dispute between the U.S. and China, even though President Donald Trump said a settlement was still possible.London's FTSE 100 slipped 0.1% to 7,235 while France's CAC 40 shed 0.4% to 5,321. Despite a report that Germany returned to growth in the first quarter, the DAX slid more than 0.4% to 11,939. Europe's biggest economy grew by 0.4% during the January-March period after a difficult few quarters, thanks to solid consumer spending and boom.On Wall Street, futures for the Standard & Poor's 500 index declined 0.2% to 2,833 while the same for the Dow Jones industrial average also declined 0.2%, to 25,508.Benchmarks in Shanghai and Tokyo closed higher as investors tried to figure out the costs of U.S. and Chinese tariff hikes on hundreds of billions of dollars of each other's goods.Trump threw financial markets into turmoil with his surprise May 5 announcement of plans to raise tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports to 25% from 10%. When that went ahead Friday, Beijing retaliated by raising duties on $60 billion of American goods.Investors worry that in addition to depressing trade, the fight sparked by U.S. complaints about China's technology ambitions might hurt consumer and business confidence, weakening spending and investment.On Tuesday, some markets steadied after Trump said the conflict was a "little squabble" between friends.The Shanghai Composite Index ended up 1.9% at 2,938.68 while Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.5% to 28,268.71 as investors also digested figures showing China's factory output and consumer spending weakened in April as the tariff war intensified.

Nationally relevant logistic hubs are subdivided into six categories: inter-ports, ports, airports, production and services, freight and cross-border. The Plan aims to develop 10 principal national freight railway routes by selecting 127 cities in which to build 212 logistic hubs (41 inter-ports, 30 ports, 23 airports, 47 production and services, 55 freight and 16 cross-border hubs). The Chinese Government's short-term objective is to assure the activation of roughly 30 logistic hubs at national level by 2020 and to have 150 by 2025. The development of the hubs singled out by the Government is expected to contribute to the economic growth of these specific geographical areas of the Country. In this perspective, by 2025, 20 logistic-themed economic zones and 30 logistic hubs will have to be built according to the "rational and effective management of available resources, a network of exchange platforms and by fine-tuning the supply chain". Finally, still by 2025, China intends to enhance the "express" delivery service to the most important international destinations.As for the management aspect, 10 companies specialised in the construction and management of logistic hubs at national level will be established by 2020, in addition to putting in place an ad hoc sector-specific federation. With respect to intelligent logistics and transportation technologies, the Plan drafted by the Chinese Authorities sets forth the construction of hyper-modern logistic infrastructure such as fully automated ports, intelligent and eco-sustainable storage systems, fully computerised documentation techniques and intelligent intermodal transportation infrastructure.Lastly, the Plan establishes the construction of between five to ten international logistics networks "capable of reaching the world's biggest economies", by harmonising national and international standards. Beijing explicitly proposes to reinforce railway connections between national railway hubs and Europe as well as establish "a strategic cooperation with logistic hubs abroad" and connect China's main maritime and fluvial ports to the major airports and maritime ports around the world, in order to be able to reach a larger number of destinations.Load-Date: April 3, 2019End of Document

Fitch: Huawei's loss could be rival Samsung's gainUPIMay 27, 2019 Monday 5:42 AM ESTCopyright 2019 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 481 wordsByline: THOMAS MARESCADateline: May 27 BodySamsung could be the big winner in a China-U.S. trade spat that has led to sanctions against Chinese smartphone giant Huawei, according to a statement Monday from , the New York-based global credit ratings and research firm."Turmoil from the U.S.-China trade dispute brings Samsung an opportunity to strengthen its position in the structurally weakening smartphone market," the statement said.Amidst an ongoing trade war with China, the Trump administration placed Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications equipment and electronics giant, on an "entity list" that severely restricts it from doing business with any American company.The Commerce Department has accused Huawei of being an arm of the Chinese government, saying it is "engaged in activities that are contrary to U.S. national security or foreign policy interest."Following the blacklist,  revoked Huawei's license of its Android operating system. Other major technology suppliers such as Britain-based ARM, which supplies the underlying architecture for Huawei's chipsets, have also cut ties, according to reports.Last week, Washington gave Huawei a 90-day reprieve from the sanctions, but uncertainty still swirls around the company's prospects.The restrictions on U.S. companies providing hardware, software and components to Huawei's smartphone business "could stir up the smartphone industry by pausing Huawei's positive momentum," the Fitch statement said.Huawei is the number two smartphone maker in the world, with a 19 percent global market share in the first quarter of 2019, according to a recent report from International Data Corporation, following on the heels of Samsung's 23.1 percent.The Chinese giant was the only global smartphone maker to see volume growth in a market that has otherwise seen shipments on the decline."Consumers used to the Android operating system are likely to consider buying other smartphone brands than Huawei, and Samsung could restore market share especially in regions where Huawei has shown strong recent growth," the Fitch statement said, citing Europe, South America and parts of Asia outside of China.The United States actions against Huawei may also give Samsung the lead in newly developing segments of the market such as 5G and foldable phones, Fitch said, depending on how long sanctions last."U.K. and Japanese companies have followed suit in delaying the launch of Huawei's 5G smartphones, which could help boost the sales of Samsung and LG Electronics, two of a few 5G handset makers with ready-to-market products -- at least in the short term," the statement added.Fitch expects the challenging outlook for smartphone manufacturers to continue due to saturation in developed markets and longer replacement cycles. Overall shipments fell 6.6 percent in the first quarter of 2019, according to IDC. Samsung's volume dropped by 8.1 percent, while Huawei's grew by 50 percent.Load-Date: May 28, 2019End of Document

Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram will no longer be pre-installed in Huawei's new phonesCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJune 7, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 508 wordsBody Facebook will not allow Huawei to pre-install its applications on the new phones that Huawei can launch. The news was taken for granted, after the US had included the Chinese manufacturer on a blacklist that prevents US companies from maintaining commercial relations with Asian companies, but Reuters reported today on how the company of Mark Zuckerberg will block Huawei from using Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram.  As in the case of Google's veto, current Huawei device owners will still be able to use these applications and will continue to receive updates through the Play Store. But, unlike the search engine, the Facebook block will be applied to all the Chinese manufacturer's phones that have not yet left the factory. Users who purchase a new Huawei mobile will continue to be able to install the applications of the social media giant through Google Play, since the ban would only affect the fact of pre-installing them, not installing them later, according to sources familiar with the situation. Reuters  The news comes despite the fact that the Administration of Donald Trump has decided to give a truce to Huawei until August 19. In the market it is assumed that other companies, also Americans, such as Twitter will take a similar decision as part of the fulfillment of the US blockade, which accuses the Chinese company of allowing cyber espionage to the Chinese government through its technological equipment.  As mentioned by the agency, mobile manufacturers tend to pre-install a large number of third-party applications. Those of Facebook and Google are usually the most common. In the case of Huawei, its flagship phones P30 came with the applications of Facebook, Booking and Amazon, although in previous years, with the P20 Pro, also preinstalled Instagram.  More fear among users  The news about the blockade of Facebook could unleash more fear among users to acquire a terminal of the Chinese company, which a few days ago acknowledged that their mobile sales had reached up to 30% in Spain after knowing the veto of Google. A figure that multiple sources of the distribution raised up to 50-60%. Many users refuse to buy the phones of the Chinese brand for fear of acquiring a terminal that may become obsolete, and that will not have the most popular applications in the West.  Huawei has already explained that it has a plan B, launch its own operating system to Android, with an application store. The problem is that the company will be forced to compete with Google and Apple to attract the preferences of application developers, which are currently those that give sense to a smartphone. And the task, according to experts, is not simple. These warn that for Huawei not being able to install Google or Facebook applications on their new phones will seriously damage their brand in all markets, except in China, where the applications of the two US companies are already excluded.  The entry Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram will no longer be preinstalled in the new Huawei phones was first published in La Tercera. Load-Date: June 7, 2019End of Document

The Company reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$1.98 and US$1.96, respectively, for the preceding quarter, and basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$0.85 each for the first quarter of 2018. Non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS were US$3.51 and US$3.48, respectively, for the first quarter of 2019, compared to non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$2.75 and US$2.73, respectively, for the preceding quarter, and non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$1.52 and US$1.51, respectively, for the first quarter of 2018.       Quarterly DividendThe board of directors has approved a dividend of US$0.69 per ADS for the first quarter of 2019, which is expected to be paid on June 7, 2019 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 31, 2019.NetEase paid a dividend of US$0.48 per ADS for the fourth quarter of 2018 on March 15, 2019.Under the Company's quarterly dividend policy announced on May 13, 2014, quarterly dividends will be set at an amount equivalent to approximately 25% of the Company's anticipated net income after tax in each fiscal quarter. The determination to make dividend distributions and the amount of such distributions in any particular quarter will be made at the discretion of the board of directors and will be based upon the Company's operations and earnings, cash flow, financial condition and other relevant factors.Other InformationAs of March 31, 2019, the Company's total cash and cash equivalents, current and non-current time deposits and short-term investments balance totaled RMB51,853.1 million (US$7,726.4 million), compared to RMB50,064.3 million as of December 31, 2018. Cash flow generated from operating activities was RMB3,386.6 million (US$504.6 million) for the first quarter of 2019, compared to RMB5,935.4 million and RMB1,905.0 million for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2018, respectively.Share Repurchase ProgramOn November 15, 2017, the Company announced that its board of directors had approved a share repurchase program of up to US$1.0 billion of the Company's outstanding ADSs for a period not to exceed 12 months beginning on November 16, 2017. On June 11, 2018, the Company announced that its board of directors approved an amendment to expand the authorized repurchase amount to US$2.0 billion. As of November 15, 2018, the last day of such program, the Company had repurchased approximately 4.6 million ADSs for approximately US$1,178.5 million under this program.On November 14, 2018, the Company also announced that its board of directors had approved a new share repurchase program of up to US$1.0 billion of the Company's outstanding ADSs for a period not to exceed 12 months beginning on November 16, 2018. As of March 31, 2019, no ADSs had been repurchased under this program.Under the terms of the current approved program, NetEase may repurchase its issued and outstanding ADSs in open-market transactions on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. The timing and dollar amount of repurchase transactions will be subject to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 10b-18 requirements. It is also expected that such repurchases will be effected pursuant to a plan in conformity with SEC Rule 10b5-1. The extent to which NetEase repurchases its ADSs will depend upon a variety of factors, including market conditions, regulatory requirements and other corporate considerations, as determined by NetEase's management team. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.** The United States dollar (US$) amounts disclosed in this press release are presented solely for the convenience of the reader. Translations of amounts from RMB into United States dollars for the convenience of the reader were calculated at the noon buying rate of US$1.00 = RMB6.7112 on March 29, 2019 as set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board. No representation is made that the RMB amounts could have been, or could be, converted into US$ at that rate on March 29, 2019, or at any other certain date. The percentages stated are calculated based on RMB.Change in Segment ReportingEffective as of December 31, 2018, the Company renamed its "e-mail and others" segment to "innovative businesses and others" to better articulate the businesses included in this segment, there's no change to the business mix included in this segment.  The Company now reports four reporting segments: online game services, e-commerce, advertising services and innovative businesses and others, and retrospectively revised prior period segment information to conform to current period presentation.Impact of the Recently Adopted Major Accounting PronouncementIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 "Leases" as amended, which generally requires lessees to recognize operating and financing lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets on the balance sheet and to provide enhanced disclosures surrounding the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leasing arrangements. The Company adopted the new standard effective January 1, 2019 on a modified retrospective basis and did not restate comparative periods. The Company recognized approximately RMB861.5 million as total right-of-use assets as well as total lease liabilities for the operating leases on its consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2019. The Company recognized RMB747.4 million and RMB763.2 million as total right-of-use assets and total lease liabilities, respectively, for the operating leases on its consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2019. Right-of-use assets are included in other long-term assets, and lease liabilities are included in accrual liabilities and other payables and other long-term payables respectively based on payment terms on the consolidated balance sheet. Other than the foregoing, the Company does not expect the new standard to have a material impact on the net assets of the Company's consolidated financial statements.Conference CallNetEase's management team will host a teleconference call with simultaneous webcast at 7:30 p.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday, May 15, 2019 (Beijing/Hong Kong Time: 7:30 a.m., Thursday, May 16, 2019).

These statements are made under the "safe harbor" provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these forward-looking statements by terminology such as "will," "expects," "anticipates," "future," "intends," "plans," "believes," "estimates" and similar statements. The accuracy of these statements may be impacted by a number of business risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or anticipated, including risks related to: the risk that the online game market will not continue to grow or that NetEase will not be able to maintain its leading position in that market, which could occur if, for example, its new online games or expansion packs and other improvements to its existing games do not become as popular as management anticipates; the ability of NetEase to successfully expand its mobile internet offerings; the ability of NetEase to effectively market its games and other services and achieve a positive return on its marketing expenditures; the risk that NetEase's affiliates will not be able to continue operatingMinecraft or other games licensed by it for a period of time or permanently due to possible governmental actions or the risk that such games will not be popular with game players in China; the risk that changes in Chinese government regulation of the online game market and the market for NetEase's e-commerce businesses may limit future growth of NetEase's revenues or cause revenues to decline; competition in the online advertising business and the risk that investments by NetEase in its content and services may not increase the appeal of the NetEase websites among internet users or result in increased advertising revenues; the risk that NetEase may not be able to continuously develop new and creative online services, including its ability to maintain and enhance the popularity of its online game, e-commerce and other innovative businesses; the risk that NetEase will not be able to control its expenses in future periods; competition in NetEase's existing and potential markets; governmental uncertainties (including possible changes in the effective tax rates applicable to NetEase and its subsidiaries and affiliates and the ability of NetEase to receive and maintain approvals of the preferential tax treatments); the risk that fluctuations in the value of the Renminbi with respect to other currencies could adversely affect NetEase's business and financial results; and other risks outlined in NetEase's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. NetEase does not undertake any obligation to update this forward-looking information, except as required under the applicable law.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresNetEase considers and uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS, as supplemental metrics in reviewing and assessing its operating performance and formulating its business plan. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP").NetEase defines non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders as net income attributable to the Company's shareholders excluding share-based compensation expenses. Non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders enables NetEase's management to assess its operating results without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses, which are non-cash charges. NetEase believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating the Company's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose. NetEase also believes that the use of this non-GAAP financial measure facilitates investors' assessment of its operating performance.Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders is that it does not reflect all items of expense that affect our operations. Share-based compensation expenses have been and may continue to be incurred in our business and are not reflected in the presentation of non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures NetEase uses may differ from the non-GAAP measures used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited.NetEase compensates for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance. See "Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results" at the end of this press release. NetEase encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. Contact for Media and Investors:Margaret ShiNetEase,

Dow Jones, Big Cap Stocks Lead Broad Drop; Will This Tech Sector Halt The Bull Run?Investor's Business DailyMay 28, 2019Copyright 2019 Investor's Business Daily, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: THE BIG PICTURELength: 755 wordsByline: DAVID SAITO-CHUNGBodyhttps://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/stock-bear-2-adobe.jpgInvestors arose from the three-day Memorial Day Weekend with an urge to buy stocks after a market pullback reached three straight weeks for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, and five weeks for the Dow Jones Industrial Average.But amid what appeared to be zero progress reported on the tariff spat between the U.S. and China, the Tuesday "rally" showed the permanence of steam lifting from BBQ pork buns at a Chinese dim sum eatery.The S&P 500 led the decline. A 0.5% gain in the first 20 minutes of the session withered into a 0.8% loss by day's end. The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 0.9% as half of the blue chip index's 30 components dropped 1 point or more. They ranged from health care (UnitedHealth and Johnson & Johnson) to cyclicals (Home Depot) to banking (Goldman Sachs).Transports got whacked. The Dow Jones transportation average fell 1.3%. Trucking giant J.B. Hunt slid near 4% to 85.76, hitting levels not seen since the summer of 2017, in heavy volume.The Nasdaq composite outperformed, falling just 0.4%, despite another bad day for chip stocks.Volume rose on both main exchanges, reaffirming an anxiousness among institutional investors to sell shares hard and lock in profits in the near term.Tuesday completed the 10th day of trade since IBD downgraded the outlook for stocks to "market in correction" on May 13.Institutional Investors Go On DefensiveWas there a flight to safe havens? Yes and no.Yes, in that prices on the long-dated end of U.S. government bonds rallied furiously, sending yields plunging.The yield on the benchmark Treasury 10-year note fell six basis points to 2.26%. That's down from 2.52% at the start of May, or roughly a quarter point in long-term interest rates.Regarding the "no" answer, the Dow Jones utility average got smacked particularly hard.The Dow utilities fell nearly 1.6%. That cut its year-to-date gain to 11%.Analyzing The S&P 500 ChartThe S&P 500 is in a sort of purgatory state, chartwise.Notice how the large-cap benchmark-tracking SPDR S&P 500 ETF trades between its 50-day moving average (which is still rising) and its longer-term 200-day moving average (flattening out).A healthy S&P 500, in a confirmed uptrend, rises above both moving averages and leads them higher. For several months this year, that in fact was the case after the S&P mustered a  on Jan. 4, kick-starting a sharp rebound and a tradable rally.Today, the S&P 500 looks poised to test the 2800 level for a third time in three weeks. It's also just two points away from taking out its May 13 near-term low of 2801.43.Will Chips Kill The Bull Run?Intel, Xilinx and VanEck Semiconductor ETF exemplified the angst on Wall Street as the U.S. and China continue to wage economic war in the form of stinging import tariffs. President Donald Trump's executive order to ban U.S. tech companies from doing business with Chinese telecom gear titan Huawei Technologies certainly is weighing on this key sector in tech stocks."We still believe that a trade deal will be reached, although it may take many months," Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at R.W. Baird, wrote in a Tuesday note to clients. "We must not lose sight that the Chinese government has a very definite sense of its own national destiny with a goal of surpassing the U.S. economically, technologically and eventually militarily."Some observers note that within the tech sector, U.S. chipmakers stand the most to lose from a prolonged trade war with the Middle Kingdom.Still, it's remarkable to note that the Nasdaq still did better than most market indexes on Tuesday. Give credit to leaders in the enterprise software, e-commerce and internet content areas of the market. Through Friday, IBD's  at No. 1 among 33 general sectors for mid- and long-term price performance, followed by Telecom (No. 2) and Business Services (No. 7), which also has a sprinkling of tech-related firms.Internet has fallen to No. 16, Electronics down to No. 17. The Chips sector ranks No. 25. Through Friday, the chip sector was up 9.6% since Jan. 1.These ETFs Beat The Dow JonesInnovator IBD 50 outperformed the key averages, ending nearly flat, but it lost virtually all of the solid gains. At 32.75, the exchange traded fund holds an 18.6% year-to-date gain. Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities rallied almost 0.9% to 20.82, extending its advance since Jan. 1 to 19.7%.Please follow Chung on Twitter at @SaitoChung and @IBD_DChung for more on stock market analysis.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Load-Date: June 5, 2019End of Document

Panasonic 'suspends transactions' with Huawei after United States banStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeMay 28, 2019 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: HI TECH; Pg. 1Length: 449 wordsByline: Sandy MccarthyBodyThis started to be displaying on the website starting from today (Friday) after the company completely removed the Huawei's products from its product catalogs.The ban would force small and independently-owned telecom operators such as Eastern Oregon Telecom and Union Wireless in Wyoming to spend their limited funds buying more expensive gear from Huawei's competitors, according to an article in The New York Times by Chen Lifang, Huawei's group board director.The US claims that Huawei embeds its equipment with backdoors under Beijing's directives to allow the Chinese government to spy on users worldwide as well as conduct cyberattacks.Japan's Panasonic Corp said on Friday it has not stopped any shipments of components to Huawei Technologies, a day after it originally called for a halt of transactions in line with a US export controls against the Chinese firm.US President Donald Trump signed an executive order that effectively banned Huawei from the United States.A company spokesman said: "Huawei has made substantial contributions to the development and growth of Android around the world".Astros fall to Red Sox, 4-1After Roberto Osuna (3-0) loaded the bases, Christian Vazquez hit a two-run single for Boston to tie it at three. The Red Sox were as opportunistic as Rodriguez was resilient. "It's where we're at", said manager Alex Cora .With $105 billion in global sales previous year, Huawei is the world's largest provider of equipment used in 5G telecom networks, and the second largest seller of smartphones. To make matters worse, EE and Vodafone have pulled Huawei's phones from their 5G launch line-up and won't be selling next-gen Huawei handsets until they can guarantee full support.Such an egocentric approach by the United States will not win the recognition and support of the worldwide community, said Wang.US-China trade relations have escalated in recent weeks and Huawei has become the epicentre of the struggle.The financial institution further pointed out that the impact on the global supply chain would be contingent on "the length and severity of restrictions imposed on Huawei". If the Huawei ban ends up being lifted at some point (which would probably be part of a larger trade deal with China), perhaps the devices will return."U.S. companies are now required to obtain licenses to transfer technology to Huawei, effectively restricting them from selling new components, chips or software to the Chinese company and its 70 affiliates without prior USA government approval", UBS explained to its clients.The firm's founder Ren Zhengfei has downplayed the impact of United States curbs on Huawei, but early signs suggest the fallout could be significant.Load-Date: May 28, 2019End of Document

In London, Pompeo Downplays Strains On US-UK RelationshipThe FrontrunnerMay 9, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 Bulletin News Network, Inc.Section: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 404 wordsBodyThe AP (5/8, Lee) reports that in London on Wednesday, Secretary of State Pompeo "urged Britain and America...not to waver in their friendship as the two nations confront a series of global and trans-Atlantic challenges that have exposed some cracks in their historically close ties." Pompeo is quoted as saying, "It is now exactly the opposite of the time for either of us to go wobbly. ... Let's stand together to address the challenges of our time." The AP says Pompeo spoke today with British Prime Minister Theresa May and Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, and afterwards "downplayed [their] differences, saying that while they disagreed on the nuclear deal, all four countries agreed on the need to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons."Reuters (5/8) reports that Pompeo also said, "President Trump is very much looking forward to his visit here next month. ... It was evident in my conversations both with Jeremy and with Prime Minister May that the special relationship does not simply endure, it is thriving."Pompeo To UK On China: No Time To Go "Wobbly."Reuters (5/8, Faulconbridge, Maclellan, Macaskill) reports Secretary of State Pompeo "told Britain on Wednesday it needed to change its attitude towards China and telecoms company Huawei, casting the world's second largest economy as a threat to the West similar to that once posed by the Soviet Union." According to Reuters, "Pompeo questioned the attitude of Prime Minister Theresa May's government towards Beijing and goaded London by saying that the late former British leader Margaret Thatcher...would have taken a much firmer line with China." Said Pompeo, "Now is not the time for either of us to go wobbly," paraphrasing what Thatcher once famously told late President George H.W. Bush. Pompeo added, "Ask yourself: would the Iron Lady be silent when China violates the sovereignty of nations through corruption or coercion? Would she allow China to control the internet of the future?"Fox News' Special Report (5/8, 1.96M) showed Pompeo saying, "As a matter of Chinese law, the Chinese government can rightfully demand access to data flowing through Huawei and ZTE systems. Why would anyone grant such power to a regime that has already grossly violated cyberspace?" To Bloomberg (5/8, 4.73M), "Pompeo fired a broadside of criticism at the UK's approach to national security" that "risked a diplomatic argument with one of the US's closest allies."Load-Date: May 10, 2019End of Document

TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS, GLOBAL PARTNERSHIPS KEY TO ELIMINATING POVERTY AND HUNGERStates News ServiceMay 15, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 818 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: ROME, Italy BodyThe following information was released by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD):UN food agencies and Chinese institutions highlight role in achieving the SDGsRome, 15 May 2018 - The important role of technological innovations and global partnerships in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) including accelerating poverty reduction and eradicating hunger came under the spotlight today at the International Cooperation Expo (EXCO 2019).The 3rd annual International Seminar on Global Poverty Reduction Partnerships was organized by three Rome-based UN agencies the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), and World Food Programme (WFP) - together with the International Poverty Reduction Center in China (IPRCC) and the China Internet Information Centre (CIIC).Discussions at this year's seminar focused how to better use technological innovations in rural areas to promote inclusive development, food security, nutrition, sustainable agriculture, gender equality and reduce rural poverty. Partnerships, with a special focus on South-South and Triangular cooperation, were highlighted as key to promoting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.Speaking about how WFP is effectively using technology and innovation to reach the people its serves, WFP's Deputy Executive Director Amir Abdulla said: "We are using biometrics, blockchain, digital cash, drones and satellite imagery to reduce poverty, among other tools to promote food security and sustainable development in rural areas". He called for further efforts to invest in infrastructure and human capital so that developing countries can use technology to connect farmers to markets, produce data and analytics for decision making and tackle climate change.Xia Gengsheng, Vice Minister of the State Council Leading Group Office of Poverty Reduction and Development, spoke about China's efforts in combating poverty. China has lifted over 82 million rural poor out of poverty, with the rural poor population down from 99 million in 2012 to 16.6 million in 2018. The poverty rate has significantly decreased from 10.2 percent to 1.7 percent.Xia Gengsheng said, "We need to continue to push forward, fight against poverty with perseverance, consolidate current achievements and reduce poverty for more people". The Chinese government is working on its post-2020 strategy for poverty reduction.Ashwani K. Muthoo, Director of the Global Engagement and Multilateral Relations Division at IFAD, added: "Innovative technologies and ICTs in particular are a very effective vehicle to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, in particular SDG 1 and 2. This event is a clear demonstration of the importance of developing and strengthening knowledge partnerships including between the RBAs and China to reduce poverty and eradicate hunger".During his closing remarks, Shengyao Tang, Director of FAO's Office of South-South and Triangular Cooperation said: "This seminar has highlighted the importance of disseminating successful experiences on the use of technological innovations for rural development. These innovations are useful for all development actors." He also noted that the seminar serves as a platform for raising awareness on the key role that global partnerships play in sustainable development, which is at the core of South-South and Triangular Cooperation. The engagement of new actors, such as development banks and the private sector, is key for sharing knowledge about technological innovations that contribute to achieve the 2030 Agenda, he added.The seminar was attended by participants from governments, international organizations, private sector, civil society and academia.PR/21/2019The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is a specialized agency of the United Nations that leads international efforts to defeat hunger. Our goal is to achieve food security for all and make sure that people have regular access to enough high-quality food to lead active, healthy lives.

They may not use it today and may not use it tomorrow, "he added.  The Chinese government guarantees Huawei and ZTE two thirds of the domestic 5G network contracts. Foreign companies have to compete with other Chinese firms for the remaining third. Samm Sacks, a senior member of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, identified three additional regulations. These barriers for US telecommunications companies operating in China are: "cybersecurity reviews, restrictions on the transfer of data across borders and a general trend towards location under the guise of security".  In addition, he noted that US information technology and telecommunications firms face several security reviews that "can be used for political purposes to delay or block access to the market."  These reviews are not transparent and cover critical information systems, cybersecurity and the risks of the network's supply chain.

Global stocks sink after Beijing says it won't back down in trade war with USCNN WireJune 3, 2019 Monday 8:50 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 464 wordsByline: By Sherisse Pham, CNN BusinessDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  Global stock markets slumped Monday, as investors reacted to the prospect of a drawn-out trade war. China on Sunday said it will "not back down" in a trade fight with the United States, two days after signaling it could blacklist foreign companies from its huge market."The series of actions over the weekend means that China's 'long march' has begun," Iris Pang, an economist with ING said in a research note Monday. "It means that the trade war has not only become a technology war but also a broad-based business war. There will be more retaliation actions from China, especially for the technology sector," she added.Tokyo's Nikkei recovered slightly from a rough opening to close down 0.9% on Monday. The Shanghai Composite declined 0.3%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng shed 0.1%. In Europe, benchmark indexes in London and Paris were down 1% in early trading. Frankfurt's DAX declined 0.6%.The Chinese government released a document on Sunday that blamed the United States for the breakdown in trade talks. Wang Shouwen, a vice minister of commerce and deputy trade negotiator, said the United States can't force a trade deal on China and that the country "will not back down." Beijing also said on Sunday that it is investigating FedEx after embattled Chinese tech firm Huawei said the delivery company diverted to the United States two packages intended for the company's offices in China. The move on FedEx comes after China announced Friday that is building an "unreliable entity list," effectively preparing to blacklist foreign companies as trade tensions with the United States continue to escalate. South Korea's KOSPI bucked the trend on Monday, rising more than 1% as foreign investors snapped up shares in tech company Samsung Electronics and chip maker SK Hynix. Samsung and SK Hynix could benefit from increased sales to Chinese firms barred from doing business with US companies, according to a recent research note from Rex Wu, an analyst with brokerage Jefferies.President Donald Trump announced Friday that he will remove India from a special trade program on Wednesday. Meanwhile, investors are still trying to determine how new tariffs on Mexico might affect American businesses and the economy."Recent events have shown that markets cannot really ever dismiss (trade) uncertainties and that investors may need to accept that the United States is comfortable fighting a trade war on many fronts," said Hannah Anderson, a market strategist with JP Morgan. Dow futures were down 160 points, or 0.6%, signaling a rough start to June for Wall Street. S&P 500 futures dropped 0.6% and Nasdaq futures fell about 0.8%.David Goldman contributed to this story. TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

According to Reuters, "Protests around the city's legislature on Wednesday forced the postponement of debate on the extradition bill, which many people in Hong Kong fear will undermine freedoms and confidence in the commercial hub." Reuters says Carrie Lam, "Hong Kong's China-backed Chief Executive...condemned the violence and urged a swift restoration of order but has vowed to press ahead with the legislation despite the reservations about it, including within the business community."The AP (6/13, Bodeen) says it is "unclear how Lam, as chief executive, might defuse the crisis, given Beijing's strong support for the extradition bill and its distaste for dissent." According to the AP, the Chinese government "has condemned the protests but so far has not indicated whether it is planning harsher measures." The AP adds that "in past cases of unrest, the authorities have waited months or years before rounding up protest leaders."The Washington Post (6/13, Mahtani, 14.2M) reports that the Hong Kong's legislature today "canceled debate for the rest of the week on [the] flash-point bill...leaving protesters emboldened and planning another major show of resistance against Beijing's efforts to reshape the rules governing the former British colony." According to the Post, "The delay in the extradition bill was hailed as a symbolic victory among the demonstrators that have poured into Hong Kong's streets this week."The New York Times (6/12, Times, 18.61M) reports, that the Civil Human Rights Front, "which organized a protest against the bill that drew as many as one million people last weekend, called on residents to take to the streets again this coming Sunday. The group also called for schools, shops and workers to go on strike on Monday."Chinese Blamed For Attack That Disrupted Messaging App Used By Protesters.The New York Times (6/13, Mozur, Stevenson, 18.61M) reports that "a network of computers in China bombarded Telegram, a secure messaging app used by many of the protesters, with a huge volume of traffic that disrupted service. The app's founder, Pavel Durov, said the attack coincided with the Hong Kong protests, a phenomenon that Telegram had seen before."WSJournal: Trump Has A Duty To Speak Up On Hong Kong.In an editorial, the Wall Street Journal (6/13, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) praises the demonstrators in Hong Kong, calling on President Trump to speak up in their defense. The Journal says Trump has a duty as an American president to push back against China's efforts to stifle democratic self-government.Load-Date: June 14, 2019End of Document| About LexisNexis | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions | Copyright © 2021 LexisNexis Page 25 of 326SPANBERGER: UNITED STATES AND NATO PARTNERS MUST STRENGTHEN CYBER DEFENSES AMID 5G THREATS FROM CHINA  Page 27 of 326The Latest: Huawei: US actions should worry other firms too  Page 29 of 326The Latest: Huawei: US actions should worry other firms too  Page 31 of 326Stocks Drop as Chipmakers Comply With Trump Administration's Blacklisting of China's Huawei  Page 33 of 326CHINA CUSTOMS MAKES ITS BIGGEST TUSK BUST  Page 35 of 326San Francisco made the right call by banning facial recognition technology - for now  Page 37 of 326CRU: Whose Tungsten Projects will Satisfy Growing Demand  Page 39 of 326Huawei says US sanctions will cost it billions in revenue  Page 41 of 326Huawei says US sanctions will cost it billions in revenue  Page 43 of 326Chairman Blunt Issues Statement at Hearing on FY 2020 Budget Request For NIH  Page 47 of 326ON WORLD ENVIRONMENT DAY, WORLD TURNS SPOTLIGHT ON AIR POLLUTION  Page 49 of 326Huawei is a matter of national security for the United States  Page 52 of 326Trump Declares US National Emergency To Protect Communications Network  Page 68 of 326Veteran Uses Combat Experience as Small Business Inspiration; Judge Rejects House of Representatives Lawsuit Over Wall Funding; Facebook Shareholders Vote to Re....  Page 70 of 326Reports Huawei to supply UK networks draw criticism  Page 72 of 326Reports Huawei to supply UK networks draw criticism  Page 92 of 326Global Steel Wire Industry  Page 94 of 326Two charged with stealing aviation secrets from GE  Page 100 of 326Focus On Latest Trade News May Lead To Higher Open On Wall Street  Page  of WuXi NextCODE Clarifications to Public Letter Sent to Department of Health and Human Services Acting Inspector General Joanne M.
