Denise Ho, diva of Hong Kong cantopop and revoltCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 23, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 720 wordsBodyLate last month, several thousand people gathered in the Yuen Long neighborhood to hunt pokémon. The Hong Kong authorities had banned the convening of a popular march to protest against the aggressions perpetrated by local mafia members the previous week, so demonstrators had to come up with excuses to gather there. Many of them went to take a photo with Denise Ho, a famous singer who conveniently announced that she would sign autographs there.His appearance was no coincidence. Denise Ho, 42, is one of the few local celebrities who not only support, but also participate in anti-government protests that have been shaking the city for three months. Through his Twitter profile, in which he has 232,000 followers, he often shares photos and videos recorded from within the mobilizations. Ho is an actress and singer of cantopop ( a musical genre played in Cantonese, the most popular language in the region) and is very involved in social issues, in which she participates as an activist. Its political involvement has made it a symbol of Hong Kong, which struggles to maintain its system of rights and freedoms.When Denise Ho was born in 1977, Hong Kong was still a British colony and would remain a British colony for two more decades. But she didn't see him firsthand until much later. As a child she moved with her parents, both teachers, to Canada, where she grew up and studied arts, communication and graphic design. In a 2016 interview with LaPresse+, he linked the defense of freedom of expression that characterizes it with the fact that he lived in Canada during the Quebec independence referendum in 1995. But he didn't stay on the other side of the Pacific much longer: at the end of his training he returned to Hong Kong, where fame awaited him.In 1996, at the age of 19, he signed up for a singing contest for new talent in his hometown. She won "by accident," as she often say herself. This allowed her to meet Anita Mu, diva of cantopop and one of her childhood idols, who became the godmother of the professional career who was about to take off. Denise Ho adopted the professional name HOCC and in 2001 recorded the first of her 12 studio albums, First, in which she put into practice the pop-rock sound that would make her famous.It was soon shown that Denise Ho was not a star to use. A year later he saw the light of his EP hocc2, which included the song Lousimalai, which created much controversy for its lesbian theme. This trend gained prominence in his musical work until in 2012, during the Celebration of Gay Pride Day in Hong Kong, he decided to come out of the closet with a public speech. "For many years I thought sexual orientation was a personal matter, but just when you expect more tolerance still finds a lot of discrimination, so silence is no longer an option," he said among the audience ovation. Denise Ho thus became the first Hong Kong celebrity to openly recognize her homosexuality and, since then, a social reference on LGTBI rights in the territory.Another of his workhorses has been the defense of Hong Kong's rights and freedoms. In 2014 he supported and participated in the Occupy Central protests, also known as the Umbrella Revolution. "The most beautiful and most disgusting thing about this city is happening right here," he said to HK Magazine. With the new wave of protests he redoubled his commitment to the cause. On 8 July this year he spoke at the United Nations Human Rights Council to denounce the situation in Hong Kong. These images went viral because ofthe reaction of a Chinese diplomat, who interrupted his speech up to twice.His political commitment makes him viewed with suspicion by China, where he is prohibited from acting, and other countries in the region. In June 2016, the French cosmetics brand Lancéme canceled the concert of the singer she sponsored because of pressure from the Chinese government against her, who was accused of supporting the independence of Hong Kong and Tibet after photos of her reunited n with the Dalai Lama. In February 2018, the Malaysian authorities refused to grant him a visa to visit the country because of his homosexuality, a condition that is still criminalized. None of these setbacks have broken his will. Back in 2014 I was going to settle: "This movement has made me understand where my priorities are."Load-Date: August 24, 2019End of Document

Net revs for NERLYNX increased to $53.8 mln from $50.8 mln in the prior year quarter; co's other $0.1 mln of revenue was royalty revenue received from co's sub-licensees. Total operating costs declined yr/yr to $79.7 mln from $92.2 mln. Co named several anticipated milestones for the remainder of 2019, including meeting with the FDA in connection with SUMMIT trial strategies, reporting additional data from the Phase 2 CONTROL trial, and receiving certain regulatory decisions for the extended adjuvant HER2-positive early stage breast cancer indication.TXMD (3.19 +20.83%): Continued strength following Tuesday evening's Q2 earnings report; the stock is up by circa +72% since the release.NVRO (72.83 +14.98%): Stretched to a 52-week high after reporting Q2 results, topping revenue expectations (fell 2.6% yr/yr to $93.6 mln) on an in-line bottom line loss while issuing upside FY19 revs guidance. Co's yr/yr decrease in US revenue (fell 2% to $78.1 mln) was associated with customer destocking associated with co's previously announced decision to alter its practice regarding certain high-volume product orders. Patient trial procedures increased +15% yr/yr while permanent implant procedures increased +10%.Small Cap LosersVRAY (3.25 -51.78%): Reported below consensus Q2 EPS and upside revs (+83.5% yr/yr to $30.17 mln). In the quarter, co received three new orders for MRIdian systems totaling $18.1 mln vs orders totaling $34.6 mln in the prior year period. Guided FY19 revs below consensus, lowering its outlook to $80-95 mln from $111-124 mln, a revision that co sees as "prudent given the timing of installations around year-end." Furthermore, co's CFO, Ajay Bansal, will resign, effective September 30; co is in the midst of a retained search to find his replacement. At two-year lows. WTRH (1.95 -48.14%): Missed consensus for Q2 EPS and revs (+216.7% yr/yr to $51.3 mln) and lowered its FY19 revs view below consensus, citing delays to the roll-out of planned revenue initiatives, additional time needed to integrate the Bite Squad merger, and current competitive dynamics. Also announced that current Chief Operations Officer Adam Price, who joined co in February 2019 as Chief Logistics Officer, will replace Chris Meaux as CEO, effective immediately; Meaux, who is also co's founder, will remain as Chairman of the Board. Co also noted that it recently commenced a review to evaluate potential strategic alternatives. Downgraded at Piper Jaffray; target cut to $8 from $18 at The Benchmark Company. At all-time lows. CNDT (5.42 -37.41%): Posted Q2 results; co missed on EPS while beating consensus for revs (fell 19.8% yr/yr to $1.11 bln). Excluding divestitures completed in 2018, revs were down 3.2% yr/yr. Total contract value signings of $813 mln declined 56.9% yr/yr due to a 5.2% decrease in new business signings and a 68.5% decrease in renewal signings; the yr/yr comparable for signings was impacted by a multi-year renewal of one of co's largest clients in the year ago quarter. Lowered its FY19 revs and adj. EBITDA margin guidance. At all-time lows.10:11OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:MSFT Aug 139 calls are seeing interest with 1870 contracts trading vs. open int of 7100, pushing implied vol up around 14 points to ~39%.

The S&P 500 (-0.7%) reclaimed its 50-day moving average during the last few minutes of yesterday's session but the benchmark index finds itself back below that level this morning.Equity futures stumbled after yesterday's cash close, responding to a Bloomberg report, which revealed that the Department of Commerce has yet to begin issuing licenses to U.S. companies that want to resume doing business with Huawei. The decision was reportedly made after the Chinese government ordered state-owned enterprises to stop purchasing agricultural goods from the U.S.Understandably, that revelation is having the biggest impact on chipmakers. The PHLX Semiconductor Index is down 2.0%, returning into negative territory for the week (-1.8% week-to-date). The broader technology sector (-0.9%) trades at the bottom of the leaderboard, while eight out of the remaining ten sectors also trade in the red.The Russell 2000 is down 0.8%; the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.8%; the S&P 500 is down 0.7%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.5%.09:40WRAPX Opening Market Summary: Wall Street opens slightly lower, little changed for the weekThe major averages begin the day slightly lower following a big two-day comeback. The S&P 500 is down 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.3%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows the trade-sensitive materials (-0.6%), industrials (-0.6%), and information technology (-0.5%) sectors underperforming. Conversely, the utilities (+0.4%), health care (+0.2%), and real estate (+0.2%) sectors outperform.U.S. Treasuries are little changed. The 2-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.60%, and the 10-yr yield is unchanged at 1.71%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% to 97.55. WTI crude has jumped another 3.7%, or $1.90, to $54.46/bbl.09:36QSR Restaurant Brands Int'l announces upsize and pricing of secondary offering of common shares (73.73 -2.84)An underwritten registered public offering of 24.0 mln common shares commenced by HL1 17 LP, an affiliate of 3G Capital Partners, an increase of 4.0 mln common shares over the amount previously announced, has priced. These common shares relate to the exchange notices received by Restaurant Brands International Limited Partnership from HL1 17 LP to exchange an aggregate of 24.0 mln Class B exchangeable limited partnership units of RBI LP. RBI LP intends to satisfy this notice with the delivery of an equal number of common shares. In connection with the offering, HL1 17 LP entered into a forward sale agreement with Morgan Stanley (the "forward counterparty") with respect to 24.0 mln common shares. The forward counterparty or its affiliates are expected to borrow and sell to the underwriter an aggregate of 24.0 mln common shares that will be delivered in this offering. HL1 17 LP is expected to physically settle the forward sale agreement by delivering to the forward counterparty the common shares received upon the exchange. Upon settlement of the forward sale agreement, HL1 17 LP will receive, in cash, the public offering price of the 24.0 mln common shares.09:29WIRES On The WiresEagle Bancorp (EGBN) announced today that its Board of Directors adopted its first share repurchase program. Under the repurchase program, the company may repurchase up to 1,715,547 shares of its common stock, or approximately 5% of its outstanding shares of common stock at June 30; the repurchase program will expire on December 31, 2019.Alliance Resources (ARLP) will cease coal production effective August 16 at the Dotiki Mine operated by its subsidiary, Webster County Coal, LLC, in order to focus on maximizing production at its lower-cost mines in the Illinois Basin. After production ceases, the operation will engage in reclamation of equipment and infrastructure for an indeterminate time. ARLP does not expect this action to have any impact on its previously announced earnings guidance provided on July 26, including 2019 full-year ranges for coal production.09:20OCFC OceanFirst Finl announces merger agreements with Two River Bancorp (TRCB) and Country Bank Holding Company (23.14 )OceanFirst Financial, parent company of OceanFirst Bank N.A., announced today the concurrent signing of two separate definitive merger agreements. Under one agreement, Two River Bancorp, parent company of Two River Community Bank, will merge into OceanFirst. Upon completion of the Two River merger, Two River Community Bank will merge into OceanFirst Bank. Shareholders of Two River will be entitled to receive 0.6663 shares of OceanFirst common stock and $5.375 in cash for each outstanding share of Two River common stock. Based on OceanFirst's closing stock price on August 8 of $23.14, the Two River transaction is valued at approx. $20.79 per Two River common share, or approx. $182.8 mln in the aggregate. Under the other agreement, Country Bank Holding Company, parent company of Country Bank, will merge into OceanFirst. Upon completion of the CYHC merger, Country Bank will merge into OceanFirst Bank. Shareholders of CYHC will be entitled to receive 2,000 shares of OceanFirst common stock for each outstanding share of CYHC common stock. Based on OceanFirst's closing stock price on August 8 of $23.14, the CYHC transaction is valued at approx. $46,280.00 per CYHC common share, or approx. $102.2 mln in the aggregate. The combined company is expected to have pro forma approx. $9.9 bln in assets, $7.5 bln in loans and $7.7 bln in deposits. The two transactions combined are expected to result in approx. 8% EPS accretion in 2021 and approx. 5% tangible book value per share dilution at closing, with a projected earnback period of less than four years using the cross-over method.09:15WRAPX S&P futures vs fair value: -9.40. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -40.00.The S&P 500 is up 0.2% for the week, but is on track to lose those slim gains at the open with the S&P 500 futures currently trading ten points, or 0.3%, below fair value.The decline in the futures could be a breather considering that the S&P 500 climbed 112 points, or 4.0%, over a two-day span. Of course, that advance followed a sharp sell-off that had many market participants blaming trade tensions, which are not helpful for economic growth prospects. In either case, the decline is modest and futures do not necessarily predict intraday action.Uber (UBER 40.12, -2.85, -6.7%) shares rose over 8% yesterday heading into its earnings report, which included a $5.2 billion quarterly loss. This was much wider than expected (revenue came up short of estimates, too), and shares initially dropped over 12% in pre-market action following the results. Currently, shares are down 6.7%09:12FTCH Farfetch drops as much as 45% on Q2 results as large acquisition, tempered outlook, and decision to limit promotional activity spooks investors; shares poised to open at all-time low (18.25 )Farfetch last night reported Q2 Adj-EPS of ($0.15), $0.02 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($0.17); revenues rose 42.7% year/year to $209.3 mln vs the $196.51 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Gross Merchandise Value increased by $149.9 mln from $338.5 mln in second quarter 2018 to $488.5 mln in second quarter 2019, representing year-over-year growth of 44.3%. Platform GMV increased by $148.9 mln from $335.4 mln in second quarter 2018 to $484.3 mln in second quarter 2019, representing year-over-year growth of 44.4%.Alongside the earnings, the company announced the acquisition New Guards Group, a brand platform for luxury brands' design, production and distribution, for a Total Enterprise Value of $675 mln. The company expects that New Guards will add approximately $150-$160 mln in revenues and GMV and approximately $30-$35 mln in operating profits in 2H19.Additionally, the company disclosed that Chief Operating Officer Andrew Robb would be stepping down after serving in the position for nine years.

On the call, the company said that it believes the highly promotional stance taken across the industry is set to stay across the next two-four quarters. In assessing the short term outlook and setting growth targets for Q3 and Q4, the co has decided to focus on delivering solid but not overly aggressive market share gains, remaining competitive but stepping back from excessive use of promotions, stabilizing order contribution metrics, tailoring our customer engagement strategy, focusing on the LTV over CAC of cohorts and creating enough bandwidth internally to integrate their newer businesses and to focus on executing on their long-term sustainable GMV growth targets.Analyst Reactions:Downgraded to Hold from Buy at China Renaissance (PT to $18 from $32)PT separately lowered at Cowen, Credit Suisse, UBS.09:05SUMRX Economic summary: July PPI in line with expectationsEconomic Data Summary:July PPI 0.2% vs Briefing.com consensus of 0.2%; June was 0.1% July Core PPI -0.1% vs Briefing.com consensus of 0.2%; June was 0.3%The key takeaway from the report is that inflationary pressure remains muted.Upcoming Economic Data:July Treasury Budget due out Monday at 14:00 (Briefing.com consensus of ; June was -$76.9 bln)Other International Events of InterestChina's July PPI decreased 0.3% yr/yr (expected 0.0%; last 0.0%).

Importantly, in the subset of patients (n = 370) with off drug follow-up laboratory records, defined as 7 days after last dose, eGFR returned to baseline for study participants randomized to Zynquista, but not to placebo, with a placebo-corrected LS mean change from baseline to off drug records of +3.0 mL/min/1.73 m2 (p = 0.031) and +2.7 mL/min/1.73 m2 (p = 0.045) for Zynquista 200 mg and 400 mg, respectively.17:32UBER Correction -- Uber misses by $1.53, misses on revs (42.97 +3.27)Reports Q2 (Jun) GAAP loss of $4.72 per share, $1.53 worse than the S&P Capital IQ GAAP Consensus of ($3.19); revenues rose 14.4% year/year to $3.17 bln vs the $3.39 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Gross bookings were +31% yr/yr to $15.76 bln -- Foreign currency negatively impacted reported gross bookings growth by 6% in Q2 2019.Adj-EBITDA was ($656 mln) vs. ($292 mln) a year ago, and ($869 mln) in Q1.Monthly active platform consumers totaled 99 mln vs. 93 mln in Q1."Our platform strategy continues to deliver strong results, with Trips up 35% and Gross Bookings up 37% in constant currency, compared to the second quarter of last year," said Dara Khosrowshahi, CEO.

Before this communication, the FDA had been silent as to whether it would convene an AdCom in connection with its review of the REDUCE-IT sNDA. The FDA expressed, based on the timing of its recent decision to convene an AdCom, that November 14th is the earliest date on which it could hold an AdCom due to scheduling constraints for such a meeting.Accordingly, Amarin does not expect the FDA to take action on the sNDA by the previously announced September 28, 2019 Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date. Amarin did not receive notice from the FDA of a PDUFA date extension. In light of the tentative AdCom date, Amarin anticipates that the PDUFA date will be extended, assuming a typical three-month extension, to a date in late December 2019. If so, this anticipated revised PDUFA date timing would offset three of the four months that were expected to be gained from FDA's earlier determination to conduct a priority review of the REDUCE-IT sNDA. Prior to such determination, Amarin had expected a PDUFA goal date in January 2020, based on a standard 10-month review. Amarin plans to update the investment community after appropriately definitive information is available related to a new PDUFA date.Amarin intends to continue to move forward with its plans to double the size of its sales force to support the launch of Vascepa. Amarin plans to use the anticipated three-month delay in the PDUFA clock to better prepare for the assumed launch of Vascepa including more time to hire and train new sales representatives. To the extent that new sales managers and representatives are hired prior to the expanded label for Vascepa, Amarin intends to have them join the company's existing sales team in promoting Vascepa based on its current indication and existing promotional messaging.16:30EB Eventbrite appoints Lanny Baker as CFO, effective September 3 (17.49 +0.73)Mr. Baker joins Eventbrite from Yelp (YELP) where as CFO he oversaw corporate finance, accounting, investor relations and workplace functions.

The Company also plans to downsize, vacate or close certain facilities and data centers in connection with the restructuring plan. The Company estimates that it will incur total costs in connection with the restructuring of approximately $100 mln, with approximately $75 mln for severance and termination benefits and $25 mln for site closures. These actions are expected to be completed in fiscal 2020. Co also announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Enterprise Security assets, which include the Symantec name, to Broadcom (AVGO) for $10.7 bln in cash. The transaction, which was approved by Symantec's Board of Directors, is expected to close before the end of the calendar year pending regulatory approvals. Sale of Enterprise Security assets delivers $10.7 bln before tax. The Company expects to issue a special dividend of $12.00 per share for shareholders. The Board of Directors approved an increase of $1.1 bln to our remaining share repurchase authorization, while maintaining our current debt levels; the total authorization is now $1.6 bln.This sale leaves behind underutilized assets that were not part of the transaction, including owned properties that will be monetized to cover a large portion of the estimated $1 bln cash cost to shed the estimated $1.5 bln in stranded costs. Co said "Upon closing of the transaction, Symantec expects to receive $10.7 bln, which is estimated to yield approximately $8.2 bln of after tax proceeds. Symantec expects to return approximately 100% of its after-tax cash proceeds in the form of a $12.00 per share special dividend to shareholders after the close of the transaction. We expect to pay the special dividend in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 and will update the expected dividend timing on our next quarterly earnings call. In addition, we expect to increase our regular dividend by 67% to $0.125 per share in the quarter following the close. The Board of Directors has approved an increase to our existing share repurchase authorization up to $1.6 bln. After the transition, we believe our Norton LifeLock business can generate $1.50 annual non-GAAP earnings per share and achieve mid-single digit revenue growth year over year."16:23ELY Callaway Golf beats by $0.11, beats on revs; guides Q3 EPS below consensus, revs in-line; guides FY19 EPS in-line, revs in-line (17.54 +0.52)Reports Q2 (Jun) earnings of $0.37 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.11 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.26; revenues rose 12.7% year/year to $446.71 mln vs the $430.12 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

The S&P 500 advanced 1.9%, which extended its two-day comeback to 112 points, or 4.0%, from its session low on Wednesday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 1.4%, the Nasdaq Composite increased 2.2%, and the Russell 2000 increased 2.1%.Thursday's positive disposition ostensibly formed overnight after China reported a surprise yr/yr increase in July exports while holding its yuan firm, which again signaled goodwill in trade relations. Today's rally, however, appeared to be more a continuation from yesterday's big intraday reversal that suggested the recent sharp sell-off may have been excessive.Interestingly, the S&P 500 traded just below its 50-day moving average (2934) for most of the afternoon before finally breaking above the key technical level late in the session. The benchmark index held above the level on a closing basis.All 11 S&P 500 sectors finished higher by at least 1.0%. The energy sector (+2.9%) led the advance as oil prices ($52.52/bbl, +$1.38, +2.7%) rebounded, followed by the information technology (+2.4%), communication services (+2.2%), and consumer discretionary (+2.0%) sectors.Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 33.92, +4.73, +16.2%) led the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (+2.7%) higher after it unveiled its well-received server CPUs that Google and Twitter will reportedly use. Broadcom (AVGO 270.98, +0.93, +0.3%) struggled to participate in the chip rally amid news that it is close to purchasing Symantec's (SYMC 22.92, +2.51, +12.3%) enterprise business for about $10 billion.In earnings news, Booking Holdings (BKNG 1941.01, +119.45, +6.6%), Lyft (LYFT 62.10, +1.81, +3.0%), and Roku (ROKU 122.03, +21.06, +20.9%) outperformed the broader market following positive results and/or upbeat guidance.

Buyers gradually came back, ultimately leaving the benchmark yield up three basis points to 1.72%. The 2-yr yield finished also finished three basis points higher at 1.61%.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -40.00.The S&P 500 is up 0.2% for the week, but is on track to lose those slim gains at the open with the S&P 500 futures currently trading ten points, or 0.3%, below fair value.The decline in the futures could be a breather considering that the S&P 500 climbed 112 points, or 4.0%, over a two-day span.

Before this communication, the FDA had been silent as to whether it would convene an AdCom in connection with its review of the REDUCE-IT sNDA. The FDA expressed, based on the timing of its recent decision to convene an AdCom, that November 14th is the earliest date on which it could hold an AdCom due to scheduling constraints for such a meeting.Accordingly, Amarin does not expect the FDA to take action on the sNDA by the previously announced September 28, 2019 Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date. Amarin did not receive notice from the FDA of a PDUFA date extension. In light of the tentative AdCom date, Amarin anticipates that the PDUFA date will be extended, assuming a typical three-month extension, to a date in late December 2019. If so, this anticipated revised PDUFA date timing would offset three of the four months that were expected to be gained from FDA's earlier determination to conduct a priority review of the REDUCE-IT sNDA. Prior to such determination, Amarin had expected a PDUFA goal date in January 2020, based on a standard 10-month review. Amarin plans to update the investment community after appropriately definitive information is available related to a new PDUFA date.Amarin intends to continue to move forward with its plans to double the size of its sales force to support the launch of Vascepa.

Today's rally, however, appeared to be more a continuation from yesterday's big intraday reversal that suggested the recent sharp sell-off may have been excessive.Interestingly, the S&P 500 traded just below its 50-day moving average (2934) for most of the afternoon before finally breaking above the key technical level late in the session. The benchmark index held above the level on a closing basis.All 11 S&P 500 sectors finished higher by at least 1.0%.

YouTube shuts down 210 channels posting about Hong KongCNN.comAugust 22, 2019 Thursday 5:36 AM ESTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: TECHLength: 365 wordsByline: By Donie O'Sullivan and Kevin Collier, CNNDateline: New York BodyGoogle announced Thursday that it had disabled 210 YouTube channels that were uploading videos "in a coordinated manner" about the ongoing protests in Hong Kong.The announcement came three days after Twitter and Facebook announced they had shut down a network of hundreds of accounts that were posting content aimed at undermining pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. Some of the accounts posed as news organizations and independent entities but in fact had links to the Chinese government, both companies said.Google said in a blog post Thursday that the discovery of the 210 YouTube channels "was consistent with recent observations and actions related to China announced by Facebook and Twitter.""We found use of VPNs and other methods to disguise the origin of these accounts and other activity commonly associated with coordinated influence operations," Shane Huntley from Google's security team wrote.Google, which owns YouTube, provided no details on how popular the YouTube channels were or how many videos had been posted to the channels.China's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, said he was "not aware" of specifics when asked about the YouTube channels."The biggest appeal of the 1.4 billion Chinese people, including the Hong Kong compatriots, is to stop violence, end chaos and restore order," he said. "It's impossible to organize or manipulate the will of 1.4 billion people, and it's impossible to block it as well."On Monday, Twitter announced it had identified and removed a network of more than 900 accounts originating in China that "were deliberately and specifically attempting to sow political discord in Hong Kong, including undermining the legitimacy and political positions of the protest movement." Twitter shared their findings with Facebook and they also removed a smaller network of accounts. Some accounts called protesters "cockroaches" or compared them to Islamic State terrorists.Hong Kong is facing a major political crisis amid weeks of mass demonstrations. Protesters are demanding greater democracy and an inquiry into alleged police brutality during past demonstrations. And as unrest intensifies, Beijing's tone is becoming increasingly heated.Load-Date: August 24, 2019End of Document

Other factors that influence the market include rising electricity prices and energy efficiency regulations. AC drives have the potential to reduce energy consumption, and offer greater return on investment and efficiency. These factors provide many opportunities for the up-gradation and retrofitting market. Moreover, saving a considerable amount of energy is expected to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.Growing Requirement for Energy Savings and Efficiency   Driving the MarketThe demand for power has been on the rise, due to the burgeoning population and industrialization. Growing energy consumption exerts a huge strain on natural resources and increases the cost of producing electricity. Utilities and governments across the world encourage industries and households to reduce energy consumption, by adopting energy-saving techniques. AC drives offer the ideal solution to energy savings, by increasing the efficiency of the machines using AC power.AC drives ensure 25%-70% energy savings for motor operation. Motors consume the most energy in any industry, and the AC drive lets the motor to run at the optimal speed and controls the motor speed.An AC drive eliminates the need for expensive and bulky mechanical drive-control components, such as gearboxes, along with offering energy savings. AC drives enable the reduction of the starting current that is required by a motor. Motors connected via an AC drive, facilitate an increase in speed at a controlled rate and reduce damage to the motor (that can happen if it began across the line). An AC drive can also stop motors at a controlled rate. The reduction of starting current also leads to lower disturbances in the power supply, as it eliminates the voltage sag that occurs as a result of motor-start. This, in turn, protects other connected devices from voltage fluctuations.Incorporating AC drives for motors, offers energy savings and reduces wear and tear on the mechanical components of the motors, in turn, reducing the frequency required for repairs and maintenance. This leads to higher benefits for operators, as plant downtime can be reduced drastically, along with savings on power bills. These factors encourage the industries to adopt AC drives, thus, boosting the AC drive market.Asia-Pacific will Continue to Lead the AC Drives Market during the Forecast PeriodThe growth in the Asia-Pacific region can be mostly attributed to the capital investments being made in the infrastructure, oil and gas, and power generation sectors, and also investments made in energy efficiency solutions. Huge investments in energy intensive sectors and manufacturing, while simultaneously focusing on energy conservation and renewable sources of energy to curtail costs, are likely to drive the long-term growth of the market.The leading countries contributing to the growth of AC drives in this region are China, Japan, India, and South Korea. With numerous suppliers targeting the marketplace, competition is intense among them. Suppliers, under pressure to differentiate their offerings and outperforming their competitors, are adopting various strategies, including establishing local manufacturing facilities, acquiring domestic companies, expanding the distributor network, and leveraging relationships with OEMs. Companies, like ABB Ltd, now have their local RandD centers focused on AC drive and two large-scale modern factories manufacturing and serving the demand, from Asia-Pacific, for AC drives.China among the Fastest-growing Markets for AC DrivesChina's rapid industrialization and strong GDP growth go hand-in-hand with increased capital expenditure by global and domestic manufacturers, resulting in the expansion of the country's manufacturing industry. This rapid development is accelerating the robust growth of the low-power AC drive market in China. The escalating industrial growth in China has increased the demand for electric power well beyond its production capacity, resulting in an acute shortage of power. This situation has forced the Chinese government to launch an energy conservation program, which recommends various energy saving measures. While the energy conservation requirement and cost savings are paramount factors contributing to the growth of the AC drive business, other key growth drivers include the concern for reliability, the growing machinery industry, and product-related issues, such as compactness, lower prices, user-friendly features, and new technologies.Share your query before purchasing this report @https://www.360researchreports.com/enquiry/pre-order-enquiry/13100891Key Highlights from AC Drives Market Report 2019.Revenue and Sales Estimation   Historical Revenue and sales volume is presented and further data is triangulated with top-down and bottom-up approaches to forecast complete market size and to estimate forecast numbers for key regions covered in the report along with classified and well recognized Types and end-use industry.

Of these, the manufacturing sector is expected to dominate and reach a valuation of USD 50 billion by the end of 2022. Mapping the Global Market:Geographically, the global factory automation market spans across North America, Asia Pacific, Europe, and Rest of the World (RoW).Considering the global scenario, Asia Pacific is considered to expand at the fastest rate and is predicted to exhibit a high growth rate. Government initiatives to increase domestic production and manufacturing and surging adoption of technology in the region is likely to augment the market growth in the region. Meanwhile, the high cost of installing automation solutions is one of the major concerns restricting the growth of the regional market. In the APAC, China is considered to hold a major share. Companies in China are highly embracing Industry 4.0 to improve productivity. Chinese government's programs like the Made in China 2025 plan are influencing the use of R&D in factory automation and technologies. As most of the automation equipment is imported from Japan and Germany, the -Made in China' initiative focuses on expanding the nation's domestic production of equipment and hardware.China is considered one of the fastest-growing countries in the world with a very high industrial production rate. This is likely to drive the automation market in the country. Investments are planned to address concerns related to the environment, aid the quality of growth, and reduce overcapacity. The number of companies deploying process and factory automation technologies and robotics is less compared to the huge size of China's manufacturing base and the number of workers the country employs. This trend is likely to present huge growth opportunities for companies in the industrial automation industry in the country. Get Complete Report @ https://www.marketresearchfuture.com/reports/factory-automation-market-3565 Head-to-HeadJuly 2019: Yamaha Motor Europe Factory Automation Section continues to extend its SCARA family.

"The next deeper than 5% drop by yearlong profits will sink equities and swell [bond] spreads," advised the credit-rating agency. In previous profit setbacks, "Financial markets reacted negatively to the profits recession. As measured by month-long averages, the market value of US common stock sank by 12.9% from a May 2015 high to a February 2016 bottom, [and] a composite high-yield bond spread ballooned from June 2014's current cycle bottom of 331 basis points to a now 10-year high of 839 basis points, while Moody's long-term "Baa" industrial company bond yield spread swelled from May 2014's current cycle low of 144 basis points to February 2016's now 10-year high of 277 basis points," said Moody's. In other words, when corporate profits sag, equities and bond prices sink, and spreads widen on riskier debt issues. "As of 2019's first quarter, the yearlong average of core profits set a new record high. However, the ability of core profits to avoid sinking under its current zenith has been challenged by the latest deceleration of business sales," said Moody's.More Asian-Pacific Trade Risks US-based multinationals who sell military weapons to Taiwan may find their full range of products effectively banned by mainland China, the South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported. "General Dynamics [GD], and its subsidiary Gulfstream Aerospace, as well as Honeywell [HON] and Oshkosh Corporation [OSK], were named in an article posted on the official WeChat channels of both the People's Daily and state broadcaster CCTV...criticizing their involvement in the sale of tanks and missiles to Taiwan," reported the Hong Kong-based newspaper. Last week, the US approved a $2.2 billion arms-sale to Taiwan, which includes Abrams tanks, Stinger missiles and heavy-equipment transporters. "China's government and Chinese companies will not cooperate or have commercial contacts with these US companies," a Beijing spokesman said, reported the SCMP.  Gulfsteam jets have been strong sellers in China, but may fall out of favor, warned the SCMP. Ebola SpreadThe renewed and fatal Ebola epidemic in the Congo will spread into Rwanda, Uganda and the Sudan, advised Oxford Analytics, a risk consultancy. "It is likely now a question of when, rather than if, the outbreak will cross into neighboring countries. The authorities in both Uganda and Rwanda have the resources and knowledge to contain an outbreak within their border regions. However, with populations increasingly mobile and urbanized, the risk of infection spreading into a major urban center is high. This would be much more difficult to contain," said the consultancy. VIX/Gold/BitcoinThe Cboe VIX, a metric of expected volatility in the US stock market for the next 30 days posted at 13.59, down 2.72% in pre-market action Friday. Readings below 20 indicate the market is projecting less volatility than average for the next four weeks. The financial headlines may be unsettling, but the market indicates it is settled in the near-term. Gold, the traditional refuge in times of financial turmoil, traded at $1,436 an ounce pre-market, near fresh six-year highs, but still below the $1,800 level the yellow-metal surpassed in 2011. Bitcoin, dubbed the "new gold" by some proponents, traded st $10,34 pre-bell, off recent highs, but much higher than the under $4,000-range of Q1. Load-Date: July 20, 2019End of Document

AUSTRALIAN UYGHUR GETS SURPRISE PHONE CHAT WITH INCARCERATED MOTHERStates News ServiceAugust 19, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1144 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:An Australian citizen of Uyghur ethnicity whose wife and mother are being detained in internment camps in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) had a surprise telephone chat with his mother this month when he called his grandparents to extend Eid holiday greetings.Almas Nizamidin's wife Bulzeynep Abdureshit (in Chinese, Buzainafu Abudourexiti) and mother Zulpiye Jalalidin (Zuyipiya Jiala), were taken into custody in the XUAR in 2017 and 2018, respectively.On August 12, Almas's father, Juret Nizamidin, posted a message on his Facebook page, saying: "My two sons have had a telephone conversation with my wife, who has been in a camp."The U.S.-based Juret said his wife, Zulpiye, had been released from the camp for three days for Eid, the Muslim holiday and had spoken to her sons, Almas and Izmurat, on Eid day."On Eid day, I called my grandparents to give them my Eid greetings, and unexpectedly my mother answered the phone," Almas told RFA's Uyghur Service."I was very surprised, at the same time I became very excited. I didn't know what to say, because my mother had been taken inside (the camp) for over 20 months," he told RFA by telephone from Australia."Despite my campaigning in the West for her release, the Chinese government didn't take any notice and continued incarcerating her for the last 20 months. She was given three days to spend time at home for Eid," he said.Almas said he spoke euphemistically to his mother about the camps, using China's description that the facilities are schools, asking her: "So, are you going back to school again?"He quoted his mother as saying: "Yes, but there is only a short time left. It is a vocational training school, we are all studying hard, and we are all fine. Do not worry about me. I am doing well and in good health.""Darling don't make too many calls, concentrate on your study, and do well in everything," his mother said.'I saw some hope'Buzeynep Abdureshit was sentenced to 17 years in prison after returning from Egypt to the XUAR in 2017. Zulpiye Jalalidin was also arrested in January 2018, after having visited her son in the United States and returned in November 2017. Since their arrests, Almas and Juret have been campaigning for their release.Almas was informed by the Australian embassy in April that Abdureshit was sentenced to seven years imprisonment and two years deprivation of political rights on June 5, 2017 for the crime of "assembling a crowd to disturb social order," while Jalalidin was arrested on Nov. 6, 2018 on the same charges.Abdureshit's arrest came slightly more than a year after she and Nizamidin were married in the XUAR capital Urumqi, and Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) said it had been informed that a medical examination conducted before she was detained "showed that she was not pregnant."Abdureshit had been preparing documents to join her husband in Australia at the time of her arrest.Almas told RFA recently that he had heard "no news about my wife at all," but was encouraged to hear his mother's voice."I felt my heart almost jumped out of my chest. From her voice, my mother sounded like a warrior. I had never expected to hear my mother's voice in such a (positive) way," he told RFA."Upon hearing her voice I regained confidence and hope," added Almas."When I said, 'mother, you are a good mum and you don't need to study,' she replied, 'don't say that, my son. Knowledge is never ending, we must study, and you should also study hard.'""In that way she gave us comfort, I was happy to hear that," he said."I heard that most of the people in concentration camps are forced into hard labor, so I was very worried if my mother was also forced to participate in heavy labor work," said Almas."But hearing her voice, I felt reassured and comforted. Hearing my mother's voice made me feel I'd accomplished something after campaigning for her freedom for the last two years," he said."I will not stop my campaign until my mother and my wife safely arrive in Australia. After speaking to my mother, I saw some hope," added Almas.Egypt connectionAs part of his tireless campaign to find his wife, Almas Nizamidin provided the documents he obtained to London-based rights group Amnesty International.Amnesty issued a statement on Sept. 28, 2017 saying that Abdureshit's arrest and subsequent sentencing was believed to be "part of a wider crackdown on Uyghur students who studied abroad," noting she had spent two years in Egypt as a student before returning to the XUAR in 2015."Held incommunicado, she is at grave risk of torture and other ill-treatment," Amnesty said at the time.But he said they were likely targeted because Abdureshit attended university in Egypt, while he and his father, who resides in the U.S., live and work abroad.Beginning in April 2017, authorities have held up to 1.5 million Uyghurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities accused of harboring "strong religious views" and "politically incorrect" in a network of political re-education camps in the XUAR.Though Beijing initially denied the existence of re-education camps, China has shifted to trying to deflect international criticism by describing the facilities as "boarding schools" that provide vocational training for Uyghurs, discourage radicalization and help protect the country from terrorism.Reporting by RFA's Uyghur Service and other media organizations, however, has shown that those in the camps are detained against their will and subjected to political indoctrination, routinely face rough treatment at the hands of their overseers, and endure poor diets and unhygienic conditions in the often overcrowded facilities.Adrian Zenz, a lecturer in social research methods at the Germany-based European School of Culture and Theology, has said that some 1.5 million people are or have been detained in the campsequivalent to just under 1 in 6 members of the adult Muslim population of the XUARafter initially putting the number at 1.1 million.Michael Kozak, the head of the State Department's human rights and democracy bureau, in an apparent reference to the policies of Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Soviet Union, said in March that people "haven't seen things like this since the 1930s" and called the internment of more than a million Uyghurs "one of the most serious human rights violations in the world today."In November 2018, Scott Busby, the deputy assistant secretary in the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor at the U.S. Department of State, said there are "at least 800,000 and possibly up to a couple of million" Uyghurs and others detained at re-education camps in the XUAR without charges, citing U.S. intelligence assessments.Reported by Shohret Hoshur for RFA's Uyghur Service.

HISTORY OF THE GAMEStates News ServiceJuly 15, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 7437 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS):Andrew Schwartz: Welcome to the Asia Chessboard, the podcast that examines geopolitical dynamics in Asia, and takes an inside look at the making of grand strategy. I'm Andrew Schwartz at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.Ben Rimland: Mike sits down with Will Inboden, associate professor of public policy and director of the Clements Center at the University of Texas at Austin. Will is also a former senior NSC official for strategic planning. Mike and Will unpack popular misconceptions about the application of history to grand strategy and discuss the critical place of values in American foreign policy. They also preview Will's forthcoming book on the Reagan administration.Mike Green: So Will, I've learned more from you on the NSC staff when we worked together for George W. Bush and as a scholar since about how to use history and state craft and you're really making that a core theme of your career and training a new generation at UT Austin at the Clements Center, which we'll get to, but tell me how you got into this whole foreign policy business and interested in strategy.Will Inboden: It was a bit of a circuitous route. I mean, so growing up as a kid in Tucson, Arizona, I loved reading military history, histories of World War II, loved visiting the Pima Air Museum, the world's largest outdoor air museum to see the old World War II and Cold War aircraft there. Then when I was in college at Stanford, I was majoring in history and IR, but decided I had a calling to go into the ministry. And so I gave up my interest in politics and policy and instead wanted to go to seminary to be a pastor. And my junior year at Stanford, I arranged an internship with the chaplain of the Senate thinking if you can learn how to do ministry with politicians, you can learn how to do ministry with anybody. And a week before I was supposed to travel to Washington to do the internship, the Senate chaplain staff notified me that he had to take a medical leave of absence from the job. He was in poor health and shortly thereafter died actually. And so I had this one way ticket to DC and my internship totally fell through. So I talked to a couple of friends from DC and they helped line up and internship for me with then Senator Dan Coats who is on the Armed Services Committee. And that three month internship totally got me re-engaged again on foreign and defense policy. It then led to my first job after graduation, working for Senator Sam Nunn, of course, here with the CSIS Board, and then in turn a career in foreign policy. So it all goes back to maybe the hand of God intervening and moving me in a different direction back into policy.Mike Green: I'm discovering a Sam Nunn foreign policy peculiarity because John Hamre, who was his principal staffer on the Senate Armed Services Committee, also went to divinity school.Will Inboden: Yes, yes. I know John and I-Mike Green: And trained for the ministry.Will Inboden: Yeah.Mike Green: What'd you take away from that in terms of strategy?Will Inboden: This was in the mid '90s. It was towards the end of Senator Nunn's time in the Senate and was a fascinating time as a young person to be working on American foreign policy, of course we're dealing with the aftermath of the Cold War. He and Dick Lugar had teamed up on the Nunn-Lugar Coop Threat Program Reduction. We are working with the Clinton administration on some of the Balkans interventions trying to reinvigorate some parts of American human rights and democracy promotion, now that there's a new window. And for me it was a lot of fun. It was somewhat unprecedented. We now look back and see the unipolar moment, but it also has raised a lot of bigger questions. How does all this fit together? What does all this mean? Are we just making up policy on the fly here in this uncharted territory? Are there any historical continuities or discontinuities? And so that's what actually prompted me to go back to grad school and do my PhD at Yale, then studying the grand strategy program there.Mike Green: A lot of self-proclaimed grand strategists in the post-war era argue, and even in the pre-war era in the United States, argue, like one of my professors at Johns Hopkins, Bob Osgood, that grand strategy's about getting rid of all your idealism and focusing on your so-called self-interests as Osgood put it. And so when you went to Yale, when you started grand strategy, you wrote about Reinhold Niebuhr, right? And-Will Inboden: Yes. Yeah.Mike Green: So what's your answer to this question or this proposition that a lot of grand strategists put forward that to be like Metternich, to be like Castlereagh, to be a real grand strategist, you have to be realpolitik, you have to get rid of idealism, get rid of values and focus on pure power. I'm sure you don't agree with that, but what's your take on it? And how'd you fight against that?Will Inboden: I don't. I think that's a rather desiccated view of strategy and national power. I start on a principle of grand strategy as doing an inventory of what are all of your national resources and assets and one of America's great assets is our values, is our rather singular values and how those had been rather inspiring to so many in the rest of the world. And so particularly in the early Cold War when I was looking at Niebuhr's influence on Truman and on Eisenhower, so it's the interaction of some of the religious principles there, but also our early efforts to develop the Cold War grand strategy. You really saw for them there was not that sharp divide between interests and values, but rather America's values were a strong asset to help shape our interests and gave us some asymmetric advantages, especially when you saw the Iron Curtain going up in this new model of Soviet totalitarianism. We realized our values provide a pretty dramatic and inspiring contrast to that.Mike Green: Let's talk about that for a minute and we'll get into Asia and history and statecraft and other dimensions. But how important is the morality of our own foreign policy and our own society in our foreign policy? People are now looking back at George Kennan's Long Telegram and it ends with the warning that if we can't be a model of democratic values ourselves, we're not going to win the Cold War. And as we gear up for new strategic competition with China, Walter Russell Mead, John Hamre, others are looking back at Kennan. How important is it that we be perceived as a morally upright nation to be effective in strategy?Will Inboden: I think it's supremely important. And again some important caveats here, politics and grand strategy does involve the art of compromise, the art of prudence, the art of making difficult choices and so even if we may have some certain principles as our lodestars there can be different ways of advancing them, right? So that's where prudence comes in. But again, I think Kennan was exactly right that one of the keys to America's long-term success in the Cold War was staying true to who we are, even if the implementation varied at times. But this is where ... Kennan himself was deeply influenced by Niebuhr. I certainly am as well and one of Niebuhr's principles is order precedes justice. Okay. So being cognizant of power realities, being cognizant of the need to preserve basic order and stability, those are not amoral. There's a moral good in preserving order and stability, as long as you don't stop there because again, for Niebuhr order precedes justice and creates the conditions, the opportunities for justice to eventually be realized, at least in a proximate sense.Mike Green: You drafted much of the second national security strategy for President Bush. I had the privilege of working with you on it and reading the first draft. I remember that the president loved the content, but it sounded like Thomas Jefferson. So you had to use the exact same concepts, make it sound like George W. Bush. The president used to say to me, and I'm sure to you, the key is to be a realist in the short term, but an idealist in the long term and always try to bend the arc of history towards a more just international society, but there are tough calls in foreign policy. Like if you look at Asia right now, we have the weaker situation. We have the million people in the streets in Hong Kong. Where do you apply American power to advance those short-term challenges to human rights and democracy?Will Inboden: Yeah, I want to come to that, but first, because you mentioned President Bush and the national security strategy, a funny anecdote from that. Yeah. When Peter Feaver and I sat down with him to go over sort of the first initial draft of the document, I'll never forget, he said to us, he says, "Guys, all right, you're off to a decent start here, but this reads like a couple of professors wrote it." And he didn't mean that as praise. He said, "I want you to write a strategy that the men on the street in Lubbock, Texas can understand. At first, I was a little taken aback but then I realized there's actually quite a bit of wisdom in that, partly because we wanted the strategy to be somewhat accessible to the American people but also academics are prone to obfuscating and hiding behind big words and dense ponderous language when clarity of prose can also bring, I think, clarity of strategic concept so-Mike Green: And it came out, I thought, very, very well and you artfully took this sort of enlightenment prose and turn it into Lubbock prose without losing a thing. You know, in my book I found Thomas Jefferson, Commodore Perry Opening to Japan, some of the most important and ambitious thinkers on Asia realized we had a stake in justly governed republics that would resist imperialism. There's a realpolitik power dimension. It sort of aligns with how President Bush talked to us about idealism in the long term. But in the short term you do face moral challenges in foreign policy, like the Uighur situation in Xinjiang and I'm focusing on Asia, of course, the Rohingya and the Rakhine state in Myanmar, Hong Kong. How do you deal with the short-term crises?Will Inboden: Yeah, I think this is where, again, prudence and good judgment come in. So you always want to keep in mind the long-term goal of more free, open, tolerant societies that are not brutalizing their own people. Because of course we see a pretty strong empirical connection between ones that are brutalizing their own people are often more aggressive externally and don't uphold international order. But I mean I was just in China and Hong Kong last week and yeah, the signs are very troubling right now. We happened to be in China on June 4th, the 30th anniversary of Tiananmen Square, and one could not find any mention of it anywhere. You know, the way that not only has the Chinese government gotten away with that brutal massacre 30 years later, but they've now squelched all awareness of it. While I'm generally supportive of the current administration's more assertive posture towards China, I do worry that our relative silence on the democracy and human rights front, is ... It's actually not smart politics. It's giving up an important tool in our toolkit. Again, an asymmetric advantage we'd have over Beijing. I mean it's perhaps a little trite to say it, but I think Xi Jinping fears his own people more than he fears the United States. And if we can be more sophisticated but still principled in our support for the democracy and human rights and religious freedom dissidence in China, certainly speaking out on behalf of the Uighurs, especially speaking out and doing more to support the protestors in Hong Kong because I think a Rubicon really is being crossed there, I think that would actually strengthen our hand also in our negotiations with China on the economic front and the security front and elsewhere. It opens up a new dimension if you want the relationship where the United States and our allies and our values would give us more of an advantage.Mike Green: So much of official Washington and wonkish policy of Washington has become so skeptical of the proposition you're now articulate ... explaining, which I agree with. We did surveys as you know, at CSIS of elites in 10 countries in Asia and the United States and we asked in the future integration of Asia how important are certain principles and we included things like human rights and democracy. And outside of China support for those norms was incredibly high. When we did the last survey in 2015 it was an aggregate, it was higher but in one country it did drop precipitously, the United States of America. U.S. experts were skeptical that these democratic norms were right or worked. There's a real sort of lack of confidence in our own value proposition, if you will. National Public Radio had a fascinating man on the street interview in a second-tier city in China and asked, what do you think of when you think of the United States? And the first few answers were from random people, democracy, freedom, and we forget sometimes how powerful this is as an asset. Tell us a little bit about the Clements Center and how you teach and think about using history and statecraft and then we'll apply some of those ideas to Asia.Will Inboden: Yeah. When we started the Clements Center for National Security at University of Texas at Austin six years ago, the idea was to create an academic teaching and research center, also policy engagement, focused on this intersection of applying the insights of history to current national security challenges. There are many excellent security studies programs and centers at a lot of leading universities in the country and I value all of them. But we found at least at the time that there were very few, if any, that had that particular focus on the history. So many others were dominated by political science and quantitative methodology. Again, which can be very insightful, but it's missing the historical part. And of course I knew from my experience as a policymaker that almost all senior national security policy makers in their very limited spare time like to read history. It's the discipline that's most accessible to them. They most naturally gravitate to it. Partly because it's often constituted as a narrative. There's a story that they can get their minds around. Partly because it deals so much with real life flesh and blood individuals and again that's often who they're dealing with in their statecraft rather than abstract concepts of balance of power in national institutions. Those are two but at the end of day it really is about those personal interactions and history brings that alive. So we're trying to do a program of teaching and training our students to think historically not just for its own sake but as preparation for careers in national security policy.Mike Green: You invited me down to the Lonestar Seminar, which I guess the UT system does collectively?Will Inboden: Yeah, in partnership with Texas AandM and SMU too.Mike Green: Yeah, and to present on a chapter from my book on the history of U.S. strategy in Asia and it was-Will Inboden: An excellent book I should add.Mike Green: Thank you very much.Will Inboden: In case we needed any more prompts for it.Mike Green: And to my staff, don't edit that part out. I had a wonderful time. And the format is: one historian, one political scientist, and one hybrid. And I guess I was a hybrid, but my favorite part was the dinner where a historian and a political scientist had a smackdown contest to see who could insult the other the most. And it ended with the political scientist saying, "What you guys, what you historians do we call trivia." And then the historian said, "What you political scientists do, reducing things to two variables, that's what we call talking to small children." And it was wonderful. But the best work really often is a hybrid, I think. And political scientists worked in the Bush NSC, Connie Rice, Peter Feaver, Victor Cha, myself.Will Inboden: Steve Krasner.Mike Green: Steve Krasner. Most of us came out and wrote history.Will Inboden: Yeah. Yeah.Mike Green: So you've written some really interesting pieces on how to think about history and how to misuse history. So how do you use history in statecraft? What's a simple guide for people listening?Will Inboden: Well I will try to keep it simple. But whenever you ask a professor who's written a lot on this you have to keep it simple. I mean, so the first is understanding history is so much more than just analogies, right? I mean that's often when it's misused, is if we grab one cheap analogy and try to cram it into something. So this new situation as another Vietnam or another Iraq or another Munich or something, you know, those are ones that are most misused. But rather, part of it is thinking about history as a way of learning vicarious lessons. So perhaps looking at different mistakes or things that others have done in the past where we can take away the lessons from that without having to bear the costs. Part of it is looking at history as a laboratory of ideas. There's very little new under the sun as Solomon says in the good book. I remember when we were on the Bush NSC staff thinking about ways to try to do the war of ideas with jihadist ideology, spent a lot of time looking at, how did we wage the war of ideas in the Cold War and what were some of the institutions and instruments that we used there? So that was a way of using history as a laboratory for ideas. History is often most important for understanding other states, our counterparties, right? I mean, so while I don't pretend to be an expert on North Korea, I do know that we can't understand the current situation in North Korea without understanding North Korea's own history, how the Kim regime dynasty views itself and its history similarly with Xi Jinping or Putin or any others. So it's not just about looking at past American ... the history of American actions, looking at the history of others. And then we've got this one, especially from President Bush when I talked to him about this shortly after he had left office, he said, history is so important for policy makers to take the long view, the long perspective because if you're only driven by polls or headlines that may make one particular policy choice more appealing than others. But if we're thinking about, how will this be remembered in history, how will this look in history, that can give you strength and resolve to sometimes make tougher choices that may not be so popular at the time. One example he used from Asia is he said, look, as much as Truman was incredibly unpopular as president over the Korean War and ends obviously in a stalemate and he leaves office with some of the lowest approval ratings ever in early 1953 because Truman had had the resolve at least sort of stay the course and protect South Korea's sovereignty and leave American forces behind, over time that obviously became a key linchpin to our security architecture in Asia, our alliance system, South Korea's eventual transition in the 1980s to a democracy and earlier transition to a market economy. So Bush talked about that in the context of ... That's partly where he got the moral resolve and strength to make the Iraq surge decision, which again was tremendously unpopular at the time. But he was thinking not just about what will this do for my poll ratings or relations with Congress tomorrow, but how will this look in history just as Truman made some of those tough calls with South Korea, you know, 70-some years earlier.Mike Green: John Lewis Gaddis was your-Will Inboden: He was my advisor. Yeah.Mike Green: And in his new book, which is a smorgasbord of history and classics and popular culture-Will Inboden: Augustine as grand strategist.Mike Green: Yes. Where he comes out in my view is it teaches you humility and it teaches you contingency and as you said, vicarious ... Either you can experience other's mistakes. Do you buy the idea that you can think in time as Neustadt and others have said, that you can sort of understand a problem if you understand how it has evolved?Will Inboden: Yeah. Dick Neustadt and Ernie May and their classic thinking in time on the use of history for policy have that wonderful analogy of thinking of history as a stream, right? And so we enter the stream at a particular juncture but we know that there are headwaters that have come before us, there are events and people and things that have flown before us. So we're not, you know, a tabula rasa, not a blank slate. And then we also know that there will be downstream consequences of our actions so we can shape and steer the stream in particular ways, but again should have the humility to recognize what has come before us and also a certain amount of deference and beholdenness to our successors in ways that we are going to be steering the stream as well. So I think it's a really powerful analogy. And again, yeah, history teaching humility is definitely another one of the important commandments of it.Mike Green: Yeah. I mean the other key insight from Gaddis's book is that the essence of good grand strategy is understanding that there are some unsolvable tensions between your national objectives. If there weren't these tensions, strategy would be easy.Will Inboden: Yeah.Mike Green: And hard grand strategy is understanding there are these tensions. You understand that best if you understand the history of an issue.Will Inboden: As I often tell my students, policymaking is not about choosing between a bad and a good option. It's about choosing between a bad option, a really bad option, and a terrible option, and your job is to pick the bad option.Mike Green: That's right. There's nothing like working in the White House for five years to teach you humility. So let's apply some of these historical frameworks to thinking about the Asia chessboard strategy in Asia and start with one important historical legacy issue, which is the Vietnam War, which frames so much of how we think about American society, American foreign and military policy, but also our relations in Asia. What is your short takeaway on the lesson of Vietnam? How would you-Will Inboden: Well, I start with this observation, which is, just about every American would agree that the United States needs to learn the lessons of Vietnam. And yet hardly anyone can agree on what those lessons are because they are so abundant and so conflicting and can go different ways. My own, I'll just highlight a few takeaways I think from Vietnam. The first is the awareness of limits, right? I mean, it's the first war in our nation's history that we actually definitively lose, the first major expeditionary foreign policy operation that was a true debacle. And it was an important chastening for the United States, of realizing that as powerful and as successful as we've been as a country, there are some profound limits on what we can accomplish. And that of course explains quite a bit of our reluctance and some succeed ... you know, particularly in the next couple of decades after Vietnam to do any other interventions. The second big one is the need to align our use of force with our policy objectives. Again, without being too much of a simplistic armchair quarterback on Vietnam, I think a pretty fair critique is that very consistently throughout the war, there was a real misalignment between the way we were trying to use the force and what our ultimate policy objectives were. And that's why of course that then, as you know I'm currently writing a book on Reagan administration foreign and defense policy, and this is what directly shapes the Weinberger Doctrine, right? Which I think is actually an imperfect doctrine. I don't subscribe to everything about it, but I appreciate ... it was at least an effort to bring the use of force much more in alignment with overall strategy and goals. Another takeaway from Vietnam, which we see especially with the Reagan doctrine, was a much greater reliance on proxy forces. So Reagan realized, okay, instead of sending 500, 600,000 American ground troops somewhere, let's supply the Mujahideen in Afghanistan with weapons. Let's supply the Contras with weapons. Let's supply the UNITA rebels in Angola with weapons, let's supply the anti-Vietnamese forces in Cambodia with weapons. Sometimes that succeeds. Sometimes it doesn't. Not easy, but I think that's a very direct takeaway from Vietnam and actually expanded the American toolkit a bit. The final big takeaway for me on Vietnam is the need to preserve and sometimes restore American credibility because it was such a tremendous blow to our credibility. This explained some of the tactics that Nixon and Kissinger are trying to use towards the end, you know, rather controversial, but I understand what they're getting at. They're trying to find a way to extricate us from that conflict that still preserves our credibility elsewhere in the world, which I do think is a very important but underappreciated part of the national security toolkit.Mike Green: Rich Armitage was on the podcast just before you and of course was on the ground and at sea in Vietnam, got the South Vietnamese Navy out of Vietnam, and then worked on Asia policy the whole rest of his career. I asked him about his experience and what it meant to him the rest of his career. And one of the most important things he said was the importance of American commitment and the price you pay when you can't live up to the commitment. And it made him a real champion of the U.S.-Japan alliance and other forward presence in Asia.Will Inboden: When I talked to Rich for my Reagan book, because of course he was so key on U.S.-Asia relations in the Reagan administration, and asked when and how did he first become appreciative of the importance of Japan as a strategic partner, he says, "Oh, when I was going to Vietnam, and I was transiting through Japan countless times, and I realized, yeah, this is a pretty large unsinkable aircraft carrier in a strategic part of the world."Mike Green: Yeah, he said that on the podcast with us as well. And I think one of the other lessons I'd add to your excellent list is Vietnam forced us to return to our Mahanian roots, which is offshore balancing the first island chain and the Guam Doctrine under Nixon was about pulling back to the first island chain. Land wars in Asia, not a good idea if you can avoid them at all. I also think we probably learned something about regional strategy. So much of what we did in Vietnam was based on how we thought it would be perceived in Europe and not the rest of Asia. And then I can tell you as an Asian guy, one other takeaway is the Vietnamese are pretty damn tough.Will Inboden: Yeah.Mike Green: The good news is they're kind of sort of on our side this time.Will Inboden: Yeah, yeah, exactly. Again, one of ... and that's another thing that history can teach us actually, particularly in Asia, is how possible it is for adversaries to become allies. I mean look at just incredible transformation in the U.S.-Japan relationship from the end of the war in '45 to the peace treaty in '51 and then as now being our most important ally in the region, or again Vietnam, who would have thought as recent as a couple of decades ago that they'd be an emerging important strategic partner for us.Mike Green: You'll recall that President Bush on the campaign stump in 2004 used to talk about how his best friend among world leaders or one of his best friends was the Japanese prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, and his dad had fought against the Japanese and he just particularly in the context of Iraq and Afghanistan found that kind of remarkable and inspiring.Will Inboden: His dad had been, yeah, shot down by the Japanese.Mike Green: Shot down and held no ill will at all, but it played well with the crowds, at least Republican crowds he was talking to.Will Inboden: Yeah.Mike Green: Let me ask you about Reagan and George.Will Inboden: Yeah.Mike Green: In my book, I reckon that George Shultz was probably the best Secretary of State we had on Asia, but how do you assess Reagan? You're doing a new book on his foreign policy. How do you look at Reagan overall as a strategist? People like George Schultz?Will Inboden: Yeah. Well first let me say, I actually, I'll go you one further on George Shultz. I think he was our finest Secretary of state of the 20th century, full stop, not just on Asia. So, and I know there's some tough competition there. Jim Baker, Henry Kissinger, Dean Acheson, and I have great reverence for all of them. But I actually, I'll go even one further. I mean, Shultz is going to come out very, very positively in my book and I think the historical record bears that out. So a couple of big takeaways thus far to give a sneak preview of the book, which is still a couple of years from actually appearing on the shelves, on the role of history and strategy in the Reagan administration. The first is Reagan brought a much more acute historical sensibility to his strategy towards the Soviets than I'd earlier appreciated. But this also applies to Asia. And there were some very formative historical episodes for Reagan, some from his own life, some from his reading. The first is he was deeply shaped by World War II, and World War II for him was not first and foremost a great power contest, but was rather a battle of ideas between the free world and totalitarianism. So also with the Cold War, even though the detente framework from the '70s had treated the Cold War as primarily a great power contest with ideology off on the side. For Reagan, it's first and foremost a battle of ideas between these two rival systems that just happens to have a great power dimension to it. He was drawing that very much from World War II, and so his takeaways there were the importance of fighting that battle of ideas, of de-legitimizing Soviet communism, of maintaining strong allies among the Free World. Another big Reagan takeaway, and this applies especially to Asia, is from the 1930s, he was deeply averse to protectionism because he saw that protectionism not only had spread global poverty, but also had led to militarism and the rise of World War II. And so this is why in the U.S.-Japan relationship, he was so focused on transforming the U.S.-Japan relationship from primarily economic rivalry to strategic partnership and strongly resisted demands from the American people, from Congress, from a lot of the media to get into a real trade war Japan and to put severe tariffs on them. Yeah, they had to deal with monetary policy in the Plaza Accord. They had to deal with some voluntary export restraints. It's not like he wasn't doing anything on that, but for Reagan over and over again, he has given speeches, making the case to the American people, protectionism is the wrong way to go with a U.S.-Japan relationship or U.S.-Taiwan or any others. One of the historical insights that he actually got from his reading, particularly with the Soviets, is he read a book by Suzanne Massie called Land of the Firebird, which was a history ... like a thousand-year history of Russia up until 1917, so it's Russia before the Soviet Union. And that gave Reagan a real appreciation for the Russian people and Russian culture and enabled him to distinguish the Russian people from the Soviet system. So that's why he's constantly engaged in outreach directly to the Russian people, trying to support Russian dissidents, trying to appeal to the best of Russian culture, his hostility was not to Russia or to Russians, it was to Soviet communism, which he saw as this kind of alien imposition, this parasite on this historic civilization and tradition. And so he got that from his own reading of history.Mike Green: Did you get to interview Shultz for the book?Will Inboden: So I did, yeah.Mike Green: In San Francisco?Will Inboden: Yeah.Mike Green: In his apartment?Will Inboden: No, it was actually in his office at Stanford.Mike Green: I interviewed him in his apartment for my book, and he welcomed me at the door, and he said, "You like the Pacific?" And I said, "Yes, Mr. Secretary." He says, "Come with me and walk me to the balcony," at the back of his apartment, which overlooked San Francisco Bay. And he points and he says, "There it is." And he gave me this history of how he got interested in the Pacific and how committed he was. But the reality was Shultz and Weinberger fought like cats and dogs in the Administration, not about Asia, but about arms control, about the Soviet Union. Isn't that a bit of a black mark on Reagan's leadership in foreign policy, that they had these huge fights or is that just unavoidable in any administration?Will Inboden: It certainly is. And I'll even go one further again, even though my book will be positive overall on the Reagan administration, I will pull no punches on the organizational chaos and dysfunction, and exemplifying that of course was the bad relations between Shultz and Weinberger in State and DoD. But also, you know, Reagan goes through six national security advisors in eight years. A couple of them get indicted, one attempts suicide, a couple others get fired. The NSC was a, until Frank Carlucci came out along in '87, pretty chaotic mess. And when you look at some of the Reagan administration's policy failures, those pretty directly stem from the organizational failures. So the Beirut mission, '83, the Marine Barracks Bombing, that was ... it was a tragedy. Iran was behind it. But it was also driven by the fact that there was this paralysis between State and DoD over what the Marines' mission was and what our strategic goals were there. And because Reagan hadn't resolved it, disaster ensued. IranContra's another one. Yeah, there were some bad policy ideas behind IranContra but at its core, it was a classic case of organizational dysfunction, lack of accountability, and NSC getting too operational. And so the question is, how did the Reagan administration succeed despite some of these things? I think there's a couple of keys. One, when Reagan himself had a clear strategic vision, especially as he did with the Soviets, and got on board, he was able to neutralize those fights, put his thumb on the scale, set the agenda, be decisive. The second was frankly, when he and Shultz forged a really close partnership and just started to kind of marginalize some of the dissenters, and a committed president and a committed Secretary of State working in tandem is a very, very powerful, potent partnership. We saw it with Truman and Acheson. We saw it with Nixon and Kissinger at their best. We saw it with Bush and Baker. We certainly saw it with Reagan and Shultz.Mike Green: The beginning of the Reagan administration was an organizational dumpster fire.Will Inboden: Yes.Mike Green: As the term is sometimes applied to President Trump, especially on Asia. He had Al Haig, who was out of the Kissinger view that China is a future for the U.S. and Asia. Pretty negative on Japan but he had George Shultz who was very pro-Japan.Will Inboden: And Haig tossed Taiwan under the bus too.Mike Green: Huge chaos. You read the headlines in the newspapers from 1981 and it's pretty chaotic, very chaotic.Will Inboden: And part of that too is Reagan himself wasn't paying a lot of attention to foreign policy in '81. He had three priorities in '81: the economy, the economy, and the economy. And he was all about getting his tax package through and getting inflation down and then creating the resources of course for a defense budget increase and other things. This is not to excuse the organizational chaos and the foreign policy ineptitude during that year, but it's the beginning of '82 when he turns and starts focusing on foreign policy that you start ... of course he gets rid of Al Haig a few months later, brings Shultz in, that you start to see some progress.Mike Green: Is it '82 when the NSC document comes out? NSC, I forgot the number, to actually roll back Soviet communism?Will Inboden: Yes-Mike Green: Because from basically Nixon on maybe even Johnson on and especially during Carter, U.S. strategy was extremely retrenched and cautious and status quo oriented. Reagan wants to rollback. It's around '82.Will Inboden: Yeah. So in January of '82 Bill Clark becomes National Security Advisor. He's not been treated well by history, but I think he deserves a better shake than that. And he oversees the drafting of two key strategy documents, NSDD 32, which is the overall national security strategy, and that comes out in '82 and that starts laying out the rollback principles. And then in '83, first drafted by Dick Pipes and then by Jack Matlock NSDD 75, and that's the more direct strategy towards the Soviet Union. And those two documents read very well in light of history.Mike Green: And here's the thing, I'm interested in this podcast in regional strategy, but effective regional strategy is impossible unless you have a coherent overall strategy. And those two documents framed an approach in Asia that guided the Pacific Command, the State Department. We shored up our alliance with Japan, we used the Japanese archipelago, which Armitage was a key part of this, instituted the maritime strategy. At the end of the Carter administration, Soviet boomers, nuclear subs were with ease going to the West Coast to the U.S., threatening us. By 1983, '84 they were afraid to leave the Sea of Okhotsk, and it was a measurable and successful strategy and would not have been possible without that larger global frame.Will Inboden: Yeah, and one of the key concepts in my book is going to be how the Reagan ... Reagan and Shultz pretty deftly integrated force and diplomacy, which is using the American defense buildup not to launch a bunch of wars, but rather to strengthen our diplomatic hand and rollback Soviet adventurism and in turn bolster the confidence of our allies and their defense spending too.Mike Green: So fans of the current president say he's Reagan-esque because he's bold and sports a strong defense, I think on defense spending, that's probably fair, but he's protectionist compared to Reagan and he's pretty tough on allies. What do you think? Is there a parallel at all between Trump and Reagan, but more to the point, is there a way the Reagan lesson might actually be convincing to President Trump, that he might actually take ... there are aspects he might take on board that could fit with his world view or is it just too different?Will Inboden: I would hope President Trump would pay more attention, pay more heed to the Reagan example. From what I've seen thus far, President Trump could not be more dissimilar to Reagan. I mean, so again, Reagan deeply committed to allies, as initially had been the case with Trump. Reagan deeply committed to free trade, hasn't been the case with Trump. Reagan deeply committed to values, especially after '82 to democracy and human rights promotion, which is why we see some of the successful democratic transitions in Asia, Philippines, Taiwan, South Korea. But that said, yeah, my word to President Trump, if he happens to be listening to this podcast or any of his staff, is, looking at some of their concerns about our allies who are free riding and underfunding their defense, the Reagan administration had those same concerns. But again, as you know very well in the case with Japan, Reagan persuaded Nakasone to over time almost triple Japan's defense budget as well as of course extend Japan's defense perimeter out at a thousand kilometers. And he did it not through publicly shaming and scolding Nakasone, but through hugging him closely and quiet diplomacy and assuring him of America's commitment to Japan. And that I think created both the political space and the confidence for Japan to increase its defense spending. Again, we've already mentioned, human rights, democracy, but tremendous asymmetric advantages the United States has, which Reagan wielded very effectively. I would encourage the Trump administration to do the same. And of course Reagan and Shultz knew that over time, free trade, economic liberty are much better for America and much better for the world than protectionism.Mike Green: That Reagan world view, I think is still pretty much the sweet spot for members of Congress and the Republican Party and a lot of the president's own administration. So what's you're saying should resonate.Will Inboden: Yeah. Part of a small briefing with Senator Romney yesterday and he was quoting Reagan at length and clearly takes Reagan as his lodestars do, many ... Senator Ben Sasse, Senator Cornyn, many other Republican senators.Mike Green: So Gaddis's book, which I read about five times in grad school, was called Strategies of Containment, plural. We're now clearly embarked on a new chapter in U.S.-China relations marked by rivalry, geopolitical rivalry, competition, the national security strategy, the national defense strategy. Say it, Hank Paulson, former Treasury Secretary even says it, but I always come back to Gaddis's argument. There were strategies, plural, of containment. What are the lessons from the Cold War for how we approach China? What does victory look like in this new strategy or will there be multiple strategies?Will Inboden: Yeah, I do think, I mean, so much of strategy is context-dependent and I don't want to take that as a punt on it, but I'm ... the two traps we can fall into with strategies is one is just pure platitudes and bromides and the other is trying to have a very rigid template that one size fits all. So with the U.S.-China relationship right now, parts of it are coming to look similar to the Cold War. Certainly, for one, the competition is global now. It's not just directly between U.S. and China, but it's playing out in the Middle East and Latin America and Africa. There is somewhat of an ideological component to it, as far as China pushing its authoritarian capitalist model and trying to support other authoritarians and both nuclear powers and we want to desperately avoid a nuclear exchange. I think at hand there's a number of dissimilarities. The biggest one is the economic interdependence between the U.S. and China right now. And I know we're trying to partially unwind some of that, but the U.S. and Soviet Union just never had anywhere near that degree of economic interdependence. In a lot of ways, it's been good for the U.S. and China, in other ways, it's been very bad for the U.S. and of course China has taken advantage of that, but that's the biggest area where the Cold War analogy breaks down. So strategic principles, I mean, from the Cold War, we need to double down and reinforce our allies in Asia, our existing alliance alliances, Japan, South Korea, Australia especially, but also our emerging partners who may not yet be formal allies. India would be a primary one.Mike Green: Reagan in 1982 issued a national presidential directive, they called them then, saying that regardless of whether it's aligned with the U.S. or not, the rise of India is in our strategic interests.Will Inboden: Yeah.Mike Green: Very prescient.Will Inboden: Yeah, exactly. Very prescient. So you look back, so much of our world today was envisioned in the 1980s by Reagan and Schultz.Mike Green: Your Reagan book is going to be great. I can't wait, but I'll have to, so when are we going to get it?Will Inboden: Yeah, well, it's due to the publisher next December and so hopefully it'll appear probably summer of 2021.Mike Green: Great. And Will Inboden, we can see your good work in the meantime at the Clements Center?Will Inboden: Yes.Mike Green: At UT Austin. And you're also of course, responsible for the National Security Review, the Texas National Security Review-Will Inboden: The Texas National Security Review, yeah that's right.Mike Green: ... and War on the Rocks is also a partner of yours-Will Inboden: Yeah.Mike Green: ... so there'll be plenty of things people can look at to breathe history and think about the Asia chessboard using the past, using statecraft lessons from not only Reagan but other American administrations thinking about values and democracy in our foreign policy. It's been a joy having you. Good luck with the book.Will Inboden: Thanks so much. It's been a pleasure.Andrew Schwartz: Thanks for listening.

Wireless revolution: What 5G is, and how it will affect you; Next-generation wireless service will mean smarter homes and faster movie downloads. But it also promises higher prices, less privacy.The Christian Science MonitorAugust 12, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 Christian Science Publishing Society All Rights ReservedSection: EconomyLength: 605 wordsByline: Laurent Belsie Staff writerBodyIf the internet was the information superhighway - as Al Gore and others famously put it - 5G is a future where every street is an autobahn: no speed limits, no data bottlenecks. It's a future perhaps as game-changing as the internet itself. What is 5G?It's the fifth generation of cellphone service, using three different portions of the spectrum to create a superfast and much more reliable service even if you're sitting in a basement or stuck in an underground tunnel during rush hour. It's this reliability of communications - wherever you are - that could lead to innovative products and services.Like what?At first, faster phones and new cable companies. Downloads will be more than 10 times as fast as a good 4G connection, meaning you could download a full movie to your phone in seconds rather than minutes. Also, wireless companies could begin competing with cable firms to offer home internet and TV service.And eventually? Your city's traffic grid would communicate with cars and vice versa to reduce bottlenecks and improve safety. Smart homes would become smarter and easier to set up. Since 5G would virtually eliminate any delays in streaming video, workers could operate bulldozers remotely and shoppers at home could "try on" clothes by watching a holographic 3D image of themselves dressed in the duds. Futurists call this "the internet of things," where everything can communicate with everything else.When will 5G be available?South Korea, China, Britain, Kuwait, and others have set up limited 5G systems. In April, Qatar hosted the world's first 5G phone call. In the United States, several cities are trying out systems. Some early testers in Chicago reported speeds up to 1,400 megabits per second, roughly 14 times the limit of what today's 4G systems can usually deliver. And that's just the beginning. Most observers peg 2020 as the year when 5G really begins to roll out around the world.When will it be mainstream?By 2025, just under half of Americans will have 5G connections, according to Deloitte. But only a third of Europeans and a quarter of Chinese will be hooked up to the new service.Will it be expensive? Estimates suggest carriers in the U.S. will offer 5G as a premium service at first. Verizon, for example, plans to charge $10 a month extra for the service. Its 5G phones range from $1,000 to $1,300. The rewards to companies could be amazing, with one forecast predicting a $277 billion global market by 2025. Are there any drawbacks?To achieve higher speeds, 5G uses radio waves in a new area of the spectrum. These radio waves don't do a good job penetrating walls and buildings, so 5G carriers will have to build a much denser network of small transmitters to complement today's cell-tower technology. Some critics have raised concerns that exposure to so many radio waves could have health effects. The industry says no studies have uncovered any problems. The other big concern is privacy. The more densely packed transmitters are, the more precisely users can be tracked. Other experts raise concerns that ­China-based Huawei, one of the most advanced, and cheapest, manufacturers of many 5G network components, will use its equipment to give the Chinese government a secret back door to the data. The Trump administration banned U.S. companies from selling equipment to Huawei, but is now considering exempting some companies from that ban. Britain shows little concern, since its carriers building 5G networks are reportedly using Huawei parts. India, by contrast, has shied away from using Huawei components, even after the company offered assurances there would be no back door.Load-Date: August 12, 2019End of Document

Deutsche mulling "~radical' job cuts; Central bank digital currency effortsamericanbanker.comJuly 1, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 SourceMedia, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: Vol. 1; No. 1Length: 1146 wordsByline: George YacikBodyReceiving Wide Coverage ...Deutsche difficultiesDeutsche Bank is considering cutting 15,000 to 20,000 jobs, "or more than one in six full-time positions globally," the Wall Street Journal reports. "The cuts being contemplated by senior executives reflect anacceleration of Deutsche Bank's downsizingand another major pullback from its global ambitions.""The internal discussions show Deutsche Bank's dire straits, buffeted by dismal profit expectations and exasperated investors looking for a reason to believe in the shares," the Journal says."The headcount reductions would be equivalent to roughly half of all investment banking jobs at Deutsche, although it is unclear whether the cuts will also affect the bank's other divisions," the Financial Times reports. "It represents about a fifth of Deutsche's total workforce of about 91,000. Last year, thelender cut 7,000 jobs.""Executives hope that the restructuring will be sufficiently radical to overcome the worries among investors, customers and employees that Deutsche Bank lacks a viable plan to overcome itsweak finances and bruised reputation," the New York Times says.Good times, bad timesBig American banks are promising $136 billion inshare buybacks and dividend increasesover the next 12 months following their passing of the Federal Reserve's stress tests. "Investors cheered the news, sending banking sector shares close to 2% higher on Friday, well ahead of the wider U.S. stock market," the Financial Times says. But "Friday's rise could not mask the fact thatbank shares have badly underperformedthe market since the beginning of last year, however, and trade at a big discount to nonbank stocks, suggesting that investors are more concerned about the prospect of declining interest rates and a slowing economy than they are excited about big payouts."Indeed, "banks are bracing for a third-straight quarter of declines" in trading revenue in the second quarter. "Stocks in 2019 have rebounded from a December swoon on hopes for continued low interest rates, which benefit the economy - a rally that could in theory help trading desks. But banks say their clients havelingering doubtsabout the resiliency of the market and aren't putting on the kinds of big, complex bets that earn bank traders the biggest fees," the Journal says.Goldman Sachs, said it would raise its dividend to $1.25, up from 85 cents, its largest increase ever, after being cleared to return $8.8 billion to shareholders over the next year, up from $6.3 billion. "The dividend increase is thelatest sign of the bank's transitionas it pushes into Main Street banking and steers away from less predictable businesses like trading."Don't get left behindCentral banks may need to issue their own digital currencies sooner than expected in order to keep up with efforts being made by Facebook and others, the head of the Bank for International Settlements said. "Many central banks are working on it; we are working on it, supporting them," Agustín Carstens told the FT, adding that the agency supports "the efforts of the world's central banks in creatingdigital versions of state currencies."One of the biggest beneficiaries of the surge in bitcoin, which tripled in price in the second quarter, was Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which "provides everyday investors with access to the world's most popular cryptocurrency." It jumped 192% for the quarter, "outperforming all fundsand other mainstream investments." It was also the best performer in the first half.But, bitcoin has failed to lift other boats in the cryptocurrency market as it did back in 2017. "Digital coins like Ethereum, Ripple's XRP coin and Bitcoin Cash are still trading between 70% and 90%below their record highs. The result is that bitcoin now makes up 62% of the cryptocurrency market's total value, compared with a third of the market near the height of the last rally."The rebound in cryptocurrency prices has "some senior figures in the financial services industry thinking again, wondering whether it wasthe spike or the crashin 2018 that was the anomaly. While demand for crypto remains driven by retail investors, particularly in Asia, institutional practitioners are increasingly getting involved, drawn by fat spreads and increasing volumes."Wall Street JournalStorm front comingThe banking industry has "managed tomostly withstand the turbulence" of digital transformations, but that is "due to change soon. Two major forces are driving this shake-up: the dramatic growth of digital payments in China and other Asian countries; and the rise of mobile banking in the West."Financial TimesNo choiceHSBC, which helped U.S. prosecutors arrest Huawei's finance director in Canada last December, "has launched a lobbying effort to convince the Chinese government that it is not responsible" for her apprehension as it "tries todistance itself from the diplomatic rowover China's top telecoms equipment maker." The Huawei executive, Meng Wanzhou, is currently fighting extradition to the U.S. "John Flint, HSBC's chief executive, and other senior representatives of the bank have told Chinese officials that it had little choice but to co-operate with the investigation."It's good to be green"Banks must develop comprehensive strategies and implementation plans" on environment-related risks, Ben Caldecott, director of the Oxford Sustainable Finance Program, says in an op-ed. If they don't, "regulators are likely to force this change. But the sector should be responsible and act sooner rather than later. It is in its commercial interests to do so.""New products, such as loans that charge lower interest rates to borrowers who meet or outperform sustainability targets, are a powerful incentive and can create new business, lower credit risk and support the real economy's transition to lower-carbon activity," he writes. "Banks can also provide retail clients with financial solutions that align them with the need for muchsmaller environmental footprints. These range from green mortgages and loans for energy efficiency retrofits to helping individual investors to engage with the companies whose shares they own."New York TimesApoliticalVisa CEO Al Kelly discusses how "he works to keep Visa at the center of the global financial system - and out of political disputes.""We are in the business of facilitating legal commerce," he says. "Our job is not to set or interpret, but to follow the law. The minute we don't, it will become an extraordinarily slippery slope. Our job is not to be dividing the country.

Deutsche mulling "~radical' job cuts; Central bank digital currency effortsAmerican BankerJuly 2, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent. All Rights ReservedSection: Vol. 184; No. 126Length: 1146 wordsByline: George YacikBodyReceiving Wide Coverage ...Deutsche difficultiesDeutsche Bank is considering cutting 15,000 to 20,000 jobs, "or more than one in six full-time positions globally," the Wall Street Journal reports. "The cuts being contemplated by senior executives reflect anacceleration of Deutsche Bank's downsizingand another major pullback from its global ambitions.""The internal discussions show Deutsche Bank's dire straits, buffeted by dismal profit expectations and exasperated investors looking for a reason to believe in the shares," the Journal says."The headcount reductions would be equivalent to roughly half of all investment banking jobs at Deutsche, although it is unclear whether the cuts will also affect the bank's other divisions," the Financial Times reports. "It represents about a fifth of Deutsche's total workforce of about 91,000. Last year, thelender cut 7,000 jobs.""Executives hope that the restructuring will be sufficiently radical to overcome the worries among investors, customers and employees that Deutsche Bank lacks a viable plan to overcome itsweak finances and bruised reputation," the New York Times says.Good times, bad timesBig American banks are promising $136 billion inshare buybacks and dividend increasesover the next 12 months following their passing of the Federal Reserve's stress tests. "Investors cheered the news, sending banking sector shares close to 2% higher on Friday, well ahead of the wider U.S. stock market," the Financial Times says. But "Friday's rise could not mask the fact thatbank shares have badly underperformedthe market since the beginning of last year, however, and trade at a big discount to nonbank stocks, suggesting that investors are more concerned about the prospect of declining interest rates and a slowing economy than they are excited about big payouts."Indeed, "banks are bracing for a third-straight quarter of declines" in trading revenue in the second quarter. "Stocks in 2019 have rebounded from a December swoon on hopes for continued low interest rates, which benefit the economy - a rally that could in theory help trading desks. But banks say their clients havelingering doubtsabout the resiliency of the market and aren't putting on the kinds of big, complex bets that earn bank traders the biggest fees," the Journal says.Goldman Sachs, said it would raise its dividend to $1.25, up from 85 cents, its largest increase ever, after being cleared to return $8.8 billion to shareholders over the next year, up from $6.3 billion. "The dividend increase is thelatest sign of the bank's transitionas it pushes into Main Street banking and steers away from less predictable businesses like trading."Don't get left behindCentral banks may need to issue their own digital currencies sooner than expected in order to keep up with efforts being made by Facebook and others, the head of the Bank for International Settlements said. "Many central banks are working on it; we are working on it, supporting them," Agustín Carstens told the FT, adding that the agency supports "the efforts of the world's central banks in creatingdigital versions of state currencies."One of the biggest beneficiaries of the surge in bitcoin, which tripled in price in the second quarter, was Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which "provides everyday investors with access to the world's most popular cryptocurrency." It jumped 192% for the quarter, "outperforming all fundsand other mainstream investments." It was also the best performer in the first half.But, bitcoin has failed to lift other boats in the cryptocurrency market as it did back in 2017. "Digital coins like Ethereum, Ripple's XRP coin and Bitcoin Cash are still trading between 70% and 90%below their record highs. The result is that bitcoin now makes up 62% of the cryptocurrency market's total value, compared with a third of the market near the height of the last rally."The rebound in cryptocurrency prices has "some senior figures in the financial services industry thinking again, wondering whether it wasthe spike or the crashin 2018 that was the anomaly. While demand for crypto remains driven by retail investors, particularly in Asia, institutional practitioners are increasingly getting involved, drawn by fat spreads and increasing volumes."Wall Street JournalStorm front comingThe banking industry has "managed tomostly withstand the turbulence" of digital transformations, but that is "due to change soon. Two major forces are driving this shake-up: the dramatic growth of digital payments in China and other Asian countries; and the rise of mobile banking in the West."Financial TimesNo choiceHSBC, which helped U.S. prosecutors arrest Huawei's finance director in Canada last December, "has launched a lobbying effort to convince the Chinese government that it is not responsible" for her apprehension as it "tries todistance itself from the diplomatic rowover China's top telecoms equipment maker." The Huawei executive, Meng Wanzhou, is currently fighting extradition to the U.S. "John Flint, HSBC's chief executive, and other senior representatives of the bank have told Chinese officials that it had little choice but to co-operate with the investigation."It's good to be green"Banks must develop comprehensive strategies and implementation plans" on environment-related risks, Ben Caldecott, director of the Oxford Sustainable Finance Program, says in an op-ed. If they don't, "regulators are likely to force this change. But the sector should be responsible and act sooner rather than later. It is in its commercial interests to do so.""New products, such as loans that charge lower interest rates to borrowers who meet or outperform sustainability targets, are a powerful incentive and can create new business, lower credit risk and support the real economy's transition to lower-carbon activity," he writes. "Banks can also provide retail clients with financial solutions that align them with the need for muchsmaller environmental footprints. These range from green mortgages and loans for energy efficiency retrofits to helping individual investors to engage with the companies whose shares they own."New York TimesApoliticalVisa CEO Al Kelly discusses how "he works to keep Visa at the center of the global financial system - and out of political disputes.""We are in the business of facilitating legal commerce," he says. "Our job is not to set or interpret, but to follow the law. The minute we don't, it will become an extraordinarily slippery slope. Our job is not to be dividing the country. Our job isnot to lecture peopleabout what to do or what to buy. And the minute you give on guns, then what about soda? What about fur coats? What about birth control pills? What about? What about? What about?"Quotable"It might be that it is sooner than we think that there is a market and we need to be able to providecentral bank digital currencies.http://www.americanbanker.com/morning-scan/deutsche-mulling-radical-job-cuts-central-bank-digital-currency-effortsLoad-Date: July 1, 2019End of Document

US PARTIALLY LIFTS BAN ON HUAWEI FOLLOWING EXTENSIVE LOBBYING CAMPAIGNStates News ServiceJuly 2, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 826 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the Center for Responsive Politics:By Vaughn GoldenOn May 15, Trump banned telecommunications giant Huawei from doing business in the U.S. as the trade war with China ramped up and the U.S. attempted to extradite Huawei's CFO from Canada on fraud charges. The Trump administration cited national security concerns, based on the premise that the Chinese government could use Huawei as a way to spy on the U.S. The concerns were driven in part by the race to expand 5G wireless network infrastructure, a sub-sector where Huawei is an industry leader.U.S. chip makers, which did an estimated $11 billion worth of business with Huawei last year, including Qualcomm and Intel, reacted by deploying lobbyists to federal agencies and Capitol Hill in an attempt to receive exceptions to the President's order.The result was a more targeted approach by the administration to restrict Huawei's supply chain, specifically targeting its 5G sub-sector rather than its consumer cell phone manufacturing.OpenSecrets keeps money in politics transparent and accountable.

Intel spent $1.4 million and $4 million respectively. Both lobbied Congress heavily as well as the Treasury Department, the Commerce Department, the White House and the U.S. trade representative. Google parent company Alphabet, also in Huawei's supply chain, spent a massive $21.5 million on lobbying in 2018 and $3.6 million so far this year.Huawei itself also is directly involved in trying to sway U.S. opinion. In March, the company publicly disclosed under the Foreign Agents Registration Act that it hired two public relations firms, Racepoint Global and Burson Cohn and Wolfe, to spearhead an influence campaign. Huawei is still paying Racepoint $55,000 per month and gave Burson Cohn and Wolfe a $160,000 budget.After President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jin Ping declared a trade truce last week, U.S. companies will now be able to sell high-tech equipment to Huawei. The ban on goods would be limited to those related to national security. This would likely include network hardware specifically related to 5G, which was one of the main targets of the administration's hardware ban in the first place.Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle weren't thrilled about Trump's concessions to reignite the trade talks. Even close allies like Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) claimed it would take significant efforts to reimplement the restrictions on Huawei should the administration want to again ratchet up pressure on China.Feel free to distribute or cite this material, but please credit the Center for Responsive Politics.For permission to reprint for commercial uses, such as textbooks, contact the Center: [email protected]Support Accountability JournalismAt OpenSecrets.org we offer in-depth, money-in-politics stories in the public interest.

A pathological complete response or pCR is defined as a lack of all signs of cancer in tissue samples analyzed following completion of neoadjuvant therapy and definitive surgery. Based on the recommendation of the DMC, the trial will continue without changes to evaluate the other dual-primary endpoint of event-free survival (EFS), per the trial design.

There was little fanfare coming out of the weekend thus the activity levels have been low. The S&P Futures represent this theme well with only a 6-handle range for the session. Spoos are currently trading around the 3023 level with an overnight high of 3026.00, while the low currently sits at 3020.00.In Asia, both China and Japan closed the day faintly lower. The Shanghai was crimped by the state release of the June Industrial Profits, which showed a decline of 3.1% for the month. Japanese shares struggled to maintain higher ground with the yen strengthening against the dollar. This kept a lid on many of the larger export stocks. On a positive note, June Retail Sales topped expectations with a rise of 0.5%, compared to +0.2% consensus. In Europe, the major bourses are mixed with Germany and France trading lower, while the FTSE is up 1%. The CAC and DAX are echoing the tone seen in Asia and the US. The FTSE had been a laggard all last week, so some of the gains appear to be a bounce in response to that. Also, the pound hit a fresh 2-year low against the greenback, lending support to equities.Market UpdatesS&P Futures vs Fair Value: -4.010 yr Note: 2.06%USD/JPY: 108.62 -0.01EUR/USD: 1.1123 -0.0001Europe: FTSE +1.0% DAX -0.1% CAC -0.3%Asia: Hang Seng -1.0% Shanghai -0.1% Nikkei -0.2%Gold (1418.70 -0.60) Silver (16.39 -0.01) Crude (56.22 +0.02)17:50WRAPX This week's biggest % gainers/losersThe following are this week's top percentage gainers and losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).This week's top % gainers Healthcare: ANIK (55.85 +37.49%), GHDX (68.66 +22.67%), SLDB (5.82 +22.27%), THC (22.01 +21.74%)Materials: CSTM (12.66 +23.87%)Industrials: UPS (120.58 +16.72%)Consumer Discretionary: SNBR (49.43 +23.11%), MTH (64.81 +19.33%), MAT (14.17 +18.18%)Information Technology: NTGR (34.25 +28.71%), MANH (88.44 +24.34%), TER (56.35 +22.61%), TYPE (20 +19.55%), TTD (278.55 +18.38%)Financials: EHTH (108.4 +24.83%), LOB (20.37 +24.36%), ENVA (25.23 +18.51%)Consumer Staples: VGR (11.15 +16.88%)This week's top % losers Healthcare: ALGN (198.84 -29.29%), ITCI (8.37 -29.19%), MMSI (41 -25.48%), DVAX (2.8 -23.5%), LNTH (22.77 -19.43%), GLYC (9.18 -17.82%), NXGN (16.31 -16.7%)Industrials: FIX (41.64 -20.23%), HCSG (24.86 -17.98%)Consumer Discretionary: IRBT (74.51 -17.61%), TUP (14.81 -17.58%)Information Technology: CARB (18.01 -27.5%), PTC (73.36 -16.63%)Energy: BPT (9.08 -30.21%), REI (2.41 -18.86%), UNT (6.32 -16.73%), SWN (2.04 -16.39%)Consumer Staples: TPB (41.86 -21.83%)Utilities: JE (3.6 -18.18%)17:49RECN Resources Connection approved an 8% increase in its cash dividend to $0.14 per share on co's common stock (17.00 +0.10)17:32EW Edwards Lifesciences files mixed securities shelf offering (212.85 +0.38)17:25PSXP Phillips 66 Partners also files mixed securities shelf offering (52.87 -1.08)17:22PSX Phillips 66 files mixed securities shelf offering (102.32 +0.75)17:20DOW Dow files mixed securities shelf offering (49.11 -1.66)17:19LXRX Lexicon Pharma provides preliminary update for Zynquista (Sotagliflozin) Type 2 Diabetes Phase 3 program; Sanofi (SNY) provides disputed termination notice; LXRX will provide update during earnings call Aug 1 at 8 a.m. ET (5.69 +0.08)The co received preliminary topline results from Sanofi for three Phase 3 trials of Zynquista (sotagliflozin) in adults living with type 2 diabetes from the InSynchrony clinical program.

The Russell 2000 rose 1.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased just 0.2%.Friday's session, much like in the days before, included its fair share of better-than-expected earnings reports. Alphabet gets the lead due to its mega-cap status, but honorable mentions include Starbucks (SBUX 99.11, +8.13, +8.9%) and Twitter (TWTR 41.80, +3.68, +9.7%). Dow components Intel (INTC 51.59, -0.57, -1.1%) and McDonald's (MCD 215.58, +1.14, +0.5%) underperformed despite positive results.Besides earnings, the fact that the U.S. economy continues to grow at a healthy pace was a positive consideration for investors. The advance estimate for second-quarter GDP increased 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus 1.8%), which did mark a modest slowdown from last quarter but not as much as expected due to strong consumer spending.The S&P 500 communication services sector (+3.3%), which is home to Alphabet and Twitter, nearly tripled the advance in the runner-up consumer staples sector (+1.2%). Laggards included energy (-0.5%) and industrials (-0.2%), although losses were modest.Amazon (AMZN 1942.70, -31.22, -1.6%) was also left out of the advance after the company missed profit estimates and guided Q3 operating income below expectations.In corporate news, Intel confirmed that Apple (AAPL 207.74, +0.72, +0.4%) will acquire most of its smartphone modem chip business for $1 billion. 3M (MMM 173.98, -4.15, -2.3%) disclosed an internal investigation to determine if its expenditures may have violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The Department of Justice approved the merger between T-Mobile US (TMUS 84.25, +4.34, +5.4%) and Sprint (S 7.99, +0.55, +7.4%).U.S. Treasuries finished the session with slight losses, pushing yields higher. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.87%, and the 10-yr yield increased one basis point to 2.08%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.2% to 98.01. WTI crude increased 0.3% to $56.19/bbl.Reviewing the Q2 GDP data, which was Friday's lone economic report:According to the BEA, the advance estimate showed Q2 real GDP increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus 1.8%) following a 3.1% increase in the first quarter. The GDP Price Deflator was up 2.4% (Briefing.com consensus 1.8%) after increasing 1.1% in the first quarter.The key takeaway from the report is that it revealed some impressive strength in the U.S. consumer, evidenced by the 4.3% growth in personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which was the second highest over the past 16 quarters. PCE contributed 2.85 percentage points to Q2 GDP growth.Investors will not receive any economic data of note on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +25.5% YTDS&P 500 +20.7% YTDRussell 2000 +17.1% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +16.6% YTD16:15APC Anadarko Petroleum misses by $0.04, beats on revs (73.62 +0.15)Reports Q2 (Jun) earnings of $0.51 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.04 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.55; revenues rose 4.6% year/year to $3.44 bln vs the $3.31 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

Hong Kong protesters call for 'Mulan' boycott after star went public in support of policeCNN.comAugust 15, 2019 Thursday 9:37 AM ESTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: ASIALength: 505 wordsByline: By Jessie Yeung, CNNBodyEven Mulan is getting political.Liu Yifei, the Chinese-born actress starring in Disney's upcoming live-action "Mulan" remake, waded into the Hong Kong protest controversy on Thursday by expressing support for the city's police, who anti-government demonstrators accuse of using excessive force to quell unrest."I support the Hong Kong police. You can all attack me now. What a shame for Hong Kong," she posted on Weibo, a Twitter-like Chinese social media platform.Immediately, people began posting #BoycottMulan on Twitter -- which is banned in China. Hours later, the hashtag was trending in Hong Kong and the United States with 37,700 tweets posted at time of writing. Twitter users accused the actress of supporting police brutality, and called out the fact that she's an American citizen."Liu is a naturalized American citizen. It must be nice. Meanwhile she pisses on people fighting for democracy," one person tweeted.On the flip side, she also received plenty of praise on Weibo, the dominant platform in China. Nearly all the comments on her post echoed support for the Hong Kong police and Beijing."Believe in the government, believe in the Chinese central (government), believe in the country," one comment wrote.The protests, which began in June as largely peaceful mass demonstrations against a now-suspended extradition bill, have morphed into something much darker and more violent, with frequent clashes between protesters and police.Liu isn't the only Chinese celebrity who's weighed in -- Jackie Chan, martial arts film icon and native Hong Konger, called for peace on Thursday in an interview with China's broadcaster CCTV. He, too, was blasted on Twitter for the nationalist tone of his message -- at one point, he says in Mandarin, "I feel the pride of being a Chinese everywhere. The five-starred red flag is respected everywhere."Other public figures, actors and singers like Tony Leung Ka-fai and Daniel Chan have spoken out against protester violence and vandalism. Pop star Denise Ho came out in strong support of the protesters -- she even gave a speech about the protests at a United Nations meeting last month.Celebrities outside of Hong Kong and China have also chimed in. Kim Eui Sung, a South Korean actor who starred in the cult 2016 zombie apocalypse film "Train to Busan," expressed support for the protesters on Instagram, writing, "We are watching you, praying for you. #freehongkong." After being bombarded with critical and pro-Beijing comments, he posted another photo -- the infamous Tank Man shot from the Tiananmen Square massacre.Sports drinks brand Pocari Sweat was also cheered by protesters and boycotted by the opposition after the company pulled ads from a local broadcaster perceived as pro-Beijing. Even bubble tea has been caught in the mix, with a Taiwanese chain urging solidarity with protesters.And with the unrest showing no end in sight, both sides are settling in for the long haul."So disappointed," said one Twitter user of Liu's Weibo post. "Was so excited for Mulan too."Load-Date: August 17, 2019End of Document

California Editorial RdpAssociated Press State & LocalJuly 31, 2019 Wednesday 4:07 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: STATE AND REGIONALLength: 1837 wordsByline: By The Associated PressBodyJuly 31Los Angeles Times on electric scooter concerns:Forget about presidential politics. The most controversial and divisive issue in Los Angeles these days may be scooters.Over the last few months, some 36,000 shared electric scooters and bicycles have been allowed onto the city's streets, as part of a one-year pilot program to study how so-called micromobility vehicles can be used and regulated in L.A. In some neighborhoods, you can't travel a block without seeing a scooter parked on - or dumped on - the sidewalk, and customers have taken around 2 million rides since the beginning of the year.But the city is split at the moment into two camps: scooter lovers, who say the rent-per-ride vehicles are a cheap, convenient way to travel short distances without getting into a car, thereby helping reduce tailpipe pollution and traffic congestion. And scooter haters, who say the vehicles are big, possibly dangerous toys being used irresponsibly and left cluttering the sidewalks when the joy ride is over.They're both right.The scooter lovers are certainly correct that in this traffic-clogged, smoggy city, people need more travel alternatives to cars. Shared scooters and bikes are especially helpful as "first-mile, last-mile" vehicles to move people between their homes or jobs and transit stations. The growing number of scooter riders helps build the case for more protected lanes and redesigned roads that make the streets safer for bicyclists, scooter riders and walkers too.But the skeptics raise legitimate gripes about the private companies that have, in some neighborhoods, inundated public spaces with scooters but failed to hold their customers accountable. So far, the companies have talked about educating riders and offering them incentives for good behavior, but problems persist. (During the first five months of the pilot project, the city received more than 3,000 complaints about scooters through its 311 app.) How much responsibility should scooter companies bear for the rude, irresponsible or downright dangerous behavior of their customers?A lot. Scooter companies have essentially introduced a new type of vehicle to the transportation landscape. They have an obligation to make sure their customers know the rules of the road and adhere to the proper etiquette governing how to ride and park the vehicles.After mostly welcoming scooters with open arms, Los Angeles officials are now considering following the lead of Chicago and some other cities and fining companies when rules or laws are broken. The city already requires companies to respond within two hours to complaints of broken, toppled or improperly parked scooters. If the companies are unresponsive over a long period, they eventually risk losing their permit to operate.Now, new penalties are being proposed, ranging from $50 for failing to respond to a service request within two hours to $1,500 if a company's customers repeatedly and consistently park their scooters improperly. (Separately, the Los Angeles Police Department has begun ticketing riders for riding on the sidewalk, which isn't allowed.)Ideally, the city won't need to levy steep penalties on companies. Scooters are still new, and some of the problems may resolve themselves if scooters become less of a novelty and more of a regular mode of transportation. Nevertheless, fines could help prod companies to be more proactive in managing their scooters and their customers, particularly if those companies choose to pass the fine along to offending riders, which would be another incentive for good behavior.Scooters companies have one big incentive already for being good stewards of the public space - many cities have banned shared, dockless vehicles from operating within their jurisdictions. It's not hard to imagine that if residents complain enough about bad scooter behavior, Los Angeles will also consider a severe crackdown or even a ban. And other cities would likely follow.That would be a shame. If scooters are ever going to be taken seriously as a transportation solution, then companies have to do a better job getting their customers to be responsible riders.___July 28Mercury News & East Bay Times on regulating the tech industry:The day of reckoning for Big Tech is upon us.Technology companies swung and missed at repeated opportunities over the past decade to work with the federal government on regulations to ensure consumer privacy and fair competition. They had a chance to address the issues and they failed.So we move to the next, inevitable step: the federal government's announcement last week that it will conduct an antitrust investigation of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon. Now the stakes are much higher. The industry's past foot-dragging means that it now faces a real threat that the feds could act unilaterally - and stifle innovation in the process.It's a serious risk. Raise your hand if you think the folks at the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission understand what drives the innovation economy. That's what we thought. Yet these are the people who will be drawing up the rules the tech industry will play by in the years ahead.Let's hope they don't forget that innovation is at the heart of our economic growth. Our ability to remain a world power requires that we maintain a technological edge over China and our other global competitors.That won't be easy. The Chinese government is investing $300 billion in an effort to dominate the fields of green energy, green vehicles, robotics, medicine and artificial intelligence. Its goal is to overcome the United States' technological advantage by 2025. Any serious disruption in the way the U.S. tech industry operates could have costly, unintended consequences on our ability to maintain our advantage.Whatever the federal government does, it must maintain incentives for U.S. tech firms to keep spending on research and development, which is one of their primary tools to evolve and prepare for the future.Tech leads U.S. companies in research and development spending. Amazon ($14.1 billion), Google ($10.15 billion), Apple ($7.65 billion) and Facebook ($4.76 billion) were among the top 10 investors in R&D in 2018. They are using those billions as a strategic weapon to win what could accurately be described as the World War of Artificial Intelligence.Time is of the essence. The digital landscape of 2030 is likely to be fundamentally different than it is today. After all, consider how fast it's changed in the past dozen years. As recently as 2007, MySpace dominated the social networking landscape, receiving more than 70% of all visits to social networks. Facebook, which was only three years old, was a distant second.That same year, IBM created Watson, its artificial intelligence system. Apple released the iPhone, Airbnb was founded, and Twitter had just gone global. Google had yet to release its Android system and Amazon was still finding its way on the cloud computing scene.Those companies launched a wave of innovation that helped the United States emerge from the 2008 financial crisis and create what has been the longest bull market in history. Unfortunately, Big Tech's dominance over those years has led to abuses that deserve greater federal regulation.As a result, the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission now needs to rein in Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. But, in the process, the feds must take extreme caution not to stifle innovation.___July 26Southern California News Group on the state's diversion of mortgage settlement funds:The California Supreme Court has finally put an end to the five-year-long shell game played by the state government with $331 million intended to help distressed homeowners during the recession-era mortgage crisis.The justices refused to hear an appeal from Gov. Gavin Newsom's administration, filed after the latest in a series of court decisions that went against the state. In April, an appeals court in Sacramento ruled in favor of consumer-advocacy groups that have been fighting for years to stop the state's diversion of the funds.The money came from the national settlement in 2012 of a lawsuit filed by 49 states, the District of Columbia and the federal government against the nation's five largest mortgage servicing companies - Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and the former GMAC, now known as Ally. The financial institutions agreed to pay more than $20 billion directly to affected homeowners and also to pay $2.5 billion to the states. California's share was $410 million.Then-Attorney General Kamala Harris directed that the state's money from the settlement should be used for various services such as homeowner education and programs to stop financial fraud. Instead, then-Gov. Jerry Brown, facing budget pressures, spent the money to cover other state expenses, including using $292 million of the mortgage settlement funds to pay state debt on housing bonds that voters had approved as far back as 2002.Groups representing distressed mortgage customers, including representatives of the Asian-American and Latino communities, filed suit in 2014 over the diversion of the funds, and courts repeatedly sided with them.State officials could have accepted those rulings and paid back the money, but instead they doubled down on sketchy conduct. Gov. Brown and the Legislature made an after-the-fact attempt to legalize the state's rerouting of the settlement money with a hastily passed budget trailer bill, signed into law in September 2018.The trailer bill, Senate Bill 861, stated that the California Department of Finance spent the $331 million from the mortgage settlement in a way that was "consistent with legislative direction."But signing it didn't make it so. "The money was unlawfully diverted," the 3rd District Court of Appeal ruled in April.With the recession-era budget problems in the rear-view mirror and surplus revenue rolling in to the state treasury, Gov. Newsom could have accepted the appeals court's decision and paid back the money. Instead he filed another appeal, this time to the California Supreme Court.Last week, the Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal. Newsom now says he will begin work on repaying the $331 million back to the special fund that was intended to help California homeowners who were hard hit by the mortgage crisis.In the final analysis, three years of state budget expenses were paid with funds that were intended to benefit distressed homeowners. Groups seeking to stop the diversion had to spend five years battling in court as the state tried every trick to keep the money. Homeowners who suffered during the mortgage crisis lost the benefit of five years of programs that might have helped them. And taxpayers had to foot the bill for the private law firm that represented the state after then-Attorney General Kamala Harris refused to defend the diversion of the settlement funds.The mortgage crisis may be over, but in California, the financial losses continue.Load-Date: August 1, 2019End of Document

Tencent profits bounce back. But there's trouble aheadCNN WireAugust 15, 2019 Thursday 10:57 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 382 wordsByline: By Laura He, CNN BusinessDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  Tencent's profit jumped 35% in the second quarter thanks to a sharp turnaround in its video game business. But more challenges are ahead.Shares in Tencent tumbled nearly 3% in Hong Kong on Thursday after the tech giant reported sales that fell short of analyst expectations and warned that an economic slowdown in China was hurting its advertising business. The stock decline wiped 92 billion Hong Kong dollars ($11.7 billion) off the company's market value.Tencent released 10 video games during the quarter after the Chinese government lifted a suspension of new game approvals that had limited the company to just one release in the first quarter.That helped drive profits higher to 24.14 billion yuan ($3 billion), topping analyst estimates.Revenue of 88.8 billion yuan ($12.6 billion) failed to impress, however. Growth in the company's online advertising business slowed amid rising trade tensions between the United States and China.The environment is "challenging" for the advertising business, Tencent Chairman and CEO Ma Huateng said in a statement. "We expect the negative impact from the current business environment will persist in the second half of 2019."China's economy is growing at the slowest pace in nearly three decades as it feels the effects of a prolonged trade war with the United States. Data published this week point to continued weakness.Alex Wong, director of asset management at Ample Capital in Hong Kong, said the country's carmakers, real estate companies and financial services firms were spending less on ads as a result of the slowdown."China's economic downturn is taking a toll on Tencent, because companies impacted by the slowdown spend less money on advertising," he said. "Advertising is a big part of its revenue source."Tencent also said that its media advertising revenues dropped 7%, partly because some TV drama series were delayed because of government restrictions on content.Following the earnings announcement, several analysts downgraded their target prices for Tencent's stock."The smartphone game momentum is not enough to offset the softness in advertising revenue growth," Citi analysts explained as they cut their target price.TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Broad-based selling left both S&P 500 and Russell 2000 down 2.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 3.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 3.0%.The stock market began the day sharply lower, giving back a bulk of yesterday's advance, after data out of China and Germany continued to weaken. China reported its slowest industrial production growth since 2002, and Germany reported a 0.1% qtr/qtr decline in Q2 GDP. Understandably, investors rushed to safe-haven assets such as gold ($1527.80/oz, +$13.70, +0.9%) and U.S. Treasuries, while equities steadily declined throughout the day.In turn, the yield on the 10-yr note fell below the yield on the 2-yr note for the first time since 2007, representing an inversion that has preceded each recession since 1980. The average length of time between the first inversion and the start of each recession since 1980 has averaged 18 months, with the range being as little as ten months to as many as two years.Despite this historical time-cushion, it was risk-off on Wall Street with all 11 S&P 500 sectors finishing lower. The energy (-4.1%) and financials (-3.6%) sectors led the broader retreat amid steep declines in oil prices ($55.01/bbl, -$2.03, -3.6%) and U.S. Treasury yields. The utilities sector (-0.9%) was the only sector that didn't finish lower by at least 1.0%.The 2-yr yield fell nine basis points to 1.58%, and the 10-yr yield fell ten basis points to 1.58%. Interestingly, the 30-yr yield hit a record low at 2.02% before finishing the session down 11 basis points at 2.03%. The U.S. Dollar Index held firm, advancing 0.2% to 98.04.It should be noted that the 2s-10s yield spread did not remain inverted during the session. Still, the yield curve had been steadily flattening all year and investors weren't given any reason today to expect a change of course. The yield-curve flattening undercut shares of Citigroup (C 61.41, -3.42, -5.3%), Bank of America (BAC 26.42, -1.30, -4.7%), and JPMorgan Chase (JPM 104.80, -4.54, -4.2%).Separately, Macy's (M 16.80, -2.56, -13.2%) provided disappointing earnings and guidance, which sent shares down 13.2% and put additional pressure on the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 38.42, -1.68, -4.2%).Reviewing Wednesday's economic data, which included Import and Export Prices for July and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index:Import prices rose 0.2% m/m in July, but declined 0.1% excluding fuel. On a yr/yr basis, all import prices were down 1.8%, versus up 4.8% for the 12 months ending in July 2018, while nonfuel import prices declined 1.3% versus a 1.4% increase for the 12 months ending in July 2018.Export prices were up 0.2% m/m in July. Excluding agricultural exports, prices were also up 0.2%. On a yr/yr basis, all export prices were down 0.9%, versus up 4.3% for the 12 months ending in July 2018, while nonagricultural export prices were down 1.5%, versus up 5.0% for the 12 months ending in July 2018.The key takeaway from the report is that it doesn't show any inflation, which stands in contrast to the Consumer Price Index for July. Accordingly, it will only serve to confuse the market's perspective on the Fed's read of inflation trends.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index spiked 21.7% following a 5.3% increase in the prior week.Investors will receive the following economic data on Thursday: Retail Sales for July, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for July, the Empire State Manufacturing Survey for August, the Philadelphia Fed Index for August, the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report, the preliminary Productivity and Unit Labor Costs for the second quarter, Business Inventories for June, and Net Long-Term TIC Flows for June.16:19RPAY Repay Holdings reports Q2 results; guides FY19 (11.77 +0.03)Q2 EBITDA $10.4 mln, in-line with estimates; revenue +17% to $36.2 mln vs. $37.15 mln consensus.Card payment volume was $2.2 billion, an increase of 27% over the second quarter of 2018.

Big Tech Problems 'Mushrooming': Conservative Senators Slam Google Over Political BiasInsideSources.com, Washington, D.C.July 19, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 Distributed by Tribune Content AgencySection: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWSLength: 1396 wordsByline: Kate Patrick, InsideSources.com, Washington, D.C.BodyJuly 19--     Jul. 19--At the censorship hearing led by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) on Tuesday, conservative senators like Cruz, Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) slammed Google for how it moderates content and prioritizes search results, accusing the tech giant of political bias toward conservatives."It seems that the problems around Big Tech, as they mature as an industry, are just mushrooming," Blackburn said at the hearing. "And the biggest and the worst offenders, unfortunately for you all, people put Google at the top of the list."Blackburn, Cruz and Hawley are three of Big Tech's biggest critics in the Senate, along with Democrat senators Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). Last month, Hawley introduced a bill to the Senate that would force tech companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter to moderate content in a "politically neutral" way, or else lose their Section 230 protections.Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act shields tech companies from legal liability if users post illegal or "lewd" content on their platforms. While tech companies are legally obligated to take down lewd and unlawful content, they cannot be held legally liable for the actions of their users under Section 230. Hawley has called this a "sweetheart deal" for Big Tech that allows them to profit off of questionable content and questionable business practices.Many conservatives believe Big Tech targets them for censorship because leadership in the Big Tech companies tends to lean left. Some conservatives claim that they are more frequently banned or censored than their liberal counterparts, although not all conservatives agree that Big Tech is politically biased.Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) pushed back on the idea that Google is biased against conservatives, pointing out that even though PragerU (a witness at the hearing) claims that YouTube unfairly restricts its videos for their conservative worldview, Google's data shows that YouTube restricts a much higher percentage of videos from very liberal channels like The Young Turks, Democracy Now and Last Week Tonight.Instead of focusing on conservative censorship claims, Hirono honed in on other perceived problems with Google's user and content moderation policies. In particular, Hirono pressed Google on why YouTube hasn't taken down a violent, graphic video of an active shooter."What possible explanation does Google have for why this video slipped through the cracks and remained on YouTube since August 2015?" she asked.Google Vice President for Government Affairs and Public Policy Karan Bhatia replied that it depends on if the video is news coverage or not, but didn't provide a concrete answer.Hirono's line of questioning fed into the overall narrative of the hearing that Google frequently makes errors, mistakes and questionable decisions -- intentional or otherwise -- when moderating content across its platforms.Blackburn then pressed Google on how the company recommends videos and search results."On Monday you claimed in an op-ed that Google is not politically biased," she said. "If you want us to believe that Google is an equal opportunity search engine and not an equal opportunity offender, let me clarify exactly what an equal playing field would look like for you all at Google: Google should equally promote video reporting in its search results whether the article is from CNN or Fox News. Shouldn't Google equally promote news articles in its search results whether they're from The Huffington Post or Breitbart?"Bhatia didn't answer directly, instead replying that "What gets surfaced is what's most responsive. ... We try to prioritize what's most relevant and authoritative."Cruz and Hawley took these answers to mean that the decision-makers at Google must decide what's most relevant or authoritative, and if Google is a more ideologically liberal company, then that means Google -- at the very least -- is implicitly biased against conservatives."Despite the fact that almost exclusively your executives donate to one political party --I think 1 percent went to Trump in 2016 -- it is your testimony that you never use content moderation to advance an ideological agenda, is that correct?" Hawley asked."Yes, Senator," Bhatia said. "It is contrary to our mission and contrary to our business interest. Which is why we've had third party studies demonstrate that we do not have political bias.""Except when you're in China," Hawley replied quickly. "You're happy to censor in China and censor away any mention of Tiananmen Square, help them control the information flow, wouldn't you call that censorship with an ideological agenda?"Bhatia didn't provide a direct answer, instead referring Hawley to the fact that Google exited the China market in 2010. He also reiterated that Project Dragonfly -- the censored, Chinese-government-controlled version of a Google search engine that Google was working with China to launch -- is definitely "terminated," despite The Intercept's report in March that the project is secretly ongoing.The indirect answers didn't satisfy Hawley, especially because Bhatia would not verbally commit to a third-party audit of Google's content moderation practices and search result and video recommendation practices."You've been more than willing to engage in ideological censorship in the largest market in the world, you have been more than happy to partner with the most oppressive authoritarian regime on the planet, all for profits, whatever it is that's good for Google, why would anyone believe you now when you won't commit to a third-party audit, you won't commit to me that you won't engage in censorship when it suits your purposes, why would anyone believe you now when you say we don't ever impose an ideological agenda, what assurances can you give us?" Hawley said.Cruz then called for "real numbers and hard data" about Google's algorithms and a "strong third party audit with no bias." He also called for the average ad rate Google charged the Trump campaign versus the Clinton campaign in 2016.Cruz also chastised Google for how the company handled internal backlash regarding its artificial intelligence (AI) ethics board. (One selected person for the board, a conservative African-American woman, Kay Coles James, worked for conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation and opposed LGBT rights and progressive climate change efforts, so Google employees called for her to be removed, and Google ended up dissolving the board completely. Bhatia also previously worked for the Heritage Foundation.)"Do you understand that when you see that kind of bias saying, a conservative African-American woman's views are not valid and not worthy of inclusion, the American people would say, these guys are silencing voices they disagree with?" Cruz asked.Bhatia reiterated that it didn't make sense for Google to alienate conservatives because losing user trust "would be damaging to our business.""We are a diverse group of people with many different views, but we do recognize there could be challenges with implicit bias, and that's precisely the reason we construct our search engines and platforms in such a way that bias does not get built in, and core to that is the system of making sure that any change in the algorithm is run based through a rating system which consists of thousands of people throughout the US in 49 states and any change would need to be reviewed by all of them," Bhatia said.But Blumenthal, a Democrat, pushed back on Bhatia's assertion that there isn't anything wrong with Google's algorithms, pointing out that conservative commentators on YouTube -- like Alex Jones of InfoWars -- have harassed families whose children died in the Sandy Hook Massacre, claiming that the massacre never happened."This stuff is not speech. It's harassment, defamation," Blumenthal said. "I would suggest whatever your machines are, they're not working."Despite the scrutiny, no Democrats or Republicans have introduced a bill or signaled that they're planning to introduce a bill to deal with the problems they see with Big Tech, other than Hawley's bill, which both conservatives and liberals condemned.Follow Kate on Twitter___ (c)2019 InsideSources.com, Washington, D.C.

The year-over-year decrease in advertising services gross profit was primarily due to decreased revenue contribution based on the evolving competitive macro-environment, and increased expenses related to staff and content purchases.The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases in innovative businesses and others gross profit were primarily due to increased net revenues fromNetEaseCloud Music,NetEase CC andYoudao Online Education, as well as better cost controls.Gross Profit/ (Loss) MarginGross profit margin for online game services for the second quarter of 2019 was 63.1%, compared to 63.7% and 64.3% for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2018, respectively. The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year decreases in gross profit margin were mainly due to higher royalty fees and revenue sharing costs recognized for certain mobile games.Gross profit margin for e-commerce for the second quarter of 2019 was 10.9%, compared to 10.2% and 10.1% for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2018, respectively. The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases in gross profit margin were primarily due to increased sales volume ofKaolaandYanxuan, as well as continuously improved procurement and operation processes.Gross profit margin for advertising services for the second quarter of 2019 was 55.5%, compared to 49.5% and 67.0% for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2018, respectively. The quarter-over-quarter increase in advertising services gross profit margin was primarily due to seasonality. The year-over-year decrease in advertising services gross profit margin was primarily due to decreased revenue contribution resulting from the evolving competitive macro-environment, and increased expenses related to staff and content purchases.Gross profit margin for innovative businesses and others for the second quarter of 2019 was 1.4%, compared to gross loss margin of 13.1% and 7.3% for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2018, respectively.

The quarter-over-quarter decrease in operating expenses was mainly due to a slight decrease in staff-related costs, partially offset by increased marketing expenditures related to online game services. The year-over-year decrease in operating expenses was mainly due to decreased marketing expenditures related to NetEase's online game services and e-commerce businesses, partially offset by increased staff-related costs. Shipping and handling costs included in selling and marketing expenses for the second quarter of 2019 were RMB388.2 million (US$56.6 million), compared to RMB404.6 million and RMB386.6 million for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2018, respectively.  Income TaxesThe Company recorded a net income tax charge of RMB685.2 million (US$99.8 million) for the second quarter of 2019, compared to RMB1,269.0 million and RMB420.5 million for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2018, respectively. The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2019 was 18.0%, compared to 34.0% and 15.7% for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2018, respectively. The lower effective tax rate in the second quarter of 2019 compared to the preceding quarter was mainly due to reduced losses from certain subsidiaries as well as tax credits recognized for certain subsidiaries of the Company.Net Income After TaxNet income attributable to the Company's shareholders for the second quarter of 2019 totaled RMB3,071.4 million (US$447.4 million), compared to RMB2,382.1 million and RMB2,106.5 million for the preceding quarter and the second quarter of 2018, respectively.

The changes in foreign exchange gains and losses were mainly due to unrealized exchange gains and losses arising from the Company's U.S. dollar-denominated bank deposits and short-term loan balances as the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the RMB fluctuated over the periods, as well as certain foreign currency transactions.NetEase reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$3.47 and US$3.44, respectively, for the second quarter of 2019.

It is also expected that such repurchases will be affected pursuant to a plan in conformity with SEC Rule 10b5-1.

Translations of amounts from RMB into United States dollars for the convenience of the reader were calculated at the noon buying rate of US$1.00 = RMB6.8650 on June 28, 2019 as set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board. No representation is made that the RMB amounts could have been, or could be, converted into US$ at that rate on June 28, 2019, or at any other certain date. The percentages stated are calculated based on RMB.Change in Segment ReportingEffective as of December 31, 2018, the Company renamed its "e-mail and others" segment to "innovative businesses and others" to better articulate the businesses included in this segment, there's no change to the business mix included in this segment. The Company now reports four reporting segments: online game services, e-commerce, advertising services and innovative businesses and others, and retrospectively revised prior period segment information to conform to current period presentation.Impact of the Recently Adopted Major Accounting PronouncementIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 "Leases" as amended, which generally requires lessees to recognize operating and financing lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets on the balance sheet and to provide enhanced disclosures surrounding the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leasing arrangements. The Company adopted the new standard effective January 1, 2019 on a modified retrospective basis and did not restate comparative periods. The Company recognized approximately RMB861.5 million as total right-of-use assets as well as total lease liabilities for the operating leases on its consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2019. The Company recognized RMB709.5 million and RMB746.3 million as total right-of-use assets and total lease liabilities, respectively, for the operating leases on its consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2019. Right-of-use assets are included in other long-term assets, and lease liabilities are included in accrual liabilities and other payables and other long-term payables, respectively based on payment terms on the consolidated balance sheet. Other than the foregoing, the Company does not expect the new standard to have a material impact on the net assets of the Company's consolidated financial statements.Conference CallNetEase's management team will host a teleconference call with simultaneous webcast at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday, August 7, 2019 (Beijing/Hong Kong Time: 9:00 a.m., Thursday, August 8, 2019).

These statements are made under the "safe harbor" provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these forward-looking statements by terminology such as "will," "expects," "anticipates," "future," "intends," "plans," "believes," "estimates" and similar statements. The accuracy of these statements may be impacted by a number of business risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or anticipated, including risks related to: the risk that the online game market will not continue to grow or that NetEase will not be able to maintain its leading position in that market within China or globally, which could occur if, for example, its new online games or expansion packs and other improvements to its existing games do not become as popular as management anticipates; the ability of NetEase to effectively market its games and other services and achieve a positive return on its marketing expenditures; the risk that changes in Chinese government regulation of the online game market and the market for NetEase's e-commerce businesses may limit future growth of NetEase's revenues or cause revenues to decline; the risk that NetEase may not be able to continuously develop new and creative online services or that NetEase will not be able to set, or follow in a timely manner, trends in the market; the risk that the e-commerce market or the internet advertising market in China will not continue to grow and will remain subject to intense competition and the risk that investments by us in our e-commerce platforms and related services or in our advertising content and services may not increase the appeal of our websites, e-commerce platforms or mobile applications among users or result in increased e-commerce or advertising revenues; the risk that NetEase will not be able to control its expenses in future periods; competition in NetEase's existing and potential markets; governmental uncertainties (including possible changes in the effective tax rates applicable to NetEase and its subsidiaries and affiliates and the ability of NetEase to receive and maintain approvals of the preferential tax treatments); the risk that fluctuations in the value of the Renminbi with respect to other currencies could adversely affect NetEase's business and financial results; and other risks outlined in NetEase's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. NetEase does not undertake any obligation to update this forward-looking information, except as required under the applicable law.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresNetEase considers and uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS, as supplemental metrics in reviewing and assessing its operating performance and formulating its business plan. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP").NetEase defines non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders as net income attributable to the Company's shareholders excluding share-based compensation expenses. Non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders enables NetEase's management to assess its operating results without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses, which are non-cash charges. NetEase believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating the Company's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose. NetEase also believes that the use of this non-GAAP financial measure facilitates investors' assessment of its operating performance.Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders is that it does not reflect all items of expense that affect our operations. Share-based compensation expenses have been and may continue to be incurred in our business and are not reflected in the presentation of non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures NetEase uses may differ from the non-GAAP measures used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited.NetEase compensates for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance. See "Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results" at the end of this press release. NetEase encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. Contact for Media and Investors:Margaret ShiNetEase,

300-Million-Yuan Income on the First Day Launch, Ping An Good Doctor's Private Doctor Recognized by the MarketPR NewswireAugust 15, 2019 Thursday 3:51 AM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1034 wordsDateline: SHANGHAI, Aug. 15, 2019 BodyPR NewswirePing An Good Doctor reached comprehensive cooperation agreements with 29 enterprises, such as China Mobile Internet, BAIC Group, and China CITIC Bank. On the first day of launch, total contract amount exceeded 300 million yuan. The world's largest online healthcare platform Ping An Healthcare and Technology Company Limited, as known as Ping An Good Doctor, held a strategy press conference to officially launch its strategic product - Ping An Good Doctor Private Doctor on 13 August in Shanghai. On the first day launching, Ping An Good Doctor has entered into strategic partnership with 29 world's leading industry giants including China Mobile Internet, BAIC Group, and China CITIC Bank, etc. The 29 enterprises operate in such industries as banking, insurance, automobile, communications, maternity, etc. and the total contract amount exceeded RMB300 million.This private doctor service launched by Ping An Good Doctor is of epoch-making significance to both the company and the internet healthcare industry. Private doctor service allows doctors and users to smoothly complete all-round interactions, and become acquaintances who are closely connected with deep trust. Thanks to the brand-new acquaintance, doctors can track in the long run the users' health conditions and the user will be able to obtain precision, continuous and individual medical and healthcare service, breaking the "unfamiliar" relationship between doctors and patients in the traditional medical scenario.Ping An Good Doctor has transformed from free online service to paid membership service by launching such private doctor service. In the meantime, the Chinese government is making the policy on internet healthcare service charges and reimbursement by Social Health Insurance and will officially release it according to the schedule. According to the latest research report of HSBC Securities, internet healthcare service charges and reimbursement by Social Health Insurance will benefit Ping An Good Doctor, and the Company will enjoy good prospects in the second half of this year.First Day of Launch of Private Doctor,Ping An Good DoctorLeading theTrend ofNewHealthcareEraArtificial intelligence (AI) technology is extensively used in the healthcare industry these years, and people's healthcare ideas, experiences and demands have changed greatly. How to seize the first chances in the new healthcare era with "new experience, new concept, new technology, and new ecosystem" as the core? This is a question every player in the healthcare area is thinking about.The private doctor service recently launched by Ping An Good Doctor is tailored for users based on the changes of current new technology and new idea. With characteristics of "excellence, professionalism, efficiency, management and security", Ping An Good Doctor - Private Doctor can offer all-round high-quality medical and healthcare services for children, adults, and the elderly, provide users with new experiences, and bring to users in more scenarios through the expanding "Healthcare+" ecosystem.Ping An Good Doctor - Private Doctor currently provides users not only with such basic services as online consultation, day-to-day health management, and clinical reservation, but also all-round one-stop high-quality healthcare services including 7x24 all-time nursing, to-the-second doctor service response, one-hour to-the-door delivery of medicine, and accompanied visit to Grade III A hospitals, to users. Those quality healthcare services will not only be available to users of Ping An Good Doctor, but also benefit the broad middle class at home and abroad by way of cooperation.Behind the quality services is the expert group of Ping An Good Doctor comprising renowned doctors in the respective fields from the top 100 reputable hospitals across the country. Ping An Good Doctor has established deep cooperation with 800 domestic Grade IIIA hospitals, 1,000 renowned doctors from abroad, and the world's top 10 hospitals, to ensure handy and accurate medical service to users across the globe."Milestone" leap forward to lead the industry into the "fast and steady" development stageThose who embrace changes will always win, which is no exception in any area. The launch of Ping An Good Doctor · Private Doctor represents the endless courage of Ping An Good Doctor in exploring the future of internet healthcare and a milestone in the global internet healthcare industry.As we all know, China has introduced a number of important documents in recent years to encourage internet healthcare development and solve the current supply-side issues. TheKey Tasks for Deepening the Reform of the Medical and Healthcare System in 2019released this June shows that the internet healthcare is expected to be officially included in the reimbursement by Social Health Insurance, and demonstrates China's resolution to develop the internet healthcare. Under such background, China's internet healthcare industry will usher in another round of great development.And who can be the "bellwether" of the industry to lead the industry towards a healthier and more orderly direction under such circumstances? Ping An Good Doctor reaffirms its industry leadership by launching the private doctor service. The service does not only herald that paid membership service is a future industry trend, but also indicates that such service has already been possible.On the other hand, the "Healthcare+" ecosystem of Ping An Good Doctor is further expanded through the private doctor service. Most of the 29 partners are not "old friends" of Ping An Good Doctor, but are in broader and more diversified industries, including automobile, communication, maternity, and drug retail, etc., which shows that in addition to the cooperation with third-party commercial insurance companies and financial institutions, Ping An Good Doctor is making an important expansion of its multi-channel development through such brand-new and strategic private doctor service. View original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/300-million-yuan-income-on-the-first-day-launch-ping-an-good-doctors-private-doctor-recognized-by-the-market-300902317.htmlSOURCE Ping An Good DoctorCONTACT: Barney Liu, Ping An Good Doctor, +86-147-1440-0858, liumingyi855@pingan.com.cn; Amber Cheng, Wonderful Sky Financial Group Limited, +852-3641-1332, amberchengl@wsfg.hkLoad-Date: August 16, 2019End of Document

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -53.60. The S&P 500 futures trade 14 points below fair value.Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region were relatively mixed on Friday following an otherwise good week for most markets. Today's mixed disposition was attributed in part to a wait-and-see attitude in front of the release of the U.S. Employment Situation Report, which will have implications for the Fed's policy stance. Other factors in play included a preliminary estimate from Samsung Electronics that its second quarter profit was down 56% yr/yr, a stronger-than-expected household spending report for May out of Japan, and a South China Morning Post report indicating China won't buy agricultural goods from the U.S. if the U.S. "flip flops again in future trade negotiations."In economic data: Japan's May Household Spending +5.5% m/m (expected +1.2%, last -1.4%) and +4.0% yr/yr (expected +1.4%, last +1.3%); May Preliminary Leading Index 95.2 (expected 95.3, last 95.9)Australia's June AIG Construction Index 43.0 (last 40.4)---Equity Markets---Japan's Nikkei: +0.2% (+2.0% for the week)Hong Kong's Hang Seng: -0.1% (+0.8% for the week)China's Shanghai Composite: +0.2% (+1.1% for the week)India's Sensex: -1.0% (+0.3% for the week)South Korea's Kospi: +0.1% (-0.9% for the week)Australia's ASX All Ordinaries: +0.5% (+2.0% for the week)Major European indices are registering modest losses in front of the release of the U.S. Employment Situation Report. A decidedly disappointing Factory Orders report for May out of Germany, however, has been an early guide for the negative stance. Additionally, the news from Thursday that the British navy seized an Iranian oil tanker headed for Syria has fostered some geopolitical angst that is keeping buying efforts in check.In economic data (Thursday and Friday): Eurozone's May Retail Sales -0.3% m/m (expected +0.4%, last -0.1%) and +1.3% yr/yr (expected +1.6%, last +1.8%)Germany's May Factory Orders -2.2% m/m (expected -0.1%, last +0.4%); June Construction PMI 50.0 (expected 52.0, last 51.4)Switzerland's June CPI 0.0% m/m (expected -0.1%, last +0.3%) and +0.6% yr/yr (expected +0.5%, last +0.6%)France's May Trade Balance EUR -3.3B (expected EUR -5.7B, last EUR -4.9B)Spain's May Industrial Production +1.4% (expected +1.1%, last +1.8%); June Consumer Confidence 102.3 (expected 95.1, last 96.9)U.K.'s June Halifax House Price Index -0.3% m/m (expected +0.3%, last +0.4%) and +5.7% yr/yr (expected +5.4%, last +5.2%); Q1 Labor Productivity -0.5% (expected -0.6%, last +0.3%)---Equity Markets---STOXX Europe 600: -0.6%Germany's DAX: -0.6%U.K.'s FTSE 100: -0.6%France's CAC 40: -0.5%Italy's FTSE MIB: -0.4%Spain's IBEX 35: -0.6%08:35 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -4.90.

The prior month's increase was revised down to 72,000 from 75,000. Nonfarm private payrolls rose by 191,000 while the Briefing.com consensus expected an increase of 147,000. The previous month's increase was revised down to 83,000 from 90,000.Average hourly earnings increased 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%), while the previous month's increase was revised up to 0.3% from 0.2%. The average workweek was reported at 34.4 (Briefing.com consensus 34.4).

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -13.10.U.S. equity futures trade modestly lower with the S&P 500 futures trading four points below fair value.Given yesterday's holiday closure, today's session should see below average participation, though the market is likely to see some volatility surrounding the 8:30 ET release of the Employment Situation report for June. The Briefing.com consensus expects the report to show the addition of 160,000 nonfarm payrolls while average hourly earnings are expected to have increased 0.3%.The overnight session featured a mixed, but largely flat, showing from markets across Asia while European indices trade in the red. The greenback has extended its rebound, sending the U.S. Dollar Index higher by 0.2% to 96.95, which marks a fresh high for the week.South China Morning Post reported that the Chinese government wants more clarity regarding the Huawei situation before purchasing agricultural products from the U.S. On a related note, China's Commerce Ministry spokesman, Gao Feng, said that the U.S. must remove tariffs on imports from China in order to reach a trade deal.Treasuries trade in negative territory with the 10-yr yield rising one basis point to 1.96%.In U.S. corporate news:Vodafone (VOD 16.90, +0.40, +2.4%): +2.4% after Reuters reported that the company will receive EU antitrust approval to purchase Liberty Global (LBTYA 27.60, 0.00, 0.0%).Reviewing overnight developments:Asian markets ended mostly higher.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -57.20.The stock market is on track for a lower start as futures on the S&P 500 trade 14 points below fair value.Index futures held modest losses in early-morning trade, but they slid to lows after the release of a June Employment Situation report that was comfortably ahead of estimates. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 224,000 (Briefing.com consensus 160,000) while average hourly earnings grew 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).The stock market is finding the strong headline beat disappointing because it has led to a reduction in expectations for an aggressive rate cut at the July FOMC Meeting. The fed funds futures market now sees just an 8.0% implied likelihood of a 50-basis point rate cut in July, down from 29.2% on Wednesday. The fed funds futures market remains certain that a 25-basis point rate cut will take place on July 31.Treasuries retreated in response to today's data, sliding toward this week's lows.

The S&P 500 futures trade 14 points below fair value.Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region were relatively mixed on Friday following an otherwise good week for most markets. Today's mixed disposition was attributed in part to a wait-and-see attitude in front of the release of the U.S. Employment Situation Report, which will have implications for the Fed's policy stance. Other factors in play included a preliminary estimate from Samsung Electronics that its second quarter profit was down 56% yr/yr, a stronger-than-expected household spending report for May out of Japan, and a South China Morning Post report indicating China won't buy agricultural goods from the U.S. if the U.S. "flip flops again in future trade negotiations."In economic data: Japan's May Household Spending +5.5% m/m (expected +1.2%, last -1.4%) and +4.0% yr/yr (expected +1.4%, last +1.3%); May Preliminary Leading Index 95.2 (expected 95.3, last 95.9)Australia's June AIG Construction Index 43.0 (last 40.4)---Equity Markets---Japan's Nikkei: +0.2% (+2.0% for the week)Hong Kong's Hang Seng: -0.1% (+0.8% for the week)China's Shanghai Composite: +0.2% (+1.1% for the week)India's Sensex: -1.0% (+0.3% for the week)South Korea's Kospi: +0.1% (-0.9% for the week)Australia's ASX All Ordinaries: +0.5% (+2.0% for the week)Major European indices are registering modest losses in front of the release of the U.S. Employment Situation Report.

Other factors in play included a preliminary estimate from Samsung Electronics that its second quarter profit was down 56% yr/yr, a stronger-than-expected household spending report for May out of Japan, and a South China Morning Post report indicating China won't buy agricultural goods from the U.S. if the U.S. "flip flops again in future trade negotiations."In economic data: Japan's May Household Spending +5.5% m/m (expected +1.2%, last -1.4%) and +4.0% yr/yr (expected +1.4%, last +1.3%); May Preliminary Leading Index 95.2 (expected 95.3, last 95.9)Australia's June AIG Construction Index 43.0 (last 40.4)---Equity Markets---Japan's Nikkei: +0.2% (+2.0% for the week)Hong Kong's Hang Seng: -0.1% (+0.8% for the week)China's Shanghai Composite: +0.2% (+1.1% for the week)India's Sensex: -1.0% (+0.3% for the week)South Korea's Kospi: +0.1% (-0.9% for the week)Australia's ASX All Ordinaries: +0.5% (+2.0% for the week)Major European indices are registering modest losses in front of the release of the U.S. Employment Situation Report. A decidedly disappointing Factory Orders report for May out of Germany, however, has been an early guide for the negative stance. Additionally, the news from Thursday that the British navy seized an Iranian oil tanker headed for Syria has fostered some geopolitical angst that is keeping buying efforts in check.In economic data (Thursday and Friday): Eurozone's May Retail Sales -0.3% m/m (expected +0.4%, last -0.1%) and +1.3% yr/yr (expected +1.6%, last +1.8%)Germany's May Factory Orders -2.2% m/m (expected -0.1%, last +0.4%); June Construction PMI 50.0 (expected 52.0, last 51.4)Switzerland's June CPI 0.0% m/m (expected -0.1%, last +0.3%) and +0.6% yr/yr (expected +0.5%, last +0.6%)France's May Trade Balance EUR -3.3B (expected EUR -5.7B, last EUR -4.9B)Spain's May Industrial Production +1.4% (expected +1.1%, last +1.8%); June Consumer Confidence 102.3 (expected 95.1, last 96.9)U.K.'s June Halifax House Price Index -0.3% m/m (expected +0.3%, last +0.4%) and +5.7% yr/yr (expected +5.4%, last +5.2%); Q1 Labor Productivity -0.5% (expected -0.6%, last +0.3%)---Equity Markets---STOXX Europe 600: -0.6%Germany's DAX: -0.6%U.K.'s FTSE 100: -0.6%France's CAC 40: -0.5%Italy's FTSE MIB: -0.4%Spain's IBEX 35: -0.6%08:35 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -4.90.

The fed funds futures market remains certain that a 25-basis point rate cut will take place on July 31.Treasuries retreated in response to today's data, sliding toward this week's lows. The 10-yr yield is up seven basis points at 2.02% while the 2-yr yield is up eight basis points at 1.84%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.4% at 97.12, with its 50-day moving average (97.26) looming not far above.Market participants will not receive any more data today, and investor participation is expected to decrease throughout the session.08:56 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -13.90.

The S&P 500 futures trade 14 points below fair value.Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region were relatively mixed on Friday following an otherwise good week for most markets. Today's mixed disposition was attributed in part to a wait-and-see attitude in front of the release of the U.S. Employment Situation Report, which will have implications for the Fed's policy stance. Other factors in play included a preliminary estimate from Samsung Electronics that its second quarter profit was down 56% yr/yr, a stronger-than-expected household spending report for May out of Japan, and a South China Morning Post report indicating China won't buy agricultural goods from the U.S. if the U.S. "flip flops again in future trade negotiations."In economic data: Japan's May Household Spending +5.5% m/m (expected +1.2%, last -1.4%) and +4.0% yr/yr (expected +1.4%, last +1.3%); May Preliminary Leading Index 95.2 (expected 95.3, last 95.9)Australia's June AIG Construction Index 43.0 (last 40.4)---Equity Markets---Japan's Nikkei: +0.2% (+2.0% for the week)Hong Kong's Hang Seng: -0.1% (+0.8% for the week)China's Shanghai Composite: +0.2% (+1.1% for the week)India's Sensex: -1.0% (+0.3% for the week)South Korea's Kospi: +0.1% (-0.9% for the week)Australia's ASX All Ordinaries: +0.5% (+2.0% for the week)Major European indices are registering modest losses in front of the release of the U.S. Employment Situation Report.

Nonfarm payrolls increased by 224,000 (Briefing.com consensus 160,000) while average hourly earnings grew 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).The stock market is finding the strong headline beat disappointing because it has led to a reduction in expectations for an aggressive rate cut at the July FOMC Meeting. The fed funds futures market now sees just an 8.0% implied likelihood of a 50-basis point rate cut in July, down from 29.2% on Wednesday. The fed funds futures market remains certain that a 25-basis point rate cut will take place on July 31.Treasuries retreated in response to today's data, sliding toward this week's lows.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -53.60. The S&P 500 futures trade 14 points below fair value.Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region were relatively mixed on Friday following an otherwise good week for most markets. Today's mixed disposition was attributed in part to a wait-and-see attitude in front of the release of the U.S. Employment Situation Report, which will have implications for the Fed's policy stance. Other factors in play included a preliminary estimate from Samsung Electronics that its second quarter profit was down 56% yr/yr, a stronger-than-expected household spending report for May out of Japan, and a South China Morning Post report indicating China won't buy agricultural goods from the U.S. if the U.S. "flip flops again in future trade negotiations."In economic data: Japan's May Household Spending +5.5% m/m (expected +1.2%, last -1.4%) and +4.0% yr/yr (expected +1.4%, last +1.3%); May Preliminary Leading Index 95.2 (expected 95.3, last 95.9)Australia's June AIG Construction Index 43.0 (last 40.4)---Equity Markets---Japan's Nikkei: +0.2% (+2.0% for the week)Hong Kong's Hang Seng: -0.1% (+0.8% for the week)China's Shanghai Composite: +0.2% (+1.1% for the week)India's Sensex: -1.0% (+0.3% for the week)South Korea's Kospi: +0.1% (-0.9% for the week)Australia's ASX All Ordinaries: +0.5% (+2.0% for the week)Major European indices are registering modest losses in front of the release of the U.S. Employment Situation Report. A decidedly disappointing Factory Orders report for May out of Germany, however, has been an early guide for the negative stance. Additionally, the news from Thursday that the British navy seized an Iranian oil tanker headed for Syria has fostered some geopolitical angst that is keeping buying efforts in check.In economic data (Thursday and Friday): Eurozone's May Retail Sales -0.3% m/m (expected +0.4%, last -0.1%) and +1.3% yr/yr (expected +1.6%, last +1.8%)Germany's May Factory Orders -2.2% m/m (expected -0.1%, last +0.4%); June Construction PMI 50.0 (expected 52.0, last 51.4)Switzerland's June CPI 0.0% m/m (expected -0.1%, last +0.3%) and +0.6% yr/yr (expected +0.5%, last +0.6%)France's May Trade Balance EUR -3.3B (expected EUR -5.7B, last EUR -4.9B)Spain's May Industrial Production +1.4% (expected +1.1%, last +1.8%); June Consumer Confidence 102.3 (expected 95.1, last 96.9)U.K.'s June Halifax House Price Index -0.3% m/m (expected +0.3%, last +0.4%) and +5.7% yr/yr (expected +5.4%, last +5.2%); Q1 Labor Productivity -0.5% (expected -0.6%, last +0.3%)---Equity Markets---STOXX Europe 600: -0.6%Germany's DAX: -0.6%U.K.'s FTSE 100: -0.6%France's CAC 40: -0.5%Italy's FTSE MIB: -0.4%Spain's IBEX 35: -0.6%08:35 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -4.90.

However, the PHLX Semiconductor Index followed Monday's opening surge with a retreat that is continuing today. The PHLX Semiconductor Index is down 1.1% today, and is now down 0.3% for the week.

The S&P 500 trades lower by 0.6% with ten out of eleven sectors in the red.Rate-sensitive groups are among the early laggards.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -57.20.The stock market is on track for a lower start as futures on the S&P 500 trade 14 points below fair value.Index futures held modest losses in early-morning trade, but they slid to lows after the release of a June Employment Situation report that was comfortably ahead of estimates. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 224,000 (Briefing.com consensus 160,000) while average hourly earnings grew 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).The stock market is finding the strong headline beat disappointing because it has led to a reduction in expectations for an aggressive rate cut at the July FOMC Meeting. The fed funds futures market now sees just an 8.0% implied likelihood of a 50-basis point rate cut in July, down from 29.2% on Wednesday. The fed funds futures market remains certain that a 25-basis point rate cut will take place on July 31.Treasuries retreated in response to today's data, sliding toward this week's lows. The 10-yr yield is up seven basis points at 2.02% while the 2-yr yield is up eight basis points at 1.84%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.4% at 97.12, with its 50-day moving average (97.26) looming not far above.Market participants will not receive any more data today, and investor participation is expected to decrease throughout the session.08:56 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -13.90. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -53.60. The S&P 500 futures trade 14 points below fair value.Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region were relatively mixed on Friday following an otherwise good week for most markets. Today's mixed disposition was attributed in part to a wait-and-see attitude in front of the release of the U.S. Employment Situation Report, which will have implications for the Fed's policy stance. Other factors in play included a preliminary estimate from Samsung Electronics that its second quarter profit was down 56% yr/yr, a stronger-than-expected household spending report for May out of Japan, and a South China Morning Post report indicating China won't buy agricultural goods from the U.S. if the U.S. "flip flops again in future trade negotiations."In economic data: Japan's May Household Spending +5.5% m/m (expected +1.2%, last -1.4%) and +4.0% yr/yr (expected +1.4%, last +1.3%); May Preliminary Leading Index 95.2 (expected 95.3, last 95.9)Australia's June AIG Construction Index 43.0 (last 40.4)---Equity Markets---Japan's Nikkei: +0.2% (+2.0% for the week)Hong Kong's Hang Seng: -0.1% (+0.8% for the week)China's Shanghai Composite: +0.2% (+1.1% for the week)India's Sensex: -1.0% (+0.3% for the week)South Korea's Kospi: +0.1% (-0.9% for the week)Australia's ASX All Ordinaries: +0.5% (+2.0% for the week)Major European indices are registering modest losses in front of the release of the U.S. Employment Situation Report. A decidedly disappointing Factory Orders report for May out of Germany, however, has been an early guide for the negative stance. Additionally, the news from Thursday that the British navy seized an Iranian oil tanker headed for Syria has fostered some geopolitical angst that is keeping buying efforts in check.In economic data (Thursday and Friday): Eurozone's May Retail Sales -0.3% m/m (expected +0.4%, last -0.1%) and +1.3% yr/yr (expected +1.6%, last +1.8%)Germany's May Factory Orders -2.2% m/m (expected -0.1%, last +0.4%); June Construction PMI 50.0 (expected 52.0, last 51.4)Switzerland's June CPI 0.0% m/m (expected -0.1%, last +0.3%) and +0.6% yr/yr (expected +0.5%, last +0.6%)France's May Trade Balance EUR -3.3B (expected EUR -5.7B, last EUR -4.9B)Spain's May Industrial Production +1.4% (expected +1.1%, last +1.8%); June Consumer Confidence 102.3 (expected 95.1, last 96.9)U.K.'s June Halifax House Price Index -0.3% m/m (expected +0.3%, last +0.4%) and +5.7% yr/yr (expected +5.4%, last +5.2%); Q1 Labor Productivity -0.5% (expected -0.6%, last +0.3%)---Equity Markets---STOXX Europe 600: -0.6%Germany's DAX: -0.6%U.K.'s FTSE 100: -0.6%France's CAC 40: -0.5%Italy's FTSE MIB: -0.4%Spain's IBEX 35: -0.6%08:35 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -4.90.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -13.10.U.S. equity futures trade modestly lower with the S&P 500 futures trading four points below fair value.Given yesterday's holiday closure, today's session should see below average participation, though the market is likely to see some volatility surrounding the 8:30 ET release of the Employment Situation report for June. The Briefing.com consensus expects the report to show the addition of 160,000 nonfarm payrolls while average hourly earnings are expected to have increased 0.3%.The overnight session featured a mixed, but largely flat, showing from markets across Asia while European indices trade in the red. The greenback has extended its rebound, sending the U.S. Dollar Index higher by 0.2% to 96.95, which marks a fresh high for the week.South China Morning Post reported that the Chinese government wants more clarity regarding the Huawei situation before purchasing agricultural products from the U.S. On a related note, China's Commerce Ministry spokesman, Gao Feng, said that the U.S. must remove tariffs on imports from China in order to reach a trade deal.Treasuries trade in negative territory with the 10-yr yield rising one basis point to 1.96%.In U.S. corporate news:Vodafone (VOD 16.90, +0.40, +2.4%): +2.4% after Reuters reported that the company will receive EU antitrust approval to purchase Liberty Global (LBTYA 27.60, 0.00, 0.0%).Reviewing overnight developments:Asian markets ended mostly higher.

The S&P 500 is lower by 0.3% while the Dow (-0.2%) sits a bit closer to its flat line.Equity indices have spent the first half of the session in negative territory after the Employment Situation report for June easily exceeded estimates. The report pointed to the addition of 224,000 nonfarm payrolls (Briefing.com consensus 160,000), which reduced expectations for a sharp rate cut.Granted, the market still expects that 25-basis point rate cut will take place at the July FOMC meeting, but the implied probability of a 50-basis point cut fell to near zero (5.9%) from 29.2% on Wednesday.The reduction in rate cut hopes pressured stocks from freshly-set record highs, but the past two hours have seen a steady rebound off session lows.Nine out of eleven sectors remain in negative territory with consumer staples (-0.8%) and industrials (-0.8%) at the bottom of the leaderboard. Transport stocks contributed to early weakness in the industrials sector, but the high-beta group has taken part in the market's recent rebound, trimming its loss to 0.6%. This leaves the Dow Jones Transportation Average unchanged for the week.Another high-beta group-PHLX Semiconductor Index-has struggled to keep pace with the rebound in the broader market. The Index is down 0.9% today and it is now down 0.1% for the week after being up 5.0% on Monday morning. The broader technology sector (-0.5%), meanwhile, trades a bit behind the broader market.Biotech names are under pressure after President Trump said that his administration is preparing a "favored-nations clause" that would reduce the prices that Medicare pays for drugs. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB 109.41, -1.52, -1.4%) is down 1.4%.On the upside, financials (+0.4%) have shown relative strength thanks to an uptick in Treasury yields. The sector has extended this week's gain to 1.9%.Treasuries trade a bit above their lows with the 10-yr yield up nine basis points at 2.04%.Reviewing the June Employment Situation Report:June nonfarm payrolls increased by 224,000 (Briefing.com consensus 160,000). Over the past three months, job gains have averaged 171,000 per month. May nonfarm payrolls revised to 72,000 from 75,000 June private sector payrolls increased by 191,000 (Briefing.com consensus 147,000) while May private sector payrolls revised to 83,000 from 90,000 June unemployment rate was 3.7% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%), versus 3.6% in May Persons unemployed for 27 weeks or more accounted for 23.7% of the unemployed versus 22.4% in May The U6 unemployment rate, which accounts for unemployed and underemployed workers, was 7.2%, versus 7.1% in May June average hourly earnings were up 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%), after increasing an upwardly revised 0.3% (from 0.2%) in May Over the last 12 months, average hourly earnings have risen 3.1%, versus 3.2% for the 12 months ending in May The average workweek in June was 34.4 hours (Briefing.com consensus 34.4), unchanged from May Manufacturing workweek was up 0.1 hour to 40.7 hours Factory overtime was unchanged at 3.4 hours The labor force participation rate was 62.9% in June versus 62.8% in May ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1041/1808. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1262/1750.12:30 ETDow -65.74 at 26900.26, Nasdaq -39.81 at 8130.42, S&P -13.43 at 2982.39[BRIEFING.COM] Recent action saw an uptick, which has lifted the S&P 500 (-0.5%) to its opening level.Ten out of eleven sectors continue trading in the red, but the consumer discretionary space (-0.1%) is on the verge of turning positive.

Merck is one of the Dow's worst-performing components as pharmaceutical names slide after President Trump teased a 'favored nation' plan, which aims to allow the U.S. to purchase drugs based on the reduced prices that other countries pay.Conversely, UnitedHealth Group (UNH 247.79, +2.58) is the best-performing Dow component as managed health care names display relative strength in today's session.At current levels, the DJIA is poised to finish the week with gains of 1.2%.12:55 ETDow -52.63 at 26913.37, Nasdaq -30.62 at 8139.61, S&P -10.23 at 2985.59[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages hold modest losses at midday. The S&P 500 is lower by 0.3% while the Dow (-0.2%) sits a bit closer to its flat line.Equity indices have spent the first half of the session in negative territory after the Employment Situation report for June easily exceeded estimates. The report pointed to the addition of 224,000 nonfarm payrolls (Briefing.com consensus 160,000), which reduced expectations for a sharp rate cut.Granted, the market still expects that 25-basis point rate cut will take place at the July FOMC meeting, but the implied probability of a 50-basis point cut fell to near zero (5.9%) from 29.2% on Wednesday.The reduction in rate cut hopes pressured stocks from freshly-set record highs, but the past two hours have seen a steady rebound off session lows.Nine out of eleven sectors remain in negative territory with consumer staples (-0.8%) and industrials (-0.8%) at the bottom of the leaderboard. Transport stocks contributed to early weakness in the industrials sector, but the high-beta group has taken part in the market's recent rebound, trimming its loss to 0.6%. This leaves the Dow Jones Transportation Average unchanged for the week.Another high-beta group-PHLX Semiconductor Index-has struggled to keep pace with the rebound in the broader market. The Index is down 0.9% today and it is now down 0.1% for the week after being up 5.0% on Monday morning. The broader technology sector (-0.5%), meanwhile, trades a bit behind the broader market.Biotech names are under pressure after President Trump said that his administration is preparing a "favored-nations clause" that would reduce the prices that Medicare pays for drugs. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB 109.41, -1.52, -1.4%) is down 1.4%.On the upside, financials (+0.4%) have shown relative strength thanks to an uptick in Treasury yields. The sector has extended this week's gain to 1.9%.Treasuries trade a bit above their lows with the 10-yr yield up nine basis points at 2.04%.Reviewing the June Employment Situation Report:June nonfarm payrolls increased by 224,000 (Briefing.com consensus 160,000). Over the past three months, job gains have averaged 171,000 per month. May nonfarm payrolls revised to 72,000 from 75,000 June private sector payrolls increased by 191,000 (Briefing.com consensus 147,000) while May private sector payrolls revised to 83,000 from 90,000 June unemployment rate was 3.7% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%), versus 3.6% in May Persons unemployed for 27 weeks or more accounted for 23.7% of the unemployed versus 22.4% in May The U6 unemployment rate, which accounts for unemployed and underemployed workers, was 7.2%, versus 7.1% in May June average hourly earnings were up 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%), after increasing an upwardly revised 0.3% (from 0.2%) in May Over the last 12 months, average hourly earnings have risen 3.1%, versus 3.2% for the 12 months ending in May The average workweek in June was 34.4 hours (Briefing.com consensus 34.4), unchanged from May Manufacturing workweek was up 0.1 hour to 40.7 hours Factory overtime was unchanged at 3.4 hours The labor force participation rate was 62.9% in June versus 62.8% in May ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1041/1808. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1262/1750.12:30 ETDow -65.74 at 26900.26, Nasdaq -39.81 at 8130.42, S&P -13.43 at 2982.39[BRIEFING.COM] Recent action saw an uptick, which has lifted the S&P 500 (-0.5%) to its opening level.Ten out of eleven sectors continue trading in the red, but the consumer discretionary space (-0.1%) is on the verge of turning positive. Relative strength among retailers has contributed to the sector's rebound even though industry giant Amazon (AMZN 1936.90, -2.10, -0.1%) trades in-line with the sector.The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 42.84, +0.38, +0.9%) is up 0.9% with top holdings like L Brands (LB 27.84, +0.55, +2.0%), Guess? (GES 16.34, +0.38, +2.4%), and Rite Aid (RAD 8.78, +0.17, +2.0%) all showing gains of at least 2.0%.11:55 ETDow -121.69 at 26844.31, Nasdaq -53.28 at 8116.95, S&P -18.95 at 2976.87[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 (-0.6%) has spent the past hour inside a four-point range just below its mid-morning high.The market has faced broad-based selling pressure today, but nine out of eleven sectors remain on track to end the week on a higher note thanks to a strong showing leading up to the Independence Day Holiday.The communications sector (-0.4%; +2.2% week-to-date) has been this week's top performer, followed by real estate (-1.0%; +2.0% week-to-date), financials (+0.2%; +1.8% week-to-date), and technology (-0.8%; +1.6% week-to-date). On the flip side, energy (-0.5%; -1.5% week-to-date) and industrials (-1.1%; -0.5% week-to-date) are on track to end the week in negative territory.11:30 ETDow -143.77 at 26822.23, Nasdaq -51.54 at 8118.69, S&P -18.96 at 2976.86[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 (-0.6%) trades about ten points above its session low.The benchmark index was knocked down by falling rate cut expectations at the start of today's session, but it should be noted that the market is likely to continue reacting to the June Employment Situation report next week once participants who are vacationing today return to their desks.The market saw a spike in volume at the start of today's session, but activity has been slowing since then. As a result, only 174 million shares have changed hands at the NYSE floor so far.11:00 ETDow -188.11 at 26777.89, Nasdaq -66.80 at 8103.43, S&P -23.46 at 2972.36[BRIEFING.COM] Equity indices trade just above their recently established session lows. The S&P 500 is down 0.8%, trimming this week's gain to 1.1%.Countercyclical sectors remain near the bottom of the leaderboard, but the industrials sector (-1.5%) is now the second worst performer. Transport stocks have contributed to the weakness, as the Dow Jones Transportation Average falls 1.5%. All 20 index components trade in the red with 15 down at least 1.0%. Avis Budget (CAR 33.92, -0.95, -2.7%) is the group's weakest performer.Elsewhere, the greenback has continued climbing after the June Employment Situation report led to a reduction in rate cut expectations. The Dollar Index is up 0.7% at 97.41 with its June high (97.77) looming not far above.10:35 ETDow -189.76 at 26776.24, Nasdaq -70.58 at 8099.65, S&P -24.41 at 2971.41[BRIEFING.COM] Commodities are lower (-0.4% at 78.86 as measured by the Bloomberg Commodity IndexDollar index is higher (+0.6% at 97.39)Looking at energy:Aug WTI crude oil futures are now -$0.10 (-0.2%) at $57.24/barrel In other energy, Aug natural gas is +$0.11 (+5.0%) at $2.40/MMBtu, not seeing any clear driver yet (unlikely there actually is one for this move)Moving on to metals:Aug gold is currently -$28.25 (-2.0%) at $1392.65/oz, while Jul silver is -$0.38 (-2.5%) at $14.95/ozSept copper is now -$0.03 (-1.1%) at $2.65/lb ..NYSE Adv/Dec 715/2100. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1078/1850.10:00 ETDow -146.20 at 26819.8, Nasdaq -55.63 at 8114.6, S&P -19.47 at 2976.35[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue trading near their opening lows with the S&P 500 down 0.6%.Chipmakers started the week with a strong Monday rally in response to the trade truce between the United States and China.

While the price action has been positive, the outcome of today's session should be taken with a grain of salt. The market was closed yesterday, so it is highly likely that many portfolio managers worked a shortened day today or skipped the session altogether.Only 265 million shares have changed hands at the NYSE floor so far today.13:30 ETDow -47.12 at 26918.88, Nasdaq -17.23 at 8153, S&P -8.45 at 2987.37[BRIEFING.COM] The major U.S. indices are trading lower, but well off their session lows, as this morning's strong economic data slate dampens investors hopes for an interest rate cut in July.A look inside the Dow Jones Industrial Average shows that 3M (MMM 171.85, -3.13), Merck (MRK 85.90, -1.00), & Procter & Gamble (PG 112.89, -1.19) are underperforming. Merck is one of the Dow's worst-performing components as pharmaceutical names slide after President Trump teased a 'favored nation' plan, which aims to allow the U.S. to purchase drugs based on the reduced prices that other countries pay.Conversely, UnitedHealth Group (UNH 247.79, +2.58) is the best-performing Dow component as managed health care names display relative strength in today's session.At current levels, the DJIA is poised to finish the week with gains of 1.2%.12:55 ETDow -52.63 at 26913.37, Nasdaq -30.62 at 8139.61, S&P -10.23 at 2985.59[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages hold modest losses at midday. The S&P 500 is lower by 0.3% while the Dow (-0.2%) sits a bit closer to its flat line.Equity indices have spent the first half of the session in negative territory after the Employment Situation report for June easily exceeded estimates. The report pointed to the addition of 224,000 nonfarm payrolls (Briefing.com consensus 160,000), which reduced expectations for a sharp rate cut.Granted, the market still expects that 25-basis point rate cut will take place at the July FOMC meeting, but the implied probability of a 50-basis point cut fell to near zero (5.9%) from 29.2% on Wednesday.The reduction in rate cut hopes pressured stocks from freshly-set record highs, but the past two hours have seen a steady rebound off session lows.Nine out of eleven sectors remain in negative territory with consumer staples (-0.8%) and industrials (-0.8%) at the bottom of the leaderboard. Transport stocks contributed to early weakness in the industrials sector, but the high-beta group has taken part in the market's recent rebound, trimming its loss to 0.6%. This leaves the Dow Jones Transportation Average unchanged for the week.Another high-beta group-PHLX Semiconductor Index-has struggled to keep pace with the rebound in the broader market. The Index is down 0.9% today and it is now down 0.1% for the week after being up 5.0% on Monday morning. The broader technology sector (-0.5%), meanwhile, trades a bit behind the broader market.Biotech names are under pressure after President Trump said that his administration is preparing a "favored-nations clause" that would reduce the prices that Medicare pays for drugs. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB 109.41, -1.52, -1.4%) is down 1.4%.On the upside, financials (+0.4%) have shown relative strength thanks to an uptick in Treasury yields. The sector has extended this week's gain to 1.9%.Treasuries trade a bit above their lows with the 10-yr yield up nine basis points at 2.04%.Reviewing the June Employment Situation Report:June nonfarm payrolls increased by 224,000 (Briefing.com consensus 160,000). Over the past three months, job gains have averaged 171,000 per month. May nonfarm payrolls revised to 72,000 from 75,000 June private sector payrolls increased by 191,000 (Briefing.com consensus 147,000) while May private sector payrolls revised to 83,000 from 90,000 June unemployment rate was 3.7% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%), versus 3.6% in May Persons unemployed for 27 weeks or more accounted for 23.7% of the unemployed versus 22.4% in May The U6 unemployment rate, which accounts for unemployed and underemployed workers, was 7.2%, versus 7.1% in May June average hourly earnings were up 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%), after increasing an upwardly revised 0.3% (from 0.2%) in May Over the last 12 months, average hourly earnings have risen 3.1%, versus 3.2% for the 12 months ending in May The average workweek in June was 34.4 hours (Briefing.com consensus 34.4), unchanged from May Manufacturing workweek was up 0.1 hour to 40.7 hours Factory overtime was unchanged at 3.4 hours The labor force participation rate was 62.9% in June versus 62.8% in May ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1041/1808. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1262/1750.12:30 ETDow -65.74 at 26900.26, Nasdaq -39.81 at 8130.42, S&P -13.43 at 2982.39[BRIEFING.COM] Recent action saw an uptick, which has lifted the S&P 500 (-0.5%) to its opening level.Ten out of eleven sectors continue trading in the red, but the consumer discretionary space (-0.1%) is on the verge of turning positive. Relative strength among retailers has contributed to the sector's rebound even though industry giant Amazon (AMZN 1936.90, -2.10, -0.1%) trades in-line with the sector.The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 42.84, +0.38, +0.9%) is up 0.9% with top holdings like L Brands (LB 27.84, +0.55, +2.0%), Guess? (GES 16.34, +0.38, +2.4%), and Rite Aid (RAD 8.78, +0.17, +2.0%) all showing gains of at least 2.0%.11:55 ETDow -121.69 at 26844.31, Nasdaq -53.28 at 8116.95, S&P -18.95 at 2976.87[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 (-0.6%) has spent the past hour inside a four-point range just below its mid-morning high.The market has faced broad-based selling pressure today, but nine out of eleven sectors remain on track to end the week on a higher note thanks to a strong showing leading up to the Independence Day Holiday.The communications sector (-0.4%; +2.2% week-to-date) has been this week's top performer, followed by real estate (-1.0%; +2.0% week-to-date), financials (+0.2%; +1.8% week-to-date), and technology (-0.8%; +1.6% week-to-date). On the flip side, energy (-0.5%; -1.5% week-to-date) and industrials (-1.1%; -0.5% week-to-date) are on track to end the week in negative territory.11:30 ETDow -143.77 at 26822.23, Nasdaq -51.54 at 8118.69, S&P -18.96 at 2976.86[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 (-0.6%) trades about ten points above its session low.The benchmark index was knocked down by falling rate cut expectations at the start of today's session, but it should be noted that the market is likely to continue reacting to the June Employment Situation report next week once participants who are vacationing today return to their desks.The market saw a spike in volume at the start of today's session, but activity has been slowing since then. As a result, only 174 million shares have changed hands at the NYSE floor so far.11:00 ETDow -188.11 at 26777.89, Nasdaq -66.80 at 8103.43, S&P -23.46 at 2972.36[BRIEFING.COM] Equity indices trade just above their recently established session lows. The S&P 500 is down 0.8%, trimming this week's gain to 1.1%.Countercyclical sectors remain near the bottom of the leaderboard, but the industrials sector (-1.5%) is now the second worst performer. Transport stocks have contributed to the weakness, as the Dow Jones Transportation Average falls 1.5%. All 20 index components trade in the red with 15 down at least 1.0%. Avis Budget (CAR 33.92, -0.95, -2.7%) is the group's weakest performer.Elsewhere, the greenback has continued climbing after the June Employment Situation report led to a reduction in rate cut expectations. The Dollar Index is up 0.7% at 97.41 with its June high (97.77) looming not far above.10:35 ETDow -189.76 at 26776.24, Nasdaq -70.58 at 8099.65, S&P -24.41 at 2971.41[BRIEFING.COM] Commodities are lower (-0.4% at 78.86 as measured by the Bloomberg Commodity IndexDollar index is higher (+0.6% at 97.39)Looking at energy:Aug WTI crude oil futures are now -$0.10 (-0.2%) at $57.24/barrel In other energy, Aug natural gas is +$0.11 (+5.0%) at $2.40/MMBtu, not seeing any clear driver yet (unlikely there actually is one for this move)Moving on to metals:Aug gold is currently -$28.25 (-2.0%) at $1392.65/oz, while Jul silver is -$0.38 (-2.5%) at $14.95/ozSept copper is now -$0.03 (-1.1%) at $2.65/lb ..NYSE Adv/Dec 715/2100. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1078/1850.10:00 ETDow -146.20 at 26819.8, Nasdaq -55.63 at 8114.6, S&P -19.47 at 2976.35[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue trading near their opening lows with the S&P 500 down 0.6%.Chipmakers started the week with a strong Monday rally in response to the trade truce between the United States and China. However, the PHLX Semiconductor Index followed Monday's opening surge with a retreat that is continuing today. The PHLX Semiconductor Index is down 1.1% today, and is now down 0.3% for the week. The broader technology sector, for its part, is down 0.9%.Treasuries have dipped to fresh lows. The 10-yr yield is up ten basis points at 2.05%.09:45 ETDow -134.31 at 26831.69, Nasdaq -45.51 at 8124.72, S&P -17.42 at 2978.4[BRIEFING.COM] The stock market has started the day in negative territory amid losses in most sectors. The S&P 500 trades lower by 0.6% with ten out of eleven sectors in the red.Rate-sensitive groups are among the early laggards. Real estate (-1.6%), utilities (-1.3%), and consumer staples (-1.0%) sit at the bottom of the leaderboard. Conversely, financials (+0.3%) trade in the green as weakness in Treasuries boosts yields.Treasuries sit on their lows with the 10-yr yield up nine basis points at 2.04%.09:13 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -14.40. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -57.20.The stock market is on track for a lower start as futures on the S&P 500 trade 14 points below fair value.Index futures held modest losses in early-morning trade, but they slid to lows after the release of a June Employment Situation report that was comfortably ahead of estimates. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 224,000 (Briefing.com consensus 160,000) while average hourly earnings grew 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).The stock market is finding the strong headline beat disappointing because it has led to a reduction in expectations for an aggressive rate cut at the July FOMC Meeting. The fed funds futures market now sees just an 8.0% implied likelihood of a 50-basis point rate cut in July, down from 29.2% on Wednesday. The fed funds futures market remains certain that a 25-basis point rate cut will take place on July 31.Treasuries retreated in response to today's data, sliding toward this week's lows. The 10-yr yield is up seven basis points at 2.02% while the 2-yr yield is up eight basis points at 1.84%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.4% at 97.12, with its 50-day moving average (97.26) looming not far above.Market participants will not receive any more data today, and investor participation is expected to decrease throughout the session.08:56 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -13.90. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -53.60. The S&P 500 futures trade 14 points below fair value.Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region were relatively mixed on Friday following an otherwise good week for most markets. Today's mixed disposition was attributed in part to a wait-and-see attitude in front of the release of the U.S. Employment Situation Report, which will have implications for the Fed's policy stance. Other factors in play included a preliminary estimate from Samsung Electronics that its second quarter profit was down 56% yr/yr, a stronger-than-expected household spending report for May out of Japan, and a South China Morning Post report indicating China won't buy agricultural goods from the U.S. if the U.S. "flip flops again in future trade negotiations."In economic data: Japan's May Household Spending +5.5% m/m (expected +1.2%, last -1.4%) and +4.0% yr/yr (expected +1.4%, last +1.3%); May Preliminary Leading Index 95.2 (expected 95.3, last 95.9)Australia's June AIG Construction Index 43.0 (last 40.4)---Equity Markets---Japan's Nikkei: +0.2% (+2.0% for the week)Hong Kong's Hang Seng: -0.1% (+0.8% for the week)China's Shanghai Composite: +0.2% (+1.1% for the week)India's Sensex: -1.0% (+0.3% for the week)South Korea's Kospi: +0.1% (-0.9% for the week)Australia's ASX All Ordinaries: +0.5% (+2.0% for the week)Major European indices are registering modest losses in front of the release of the U.S. Employment Situation Report. A decidedly disappointing Factory Orders report for May out of Germany, however, has been an early guide for the negative stance. Additionally, the news from Thursday that the British navy seized an Iranian oil tanker headed for Syria has fostered some geopolitical angst that is keeping buying efforts in check.In economic data (Thursday and Friday): Eurozone's May Retail Sales -0.3% m/m (expected +0.4%, last -0.1%) and +1.3% yr/yr (expected +1.6%, last +1.8%)Germany's May Factory Orders -2.2% m/m (expected -0.1%, last +0.4%); June Construction PMI 50.0 (expected 52.0, last 51.4)Switzerland's June CPI 0.0% m/m (expected -0.1%, last +0.3%) and +0.6% yr/yr (expected +0.5%, last +0.6%)France's May Trade Balance EUR -3.3B (expected EUR -5.7B, last EUR -4.9B)Spain's May Industrial Production +1.4% (expected +1.1%, last +1.8%); June Consumer Confidence 102.3 (expected 95.1, last 96.9)U.K.'s June Halifax House Price Index -0.3% m/m (expected +0.3%, last +0.4%) and +5.7% yr/yr (expected +5.4%, last +5.2%); Q1 Labor Productivity -0.5% (expected -0.6%, last +0.3%)---Equity Markets---STOXX Europe 600: -0.6%Germany's DAX: -0.6%U.K.'s FTSE 100: -0.6%France's CAC 40: -0.5%Italy's FTSE MIB: -0.4%Spain's IBEX 35: -0.6%08:35 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -4.90.

Merck is one of the Dow's worst-performing components as pharmaceutical names slide after President Trump teased a 'favored nation' plan, which aims to allow the U.S. to purchase drugs based on the reduced prices that other countries pay.Conversely, UnitedHealth Group (UNH 247.79, +2.58) is the best-performing Dow component as managed health care names display relative strength in today's session.At current levels, the DJIA is poised to finish the week with gains of 1.2%.12:55 ETDow -52.63 at 26913.37, Nasdaq -30.62 at 8139.61, S&P -10.23 at 2985.59[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages hold modest losses at midday. The S&P 500 is lower by 0.3% while the Dow (-0.2%) sits a bit closer to its flat line.Equity indices have spent the first half of the session in negative territory after the Employment Situation report for June easily exceeded estimates. The report pointed to the addition of 224,000 nonfarm payrolls (Briefing.com consensus 160,000), which reduced expectations for a sharp rate cut.Granted, the market still expects that 25-basis point rate cut will take place at the July FOMC meeting, but the implied probability of a 50-basis point cut fell to near zero (5.9%) from 29.2% on Wednesday.The reduction in rate cut hopes pressured stocks from freshly-set record highs, but the past two hours have seen a steady rebound off session lows.Nine out of eleven sectors remain in negative territory with consumer staples (-0.8%) and industrials (-0.8%) at the bottom of the leaderboard. Transport stocks contributed to early weakness in the industrials sector, but the high-beta group has taken part in the market's recent rebound, trimming its loss to 0.6%. This leaves the Dow Jones Transportation Average unchanged for the week.Another high-beta group-PHLX Semiconductor Index-has struggled to keep pace with the rebound in the broader market. The Index is down 0.9% today and it is now down 0.1% for the week after being up 5.0% on Monday morning. The broader technology sector (-0.5%), meanwhile, trades a bit behind the broader market.Biotech names are under pressure after President Trump said that his administration is preparing a "favored-nations clause" that would reduce the prices that Medicare pays for drugs. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB 109.41, -1.52, -1.4%) is down 1.4%.On the upside, financials (+0.4%) have shown relative strength thanks to an uptick in Treasury yields. The sector has extended this week's gain to 1.9%.Treasuries trade a bit above their lows with the 10-yr yield up nine basis points at 2.04%.Reviewing the June Employment Situation Report:June nonfarm payrolls increased by 224,000 (Briefing.com consensus 160,000). Over the past three months, job gains have averaged 171,000 per month. May nonfarm payrolls revised to 72,000 from 75,000 June private sector payrolls increased by 191,000 (Briefing.com consensus 147,000) while May private sector payrolls revised to 83,000 from 90,000 June unemployment rate was 3.7% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%), versus 3.6% in May Persons unemployed for 27 weeks or more accounted for 23.7% of the unemployed versus 22.4% in May The U6 unemployment rate, which accounts for unemployed and underemployed workers, was 7.2%, versus 7.1% in May June average hourly earnings were up 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%), after increasing an upwardly revised 0.3% (from 0.2%) in May Over the last 12 months, average hourly earnings have risen 3.1%, versus 3.2% for the 12 months ending in May The average workweek in June was 34.4 hours (Briefing.com consensus 34.4), unchanged from May Manufacturing workweek was up 0.1 hour to 40.7 hours Factory overtime was unchanged at 3.4 hours The labor force participation rate was 62.9% in June versus 62.8% in May ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1041/1808. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1262/1750.12:30 ETDow -65.74 at 26900.26, Nasdaq -39.81 at 8130.42, S&P -13.43 at 2982.39[BRIEFING.COM] Recent action saw an uptick, which has lifted the S&P 500 (-0.5%) to its opening level.Ten out of eleven sectors continue trading in the red, but the consumer discretionary space (-0.1%) is on the verge of turning positive. Relative strength among retailers has contributed to the sector's rebound even though industry giant Amazon (AMZN 1936.90, -2.10, -0.1%) trades in-line with the sector.The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 42.84, +0.38, +0.9%) is up 0.9% with top holdings like L Brands (LB 27.84, +0.55, +2.0%), Guess?

On the flip side, energy (-0.5%; -1.5% week-to-date) and industrials (-1.1%; -0.5% week-to-date) are on track to end the week in negative territory.11:30 ETDow -143.77 at 26822.23, Nasdaq -51.54 at 8118.69, S&P -18.96 at 2976.86[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 (-0.6%) trades about ten points above its session low.The benchmark index was knocked down by falling rate cut expectations at the start of today's session, but it should be noted that the market is likely to continue reacting to the June Employment Situation report next week once participants who are vacationing today return to their desks.The market saw a spike in volume at the start of today's session, but activity has been slowing since then. As a result, only 174 million shares have changed hands at the NYSE floor so far.11:00 ETDow -188.11 at 26777.89, Nasdaq -66.80 at 8103.43, S&P -23.46 at 2972.36[BRIEFING.COM] Equity indices trade just above their recently established session lows. The S&P 500 is down 0.8%, trimming this week's gain to 1.1%.Countercyclical sectors remain near the bottom of the leaderboard, but the industrials sector (-1.5%) is now the second worst performer. Transport stocks have contributed to the weakness, as the Dow Jones Transportation Average falls 1.5%. All 20 index components trade in the red with 15 down at least 1.0%. Avis Budget (CAR 33.92, -0.95, -2.7%) is the group's weakest performer.Elsewhere, the greenback has continued climbing after the June Employment Situation report led to a reduction in rate cut expectations.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -57.20.The stock market is on track for a lower start as futures on the S&P 500 trade 14 points below fair value.Index futures held modest losses in early-morning trade, but they slid to lows after the release of a June Employment Situation report that was comfortably ahead of estimates. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 224,000 (Briefing.com consensus 160,000) while average hourly earnings grew 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).The stock market is finding the strong headline beat disappointing because it has led to a reduction in expectations for an aggressive rate cut at the July FOMC Meeting. The fed funds futures market now sees just an 8.0% implied likelihood of a 50-basis point rate cut in July, down from 29.2% on Wednesday. The fed funds futures market remains certain that a 25-basis point rate cut will take place on July 31.Treasuries retreated in response to today's data, sliding toward this week's lows.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -53.60. The S&P 500 futures trade 14 points below fair value.Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region were relatively mixed on Friday following an otherwise good week for most markets. Today's mixed disposition was attributed in part to a wait-and-see attitude in front of the release of the U.S. Employment Situation Report, which will have implications for the Fed's policy stance. Other factors in play included a preliminary estimate from Samsung Electronics that its second quarter profit was down 56% yr/yr, a stronger-than-expected household spending report for May out of Japan, and a South China Morning Post report indicating China won't buy agricultural goods from the U.S. if the U.S. "flip flops again in future trade negotiations."In economic data: Japan's May Household Spending +5.5% m/m (expected +1.2%, last -1.4%) and +4.0% yr/yr (expected +1.4%, last +1.3%); May Preliminary Leading Index 95.2 (expected 95.3, last 95.9)Australia's June AIG Construction Index 43.0 (last 40.4)---Equity Markets---Japan's Nikkei: +0.2% (+2.0% for the week)Hong Kong's Hang Seng: -0.1% (+0.8% for the week)China's Shanghai Composite: +0.2% (+1.1% for the week)India's Sensex: -1.0% (+0.3% for the week)South Korea's Kospi: +0.1% (-0.9% for the week)Australia's ASX All Ordinaries: +0.5% (+2.0% for the week)Major European indices are registering modest losses in front of the release of the U.S. Employment Situation Report. A decidedly disappointing Factory Orders report for May out of Germany, however, has been an early guide for the negative stance. Additionally, the news from Thursday that the British navy seized an Iranian oil tanker headed for Syria has fostered some geopolitical angst that is keeping buying efforts in check.In economic data (Thursday and Friday): Eurozone's May Retail Sales -0.3% m/m (expected +0.4%, last -0.1%) and +1.3% yr/yr (expected +1.6%, last +1.8%)Germany's May Factory Orders -2.2% m/m (expected -0.1%, last +0.4%); June Construction PMI 50.0 (expected 52.0, last 51.4)Switzerland's June CPI 0.0% m/m (expected -0.1%, last +0.3%) and +0.6% yr/yr (expected +0.5%, last +0.6%)France's May Trade Balance EUR -3.3B (expected EUR -5.7B, last EUR -4.9B)Spain's May Industrial Production +1.4% (expected +1.1%, last +1.8%); June Consumer Confidence 102.3 (expected 95.1, last 96.9)U.K.'s June Halifax House Price Index -0.3% m/m (expected +0.3%, last +0.4%) and +5.7% yr/yr (expected +5.4%, last +5.2%); Q1 Labor Productivity -0.5% (expected -0.6%, last +0.3%)---Equity Markets---STOXX Europe 600: -0.6%Germany's DAX: -0.6%U.K.'s FTSE 100: -0.6%France's CAC 40: -0.5%Italy's FTSE MIB: -0.4%Spain's IBEX 35: -0.6%08:35 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -4.90.

The S&P 500 futures trade 14 points below fair value.Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region were relatively mixed on Friday following an otherwise good week for most markets. Today's mixed disposition was attributed in part to a wait-and-see attitude in front of the release of the U.S. Employment Situation Report, which will have implications for the Fed's policy stance. Other factors in play included a preliminary estimate from Samsung Electronics that its second quarter profit was down 56% yr/yr, a stronger-than-expected household spending report for May out of Japan, and a South China Morning Post report indicating China won't buy agricultural goods from the U.S. if the U.S. "flip flops again in future trade negotiations."In economic data: Japan's May Household Spending +5.5% m/m (expected +1.2%, last -1.4%) and +4.0% yr/yr (expected +1.4%, last +1.3%); May Preliminary Leading Index 95.2 (expected 95.3, last 95.9)Australia's June AIG Construction Index 43.0 (last 40.4)---Equity Markets---Japan's Nikkei: +0.2% (+2.0% for the week)Hong Kong's Hang Seng: -0.1% (+0.8% for the week)China's Shanghai Composite: +0.2% (+1.1% for the week)India's Sensex: -1.0% (+0.3% for the week)South Korea's Kospi: +0.1% (-0.9% for the week)Australia's ASX All Ordinaries: +0.5% (+2.0% for the week)Major European indices are registering modest losses in front of the release of the U.S. Employment Situation Report. A decidedly disappointing Factory Orders report for May out of Germany, however, has been an early guide for the negative stance.

Merck is one of the Dow's worst-performing components as pharmaceutical names slide after President Trump teased a 'favored nation' plan, which aims to allow the U.S. to purchase drugs based on the reduced prices that other countries pay.Conversely, UnitedHealth Group (UNH 247.79, +2.58) is the best-performing Dow component as managed health care names display relative strength in today's session.At current levels, the DJIA is poised to finish the week with gains of 1.2%.12:55 ETDow -52.63 at 26913.37, Nasdaq -30.62 at 8139.61, S&P -10.23 at 2985.59[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages hold modest losses at midday. The S&P 500 is lower by 0.3% while the Dow (-0.2%) sits a bit closer to its flat line.Equity indices have spent the first half of the session in negative territory after the Employment Situation report for June easily exceeded estimates. The report pointed to the addition of 224,000 nonfarm payrolls (Briefing.com consensus 160,000), which reduced expectations for a sharp rate cut.Granted, the market still expects that 25-basis point rate cut will take place at the July FOMC meeting, but the implied probability of a 50-basis point cut fell to near zero (5.9%) from 29.2% on Wednesday.The reduction in rate cut hopes pressured stocks from freshly-set record highs, but the past two hours have seen a steady rebound off session lows.Nine out of eleven sectors remain in negative territory with consumer staples (-0.8%) and industrials (-0.8%) at the bottom of the leaderboard. Transport stocks contributed to early weakness in the industrials sector, but the high-beta group has taken part in the market's recent rebound, trimming its loss to 0.6%. This leaves the Dow Jones Transportation Average unchanged for the week.Another high-beta group-PHLX Semiconductor Index-has struggled to keep pace with the rebound in the broader market. The Index is down 0.9% today and it is now down 0.1% for the week after being up 5.0% on Monday morning. The broader technology sector (-0.5%), meanwhile, trades a bit behind the broader market.Biotech names are under pressure after President Trump said that his administration is preparing a "favored-nations clause" that would reduce the prices that Medicare pays for drugs. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB 109.41, -1.52, -1.4%) is down 1.4%.On the upside, financials (+0.4%) have shown relative strength thanks to an uptick in Treasury yields. The sector has extended this week's gain to 1.9%.Treasuries trade a bit above their lows with the 10-yr yield up nine basis points at 2.04%.Reviewing the June Employment Situation Report:June nonfarm payrolls increased by 224,000 (Briefing.com consensus 160,000).

The S&P 500 is down 0.8%, trimming this week's gain to 1.1%.Countercyclical sectors remain near the bottom of the leaderboard, but the industrials sector (-1.5%) is now the second worst performer. Transport stocks have contributed to the weakness, as the Dow Jones Transportation Average falls 1.5%. All 20 index components trade in the red with 15 down at least 1.0%. Avis Budget (CAR 33.92, -0.95, -2.7%) is the group's weakest performer.Elsewhere, the greenback has continued climbing after the June Employment Situation report led to a reduction in rate cut expectations.

However, the PHLX Semiconductor Index followed Monday's opening surge with a retreat that is continuing today. The PHLX Semiconductor Index is down 1.1% today, and is now down 0.3% for the week.

Nonfarm payrolls increased by 224,000 (Briefing.com consensus 160,000) while average hourly earnings grew 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).The stock market is finding the strong headline beat disappointing because it has led to a reduction in expectations for an aggressive rate cut at the July FOMC Meeting. The fed funds futures market now sees just an 8.0% implied likelihood of a 50-basis point rate cut in July, down from 29.2% on Wednesday. The fed funds futures market remains certain that a 25-basis point rate cut will take place on July 31.Treasuries retreated in response to today's data, sliding toward this week's lows.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -53.60. The S&P 500 futures trade 14 points below fair value.Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region were relatively mixed on Friday following an otherwise good week for most markets. Today's mixed disposition was attributed in part to a wait-and-see attitude in front of the release of the U.S. Employment Situation Report, which will have implications for the Fed's policy stance. Other factors in play included a preliminary estimate from Samsung Electronics that its second quarter profit was down 56% yr/yr, a stronger-than-expected household spending report for May out of Japan, and a South China Morning Post report indicating China won't buy agricultural goods from the U.S. if the U.S. "flip flops again in future trade negotiations."In economic data: Japan's May Household Spending +5.5% m/m (expected +1.2%, last -1.4%) and +4.0% yr/yr (expected +1.4%, last +1.3%); May Preliminary Leading Index 95.2 (expected 95.3, last 95.9)Australia's June AIG Construction Index 43.0 (last 40.4)---Equity Markets---Japan's Nikkei: +0.2% (+2.0% for the week)Hong Kong's Hang Seng: -0.1% (+0.8% for the week)China's Shanghai Composite: +0.2% (+1.1% for the week)India's Sensex: -1.0% (+0.3% for the week)South Korea's Kospi: +0.1% (-0.9% for the week)Australia's ASX All Ordinaries: +0.5% (+2.0% for the week)Major European indices are registering modest losses in front of the release of the U.S. Employment Situation Report. A decidedly disappointing Factory Orders report for May out of Germany, however, has been an early guide for the negative stance. Additionally, the news from Thursday that the British navy seized an Iranian oil tanker headed for Syria has fostered some geopolitical angst that is keeping buying efforts in check.In economic data (Thursday and Friday): Eurozone's May Retail Sales -0.3% m/m (expected +0.4%, last -0.1%) and +1.3% yr/yr (expected +1.6%, last +1.8%)Germany's May Factory Orders -2.2% m/m (expected -0.1%, last +0.4%); June Construction PMI 50.0 (expected 52.0, last 51.4)Switzerland's June CPI 0.0% m/m (expected -0.1%, last +0.3%) and +0.6% yr/yr (expected +0.5%, last +0.6%)France's May Trade Balance EUR -3.3B (expected EUR -5.7B, last EUR -4.9B)Spain's May Industrial Production +1.4% (expected +1.1%, last +1.8%); June Consumer Confidence 102.3 (expected 95.1, last 96.9)U.K.'s June Halifax House Price Index -0.3% m/m (expected +0.3%, last +0.4%) and +5.7% yr/yr (expected +5.4%, last +5.2%); Q1 Labor Productivity -0.5% (expected -0.6%, last +0.3%)---Equity Markets---STOXX Europe 600: -0.6%Germany's DAX: -0.6%U.K.'s FTSE 100: -0.6%France's CAC 40: -0.5%Italy's FTSE MIB: -0.4%Spain's IBEX 35: -0.6%08:35 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -4.90.

The Briefing.com consensus expects the report to show the addition of 160,000 nonfarm payrolls while average hourly earnings are expected to have increased 0.3%.The overnight session featured a mixed, but largely flat, showing from markets across Asia while European indices trade in the red.

The benchmark index narrowed its loss to 0.2% by the close while Nasdaq (-0.1%) and Russell 2000 (+0.2%) outperformed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.2%) settled in line with the benchmark index.Equities stumbled out of the gate after a much stronger than expected headline reading of the June Employment Situation report (actual 224,000; Briefing.com consensus 160,000) dashed hopes for aggressive action from the FOMC.The solid report served as another reminder that the U.S. economy continues holding up well against a backdrop of slowing activity elsewhere. Today's news weighed on Treasuries, sending the 10-yr yield higher by ten basis points to 2.05%, while the implied likelihood of a 50-basis point rate cut fell to just 4.9% from 29.2% on Wednesday. The fed funds futures market remains certain that a 25-basis point cut will take place on July 31.In addition to weighing on Treasuries, the jobs report boosted the dollar, lifting the U.S. Dollar Index to its 50-day moving average (97.27). The Index gained 1.2% this week and is now within 0.6% of its high from June.The major averages retreated through the first hour of the session, but the market found support shortly after the S&P 500 dipped to its starting level from Monday. The next few hours saw a steady rebound, which ran into resistance near Wednesday's closing levels.Seven out of eleven sectors ended the day in negative territory. Countercyclical real estate (-0.6%) and health care (-0.7%) settled at the bottom of the leaderboard with health care pressured by biotech names after President Trump said that his administration is preparing a "favored-nations clause" that would reduce prices that Medicare pays for drugs. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB 109.22, -1.71, -1.5%) narrowed this week's gain to just 0.2%.The top-weighted technology sector (-0.2%) settled in line with the broader market as relative strength in largest sector components outweighed continued weakness among chipmakers. The PHLX Semiconductor Index lost 0.6% with 24 of its 30 components ending in the red. AMD (AMD 31.50, +0.31, +1.0%) was among the outperformers amid speculation that the company's newest video cards that will become available on Sunday will challenge corresponding offerings from NVIDIA (NVDA 160.23, -2.52, -1.6%) when it comes to price and performance.On the upside, financials (+0.4%) spent the bulk of the session in the green, as the uptick in Treasury yields and the continued strength in employment data fostered the thought that banks may be able to keep their net interest margins at healthy levels.The communications sector (+0.2%) also outperformed, ending the week ahead of the remaining ten groups with a gain of 2.7%.Today's investor participation was well below average, as fewer than 600 million shares changed hands at the NYSE floor.Reviewing the June Employment Situation Report:June nonfarm payrolls increased by 224,000 (Briefing.com consensus 160,000). Over the past three months, job gains have averaged 171,000 per month. May nonfarm payrolls revised to 72,000 from 75,000 June private sector payrolls increased by 191,000 (Briefing.com consensus 147,000) while May private sector payrolls revised to 83,000 from 90,000 June unemployment rate was 3.7% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%), versus 3.6% in May Persons unemployed for 27 weeks or more accounted for 23.7% of the unemployed versus 22.4% in May The U6 unemployment rate, which accounts for unemployed and underemployed workers, was 7.2%, versus 7.1% in May June average hourly earnings were up 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%), after increasing an upwardly revised 0.3% (from 0.2%) in May Over the last 12 months, average hourly earnings have risen 3.1%, versus 3.2% for the 12 months ending in May The average workweek in June was 34.4 hours (Briefing.com consensus 34.4), unchanged from May Manufacturing workweek was up 0.1 hour to 40.7 hours Factory overtime was unchanged at 3.4 hours The labor force participation rate was 62.9% in June versus 62.8% in MayMonday's economic data will be limited to the 15:00 ET release of May Consumer Credit (Briefing.com consensus $17.70 bln; prior $17.50 bln).Nasdaq Composite +23.0% YTD S&P 500 +19.3% YTD Russell 2000 +16.8% YTD Dow Jones Industrial Average +15.4% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1423/1474. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1651/1399.15:35 ETDow -47.44 at 26918.56, Nasdaq -6.89 at 8163.34, S&P -5.45 at 2990.37[BRIEFING.COM] Metals Settlement Prices:Aug gold settled today's session $19.45 lower (-1.4%) at $1400.95/ozSept silver settled today's session $0.34 lower (-2.2%) at $15.00/ozSept copper settled $0.02 lower (-0.7%) at $2.66/lbAgriculture Settlement Prices:Sept corn settled $0.03 higher (+0.7%) at $4.39/bushelSept wheat settled $0.04 higher (+0.8%) at $5.17/bushelAug soybeans settled $0.13 lower (-1.5%) at $8.76/bushelEnergy Settlement Prices:Aug Crude Oil futures rose $0.06 to $57.40/barrelAug Natural Gas settles $0.11 higher (+5.0%) at $2.40/MMBtuAug RBOB Gasoline settled $0.063 higher (+1.6%) at $1.93/gallonAug Heating oil futures settled $0.01 higher (+0.5%) at $1.90/gallon ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1341/1566. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1578/1461.14:55 ETDow -25.33 at 26940.67, Nasdaq -2.62 at 8167.61, S&P -2.99 at 2992.83[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is lower by 0.1% with one hour remaining in the session.This week was very quiet on the earnings front and this condition will only persist for one more week before the Q2 earnings season starts in mid-July.As for next week, the market will hear from PepsiCo (PEP 133.11, -0.88, -0.7%) on Tuesday morning and Kraft Heinz (KHC 30.97, -0.28, -0.9%) on Wednesday morning. Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY 11.40, +0.26, +2.3%) will report after Wednesday's close while Delta Air Lines (DAL 58.68, -0.47, -0.8%) will release its quarterly results on Thursday morning.14:25 ETDow -58.07 at 26907.93, Nasdaq -14.92 at 8155.31, S&P -7.46 at 2988.36[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 (-0.3%) hovers three points below its rebound high.Market participants received a heavy dose of economic data during the shortened week but things will quiet down significantly next week.Investors will not receive any top tier data during the first three sessions of the week, meaning Thursday's CPI report for June (prior 0.1%) will be the most notable report of the week, followed by June PPI (prior 0.1%) on Friday.Monday's economic data will be limited to the 15:00 ET release of Ma Consumer Credit (prior $17.50 bln).13:55 ETDow -54.25 at 26911.75, Nasdaq -15.01 at 8155.22, S&P -7.01 at 2988.81[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have continued their rebound with the S&P 500 narrowing its loss to 0.2%.Stocks have enjoyed a steady rebound since notching session lows around 10:30 ET. While the price action has been positive, the outcome of today's session should be taken with a grain of salt. The market was closed yesterday, so it is highly likely that many portfolio managers worked a shortened day today or skipped the session altogether.Only 265 million shares have changed hands at the NYSE floor so far today.13:30 ETDow -47.12 at 26918.88, Nasdaq -17.23 at 8153, S&P -8.45 at 2987.37[BRIEFING.COM] The major U.S. indices are trading lower, but well off their session lows, as this morning's strong economic data slate dampens investors hopes for an interest rate cut in July.A look inside the Dow Jones Industrial Average shows that 3M (MMM 171.85, -3.13), Merck (MRK 85.90, -1.00), & Procter & Gamble (PG 112.89, -1.19) are underperforming. Merck is one of the Dow's worst-performing components as pharmaceutical names slide after President Trump teased a 'favored nation' plan, which aims to allow the U.S. to purchase drugs based on the reduced prices that other countries pay.Conversely, UnitedHealth Group (UNH 247.79, +2.58) is the best-performing Dow component as managed health care names display relative strength in today's session.At current levels, the DJIA is poised to finish the week with gains of 1.2%.12:55 ETDow -52.63 at 26913.37, Nasdaq -30.62 at 8139.61, S&P -10.23 at 2985.59[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages hold modest losses at midday. The S&P 500 is lower by 0.3% while the Dow (-0.2%) sits a bit closer to its flat line.Equity indices have spent the first half of the session in negative territory after the Employment Situation report for June easily exceeded estimates. The report pointed to the addition of 224,000 nonfarm payrolls (Briefing.com consensus 160,000), which reduced expectations for a sharp rate cut.Granted, the market still expects that 25-basis point rate cut will take place at the July FOMC meeting, but the implied probability of a 50-basis point cut fell to near zero (5.9%) from 29.2% on Wednesday.The reduction in rate cut hopes pressured stocks from freshly-set record highs, but the past two hours have seen a steady rebound off session lows.Nine out of eleven sectors remain in negative territory with consumer staples (-0.8%) and industrials (-0.8%) at the bottom of the leaderboard. Transport stocks contributed to early weakness in the industrials sector, but the high-beta group has taken part in the market's recent rebound, trimming its loss to 0.6%. This leaves the Dow Jones Transportation Average unchanged for the week.Another high-beta group-PHLX Semiconductor Index-has struggled to keep pace with the rebound in the broader market. The Index is down 0.9% today and it is now down 0.1% for the week after being up 5.0% on Monday morning. The broader technology sector (-0.5%), meanwhile, trades a bit behind the broader market.Biotech names are under pressure after President Trump said that his administration is preparing a "favored-nations clause" that would reduce the prices that Medicare pays for drugs. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB 109.41, -1.52, -1.4%) is down 1.4%.On the upside, financials (+0.4%) have shown relative strength thanks to an uptick in Treasury yields.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -53.60. The S&P 500 futures trade 14 points below fair value.Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region were relatively mixed on Friday following an otherwise good week for most markets. Today's mixed disposition was attributed in part to a wait-and-see attitude in front of the release of the U.S. Employment Situation Report, which will have implications for the Fed's policy stance. Other factors in play included a preliminary estimate from Samsung Electronics that its second quarter profit was down 56% yr/yr, a stronger-than-expected household spending report for May out of Japan, and a South China Morning Post report indicating China won't buy agricultural goods from the U.S. if the U.S. "flip flops again in future trade negotiations."In economic data: Japan's May Household Spending +5.5% m/m (expected +1.2%, last -1.4%) and +4.0% yr/yr (expected +1.4%, last +1.3%); May Preliminary Leading Index 95.2 (expected 95.3, last 95.9)Australia's June AIG Construction Index 43.0 (last 40.4)---Equity Markets---Japan's Nikkei: +0.2% (+2.0% for the week)Hong Kong's Hang Seng: -0.1% (+0.8% for the week)China's Shanghai Composite: +0.2% (+1.1% for the week)India's Sensex: -1.0% (+0.3% for the week)South Korea's Kospi: +0.1% (-0.9% for the week)Australia's ASX All Ordinaries: +0.5% (+2.0% for the week)Major European indices are registering modest losses in front of the release of the U.S. Employment Situation Report. A decidedly disappointing Factory Orders report for May out of Germany, however, has been an early guide for the negative stance. Additionally, the news from Thursday that the British navy seized an Iranian oil tanker headed for Syria has fostered some geopolitical angst that is keeping buying efforts in check.In economic data (Thursday and Friday): Eurozone's May Retail Sales -0.3% m/m (expected +0.4%, last -0.1%) and +1.3% yr/yr (expected +1.6%, last +1.8%)Germany's May Factory Orders -2.2% m/m (expected -0.1%, last +0.4%); June Construction PMI 50.0 (expected 52.0, last 51.4)Switzerland's June CPI 0.0% m/m (expected -0.1%, last +0.3%) and +0.6% yr/yr (expected +0.5%, last +0.6%)France's May Trade Balance EUR -3.3B (expected EUR -5.7B, last EUR -4.9B)Spain's May Industrial Production +1.4% (expected +1.1%, last +1.8%); June Consumer Confidence 102.3 (expected 95.1, last 96.9)U.K.'s June Halifax House Price Index -0.3% m/m (expected +0.3%, last +0.4%) and +5.7% yr/yr (expected +5.4%, last +5.2%); Q1 Labor Productivity -0.5% (expected -0.6%, last +0.3%)---Equity Markets---STOXX Europe 600: -0.6%Germany's DAX: -0.6%U.K.'s FTSE 100: -0.6%France's CAC 40: -0.5%Italy's FTSE MIB: -0.4%Spain's IBEX 35: -0.6%08:35 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -4.90.

Stock Market UpdateBriefing.comJuly 5, 2019 4:19 PMCopyright 2019 Briefing.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 4355 wordsBodyEmployment growth exceeds June expectations, weighing on rate cut betsLow volume expected during post-holiday sessionShortened Week Ends on Slightly Lower Note - Jul 05 - 16:20 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The stock market ended the week on a lower note, though the final standing represented a significant improvement from morning action when the S&P 500 was down as much as 0.9%. The benchmark index narrowed its loss to 0.2% by the close while Nasdaq (-0.1%) and Russell 2000 (+0.2%) outperformed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.2%) settled in line with the benchmark index. Equities stumbled out of the gate after a much stronger than expected headline reading of the June Employment Situation report (actual 224,000; Briefing.com consensus 160,000) dashed hopes for aggressive action from the FOMC.  The solid report served as another reminder that the U.S. economy continues holding up well against a backdrop of slowing activity elsewhere. Today's news weighed on Treasuries, sending the 10-yr yield higher by ten basis points to 2.05%, while the implied likelihood of a 50-basis point rate cut fell to just 4.9% from 29.2% on Wednesday. The fed funds futures market remains certain that a 25-basis point cut will take place on July 31. In addition to weighing on Treasuries, the jobs report boosted the dollar, lifting the U.S. Dollar Index to its 50-day moving average (97.27). The Index gained 1.2% this week and is now within 0.6% of its high from June. The major averages retreated through the first hour of the session, but the market found support shortly after the S&P 500 dipped to its starting level from Monday. The next few hours saw a steady rebound, which ran into resistance near Wednesday's closing levels. Seven out of eleven sectors ended the day in negative territory. Countercyclical real estate (-0.6%) and health care (-0.7%) settled at the bottom of the leaderboard with health care pressured by biotech names after President Trump said that his administration is preparing a "favored-nations clause" that would reduce prices that Medicare pays for drugs. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB 109.22, -1.71, -1.5%) narrowed this week's gain to just 0.2%. The top-weighted technology sector (-0.2%) settled in line with the broader market as relative strength in largest sector components outweighed continued weakness among chipmakers. The PHLX Semiconductor Index lost 0.6% with 24 of its 30 components ending in the red. AMD (AMD 31.50, +0.31, +1.0%) was among the outperformers amid speculation that the company's newest video cards that will become available on Sunday will challenge corresponding offerings from NVIDIA (NVDA 160.23, -2.52, -1.6%) when it comes to price and performance.  On the upside, financials (+0.4%) spent the bulk of the session in the green, as the uptick in Treasury yields and the continued strength in employment data fostered the thought that banks may be able to keep their net interest margins at healthy levels.  The communications sector (+0.2%) also outperformed, ending the week ahead of the remaining ten groups with a gain of 2.7%. Today's investor participation was well below average, as fewer than 600 million shares changed hands at the NYSE floor. Reviewing the June Employment Situation Report: • June nonfarm payrolls increased by 224,000 (Briefing.com consensus 160,000).

Merck is one of the Dow's worst-performing components as pharmaceutical names slide after President Trump teased a 'favored nation' plan, which aims to allow the U.S. to purchase drugs based on the reduced prices that other countries pay. Conversely, UnitedHealth Group (UNH 247.79, +2.58) is the best-performing Dow component as managed health care names display relative strength in today's session.At current levels, the DJIA is poised to finish the week with gains of 1.2%.NASDAQ - 1433 - 1594 - 999 mlnNYSE - 1177 - 1703 - 251 mlnDJ30 - -47.12 - 26918.88NASDAQ - -17.23 - 8153SP500 - -8.45 - 2987.37Market Under Modest Pressure at Midday - Jul 05 - 12:55 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages hold modest losses at midday. The S&P 500 is lower by 0.3% while the Dow (-0.2%) sits a bit closer to its flat line. Equity indices have spent the first half of the session in negative territory after the Employment Situation report for June easily exceeded estimates. The report pointed to the addition of 224,000 nonfarm payrolls (Briefing.com consensus 160,000), which reduced expectations for a sharp rate cut. Granted, the market still expects that 25-basis point rate cut will take place at the July FOMC meeting, but the implied probability of a 50-basis point cut fell to near zero (5.9%) from 29.2% on Wednesday.  The reduction in rate cut hopes pressured stocks from freshly-set record highs, but the past two hours have seen a steady rebound off session lows.  Nine out of eleven sectors remain in negative territory with consumer staples (-0.8%) and industrials (-0.8%) at the bottom of the leaderboard. Transport stocks contributed to early weakness in the industrials sector, but the high-beta group has taken part in the market's recent rebound, trimming its loss to 0.6%. This leaves the Dow Jones Transportation Average unchanged for the week. Another high-beta group-PHLX Semiconductor Index-has struggled to keep pace with the rebound in the broader market. The Index is down 0.9% today and it is now down 0.1% for the week after being up 5.0% on Monday morning. The broader technology sector (-0.5%), meanwhile, trades a bit behind the broader market. Biotech names are under pressure after President Trump said that his administration is preparing a "favored-nations clause" that would reduce the prices that Medicare pays for drugs. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB 109.41, -1.52, -1.4%) is down 1.4%.  On the upside, financials (+0.4%) have shown relative strength thanks to an uptick in Treasury yields. The sector has extended this week's gain to 1.9%. Treasuries trade a bit above their lows with the 10-yr yield up nine basis points at 2.04%.Reviewing the June Employment Situation Report: • June nonfarm payrolls increased by 224,000 (Briefing.com consensus 160,000).

Nonfarm payrolls increased by 224,000 (Briefing.com consensus 160,000) while average hourly earnings grew 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).  The stock market is finding the strong headline beat disappointing because it has led to a reduction in expectations for an aggressive rate cut at the July FOMC Meeting.

The S&P 500 futures trade 14 points below fair value.Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region were relatively mixed on Friday following an otherwise good week for most markets. Today's mixed disposition was attributed in part to a wait-and-see attitude in front of the release of the U.S. Employment Situation Report, which will have implications for the Fed's policy stance. Other factors in play included a preliminary estimate from Samsung Electronics that its second quarter profit was down 56% yr/yr, a stronger-than-expected household spending report for May out of Japan, and a South China Morning Post report indicating China won't buy agricultural goods from the U.S. if the U.S. "flip flops again in future trade negotiations."• In economic data: Japan's May Household Spending +5.5% m/m (expected +1.2%, last -1.4%) and +4.0% yr/yr (expected +1.4%, last +1.3%); May Preliminary Leading Index 95.2 (expected 95.3, last 95.9)Australia's June AIG Construction Index 43.0 (last 40.4)---Equity Markets---• Japan's Nikkei: +0.2% (+2.0% for the week)• Hong Kong's Hang Seng: -0.1% (+0.8% for the week)• China's Shanghai Composite: +0.2% (+1.1% for the week)• India's Sensex: -1.0% (+0.3% for the week)• South Korea's Kospi: +0.1% (-0.9% for the week)• Australia's ASX All Ordinaries: +0.5% (+2.0% for the week)Major European indices are registering modest losses in front of the release of the U.S. Employment Situation Report.

Hong Kong protesters call for 'Mulan' boycott after star went public in support of policeCNN WireAugust 16, 2019 Friday 7:14 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 499 wordsByline: By Jessie Yeung, CNNDateline: (CNN) Body (CNN) --  Even Mulan is getting political. Liu Yifei, the actress starring in Disney's upcoming live-action "Mulan" remake, waded into the Hong Kong protest controversy on Thursday by expressing support for the city's police, who anti-government demonstrators accuse of using excessive force to quell unrest."I support the Hong Kong police. You can all attack me now. What a shame for Hong Kong," she posted on Weibo, a Twitter-like Chinese social media platform.Immediately, people began posting #BoycottMulan on Twitter -- which is banned in China. Twitter users accused the actress of supporting police brutality, and called out the fact that she's an American citizen."Liu is a naturalized American citizen. It must be nice. Meanwhile she pisses on people fighting for democracy," one person tweeted.On the flip side, she also received plenty of praise on Weibo, the dominant platform in China. Nearly all the comments on her post echoed support for the Hong Kong police and Beijing."Believe in the government, believe in the Chinese central (government), believe in the country," one comment wrote.The protests, which began in June as largely peaceful mass demonstrations against a now-suspended extradition bill, have morphed into something much darker and more violent, with frequent clashes between protesters and police. Liu isn't the only Chinese celebrity who's weighed in -- Jackie Chan, martial arts film icon and native Hong Konger, called for peace on Thursday in an interview with China's broadcaster CCTV. He, too, was blasted on Twitter for the nationalist tone of his message -- at one point, he says in Mandarin, "I feel the pride of being a Chinese everywhere. The five-starred red flag is respected everywhere."Other public figures, actors and singers like Tony Leung Ka-fai and Daniel Chan have spoken out against protester violence and vandalism. Pop star Denise Ho came out in strong support of the protesters -- she even gave a speech about the protests at a United Nations meeting last month.Celebrities outside of Hong Kong and China have also chimed in. Kim Eui Sung, a South Korean actor who starred in the cult 2016 zombie apocalypse film "Train to Busan," expressed support for the protesters on Instagram, writing, "We are watching you, praying for you. #freehongkong." After being bombarded with critical and pro-Beijing comments, he posted another photo -- the infamous Tank Man shot from the Tiananmen Square massacre.Sports drinks brand Pocari Sweat was also cheered by protesters and boycotted by the opposition after the company pulled ads from a local broadcaster perceived as pro-Beijing. Even bubble tea has been caught in the mix, with a Taiwanese chain urging solidarity with protesters.And with the unrest showing no end in sight, both sides are settling in for the long haul."So disappointed," said one Twitter user of Liu's Weibo post. "Was so excited for Mulan too."TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved.Load-Date: August 17, 2019End of Document

Apple's Ability to Mitigate Tariffs Is 'Underappreciated,' JPMorgan Analyst SaysTheStreet.comAugust 26, 2019 Monday 11:20 AM EDTCopyright 2019 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 559 wordsByline: Jacob SonenshineHighlight: Apple may not have to raise iPhone prices because the cost of its memory chips have been declining, analyst Samik Chatterjee points out.BodyThe trade war between the U.S. and China has heated up in the past week, putting pressure on Apple  shares, but one analyst says the tech giant has a greater ability to weather potential tariffs than the market currently recognizes. U.S. tariffs on additional goods from China, including smartphones and other electronics, are scheduled to go into effect Dec. 15, and President Trump on Friday threatened to raise the level of those tariffs from 10% to 15% in response to the Chinese government imposing its own additional tariffs on U.S. goods. He also ordered U.S. companies to look for ways to not do business with China, sending shares of Apple, which assembles the majority of its iPhones in China,  . Apple analysts have outlined how planned tariffs would impact Apple's profits, based on whether it chooses to absorb the higher costs or pass them along to consumers through price increases. Cowen analyst Krish Sankar outlined in an early August note that 10% tariffs would have a  on Apple of anywhere between 0.5% and 4%.But JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee wrote in a note on Monday that "we see certain silver linings relative to timing that might allow Apple to navigate the challenging dynamic better than investors currently expect." He noted that Apple's ability to mitigate the potential tariffs is "underappreciated."One factor Chatterjee says investors aren't much considering is the decline in memory chip prices, which reduces its own costs. He mentioned that the total year-over-year decline for those costs for the launch of new phones in September would amount to roughly $30 to $50 per phone. This is due primarily to a decrease in the cost of DRAM and NAND prices, Chatterjee said, a decrease that has hurt Micron's  revenue growth. This is "allowing the company to absorb a large portion of the tariffs without a retail price increase for the American consumer," said Chatterjee. He said Apple would have had an 8% hit to EPS from absorbing 10% tariffs, but that the EPS hit could now be less than that with the memory cost decrease partially offsetting the tariffs.Chatterjee's belief that Apple can maintain last September's iPhone profit margins without lifting prices would be good news in terms of sales expectations. Cowen's Sankar thinks higher iPhone prices would equate to 5% to 20% "demand destruction," while Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives sees 6 million to 8 million fewer iPhones sold in the event of a price increase. As for Apple's non-iPhone hardware products, which include AirPods, Apple Watches and iPads, "pricing power is higher given limited competition" for these devices, Chatterjee argued. These products represent about 28% of Apple's total revenue. "In addition, we see a significant memory price benefit on Mac devices," Chatterjee added. Aside from footwork around price and cost, Apple could also move some of its production out of China. Ives has pointed out  out of China, which would take at least 18 months. Moving 30% of such production out of the country would take roughly three years. Apple shares were rising 2% to $206.67 on Monday and are up about 31% year-to-date. Apple is a holding in Jim Cramer's .

(Nasdaq: IDEX) has today announced it has signed an agreement to partner with Anhui Ankai Automobile Co., Ltd. (also known as "Ankai") (000868:CH), a leading industry manufacturer and sales enterprise for bus markets, servicing a full range of small, medium, and large buses. The partnership will extend the service offering of Ideanomics' recently-established NETS Group and will provide bus and tour bus operators with benefits ranging from factory/group purchasing power, through to streamlined ABS financing services. The partner will service major state-owned tourism groups, major domestic tourism associations and/or their members including tour agencies, hotels, parks and tour transportation operators, and other sources through official industry associations.Under the terms of the deal Ideanomics is entitled to up to 10% commission on bus orders it introduces, the exact commission will be dependent on the make, model, and specification of the buses ordered, as well as any discounted pricing negotiated as part of the sales order. In return for the commissions, Ideanomics will seek to place a minimum of 10,000 orders with Ankai from its previously announced deals. The parties have agreed to cooperate on sales and marketing activities in Malaysia and the broader ASEAN region, as well as Europe and the United States. Ideanomics also earns fees from asset-backed financing (ABS) services it arranges through its banking and financial services relationships.Furthermore, both parties have agreed to cooperate on new energy initiatives, including electric battery, hydrogen, and charging station networks, with Ideanomics contributing its relationships with leading partners in this field. Ideanomics is currently working with a number of partners in this area and plans to also derive a share of the recurring revenues from the charging networks it is partnering to facilitate."We are very pleased to be partnering with Ankai, as part of our Bus and Tour Bus initiatives. This, along with our other manufacturing partnerships that have been recently announced, will help speed up the time-to-market for sales orders received, as well as help facilitate a rounded offering of small, medium, and large buses required to service the different markets we are operating in," said Alf Poor, CEO of Ideanomics. "This deal epitomizes the S2F2C (Sales to Financing to Charging) model which Ideanomics is pioneering for the benefit of streamlining and mobilizing the migration from fossil fuels to clean tech fuels. Our intentions with S2F2C is to become the lynchpin for the EV and Hydrogen bus markets, such that both manufacturers and the state-owned and private bus operators see Ideanomics as a one-stop solution for access to all of their vehicle procurement, financing, and charging station network needs. Our immediate objectives with Ankai, and our other manufacturing partners, is to establish a full value chain to support the Chinese government's mandate for clean energy buses by 2020, as well as begin the process for exporting these world-leading manufacturers to the Asean region and beyond. This will see Ideanomics use our expertise and industry connections to enable expedient planning in areas such as right-hand drive vehicles, for those particular markets, as well as the certification and suitability of the vehicles for all of our target markets".The Ankai pure electric double-layer 5G bus connects the 5G smart bus vehicle big data real-time supervision platform, which can integrate the previously separated data systems and platforms to form intelligent central control, thus harvesting the smart public transportation "cloud brain" platform reputation.Ankai continues to build and develop green, energy-saving and intelligent transportation service systems around the international development strategy of "creating global brands and becoming the world's Ankai", enabling Chinese manufacturing to go global and provide better quality transportation service to the people of the world. About AnkaiAs a subsidiary company to Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Co., Ltd.

Where In The World Is Justin Sun?Stillman Advance: Stillman CollegeJuly 30, 2019 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: MARKETS; Pg. 1Length: 369 wordsByline: Jean GarciaBodyThe 29-year-old founder of the cryptocurrency Tron, Sun paid a whopping $4.57 million for a private lunch with Buffett at an annual charity auction held in April.It all started when the Tron Foundation abruptly scrubbed Justin Sun's $4.57 million Thursday lunch-date with Warren Buffett, with Sun stating that he had kidney stones and would reschedule the meeting for a future date.Local media reported that Sun was barred from foreign travel due to allegations including illegal fundraising, money laundering, and gambling.Warren Buffet is wildly popular in China and Sun has been promoting the lunch heavily since his winning bid was announced.Buffett, the billionaire chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), has always been a skeptic of cryptocurrency. Solar, who launched Tronix in 2017, acknowledged in June that he hoped to educate Buffett, a self-professed cryptocurrency critic, on the benefits of crypto and the underlying technology, blockchain.After undergoing treatment in hospital Sun is in stable condition and recovering, according to the announcement.Dueling meteor showers will create cosmic light show in IndianaThese include suburban areas with little to none light pollution or clear spots out in the countryside. EarthSky notes that the Delta Aquariid shower is active every year from about July 12 to August 23.The outlet additionally argues that Sun cannot abandon the nation, and that is the true motive why Sun chose to reschedule theWarren Buffett lunch and news conferences to an unknown deadline.Tron launched its TRX token in 2017, raising about $70 million in an initial coin offering, and acquired San Francisco-based BitTorrent for $120 million previous year.Sun founded cryptocurrency TRON, which is now the world's 10th largest.Following the release of the early reports, Sun took to Weibo to clear the air and deny all accusations.Chinese media outlet Caixin is claiming that Sun has been detained by the Chinese government and is unable to leave the country.At this point, we're left with far more questions than answers, but if the worst of the allegations turn out to be accurate, we could be witnessing the ultimate Tron bait-and-switch - the archetypical proof of Sun's Law.Load-Date: July 30, 2019End of Document

REP. HERN HOSTS TOWN HALL WITH MORE THAN 4,300 CONSTITUENTSStates News ServiceJuly 16, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 852 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the office of Oklahoma Rep. Kevin Hern:Representative Kevin Hern (OK-01) hosted a town hall on July 15, 2019. More than 4,300 constituents participated, either on the call or live-streaming from Rep. Hern's website.Attendees were from all over the First Congressional District, including Tulsa, Broken Arrow, Bartlesville, Sand Springs, and Wagoner.Rep. Hern took questions from callers, as well as questions submitted on Facebook and through the online portal. While many constituents were curious about immigration developments and the crisis on our Southern border, questions ranged from trade to foreign affairs to disaster aid to religious liberty."As a representative of my constituents, there's nothing more important to me than connecting with them, talking to them, and listening to what they have to say," said Rep. Hern. "Doing a town hall in the virtual setting allows me to connect with many, many more people in a convenient way. People can participate from the comfort of their own home, or they can listen in while at the grocery store or driving home from work. I've been working hard to keep an open line of communication with my constituents, and I look forward to hosting more town hall events as my time in Congress continues."The event was promoted on social media channels with a dial-in number and a link to live stream the audio on Rep. Hern's website. In addition, thousands of constituents were called and invited to join the event.Excerpts:Mark from Broken Arrow: China wants to overtake the United States with tech they've largely stolen. We have to fight back with better technology and take back our technologically superior economy. Is there a coalescing of agreement on that?Rep. Hern: That's what the President's main concern is with trade. The deficits with trade deals are bad we're talking $500 billion in deficits with our trade with China. More importantly, it's the stealing of our technology. They have an economy that is growing about 7% a year, they clandestinely own many of the companies that compete with us globally. They have a program that's called Belt and Road, which I encourage you to look up. With this program, they're going through less developed countries and building infrastructure, loaning money to these countries that they cannot ever pay back. Then they foreclose on them and take those properties as an extension of the Chinese government into those under-developed countries. They know how to do this. We're dealing with countries who have leaders with no terms. They can be very patient and wait out the current leader of the free world. We need to be cognizant and push back.Andrea from Tulsa: I hear that Tulsa might become a sanctuary city, is that correct? What steps do we take as citizens of this city and the state of Oklahoma to prevent that from happening?Rep. Hern: That's a great question. Much has been made in the last few days about the deportation efforts by the government, and I'd like to remind everybody on the call that President Obama deported more than 3 million people during his 8 years in office, about 400,000 per year. President Trump has deported about 400,000 people in a 2-year period, about half of what President Obama did. The process that Democrats and all of us, really, are asking them to do is for asylum seekers to go through our court system, have their case listened to, and be granted asylum or sent back home. Of the thousands that are sent to court, only about 15% qualify for asylum. 85% are given notice to leave the country. Those in the 85%, who have not left the country, that's who the executive branch is looking for with deportations. When you have a mayor that says, "immigrants are welcome", I'd hope every mayor would say that legal immigrants are welcome. Our country is made up of legal immigrants. It's the illegal immigrants, the ones who have violated the law, that I find troubling when a mayor is willing to say that. We want to follow the rule of law in this country, and when you blatantly, as a lawmaker in DC or in the statehouse or as the mayor of a city, want to tell people to violate the very law that you swore an oath not to violate, I find that very troubling. I'd reach out to your mayor, city council, police officers, state legislators, me as your Congressman and your U.S. Senators, to let us know how you feel.Leland from Broken Arrow: Are you supporting any gun control legislation in the House? I don't support gun control.Rep. Hern: Me neither. I've been an avid hunter, had guns my entire life. I'm a lifetime member of Gun Owners of America, lifetime member of the NRA. We have other issues we need to deal with, one of them being mental health readiness, understanding that. I've spent a lot of time researching this, it's not our guns that are causing the problem. I have a hard time with the definition of an assault rifle, there are many guns that have multiple rounds in them, or more than one. It's not the gun's fault, it's the fault of the people buying the guns. We have other issues to deal with in that area.###Load-Date: July 25, 2019End of Document

Huawei Mate 30 may launch without licensed AndroidStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeAugust 30, 2019 FridayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: HI TECH; Pg. 1Length: 430 wordsByline: Sandy MccarthyBodyWhile U.S. companies can apply for licenses for products to be exempt from the ban, it's not looking good for Huawei at the present time.Earlier this month, the USA government that is run by the Trump administration had given an extension toHuawei's business customers in America to switch to other suppliers.The Middle Kingdom mobe-maker's forthcoming phone is the first smartphone created to work with next-generation 5G networks and is due to be launched in Munich on September 18.So barring a trade deal in the coming days,Huawei's upcoming mobile phones can not be sold with licensed Google apps and services because of the ban, a Google spokesperson tells Reuters. None have been approved.Google would not tell Reuters whether it had applied for a license to offer its apps and services known asGoogle Mobile Services, though it has said in the past that it wants to continue supplyingHuawei.Google Pixel Watch could have a camera in an unexpected placeGoogle's hardware has never sold well, but the firm continues to believe it can grow, especially in the smartphone market. Google is also going to be shifting some of its Pixel 3a production out of China to Vietnam before the end of the year.NewHuawei phones reportedly can't use Android.As it stands right now, it seems the next smartphone launched byHuawei will not be able to access any Google services or apps.People familiar with the matter told the same source that the unveiling could take place on September 18 in Munich, but specifics on when the Mate 30 could hit the shelves aren't available for now. Consumers overwhelmingly expect Android devices in western markets to come with these key apps, as services such as Gmail and Google Maps are incredibly popular. CitingHuawei's close ties with the Chinese government, the USA government has also worked to push the company out of the running for providing 5G infrastructure.But this doesn't mean thatHuawei can't use Android any more. In the words of independent analystRichard Windsor to Reuters: "Without Google services, no one will buy this device".Huawei is confident that other hardware in the new phone will be compliant withUnited States law. If the leaks and rumours are true, the Mate 30 Pro will come packing a Kirin 990 processor, a gargantuan rear quad camera, support for 5G networks and the latest official version of Android.Huawei's HiSilicon division designed the chip by itself. Meaning, its upcoming smartphones, and other devices are banned from using American software and hardware without the approval of the U.S. Department of Commerce.Load-Date: August 30, 2019End of Document

Dec: 1232Moving the MarketSector WatchSome consolidation from record highs in front Apple's (AAPL) earnings report after the close and the Fed's rate decision tomorrowPresident Trump calls out China for not buying U.S. agricultural products; trade talks are ongoing in Shanghai Strongest consumer confidence reading since Nov. 2018Strong: Energy, Real Estate, Materials, Consumer StaplesWeak: Utilities, Communication Services, Consumer Discretionary, Information Technology13:35 ETDow -58.28 at 27163.07, Nasdaq -26.26 at 8267.07, S&P -10.73 at 3010.24[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages are little changed in the last 30 minutes; the Dow Jones Industrial Average still holds the softest declines on Tuesday, down about 0.21%.Today's losses in Dow Jones Industrial Average constituent Pfizer (PFE 38.85, -2.60, -6.27%) have been widely covered; behind PFE shares of Caterpillar (CAT 132.64, -1.82, -1.35%), Walt Disney (DIS 144.71, -1.68, -1.15%), and Intel (INTC 51.98, -0.53, -1.01%) cling to decent losses. DIS gives back a portion of yesterday's all-time highs which were tied to a strong weekend from the company's The Lion King remake, while INTC falls following a cautious sell side mention.Conversely, Boeing (BA 343.38, +3.17, +0.93%) sits near the top of the index, recovering slightly from recent losses, as it appears no bad news is essentially good news for the embattled aerospace and defense company.The DJIA gives back a portion of the recovery from the last two days, now down some 0.68% over the last calendar week.12:55 ETDow -56.49 at 27164.86, Nasdaq -30.01 at 8263.32, S&P -11.00 at 3009.97[BRIEFING.COM] The stock market has wavered in negative territory today with the S&P 500 currently down 0.3%. There hasn't been much buying conviction in the broader market, although the small-cap Russell 2000 (+0.5%) has seen some positive action. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.4%.Several factors that have contributed to the negative disposition include President Trump saying there are no signs of China buying U.S. agricultural products, some cautious trading ahead of Apple's (AAPL 208.08, -1.59, -0.8%) earnings report after the close and the Fed's rate decision tomorrow, and the disappointing price action in shares of Beyond Meat (BYND 205.01, -17.12, -7.7%) following its report.Beyond Meat is perhaps more a reflection of how far many stocks, and the stock market to a certain extent, have come in a short period of time. It isn't too surprising to see some broader consolidation -- or to see shares of Beyond Meat attempting a recovery after being down as much as 17% today.The stock market, too, has come off its lows. At this juncture, the utilities (-0.7%), information technology (-0.6%), and consumer discretionary (-0.6%) sectors are underperforming, while the materials (+0.5%), real estate (+0.5%), energy (+0.5%), and consumer staples (+0.4%) sectors are outperforming.In corporate news, Procter & Gamble (PG 121.29, +5.29, +4.6%) and Merck (MRK 83.42, +0.94, +1.1%) both beat top and bottom-line estimates. Shares are up nicely on the results, while shares of fellow Dow component Pfizer (PFE 39.02, -2.44) are down 5.9% after being downgraded at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley. Capital One (COF 89.99, -6.93, -7.2%), meanwhile, is feeling the fallout from a data breach that affected over 100 million customers.Separately, an expectation that interest rates will remain low has prompted Goldman Sachs to raise its S&P 500 2019 year-end target to 3100 and set a 2020 year-end price target of 3400. Currently, the benchmark 10-yr note yield is up one basis point to 2.07%.Reviewing today's economic data, which included the Personal Income and Spending Report for June, the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for July, the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for May, and Pending Home Sales for June:Personal income increased 0.4% (Briefing.com consensus 0.4%) while personal spending rose 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) m/m in June. The PCE Price Index was up 0.1%, as expected, and the core PCE price Index, which excludes food and energy, jumped 0.2%, also as expected. On a yr/yr basis, the PCE Price Index held steady at 1.4% while the core PCE Price Index edged up to 1.6% from 1.5% in May.The key takeaway from the report is that it contained decent consumer data and tame inflation data, which is not all that surprising relative to recent data seen of late.The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index surged to 135.7 in July (Briefing.com consensus 125.5) from an upwardly revised 124.3 (from 121.5) in June. That is the highest reading since November 2018 and the third-highest reading since October 2000.The key takeaway from the report is that consumers are optimistic about current and prospective business and labor market conditions, and have improved expectations for their financial outlook. That is a supportive combination that will encourage increased consumer spending activity.The S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for May increased 2.4% (Briefing.com consensus 3.5%) after increasing 2.5% in April.Pending Home Sales increased 1.6% in June (Briefing.com consensus +1.0%). Today's reading follows an unrevised increase of 1.1% in May. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1495/1388. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1702/1263.12:25 ETDow -48.62 at 27172.73, Nasdaq -27.14 at 8266.19, S&P -9.68 at 3011.29[BRIEFING.COM] The stock market has wavered in negative territory without much conviction, much like yesterday's session. The S&P 500 is down 0.3%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows Facebook (FB 197.14, +1.20, +0.6%) as the lone stock trading higher, while Netflix (NFLX 324.65, -8.05, -2.4%) underperforms. Apple (AAPL 2018.19, -1.50, -0.7%), Amazon (AMZN 1897.51, -14.84, -0.8%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1229.59, -9.82, -0.8%) trade with losses just below 1%.In earnings news, shares of Eli Lilly (LLY 109.46, +0.75, +0.7%) are up after the company beat profit estimates and raised its FY19 EPS outlook.11:55 ETDow -55.98 at 27165.37, Nasdaq -29.89 at 8263.44, S&P -10.57 at 3010.4[BRIEFING.COM] The rebound attempt has lost some steam, as the S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.4%. It was still a encouraging to see the benchmark index holding above the 3000 level at its lowest point today.Apple (AAPL 208.21, -1.47, -0.7%) will take the spotlight after today's closing bell when it releases its earnings report. Analyst expectations are low, but interest is high for one of the market's most widely-owned stocks that has already surged nearly 32% this year.Overseas, the major European indices closed on lower note. Germany's DAX lost 2.1%, UK's FTSE lost 0.5%, and France's CAC lost 1.6%. The Europe Stoxx 600 declined 1.5%.11:25 ETDow -24.31 at 27197.04, Nasdaq -24.51 at 8268.82, S&P -8.12 at 3012.85[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have pared early losses and now trade near session highs. The S&P 500 is down 0.3%, the Dow is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq is down 0.3%.The Dow has received some support from shares of Procter & Gamble (PG 121.00, +5.00, +4.3%) and Merck (MRK 83.15, +0.65, +0.8%) following their earnings reports. The blue-chip average, however, is being pressured by losses in most components, including Pfizer (PFE 39.32, -2.12, -5.1%), which was downgraded at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley.Separately, shares of Capital One (COF 90.05, -6.87, -7.1%) are getting hit after the company announced a data breach that affected around 100 million customers in the United States and six million in Canada. The suspected hacker has been arrested.10:55 ETDow -46.35 at 27175, Nasdaq -27.63 at 8265.7, S&P -9.07 at 3011.9[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.4%, recouping some of its opening losses. Today's lower start has reflected some consolidation from record highs, but there have also been some convenient selling narratives.One of those includes President Trump calling out China for not buying U.S. agricultural products despite it agreeing to do so. Another one could be a lack of buying interest, much like yesterday, in front of the Fed's rate decision tomorrow.Separately, shares of Beyond Meat (BYND 199.40, -22.73) have dropped 10.3% following its earnings report. It wasn't a bad report, per se, but the company announcing a secondary stock offering has undercut sentiment for this year's hottest stock. In addition, its poor showing today has caused some investors to reconsider stocks that have also caught fire this year.10:30 ETDow -70.77 at 27150.58, Nasdaq -37.70 at 8255.63, S&P -11.72 at 3009.25[BRIEFING.COM] Commodities are lower (-0.2% at 78.88 as measured by the Bloomberg Commodity Index)Dollar index is higher (+0.1% at 98.11)Looking at energy:Aug WTI crude oil futures are now +$0.28 (+0.5%) at $57.16/barrel Aug natural gas is +$0.01 (-0.8%) at $2.13/MMBtuMoving on to metals:Aug gold is currently +$6.20 at $1426.70/oz, while Jul silver is +$0.06 (+0.4%) at $16.51/ozSept copper is now -$0.03 (-1.2%) at $2.68/lb ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1084/1697. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1070/1739.10:05 ETDow -70.83 at 27150.52, Nasdaq -41.09 at 8252.24, S&P -11.00 at 3009.97[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades lower by 0.4%, and the Russell 2000 trades lower by 0.5%.Just in, the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index increased to 135.7 in July (Briefing.com consensus 125.5) from a revised 124.3 in June (from 121.5).Separately, Pending Home Sales increased 1.6% in June (Briefing.com consensus +1.0%). Today's reading follows an unrevised increase of 1.1% in May.09:45 ETDow -113.35 at 27108, Nasdaq -44.21 at 8249.12, S&P -14.31 at 3006.66[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages begin the day lower, partly due to some caution ahead of the Fed's rate decision tomorrow and negative trade rhetoric from President Trump. The S&P 500 is down 0.5%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.5%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows consumer discretionary (-0.7%), health care (-0.7%), and industrials (-0.7%) leading the market lower. Conversely, the utilities (+0.1%), consumer staples (+0.2%) and real estate (+0.6%) sectors are the lone sectors trading higher.U.S. Treasuries are trading near their unchanged marks. The 2-yr yield is up one basis point to 1.85%, and the 10-yield is down one basis point to 2.05%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.1% to 98.11.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -59.60.The stock market is on pace to pull back further from all-time highs at the open. Currently, the S&P 500 futures trade 15 points, or 0.5%, below fair value.De-risking efforts appear to be contributing to the negative disposition, partly due to negative trade rhetoric from President Trump stirring trade concerns. Specifically, the president tweeted that there are "no signs" that China has begun to buy U.S. agricultural products. The topic is likely to come up during the ongoing trade talks in Shanghai.In addition, the 16% drop in shares of Beyond Meat (BYND 186.10, -36.03, -16.2%) following its earnings report has perhaps reflected some complacency in the economic growth outlook.Dow components Procter & Gamble (PG 121.39, +5.39, +4.7%) and Merck (MRK 84.87, +2.38, +2.9%) have provided some support for the market after both beat top and bottom-line estimates. Fellow Dow member Pfizer (PFE 40.40, -1.05, -2.5%) is down after Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to the equivalent of a Neutral rating.Earlier, the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for May increased 2.4% (Briefing.com consensus 3.5%) after increasing 2.5% in April.08:50 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -15.40.

All Rights ReservedLength: 233 wordsByline: Scott Van VoorhisHighlight: Facebook removed pages, groups and accounts that it contends were "involved in coordinated inauthentic behavior" by a "small network" in China aimed at stirring anger against the protesters in Hong Kong.BodyFacebook and Twitter on Monday both disclosed crackdowns on fake accounts originating in China that were being used to target misinformation and propaganda at protesters in Hong Kong. Facebook  said it had "removed seven Pages, three Groups and five Facebook accounts" that it said were "involved in coordinated inauthentic behavior" on part of what it described as "small network" in China. The individuals involved used fake accounts and other "deceptive tactics" to "manage Pages posting as news organizations," wrote Nathaniel Gleicher, head of cybersecurity policy for Facebook.The group, which Facebook tied to individuals linked to the Chinese government, compared the Hong Kong protesters to ISIS fighters and "cockroaches," while accusing the protesters of overtly violent behavior, accompanied by photos of an injured police officer and nurse.Twitter  said it was suspending 936 accounts involved in a "significant state-backed information operation focused on the situation in Hong Kong" that it traced back to mainland China.The objectionable tweets also featured similar themes aimed to discredit the protesters by using fake accounts."Specifically, we identified large clusters of accounts behaving in a coordinated manner to amplify messages related to the Hong Kong protests," Twitter said in a statement.Facebook shares closed at $186.17, up 1.3%, while Twitter rose 2.8% to $41.70.Load-Date: August 20, 2019End of Document

Trump threatens Apple with tariffs on its Mac Pro computersCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 26, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 411 wordsBodyU.S. President Donald Trump on Friday threatened Apple with imposing tariffs on components of its high-end Mac Pro computer, the most expensive of those produced by the company, if it finally decides to move its manufacturing from the U.S. to China."Apple will not receive exemptions or relief from Mac Pro components manufactured in China. Make them in America, there are no tariffs," the representative said on Twitter.Right after Trump's message, Apple's value on the Nasdaq index, where major tech groups trade, slightly lowered.As the Wall Street Journal unveiled in June, Apple plans to move its Mac Pro computer from the US to China, despite the trade war between the two powers.According to the New York rotaper, which cited the company's "plan-savvy sources," Apple has chosen Chinese contractor Quanta Computer Inc. to produce the new Mac Pro at one of its Shanghai plants near other factories that already create products for The signature.The Mac Pro, whose latest model was presented at the developer conference WWDC19 that the company held in early June in San Jose (California, USA) is a computer model designed primarily for professionals in video design and editing, and $6,000.It is the last major device that Apple still manufactured in the US - although as a luxury product, production is very low - and Cupertino's company has decided to move its manufacturing at a time of peak commercial tension between the Us and China and China and despite the possibility of tariffs being increased.That is why, as of June, the company that runs Tim Cook requested by letter to the US Government not to apply new tariffs on imports from China, as they would affect products such as iPhone phones, iPad tablets, Mac computers, AirPods and AppleTV digital players.In the missive, addressed to US Foreign Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, Apple directly asked him to "do not impose tariffs on these products."Washington and Beijing plunged into a trade war in 2018 that led Trump to impose tariffs on all Chinese goods imported annually to the US, worth US$300 billion; while the government of Chinese President Xi Jinping did the same with US products valued at $60 billion.At the recent G20 summit in June, Trump and Xi agreed to a trade truce, so since then they have imposed no more tariffs, although those they have already decreed remain in force.The Trump entry threatens Apple with tariffs to its Mac Pro computers was first published in The Third.Load-Date: July 27, 2019End of Document

The Russell 2000 rose 1.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased just 0.2%.Friday's session, much like in the days before, included its fair share of better-than-expected earnings reports. Alphabet gets the lead due to its mega-cap status, but honorable mentions include Starbucks (SBUX 99.11, +8.13, +8.9%) and Twitter (TWTR 41.80, +3.68, +9.7%). Dow components Intel (INTC 51.59, -0.57, -1.1%) and McDonald's (MCD 215.58, +1.14, +0.5%) underperformed despite positive results.Besides earnings, the fact that the U.S. economy continues to grow at a healthy pace was a positive consideration for investors.

Laggards included energy (-0.5%) and industrials (-0.2%), although losses were modest.Amazon (AMZN 1942.70, -31.22, -1.6%) was also left out of the advance after the company missed profit estimates and guided Q3 operating income below expectations.In corporate news, Intel confirmed that Apple (AAPL 207.74, +0.72, +0.4%) will acquire most of its smartphone modem chip business for $1 billion. 3M (MMM 173.98, -4.15, -2.3%) disclosed an internal investigation to determine if its expenditures may have violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

The GDP Price Deflator was up 2.4% (Briefing.com consensus 1.8%) after increasing 1.1% in the first quarter.The key takeaway from the report is that it revealed some impressive strength in the U.S. consumer, evidenced by the 4.3% growth in personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which was the second highest over the past 16 quarters.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -4.40.The S&P 500 futures trade two points, or 0.1%, below fair value. The S&P 500 is up 2.9% in July with three trading sessions left.Reviewing the S&P 500 sector standing this month shows information technology (+5.6%) and communication services (+5.4%) leading the benchmark index higher. Conversely, the energy (-2.1%) and health care (-0.7%) sectors are the lone sectors in negative territory this month.Separately, shares of PayPal (PYPL 113.60, -1.89) are down 1.6% in pre-market action after the stock was downgraded to Sell from Neutral at Guggenheim.07:56 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -0.40. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -4.10.The S&P 500 futures trade roughly in-line with fair value ahead of an eventful week on Wall Street. The week will feature the FOMC's rate decision on Wednesday, the July employment report on Friday, and earnings reports throughout the week.U.S.-China trade talks will also resume on Tuesday for a two-day meeting in Beijing, but expectations for the high-level meeting are low. On the other hand, the Fed will kick off its two-day policy meeting tomorrow, and expectations are high for a rate cut of at least 25 basis points at the conclusion of the meeting.It isn't too surprising to see some hesitation this morning ahead of these potential market-moving events, especially after the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite hit new all-time highs on Friday. Also, while there will be no notable economic data released today, there are some health care corporate news for investors to parse through.Dow component Pfizer (PFE 42.45, -0.64, -1.5%) missed revenue estimates and lowered its full-year guidance to reflect anticipated completions of prior acquisitions. In addition, Mylan N.V. (MYL 21.55, +3.09, +16.7%) will combine with Pfizer's off-patent drug business with Mylan shareholders owning 43% of the combined company.U.S. Treasuries have edged higher, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield and the 10-yr yield are down three basis points each to 1.84% and 2.05%, respectively. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.1% to 98.11.

Police: First shot fired in Hong Kong protest 'necessary'UPIAugust 25, 2019 Sunday 12:21 PM ESTCopyright 2019 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 535 wordsByline: DANIEL URIA&DARRYL COOTEDateline: Aug. 25 BodyHong Kong police on Monday defended officers who pulled guns on protesters during a demonstration the night before.Senior Superintendent Yolanda Yu of the Police Public Relations Branch said in a press conference that police condemned the "extreme violence" by "rioters" Sunday night while defending the six officers who drew their service weapons, saying they did so because their "lives were under threat."The weapons were pulled to protect themselves and others at Sha Tsui Road where police and protesters clashed at around 8 p.m. following an afternoon march during the 12th consecutive week of mass protests in Hong Kong, she said.On Sunday, a group of protesters separated from the main march, using traffic cones and street railings to build barricades and throw bricks and petrol bombs at police.Police deployed tear gas but failed to disperse the group and later fired water cannons at the makeshift barricade.During the confrontation, one officer shot a round into the air, the first live ammunition fired during the three months of protests.Yolanda said Monday morning that the officer fired his weapon in order to protect another officer who had fallen as protesters charged."The officer acted heroically and with restraint, and the force used under the circumstances was necessary and reasonable," she said, adding that no one was injured as a result of the officer's actions.In a statement, police said 15 officers were injured and sent to the hospital while 29 men and seven women, ranging in ages from 12 to 48, were arrested for offenses including unlawful assembly, possession of offensive weapon and assaulting police officers."The protesters' violence disregarded the law and order," the police said in the statement. "Police severely condemn such violence, which was outrageous and have overstepped the bottom line of a civilized society."The police department said on Twitter that commissioner Lo Wai-chung visited the injured officers at  Hospital and that the police force "will strive to investigate all violent acts that have caused serious and even life-threatening injuries."Meanwhile, police supporters held their own rally on Sunday, calling for communication between police and the public to "mend the broken relationship."Senior police officials said some officers had their personal data, including contact information and home addresses shared online and 16 people were arrested for disclosing personal data without consent, causing harm and unauthorized access to a computer.Hong Kong leader  posted a statement on Facebook, calling for dialogue and an end to the protests."After two months everyone is tired. Can we sit down and talk about it?" she said.Hong Kong has been rocked with protests since early June against a bill that would allow for extradition to mainland China, a move activists view as a chipping away at the rights Hong Kong enjoys as a semi-autonomous region. They also view the law a possible weapon to use against critics of the Chinese government.The protests have since evolved into a larger pro-democracy movement following claims of police brutality and anger at the local government for not heeding their demands, which include the resignation of Lam.Load-Date: August 27, 2019End of Document

The trade war with China is coming for the American computer industryCNN WireAugust 2, 2019 Friday 4:29 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 797 wordsByline: By Clare Duffy, CNN BusinessDateline: NEW YORK (CNN Business) BodyNEW YORK (CNN Business) --  The heart of the American computer industry is getting hit from all sides of the trade war.Chipmakers have been punished over the past two months after the White House put Huawei in the dog house. President Donald Trump's newly proposed tariffs on Chinese imports will sting even more.Intel, Qualcomm and Advanced Micro Devices recently said that ongoing trade tensions with China and restrictions on selling to Huawei are weighing on their bottom lines and forecasts."Tariff and trade uncertainties created anxiety across our customer supply chains," Intel CEO Bob Swan said on a conference call with shareholders on July 25. Companies want the White House to resolve the trade war. Instead, Trump said Thursday the United States would impose a 10% tariff on the remaining $300 billion in Chinese goods that were not already subject to tariffs. Those goods, which will include laptops, smartphones and other technology, will hit the chipmakers particularly hard.The Huawei ban threatens American businesses, too. Chipmakers have asked the Trump administration to allow sales to Huawei to resume. Last week, chief executives from seven US suppliers to Huawei met with Trump to discuss the restrictions. They included the CEOs of Qualcomm, Google, Intel, Broadcom, Micron, Western Digital and Cisco. The Trump administration in May barred US firms from using Huawei telecom gear and from selling to the Chinese company. The US government fears Huawei's telecom equipment poses a national security threat, a claim Huawei denies. The administration later added five additional Chinese companies to the same "Entity List" of banned businesses.Trump said in June he would relax the Huawei export ban, but there has been confusion on exactly what US suppliers will be able to ship and when. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has said the government could begin responding next week to US companies requesting licenses to resume sales to Huawei, according to a Reuters report. But in the meantime, many of those companies fear their sales will suffer as a result of the restrictions and general trade uncertainty. Chip companies fear future lossesQualcomm on Wednesday posted revenue of $4.9 billion for the quarter ending in June, down 13% from the same period in the prior year. The company said that was in part because Huawei, a major buyer of Qualcomm's chips for cell phones to be sold outside of China, has changed its business strategy in response to the export ban.Qualcomm also announced projected full-year chip shipments of between $140 million and $160 million, which would be a 31% to 40% decrease from the prior year. And CEO Steve Mollenkopf said the Huawei export ban is expected to continue to "create headwinds" in the next two quarters.AMD also had a challenging quarter. On Wednesday, it posted a 13% drop in revenue for the three months ending in June. AMD was particularly hurt by the US government's additions to the Entity List in June, because three of the Chinese businesses added to it were part of a joint venture AMD has in China to license its microchip technology. "We have stopped shipping some products to a couple of our customers that are on the US Entity List and that is a little bit of a headwind into the second half of the year," AMD chief executive Lisa Su said on the earnings call. Much of the potential impact of the Huawei export ban has not yet been realized, said Bank of America analyst Tal Liani. Huawei anticipated the ban and made additional purchases from US suppliers to build up its inventory, meaning the American companies got a bump in sales that mitigated declines. "Huawei built very high levels of inventory of components, so we have not seen any major impact as of yet," Liani said. "But that's temporary." Some American companies have resumed sales of select products to Huawei that they determined not to be covered by the export ban. Micron was the first chip company to announce it had done so during its earnings call last month. Still, the company's earnings in the three months ending May were dragged down by the inability to sell to Huawei. Huawei was previously Micron's top customer, and contributed 13% of its revenue in the first half of 2019. Intel's Swan said during his company's earnings call last week that Intel has also restarted some shipments to Chinese companies that had been placed on the Entity List, though he did not mention Huawei by name. But it's unclear whether those actions will be enough to completely stem losses if the export ban remains in place and trade tensions continue to fester. "Resolving the trade issues is very important for Huawei and also for the US companies," Liani said. TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Analyzing the Global Semiconductors Industry, 2019-2022 - ResearchAndMarkets.comBusiness WireAugust 14, 2019 Wednesday 3:38 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Business Wire, Inc.Length: 897 wordsDateline: DUBLIN BodyThe "Analyzing the Global Semiconductors Industry 2019" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.The year 2019 is a year of contraction for the global semiconductor industry, especially surrounded by intense economic uncertainties stemming from the US-China trade war. However, from 2020, the industry is again poised for strong growth as artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly adding to global demand.With technological innovation happening at a breakneck speed worldwide, the semiconductor industry is also no exception to this, and it can look forward to significant growth in the coming years following a rather weak 2019.In 2018, global semiconductor sales stood at a total of US$ 481 billion, and over the coming four years, sales are expected to keep growing (albeit at a slower rate) to cross US$572 billion by the end of 2022. Samsung, a leading player in the global semiconductor industry, has recently undertaken a massive capital spending on its semiconductor division and this is expected to drive overcapacity in the memory segment, likely causing a fall in sales of memory products in 2019. Nevertheless, 2020 will witness a recovery of the sector once again.The global semiconductor industry is expected to be massively driven by the demand for chips that are related to the booming artificial intelligence sector. Much of this demand is likely to emerge from the industrial and automotive markets, with the automotive market expected to grow the fastest through 2022.The introduction of the 5G technology and its growth in emerging markets is going to drive the use of semiconductors in the communications market while the continuing growth of video game consoles and handhelds, TVs, and digital set-top boxes will continue to drive the need for semiconductors in the consumer electronics markets. Growth in optoelectronic chips is also expected to remain healthy.Asia Pacific will continue to lead the global semiconductor market and will remain the most significant contributor to the industry revenues. China is currently the biggest purchaser and importer of chips, and the development of the semiconductor industry is going to remain a huge priority for the Chinese government.Overall, artificial intelligence is going to emerge as the next new catalyst for at least the coming decade for the global semiconductor market. Connectivity, sensing, and instant computing are going to be responsible for driving a dramatic demand for AI-tailored semiconductors in the coming years, with the Asia Pacific continuing to lead the industry.Players analyzed include the industry stalwarts such as Texas Instruments, Intel Corporation, Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix, STMicroelectronics, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, amongst many others.Key Topics Covered:A.

However, from 2020, the industry is again poised for strong growth as artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly adding to global demand.With technological innovation happening at a breakneck speed worldwide, the semiconductor industry is also no exception to this, and it can look forward to significant growth in the coming years following a rather weak 2019.In 2018, global semiconductor sales stood at a total of US$ 481 billion, and over the coming four years, sales are expected to keep growing (albeit at a slower rate) to cross US$572 billion by the end of 2022. Samsung, a leading player in the global semiconductor industry, has recently undertaken a massive capital spending on its semiconductor division and this is expected to drive overcapacity in the memory segment, likely causing a fall in sales of memory products in 2019. Nevertheless, 2020 will witness a recovery of the sector once again.The global semiconductor industry is expected to be massively driven by the demand for chips that are related to the booming artificial intelligence sector.

The reason for this blockade is to combat any "coordinated operation of influence" that may occur on the platform.This discovery claims that "it has been consistent with recent observations and actions related to China announced by Facebook and Twitter." On Monday, both social networks testified that they had suspended several accounts that were part of an information operation that sought to undermine protests in the city and that it was associated with the Chinese government.Protests in Hong Kong, which began in June, were initiated to demand the withdrawal of the extradition bill allowing those suspected of committing a crime in Hong Kong to be extradited to mainland China, although it is currently found Suspended.TECHNOLOGY Newsletter with the most important analysis and news, every Wednesday.

Tesla Analyst: Europe Business Steady, 'Demand Challenges Remain'Benzinga.comAugust 29, 2019 Thursday 1:25 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Accretive Capital LLC d/b/a Benzinga All Rights ReservedLength: 401 wordsByline: Wayne DugganBodyTesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) shares ticked higher on Thursday after one analyst said international trade disputes doesn t seem to be hurting Tesla s Euopean business as much as feared.The AnalystWedbush analyst Daniel Ives reiterated his Neutral rating and $220 price target for Tesla.The ThesisIves said checks on third-quarter Model 3 demand in Europe suggest the business is holding steady despite trade tensions.Tesla is implementing price hikes on its vehicles in China starting on Friday after the Chinese government said it plans to reinstate 25% tariffs on imported U.S. vehicles starting in December. Tesla imports all of the vehicles it sells in China, and investors can expect the company to push hard to get as many vehicles shipped there as possible prior to December.If the European business can stay on track, Ives said Europe can help offset weakness in Tesla s China business. Ives said the bigger question in Europe will be whether or not Tesla can continue to ramp-up European delivery to reach 100,000 units over the next 12 months and whether or not European demand will be as high as anticipated. In the meantime, Ives said Tesla still has to prove its business model is viable on a large scale and "demand challenges remain." In essence, unless self driving functionality and other software upgrades are sold with lower priced Model 3 units it will be a major challenge for Tesla to ramp its business model and gross margin profile in line with long term targets and therefore show profits on an ongoing basis,  Ives said.Benzinga s TakeNews that Tesla s European ramp in the third quarter is on track despite trade war concerns in good news for Tesla in the near term. However, U.S. demand in the second half of the year remains a question mark. Until Tesla can demonstrate it can consistently turn a profit, the stock will likely continue to lag the market.Do you agree with this take?

US goods going to China plummet 31.4%Stillman Advance: Stillman CollegeJuly 13, 2019 SaturdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: MARKETS; Pg. 1Length: 417 wordsByline: Jean GarciaBodyChina's exports likely fell in June as weakening global demand and a sharp hike in USA tariffs took a heavier toll on the world's largest trading nation, a Reuters poll showed.Exports fell 1.3%, while imports dropped by 7.3%.U.S. -Chinese trade has weakened since President Donald Trump started hiked tariffs past year on goods from China in a fight over Beijing's technology ambitions.Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the state-owned Global Times newspaper, tweeted late Thursday that the "achievement of Osaka summit is a China-U.S. consensus, not a unilateral commitment China made to the U.S. Hope the U.S. will lift all sanctions on Huawei soon and respect the principle of equality".Washington is pressing Beijing to roll back plans for government-led creation of Chinese global competitors in robotics, electric cars and other technologies.Chinese leaders express confidence their economy can survive the tariff fight. Mistrust between Washington and Beijing runs high."It seems the two sides are arm-wrestling about the basis on which they'll resume talks, as well as when and where", said Zhou Xiaoming, a former commerce ministry official and diplomat.At least 10 killed in bomb, gun attack on Somalia hotelShe founded Integration TV , an global web-based video production company aimed at Somali viewers around the world. It added that consular officials in Nairobi are in contact with local authorities to gather information.Trade weakness has added to pressure on Xi's government to shore up economic growth and avoid politically unsafe job losses. Mr Trump also claimed Mr Xi had agreed that China would buy large amounts of USA agricultural goods."Mexico is doing great at the Border, but China is letting us down in that they have not been buying the agricultural products from our great Farmers that they said they would".The chairman of Huawei said Friday that his company has yet to see any benefit from Trump's promise to ease restrictions on sales of components to the Chinese tech giant, which was put on a USA national security blacklist in May."They have not been buying the agricultural products from our great Farmers that they said they would", the president said on Twitter.But data released on Thursday (July 11) by the US Department of Agriculture indicate that China actually slowed its purchases of American agriculture products following the G-20 meeting.Trump's statement "highlighted how more speed bumps may remain in the road ahead", said Craig Orlam of OANDA in a report.Load-Date: July 15, 2019End of Document

Global Sports Nutrition Market to 2024 - Major Players are Glanbia, PepsiCo, MusclePharm, The Coca-Cola Company, Clif Bar & Company, MultipowerPR NewswireJuly 31, 2019 Wednesday 4:15 PM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 893 wordsDateline: DUBLIN, July 31, 2019 BodyPR NewswireThe"Sports Nutrition Market - Growth, Trends And Forecasts (2019 - 2024)"report has been added toResearchAndMarkets.com'soffering.Global sports nutrition market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 8.42% during the forecasted period (2019 - 2024).Sports nutritional products were once classified as a niche category - designed particularly for athletes and hardcore full-time sports personnel. The scenario has been altered quite significantly with such products getting popular and being demanded by more diverse consumer group - the regular exercisers and the everyday consumer looking for an extra boost in their workouts. Sports drinks product type segment is expected to account for the highest revenue share by 2024 end in global sports nutrition market attributable to a burgeoning interest in fitness and healthy lifestyle across the globe.Scope of the ReportGlobal sports nutrition market is segmented by product type into sports food, sports drink and dietary supplement. By distribution channel, the scope includes supermarkets/hypermarkets, convenience stores, specialty stores, online stores, and others.Key Market Trends'Veganism' Trend to Accelerate Revenue GenerationGlobally the mainstreaming of sports nutrition has not peaked and protein continues to reign supreme in the respective market space. Increase in plant-based diets has resulted in an increasing number of sports nutrition products being rolled out on retail shelves claiming 'natural' and 'organic', thus resulting in increased market revenues for sports nutrition products.For example, GHT Companies has introduced Vegan Life Nutrition (VLN), to provide nutritional supplements that are completely free of animal products. Vegan Life Nutrition created this supplement range to meet the growing demand for animal-free plant-based products.Also, a Harris Poll conducted in 2016 found that approximately 3% of the U.S. population eats a strictly vegetarian diet, and about half of those are vegan. The bigger revelation was that 36% opt for at least some vegetarian meals on a regular basis. All of this points to an emerging trend toward a decreasing reliance on animal-based nutrition.Asia-Pacific is the Fastest Growing MarketStrong fitness culture across the countries such as China, Japan, and Australia and the wide availability of sports nutrition products, with a plethora of brands on the market and constant new product launches, are some of the factors contributing towards increasing market for sports nutrition products across the Asia Pacific. Additionally, increasing dependency on social media marks a significant attribute in the success of sports nutrition brands, with the use of social media channels including Instagram and Facebook, as well as brand ambassadors having a strong influence on sales.Furthermore, increasing government efforts to educate consumers on the importance of fitness is further adding to the overall revenues in the Asia Pacific sports nutrition market. In this regards, in 2016, the Chinese government introduced, the National Fitness Programme, encouraging consumers to take part in various sporting activities being held throughout the country, such as marathons.Competitive LandscapeGlobal sports nutrition market is highly competitive and remained fragmented with the presence of various international as well as domestic players. Though there are many local players existing in the global sports nutrition market, brand value, high distribution network, and the demand for clean label products gives the global players an upper edge over the regional players.Major players in the global sports nutrition market are, Glanbia plc, PepsiCo, Inc., MusclePharm Corporation, The Coca-Cola Company, Clif Bar & Compan, Multipower and others.Key Topics Covered:1 INTRODUCTION1.1 Study Deliverables1.2 Study Assumptions1.3 Scope of the Study2 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY3 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY3.1 Market Overview4 MARKET DYNAMICS4.1 Market Drivers4.2 Market Restraints4.3 Porters Five Forces Analysis5 MARKET SEGMENTATION5.1 Type5.1.1 Sports Food5.1.2 Sports Drink5.1.3 Sports Supplements5.2 Distribution Channel5.2.1 Supermarkets/Hypermarkets5.2.2 Convenience Stores5.2.3 Specialty Stores5.2.4 Online Stores5.2.5 Others5.3 Geography6 COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE6.1 Market Share Analysis6.2 Most Active Companies6.3 Most Adopted Strategy6.4 Company Profiles6.4.1 Glanbia plc6.4.2 PepsiCo, Inc.6.4.3 MusclePharm Corporation6.4.4 The Coca-Cola Company6.4.5 Clif Bar & Company6.4.6 Monster Beverage Corporation6.4.7 GNC Holdings Inc.6.4.8 Abbott Laboratories Inc6.4.9 Multipower6.4.10 GNC Holdings Inc.7 MARKET OPPORTUNITIES AND FUTURE TRENDSFor more information about this report visithttps://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/6g410wResearch and Markets also offersCustom Researchservices providing focused, comprehensive and tailored research.Media Contact:Research and MarketsLaura Wood, Senior Managerpress@researchandmarkets.comFor E.S.T Office Hours Call +1-917-300-0470For U.S./CAN Toll Free Call +1-800-526-8630For GMT Office Hours Call +353-1-416-8900U.S. Fax: 646-607-1907Fax (outside U.S.): +353-1-481-1716 View original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-sports-nutrition-market-to-2024---major-players-are-glanbia-pepsico-musclepharm-the-coca-cola-company-clif-bar--company-multipower-300894238.htmlSOURCE Research and MarketsLoad-Date: August 1, 2019End of Document

Honeywell Gains Following Second Quarter ResultsJim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUSJuly 18, 2019 Thursday 12:20 PM EDTCopyright 2019 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1460 wordsByline: Jim Cramer and the AAP TeamHighlight: Overall, we thought this was a fine quarter for the company.BodyOn Thursday before the opening bell, Honeywell  reported a mixed headline result with its second quarter earnings. Although revenues of $9.23 billion came in shy of $9.35 billion consensus, earnings per share was a different story and Honeywell's $2.10 number exceeded the consensus by two pennies.Despite the mixed headline, it was still a strong quarter for Honeywell. Many companies in the sector are expected to be under the gun in the second quarter due to general economic pressures (just look at how HON reacted to aerospace weakness from Textron  yesterday) but Honeywell's re-positioned and focused portfolio still managed to deliver 5% organic sales growth, which is right in line of management's 4% to 7% guidance. Additionally, management was able to pull its levers on the margin side as segment margins expanded 80 basis points ex-spins, topping guidance of a 30-basis point to 50 basis points increase. Meanwhile, Adjusted Free Cash Flow conversion of 100% in the quarter continues to reflect multi-year operational improvements. AerospaceAerospace revenue was $3.508 billion, topping expectations of $3.427 billion. Organic sales growth was 11%, representing the fourth consecutive quarter double-digit growth and an acceleration from the first quarter's 10% number. Meanwhile, segment margins improved by 330 basis points to 25.9%.Within the segment, on an organic basis, sales increased 4% in Commercial Aviation OE on strength across its business jet platforms, 8% in Commercial Aviation Aftermarket on demand for both Air Transport and Regional Aviation as well as adoption of its Connected Aircraft technologies, and a whopping 20% in Defense and Space driven by global demand for guidance and navigation systems as well as increased spare volumes on the U.S. Department of Defense programs.Regarding the Boeing  737 Max program, management reiterated on the call that they do not anticipate a significant impact to operational results in 2019. Also of note, Honeywell addressed the sale of weapons to Taiwan by the U.S. government and mentioned that they do not see a reason why they would be sanctioned by the Chinese government over this.Honeywell Building TechnologiesHoneywell Building Technologies (HBT) revenue was $1.450 billion, edging expectations of $1.442 billion. Organic sales increased by 5%, and management continues to like the progress made in this business. Segment margins also expanded by 390 basis points to 20.7% as the team continues to make progress on eliminating stranded costs related to last year's Homes business spin.Driving the quarter was continued strength in commercial fire products, a business which management continues to innovate and launch new products in. There was also growth across Honeywell's building management software platforms which integrate building management systems and data. In buildings solutions, management saw growth in global projects across in the Americas, and its airport business in the Middle East continues to do well. Building Solutions exited the quarter with double digit projects backlog growth.PMTPerformance Materials and Technologies (PMT) sales of $2.735 billion were slightly below expectations of $2.764 billion, while organic sales increased 4% and segment margins expanded 140 basis points to 23.5%.Within the segment, organic sales increased 5% in UOP, 5% at Honeywell Process Solutions, and 2% at Advanced Materials.Breaking the segment down further, Process Solutions saw strength in its short-cycle business and a backup up 12% provides management with confidence in its growth for the second half of the year, while UOP saw strength from reinvestment in existing refining infrastructure, which is probably a product of the upcoming IMO 2020 regulation change. UOP orders and backlog were also up 10% for the quarter, and UOP orders in China saw a double-digit increase.SPSSafety and Productivity Solutions (SPS) was a much different story than what we have become accustomed to as sales of $1.55 billion missed the consensus of $1.716 billion. After several quarters in a row of double-digit organic sales growth, which made this business one of the best growth stories in the sector, SPS took a step back and organic sales actually fell by 4%.Management cited weakness in its short-cycle, high-margin productivity products (which they have flagged in their cautious guidance from before) along with a combination of continued distributor inventory destocking, fewer large project rollouts in mobile, and lower channels, as reasons for the weakness. It didn't help that comps have also become tougher in this segment, and this may become more apparent in the second half of the year.The margin story wasn't clean either, contracting 420 basis points to 12.3%. Breaking the segment down further, on an organic basis, Safety sales increased 1% (which is an acceleration from Q1's flat reading), but Productivity Solutions fell 7%.There was a bright spot, however, as the aftermarket business at Intelligrated saw double digit organic gains driven by demand for comprehensive life cycle support and service. Management remains very optimistic about the long-term outlook of this share gaining business, though third quarter performance is expected to be similar to 2Q (20% growth in aftermarket, but weakness related slower growth in large projects). Importantly, management said the backlog from blue chip customers is still robust and there is some visibility in a strong pipeline of potential awards in the third and fourth quarter.GuidanceTaking a look at the third quarter, management expects sales to be in the range of $9.0 billion to $9.2 billion (consensus $9.216 billion) with organic sales growth up 2% to 4%. Segment Margins are expected to be in the range of 20.6% to 20.8%, with earnings per share in the range of $1.97 to $2.02 (consensus $1.98). Management continues to take a conservative approach with regards to its short-cycle business, while growth in Aerospace, Process Solutions, and building products are expected to be offset by continued headwinds in productivity products.Updating for the full year 2019, management raised the low end of its guidance in organic sales, earnings per share, and adjusted free cash flow. Full year sales are now expected to be in the range of $36.7 billion to $37.2 billion ($37.188 billion), with organic sales growth between 4% and 6%. Segment margins are expected to be in the range of 20.7% to $21.0%, representing a year over year increase of 30 to 60 basis points ex-spins. Moving to the bottom line, earnings per share is expected to be between $7.95 to $8.15, which as a midpoint of $8.05 is slightly below $8.10 expectations. Finally, adjusted FCF is expected to be in the range of $5.7 billion to $6.0 billion with conversion between 98% to 100%.On the capital allocation front, management continues to utilize the balance sheet and strong free cash flows to repurchase shares, and they bought back about $1.9 billion worth of stock in the quarter. For a full year total, management said on the call that $4 billion "is probably in the right neighborhood," but there could still be EPS upside that should step up this figure. On mergers and acquisitions, management is still "very active" across all four of the businesses. We note that Honeywell's balance sheet is one of the best in its sector. Overall, we thought this was a fine quarter for the company. Let's think about what Honeywell was up against. Not only did they operate in a more challenged economic environment that will likely upend other names in the sector, expectations were lofty into the print (even with yesterday's rare pullback) due to the stock's significant outperformance year to date. Still, Honeywell was able to overcome such challenges with confidence to raise the lower end of several targets in its full year guidance.Obviously, we expect some nitpicking around the topline miss and the SPS shortfall will ding the bull thesis (it was the main subject of the conference call), but what is so great about Honeywell's portfolio right now - nearly one year post-spins which fueled an overall transformation - is that even with a disappointed print from a previously high flying segment (SPS), Honeywell's other businesses currently operate in strong end-markets and have the ability to pick up the slack to maintain organic growth, margins, and free cash flow. This is why Honeywell has been and remains our favorite industrial stock.For those looking to get in, we think there may be a better opportunity down the road as earning season tends to bring volatility with it, but we believe the quarter was positive enough for it to ultimately recover its pre-earnings highs over time. Our price target is under review.Load-Date: September 8, 2019End of Document

Sports Nutrition Market Growth, Trends And Forecasts 2019-2024 - 'Veganism' Trend to Accelerate Revenue Generation - ResearchAndMarkets.comBusiness WireJuly 31, 2019 Wednesday 3:45 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Business Wire, Inc.Length: 849 wordsDateline: DUBLIN BodyThe "Sports Nutrition Market - Growth, Trends And Forecasts (2019 - 2024)" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.Global sports nutrition market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 8.42% during the forecasted period (2019 - 2024).• Sports nutritional products were once classified as a niche category - designed particularly for athletes and hardcore full-time sports personnel. The scenario has been altered quite significantly with such products getting popular and being demanded by more diverse consumer group - the regular exercisers and the everyday consumer looking for an extra boost in their workouts.• Sports drinks product type segment is expected to account for the highest revenue share by 2024 end in global sports nutrition market attributable to a burgeoning interest in fitness and healthy lifestyle across the globe.Scope of the ReportGlobal sports nutrition market is segmented by product type into sports food, sports drink and dietary supplement. By distribution channel, the scope includes supermarkets/hypermarkets, convenience stores, specialty stores, online stores, and others.Key Market Trends'Veganism' Trend to Accelerate Revenue GenerationGlobally the main-streaming of sports nutrition has not peaked and protein continues to reign supreme in the respective market space. Increase in plant-based diets has resulted in an increasing number of sports nutrition products being rolled out on retail shelves claiming 'natural' and 'organic', thus resulting in increased market revenues for sports nutrition products.For example, GHT Companies has introduced Vegan Life Nutrition (VLN), to provide nutritional supplements that are completely free of animal products. Vegan Life Nutrition created this supplement range to meet the growing demand for animal-free plant-based products.Also, a Harris Poll conducted in 2016 found that approximately 3% of the U.S. population eats a strictly vegetarian diet, and about half of those are vegan. The bigger revelation was that 36% opt for at least some vegetarian meals on a regular basis. All of this points to an emerging trend toward a decreasing reliance on animal-based nutrition.Asia-Pacific is the Fastest Growing MarketStrong fitness culture across the countries such as China, Japan, and Australia and the wide availability of sports nutrition products, with a plethora of brands on the market and constant new product launches, are some of the factors contributing towards increasing market for sports nutrition products across the Asia Pacific. Additionally, increasing dependency on social media marks a significant attribute in the success of sports nutrition brands, with the use of social media channels including Instagram and Facebook, as well as brand ambassadors having a strong influence on sales.Furthermore, increasing government efforts to educate consumers on the importance of fitness is further adding to the overall revenues in the Asia Pacific sports nutrition market. In this regards, in 2016, the Chinese government introduced, the National Fitness Programme, encouraging consumers to take part in various sporting activities being held throughout the country, such as marathons.Competitive LandscapeGlobal sports nutrition market is highly competitive and remained fragmented with the presence of various international as well as domestic players. Though there are many local players existing in the global sports nutrition market, brand value, high distribution network, and the demand for clean label products gives the global players an upper edge over the regional players.Major players in the global sports nutrition market are, Glanbia plc, PepsiCo, Inc., MusclePharm Corporation, The Coca-Cola Company, Clif Bar & Company, Multipower and others.Key Topics Covered:1 INTRODUCTION1.1 Study Deliverables1.2 Study Assumptions1.3 Scope of the Study2 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY3 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY3.1 Market Overview4 MARKET DYNAMICS4.1 Market Drivers4.2 Market Restraints4.3 Porters Five Forces Analysis5 MARKET SEGMENTATION5.1 Type5.1.1 Sports Food5.1.2 Sports Drink5.1.3 Sports Supplements5.2 Distribution Channel5.2.1 Supermarkets/Hypermarkets5.2.2 Convenience Stores5.2.3 Specialty Stores5.2.4 Online Stores5.2.5 Others5.3 Geography6 COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE6.1 Market Share Analysis6.2 Most Active Companies6.3 Most Adopted Strategy6.4 Company Profiles6.4.1 Glanbia plc6.4.2 PepsiCo, Inc.6.4.3 MusclePharm Corporation6.4.4 The Coca-Cola Company6.4.5 Clif Bar & Company6.4.6 Monster Beverage Corporation6.4.7 GNC Holdings Inc.6.4.8 Abbott Laboratories Inc6.4.9 Multipower6.4.10 GNC Holdings Inc.7 MARKET OPPORTUNITIES AND FUTURE TRENDSFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/4urn4pView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190731005704/en/CONTACT: ResearchAndMarkets.comLaura Wood, Senior Press Managerpress@researchandmarkets.comFor E.S.T Office Hours Call 1-917-300-0470For U.S./CAN Toll Free Call 1-800-526-8630For GMT Office Hours Call +353-1-416-8900Related Topics: Health Food and Sports Nutritionhttp://www.businesswire.comLoad-Date: August 1, 2019End of Document

10 things you need to know before the opening bellBusiness Insider USJuly 16, 2019 Tuesday 06:39 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 460 wordsByline: feedback@businessinsider.com,  (Yusuf Khan)Highlight: This is what traders are talking about.BodyChip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesHere is what you need to know.1. US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin has warned that Facebook's Libra could be a tool for terrorists, traffickers, and drug smugglers. Bitcoin's price barely moved on the comments.2. UK Prime Minister candidate Boris Johnson has condemned Trump's tweets telling four congresswomen to "'go back" to where they came from. Johnson said that "if you are the leader of a great multiracial, multicultural society you simply cannot use that kind of language about sending people back to where they came from."3. Bayer is rallying after a judge slashed a payout over its cancer-linked Roundup weed killer by $55 million. Bayer's stock climbed as much as 3% on Tuesday, after the original ruling of $75 million was cut to $20 million. 4. The European Union may be about to get slapped with up to $7 billion in US tariffs over EU aid to Airbus. The tariffs would raise the costs of aircraft and helicopter parts, and also consumable goods like cheese, pasta, olives, and whiskey coming from the EU.5. Foreigners are snapping up real estate on a tiny Mediterranean island to get EU citizenship. Americans have been buying property in Malta, and it's highlighting the significance of second passports as status symbols among the wealthy.6. Australian universities reportedly collaborated with surveillance-app and racial-profiling tech developers linked to China's human rights abuses in Xinjiang. A documentary broadcast on ABC Australia accused two Australian universities of links to technology used by the Chinese government in its human rights abuses of the Uighur minority in Xinjiang. 7. EU trade gaps with the US and China have widened and it's putting further strain on relationships between the parties. The EU's trade surplus in goods with the United States and its deficit with China both increased in the first five months of 2019. 8. Stocks were mixed around the world today. S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures were both flat. In Europe, Germany's DAX slid (-0.1%) and the Euro Stoxx 50 was flat. In Asia, stocks were mixed on close, with the Nikkei 225 down (-0.7%) and the Shanghai Composite also down (-0.2%), while Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose (+0.2%).9.

Global Fluid Power Equipment Market, 2015-2018 & Outlook for 2019 - ResearchAndMarkets.comBusiness WireJuly 29, 2019 Monday 2:43 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Business Wire, Inc.Length: 1250 wordsDateline: DUBLIN BodyThe "Global Fluid Power Equipment Market Outlook, 2019" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.This report outlook analyzes the global fluid power equipment market in detail from 2015 to 2018 and provides the outlook for 2019. It examines the various product segments, end-user industries, and market shares, and offers a competitive analysis of the global market participants. Regional analyses are provided for North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA), Asia-Pacific (APAC), and the Rest of the World (ROW).Research ScopeThis study examines the key product segments, application segments, and end-user industries in each region, and provides forecasts for 2019 by end-user industry, product segments, and individual regions. In addition, it also highlights the key fluid power trends to watch for, key end-user trends, and investment patterns in the major end-user industries. This outlook also examines future growth opportunities and the strategic imperatives that need to be undertaken by market participants in order to capitalize on these growth opportunities. In this research service, the publisher's analysts examine the following product segments and end-user industries:By Product Segments:Hydraulics:• Hydraulic pumps• Hydraulic motors• Hydraulic valves• Hydraulic cylinders• Hydraulic transmission• Hydraulic filters and hydraulic accumulators• Others (fluid connectors, auxiliary components, and other accessories)Pneumatics:• Hydraulic pumps• Pneumatic valves• Pneumatic actuators• Pneumatic FRLs• Pneumatic fittings• Others (grippers, positioners, guns, and nozzles)By End-user Industry for Hydraulics:• Construction• Agriculture• Material Handling• Oil and Gas• Aerospace and Defense• Machine Tools• Hydraulic Press• Plastics• Automotive• Renewable Energy• Others (mining, commercial vehicles, marine, food and beverage, water and wastewater, chemicals, packaging, semiconductors, pulp and paper, and other niche and customized applications)By End-user Industry for Hydraulics:• Automotive• Food Processing and Packaging• Chemicals, Plastics, and Oil• Material Handling and Assembly• Semiconductors and Electronics• Metalworking• Paper and Printing• Wood and Ceramic• Life Sciences• Aerospace and Defense• Others (construction, metals and mining, entertainment, pharmaceuticals, and textiles)Following several years of decline owing to the oil and gas downturn and the knock-on effects on surrounding industries, the fluid power equipment market has demonstrated a strong recovery in the last few years. While economic sentiment has remained positive, recent geopolitical events threaten to dampen global economic prospects with an imminent slowdown.The commoditization of fluid power product equipment adds to the price pressure, which is already getting strained due to supply chain constraints, the trade war, and the presence of low-cost manufacturers. However, increased focus on energy-efficient products and technological advancement are expected to help manufacturers differentiate their solutions. North America, home to the largest economy in the world, continues to go from strength to strength in the oil and gas industry, as well as, in the off-highway vehicle sector.Similarly, Asia-Pacific, which is home to the two fastest-growing major economies in the world, is another key growth engine for this market due to the rising wealth in the region and the growth of the manufacturing sector. The Chinese Government's One Belt One Road Policy' is expected to continue to spur investments in infrastructure and logistics, driving growth in the construction and material handling sectors, while in the long-term, Made in China initiative will continue to push China in the direction of self-sufficiency for its technology needs. With greater penetration of smart solutions across key end-user sectors, the threat posed by electrification is also expected to be mitigated to some extent.As some industries are expected to experience a significant slowdown in 2019, technological differentiation is the key to navigating the market slowdown successfully and emerging stronger for the future.Key Topics Covered:1.

North America, home to the largest economy in the world, continues to go from strength to strength in the oil and gas industry, as well as, in the off-highway vehicle sector.Similarly, Asia-Pacific, which is home to the two fastest-growing major economies in the world, is another key growth engine for this market due to the rising wealth in the region and the growth of the manufacturing sector. The Chinese Government's One Belt One Road Policy' is expected to continue to spur investments in infrastructure and logistics, driving growth in the construction and material handling sectors, while in the long-term, Made in China initiative will continue to push China in the direction of self-sufficiency for its technology needs. With greater penetration of smart solutions across key end-user sectors, the threat posed by electrification is also expected to be mitigated to some extent.As some industries are expected to experience a significant slowdown in 2019, technological differentiation is the key to navigating the market slowdown successfully and emerging stronger for the future.Key Topics Covered:          1.

North Korea blasts Nancy Pelosi for support of Hong Kong protestsUPIAugust 13, 2019 Tuesday 10:54 AM ESTCopyright 2019 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 330 wordsByline: ELIZABETH SHIMDateline: Dec. 31 BodyNorth Korean state media is singling out U.S. House Speaker  after she expressed opposition to the use of force against protesters in Hong Kong.An article in Korean Workers' Party newspaper Rodong Sinmun that condemned the protests and alleged the demonstrators were being spurred on by "Western interference" also accused Pelosi, 79, of tampering with Chinese sovereignty."On the outside, Western interference distorts the international image of a socialist nation, and on the inside it encourages and expands upon social chaos," the Rodong said Tuesday, while mentioning Pelosi by name.On Monday, Pelosi tweeted, "It is alarming to watch the #HongKong police with support from Beijing intensify their use of force against the protesters and label them violent criminals."China has condemned the rallies and has previously called protesters "rioters" and claimed they were engaging in "terrorism."Beijing has also done little to interfere with police violence in Hong Kong's public spaces, including subway stations. Footage on social media shows police in full riot gear attacking protesters until they bleed.On Tuesday, North Korea showed support for China, its closest partner."We support the position of the Chinese party and government, that intends to protect its territorial integrity, political integrity and socialism," the Rodong stated. "The protests that began with regards to the issue of legal reform in Hong Kong, China, have evolved into extremely violent rallies."Hong Kong's government agreed to shelve an extradition bill that would allow Hong Kong's authorities to transfer suspected criminals to mainland China, but protests have continued over a larger set of grievances.Chinese state media have begun to air increasingly more footage of military vehicles, including armored troop carriers, gathering at Shenzhen, near the Hong Kong border, according to The Guardian.Hundreds of flights were also canceled on Tuesday as protesters converge at Hong Kong airport.Load-Date: August 14, 2019End of Document

Global Semiconductors Market Analysis Report, 2019 - AI is Going to Emerge as the Next New Catalyst for at Least the Coming DecadeGlobeNewswireAugust 27, 2019 Tuesday 8:41 AM PTCopyright 2019 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: RESEARCH ANALYSIS AND REPORTSLength: 893 wordsBodyDublin, Aug.  27, 2019  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The     "Analyzing the Global Semiconductors Industry 2019"   report has been added to     ResearchAndMarkets.com's  offering.The year 2019 is a year of contraction for the global semiconductor  industry, especially surrounded by intense economic uncertainties  stemming from the US-China trade war. However, from 2020, the industry  is again poised for strong growth as artificial intelligence (AI) is  rapidly adding to global demand.With technological innovation  happening at a breakneck speed worldwide, the semiconductor industry is  also no exception to this, and it can look forward to significant growth  in the coming years following a rather weak 2019.In 2018,  global semiconductor sales stood at a total of US$ 481 billion, and over  the coming four years, sales are expected to keep growing (albeit at a  slower rate) to cross US$572 billion by the end of 2022.Samsung, a  leading player in the global semiconductor industry, has recently  undertaken a massive capital spending on its semiconductor division and  this is expected to drive overcapacity in the memory segment, likely  causing a fall in sales of memory products in 2019. Nevertheless, 2020  will witness a recovery of the sector once again.The global  semiconductor industry is expected to be massively driven by the demand  for chips that are related to the booming artificial intelligence  sector. Much of this demand is likely to emerge from the industrial and  automotive markets, with the automotive market expected to grow the  fastest through 2022.The introduction of the 5G technology and  its growth in emerging markets is going to drive the use of  semiconductors in the communications market while the continuing growth  of video game consoles and handhelds, TVs, and digital set-top boxes  will continue to drive the need for semiconductors in the consumer  electronics markets. Growth in optoelectronic chips is also expected to  remain healthy.Asia Pacific will continue to lead the global  semiconductor market and will remain the most significant contributor to  the industry revenues. China is currently the biggest purchaser and  importer of chips, and the development of the semiconductor industry is  going to remain a huge priority for the Chinese government.Overall,  artificial intelligence is going to emerge as the next new catalyst for  at least the coming decade for the global semiconductor market.  Connectivity, sensing, and instant computing are going to be responsible  for driving a dramatic demand for AI-tailored semiconductors in the  coming years, with the Asia Pacific continuing to lead the industry.Players  analyzed include the industry stalwarts such as Texas Instruments,  Intel Corporation, Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix, STMicroelectronics,  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, amongst many others.Key Topics Covered          A.

Research Alert: CFRA Maintains Buy Opinion On Shares Of Cisco Systems, Inc.MT Newswires Live BriefsAugust 15, 2019 Thursday 11:55 AM ESTCopyright 2019 MT Newswires All Rights ReservedLength: 192 wordsBody CFRA, an independent research provider, has provided MT Newswires with the following research alert. Analysts at CFRA have summarized their opinion as follows:We trim our 12-month target by $7 to $55, 16.5x our FY 20 (Jul.) EPS estimate, a slight discount to co.'s three-year historical average P/E at 17.6x, reflecting our decelerating sales growth outlook. We lower our FY 20 EPS estimate by $0.07 to $3.34 and set FY 21's at $3.59. CSCO reported Jul-Q operating EPS of $0.83 vs $0.70, $0.01 above the consensus. Jul-Q revenues rose 6%, with 6% growth in Infrastructure Platforms on increases in all businesses except routing, 11% growth in Applications and a 14% increase in Security. Oct-Q guidance of 0% to 2% revenue growth came in slightly weaker than expected as service provider demand is expected to remain sluggish and enterprise spending could be pressured by macro uncertainties. In China, results are deteriorating at a rapid rate with many Chinese government-controlled enterprises blocking CSCO from bidding on projects. We note China accounts for a very small portion of total sales, so the impact should be less noticeable beyond Oct-Q.Load-Date: August 16, 2019End of Document

Risen Energy H1 net profit soars 295.52%PR NewswireAugust 29, 2019 Thursday 10:20 AM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 912 wordsDateline: NINGBO, China, Aug. 29, 2019 BodyPR NewswireRisen Energy Co., Ltd. disclosed its financial results for the first half of 2019 on August 23. During the last six months, the company recorded total operating revenue of 6.056 billion yuan (approx. US$847 million), an increase of 27.59% from a year earlier. Net profit reached 485 million yuan (approx. US$67.8 million), soaring 295.52%.Commenting on the growth for the half year, Risen Energy president Xie Jian said: "We always put customers first, closely respond to market demand, optimize product structure, and improve core competitiveness in scientific research and development, efficient product promotion, process improvement, lean production, cost management and other aspects. With the excellent ability and rich experience of the management team, we can effectively predict the direction of the industry, seize market opportunities and achieve good business performance."Continuously increases R & D investment, so that technological innovation ensures product qualityIn 2019, with the continuous expansion of the global photovoltaic market and iterative upgrade of photovoltaic manufacturing technology, Risen Energy continued to pay attention to the trends in terms of the development of the technology and the industry, constantly increased the R&D into efficient technology and scientific research investment, and developed many core technologies.On August 19, Risen Energy held a groundbreaking ceremony for its 2.5GW high-efficiency heterojunction cell and module project in Ninghai, a county within the city of Ningbo, Zhejiang province. Total investment for the project reached 3.3 billion yuan (approx. US$467 million). The company's heterojunction cells have a conversion efficiency exceeding 23% and has integrated half-cut, imbricate, double-glass and high-reflectivity backsheet into the cell's construction. Through the application of high-efficiency bifacial heterojunction cell technology, Risen Energy's heterojunction components can generate electricity on both sides of the panel and provide investors with a 10-30% higher level of income from the power generated.Besides the heterojunction cells, Risen Energy's technology R&D team has also successfully developed the second-generation half-cut technology of ultra-high light utilization and ultra-low power loss through the joint optimization of advanced battery passivation technology and high efficiency component packaging technology. After being tested by the independent third-party certification and testing organization TUV SUD, the company's photoelectric conversion efficiency for Jaeger HP series of 72 components reached 21%, among the highest across the sector. The maximum conversion efficiency for its MBB monocrystal cell has exceeded 23.00%, with an average efficiency reaching 22.73%. The company plans to gradually complete the switch from 5BB to MBB technology which it commenced in June 2019 and achieve full mass production of MBB technology within this year.At present, the annual output capacity of photovoltaic module for Risen Energy is 9.1 GW. In the next few years, with the expansion of battery component projects in Ninghai and Jintan, the company's total production capacity is expected to reach 12GW-15GW.Based on demand in emerging markets, thousands of projects are being developed and delivered globallyThe market outside of China is expected to continue on a path of sustained growth. With the help of sustained breakthroughs in efficient technology and the leading production capacity advantages across the industry, Risen Energy has acted on the opportunity presented by the demand in emerging markets, expanding its business in overseas markets and promoting global development.This year, Risen Energy built the 132MW (dc) Merredin solar farm, the large-scale renewable power plant in Western Australia.

The solar module developer has established a solid reputation and a significant share of the market in Australia with its ongoing technical research and development, excellent component quality and experienced project team. It has also become one of the largest and most reliable suppliers of solar components in Australia due to its continued development there.In addition to consolidating the investment and construction of power stations in Australia, Risen Energy has contributed to the Chinese government's "One Belt, One Road" initiative through activities in the markets of many countries and regions along the route. As one of the first group of photovoltaic manufacturers to have set up operations in Vietnam, Risen Energy has obtained many large orders in the market with its efficient technical products, rich EPC experience and localized operation strategy. To date the company has won the 61MW solar project with Tasco, the 50MW solar power station project owned by Vietnam-based Bitexco Group's subsidiary, Hoang Son's 62 MW project and PNP HANOI's 50MW project, among other major projects in Ninh Thuan.Up to now, the company has developed and delivered thousands of projects globally. Its efficient components have been sold to Kazakhstan, India, Nepal, Belarus, Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria and Macedonia as well as other countries and regions around the world. View original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/risen-energy-h1-net-profit-soars-295-52-300908876.htmlSOURCE Risen Energy Co., LtdCONTACT: Tina Feng, +86-574-59953077, tina@risenenergy.comLoad-Date: August 30, 2019End of Document

YouTube shuts down 210 channels posting about Hong KongCNN.comAugust 22, 2019 Thursday 7:57 PM ESTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: TECHLength: 300 wordsByline: By Donie O'Sullivan and Kevin Collier, CNNDateline: New York BodyGoogle announced Thursday that it had disabled 210 YouTube channels that were uploading videos "in a coordinated manner" about the ongoing protests in Hong Kong.The announcement came three days after Twitter and Facebook announced they had shut down a network of hundreds of accounts that were posting content aimed at undermining pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. Some of the accounts posed as news organizations and independent entities but in fact had links to the Chinese government, both companies said.Google said in a blog post Thursday that the discovery of the 210 YouTube channels "was consistent with recent observations and actions related to China announced by Facebook and Twitter.""We found use of VPNs and other methods to disguise the origin of these accounts and other activity commonly associated with coordinated influence operations," Shane Huntley from Google's security team wrote.Google, which owns YouTube, provided no details on how popular the YouTube channels were or how many videos had been posted to the channels.On Monday, Twitter announced it had identified and removed a network of more than 900 accounts originating in China that "were deliberately and specifically attempting to sow political discord in Hong Kong, including undermining the legitimacy and political positions of the protest movement." Twitter shared their findings with Facebook and they also removed a smaller network of accounts. Some accounts called protesters "cockroaches" or compared them to Islamic State terrorists.Hong Kong is facing a major political crisis amid weeks of mass demonstrations. Protesters are demanding greater democracy and an inquiry into alleged police brutality during past demonstrations. And as unrest intensifies, Beijing's tone is becoming increasingly heated.Load-Date: August 23, 2019End of Document

Didi may relaunch a carpooling service that was shut after two murdersCNN WireJuly 19, 2019 Friday 9:29 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 389 wordsByline: By Sherisse Pham, CNN BusinessDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  Didi Chuxing is considering reviving Hitch, a carpooling service it suspended indefinitely last year after two female passengers were murdered. China's top ride-hailing company said in a statement that it was putting forward a new product design and safety features for public consultation but added it has "no definite timetable yet for relaunching Hitch." At a press conference on Thursday, Didi executives laid out the new safety features that have been added to Hitch. They include stronger screening checks for drivers and passengers, using facial recognition to weed out people fraudulently using someone else's identity, and minimizing the display of personal information such as gender. Women users will also now have access to a "Safety Assistant" that gives them more information about their driver, including driving history and details of a background check. Didi faced public outrage and criticism from the Chinese government last year after two female passengers were murdered by Hitch drivers. Slammed for putting growth and profit ahead of passenger safety, Didi indefinitely suspended Hitch last August. In one of the murders, the suspect had used his father's Hitch account, breaching the service's rules, according to Didi. The company said the father had passed the verification process and criminal background checks required by the company. The crisis came just as Didi was expanding its global footprint, taking on Uber in key markets like Mexico, Brazil and Australia. Didi president Jean Liu acknowledged Thursday that Hitch is "controversial within the company," but she added that the carpooling service also "produces huge social value." Before it was suspended, Hitch regularly received up to two million daily orders, Liu said. The company had previously said it will spend 2 billion yuan ($290 million) to upgrade safety and security systems this year, including better software and driver training and education. It also removed more than 300,000 drivers from its platform since the murders.Didi was last valued at $56 billion and accounts for about 90% of China's ride-hailing market, according to a recent study from consulting firm Bain & Company.Serenitie Wang contributed to this report. TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Video: Jim's Daily Rundown for MondayJim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUSJuly 1, 2019 Monday 11:46 AM EDTCopyright 2019 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1000 wordsByline: Jim Cramer and the AAP TeamHighlight: Jim gives his takeaways on last week's G-20 meeting, our semiconductor stocks, and more!BodyIn today's Daily Rundown, Jim gives his takeaways on last week's G-20 meeting, our semiconductor stocks (Lam Research  and Nvidia  ), and more! Plus, Jim answers a club member question about how many stocks to own in a Mad Money portfolio.Katherine Ross: Hey y'all. I'm Katherine Ross. I'm here on the floor of the NYSE with Jim Cramer. Today we're going to be talking about G20, semiconductors and more. Jim, let's start off with G20. What are your thoughts about the meeting that occurred there?Jim Cramer: Well, I think that there is a move afoot by the president that is a far more friendly toward world trade including with Russia. I mentioned that because Russia's more of an outlier than China so much. And almost as if the president took counsel of what could happen with the election and wants to go in for the kill. He wants those farmers to come with him. He wants the rust belt to come with him. He wants manufacturing people work... You know, manufacturing's a small part of our country. But the ancillary aspects of it are in the states that are the most important states for the election will go his way. I think he senses that Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren are the real front runners, and Warren, Massachusetts and Harris, California. And I think he wants to go for almost a McGovern like defeat for the Democrats. And so therefore he's wiling up to say, "Okay, well look, the farmers are going to win. They're going to get what they want." The farmers are a huge constituency in states that he must keep in line. The manufacturers. Huge. I think a lot of this was short term about the election and that this analysis I'm offering, it seems to be very overlooked, but this was an election year meeting.Katherine Ross: I'm glad that you say that. That's actually very interesting, especially because we saw Trump soften his stance on Huawei, which led to the semis rallying.Jim Cramer: Well, look. This is unbelievable for Lam Research, which is a company that uniquely makes the equipment for DRAMs. If you listen to Micron last week, they said DRAM prices will bottom out because of capital equipment declines, but that doesn't matter. Micron's going to be up. And then this is for Nvidia remarkable, because Nvidia needs Chinese government approval of its purchase of Mellanox, which is amazingly important for them. I think that we have a couple bullpen names, Caterpillar, Marvell that are big winners, and we have to figure out what to do there, because they're incredible winners. By the way, the oddest thing today is that the banks continue to rally.Katherine Ross: I'm glad that you mentioned the banks. That was going to be my next question. What are your thoughts there?Jim Cramer: We have a huge position in the banks. Goldman Sachs is very cheap. We're under water Goldman terribly, but it's our second largest position. Goldman could be one to buy. We can't buy it anymore. We're just filled to the gills with it. JP Morgan's been on such a move. Citi, we trimmed a little. But wow, the banks are, post the CCAR, by far the biggest winners, and they don't stop, which is very odd given the fact that they're not related to China at all.Katherine Ross: All right. Are you ready for member question of the day?Jim Cramer: Sure.Katherine Ross: So we're not attaching a name to this, because it's about a portfolio position. This member asked, "I know you have suggested no more than 10 stocks if you own a $100,000 portfolio, but would you recommend additional positions if your portfolio is sizeably larger?"Jim Cramer: Yeah, sure. I mean, remember when we became a club, we became a recommended list. Why did we become a recommended list? We can't do half the stuff we say. I mean it's ridiculous. I mean, for instance, this morning I mentioned Dow chemical, well I'm froze in Dow chemical. Is Dow a stock I want to buy? No, got lucky there, because Westlake was bad, I have to believe Dow's bad. But I do think that you can look at the recommended list and make some choices for some income. I mentioned, Dow, that's a big income, BP. For high growth, hypergrowth, Nvidia. For blended, Honeywell. And now Goldman, by the way, because of the increase in dividend. I mean what I want to emphasize over and over again is that if you have time and inclination, go buy some more.Jim Cramer: But remember it's a recommended lists. Just like when I worked at Goldman, we put out a recommended list and why you should buy them. That's what the product does. It's very hard for people to understand that, because it's a club, and it will always be a club, and I hope it stays a club.Katherine Ross: Jim, before we go, you are gone all last week. We've talked about the semiconductors, we've talked about the meeting between Trump and Xi, and we talked about the banks. What else are you watching in this market?Jim Cramer: Well, obviously Boeing, because of what Harris Corp just told me, now its L3Harris, that there is voluntary training among pilots for the 737 Max. That's both good and bad. Good that it may mean that there's a certain point where it'll be back in the air. Bad is that we were hoping you didn't need that. You know what I mean? We were hoping that there was nothing really wrong. Obviously there is something very much involved.Jim Cramer: I'm looking at Home Depot. The weather's been great, really great, and that's why that stock keeps going up. That's a weather related stock, and the housing stocks are doing quite well, and obviously Nvidia. I do believe that Jensen Huang will be vindicated. Please watch your bullpen. There'll be changes made.Katherine Ross: All right Jim. It's a pleasure to have you back. Thank you.Jim Cramer: Yeah, it's good to be back. And again, watch the free video when I talked about Tuscany. I don't wanna spend too much time for the people who pay, but I have some suggestions about what to do if you go.Katherine Ross: There we go. All right guys. Thanks for watching. I'm Katherine Ross, and we'll see you tomorrow.Load-Date: September 8, 2019End of Document

Dow Jones Futures: Micron, Apple, China's Yuan Fall On Huawei Report; Uber, Trade Desk Are Earnings MoversInvestor's Business DailyAugust 9, 2019Copyright 2019 Investor's Business Daily, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: STOCK MARKET TODAYLength: 873 wordsByline: ED CARSONBodyhttps://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Chips-IC-4.25.17.jpgDow Jones futures fell solidly early Friday, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures, after the stock market rally continued for a third day with strong gains. Stock futures and China's yuan fell on a report that the White House is delaying a decision on letting chipmakers and other U.S. companies resume supplying China's Huawei. Micron stock, Qualcomm stock, AMD stock, Nvidia stock all retreated modestly, along with China-exposed Apple stock. Meanwhile, Uber Technologies and Trade Desk reported earnings late, with Uber stock and Trade Desk stock down in volatile action.The White House is delaying decisions on permitting Micron Technology and others to resume sales to the Chinese telecom giant, in retaliation for Beijing's recent decision to halt all purchases of U.S. agricultural goods,  late Thursday. The farm goods halt was among China's responses to President Donald Trump's decision last week to hike tariffs on the final $300 billion worth of Chinese goods, escalating the China trade war.Micron stock, Qualcomm and Advanced Micro Devices fell 2%, while Xilinx and Nvidia also retreated overnight. All these chip names were winners in Thursday's , with AMD stock up 16% on new chips and contracts.These chip stocks and others likely would come under more pressure if the White House confirmed the delay, especially if the suspension was long-lasting.Apple stock sank 1% before the open. Apple is a big chip user. More importantly, the Dow Jones tech giant is exposed to the China trade war. The new Trump tariffs will hit the Apple iPhone for the first time. And the company is exposed to Chinese retaliation by the government or consumers, especially if national champion Huawei is under attack.Apple stock rose 2.2% Thursday, continuing to rebound after tumbling below its 50-day line on Monday.Huawei, for its part, debuted its own HuaweiOS operating system. The company said it could quickly use the new operating system to replace Android if Google-parent Alphabet is forced to cut off support.Dow Jones Futures TodayDow Jones futures fell 0.5% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures retreated 0.55% and Nasdaq 100 futures sank 0.8%. Remember that overnight action in , AMD stock, Uber stock, Trade Desk stock and more doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular  session.The offshore yuan rate fell on the Huawei license delay report.The People's Bank of China set its yuan rate midpoint at 7.0136 to the dollar. That's slightly weaker than 7.0039 a day earlier, but not as weak as markets expected.China's yuan has moved Dow futures for the past several sessions, mostly notably with Monday's yuan devaluation. Since then, the PBOC has continued to fix the yuan rate slightly lower, weakening the yuan to more than seven to the dollar.Current Stock Market RallyThe stock market rally attempt had an impressive session, extending gains for a third session. The Dow Jones industrial average rallied 1.4%, the S&P 500 index 1.9% and the Nasdaq composite 2.2%. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 index both reclaimed their 50-day lines and are now slightly positive for the week, completely reclaiming Monday's elevator-down sell-off.Positive China news on the yuan and exports, along with generally upbeat corporate earnings, spurred Thursday's stock market rally.Growth stocks led the way, with some clearing or retaking buy points or key support levels.Among the , the Innovator IBD 50 ETF popped 3%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF advanced 3.2% and the VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF 2.5%. The SMH ETF fell in extended trade as AMD stock, Micron stock and more weighed.At this point, investors should be looking for a  to confirm a new stock market rally. A follow-through involves a strong gain on one or more of the major indexes in higher volume than the prior session.When a stock market rally works, it's easy to look back and wish you'd start buying a day or two earlier. But if the uptrend lasts for weeks or months, there are many opportunities for solid gains. And it lowers the risk that you'll jump just as a market rally turns out to be a short-term bounce.Uber Earnings.

6 hurt by fireworks amid Hong Kong protests on riot chargesAssociated Press InternationalJuly 30, 2019 Tuesday 10:57 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 870 wordsByline: By KATIE TAM, Associated PressDateline: HONG KONG BodyHONG KONG (AP) - Protesters clashed with police again in Hong Kong on Tuesday night after reports that some of their detained colleagues would be charged with the relatively serious charge of rioting.Several hundred protesters mobilized in the streets outside a police station after 44 people were arrested on riot charges stemming from a Sunday night demonstration.Hong Kong police said in a statement Tuesday that the protesters set up roadblocks, broke fences, damaged street signs and attacked police officers with bricks and iron rods.One of the accused is a 33-year-old man who was also charged with assaulting a police officer, police said.The accused rioters and a 24-year-old man charged with weapons possession will appear in court Wednesday.A total of 49 people, including 32 men and 17 women between the ages of 16 and 41, had initially been arrested from the scene. Hong Kong police said it "will not rule out the possibility of further arrest" as it investigates the four others released temporarily or out on bail.Video livestreamed by Hong Kong media showed protesters chanting slogans and throwing eggs at the Kwai Chung police station. Police used pepper spray to try to disperse them.Fireworks were set off just before 3 a.m. Wednesday, injuring six men near another police station. Five people were taken to a nearby hospital for their injuries and the sixth man declined medical treatment at the scene, police said.Video footage on social media appears to show a car driving by the Tin Shui Wai police station as fireworks flare by where protesters were gathered.Police said it was not an action taken by officials and that officers are investigating the incident.The unannounced protest capped another day of unrest. During the morning rush hour, commuters argued with demonstrators who blocked subway train doors in their continuing movement to demand greater accountability from the semi-autonomous Chinese territory's government.Activists began protesting in early June for the government to withdraw an extradition bill that would have allowed people to be sent to stand trial in mainland China, where critics say their legal rights would be threatened. The government suspended the bill, but the protests have expanded to calls for democracy and government accountability.Service was delayed and partially suspended on the Island and Kwun Tong lines, subway operator MTR said. It cited "a number of train door obstructions" as well as someone activating a safety device at a platform on the Kwun Tong line.The action targeted rush hour traffic at several stations. MTR responded by providing minibuses to replace delayed trains, and normal service was restored by around noon.Protester Ken Chan said he wanted MTR officials to explain why they allegedly failed to take action on July 21 when a large gang of men in white shirts brutally beat dozens of people inside a train station as a massive protest was winding down. Hong Kong's government and the central authorities in Beijing have blamed protesters for sparking the confrontation."How could they let the triads in white attack people on the platform randomly, including the elderly and children in the train?" said Chan, 32, using the common term for members of organized crime groups. "Some of the elderly got smacked on their heads, but (MTR staff) turned a blind eye to it."Lorraine Lee, 26, said the subway disruption was an attempt to remind people of the government's alleged failure to deal with social, economic and political injustices."The government has not been addressing the problems in our society," Lee said. "That is why now Hong Kongers have no choice but to use different 'creative' approaches to remind people what is happening in Hong Kong."Associated Press video showed heated exchanges at Tiu Keng Leng station, where a crowd of protesters and commuters filled the platform and a stopped train.Posts on Twitter showed long lines of commuters waiting for free shuttle buses provided by MTR to other subway stops. Protesters conducted a similar action to block trains last week.The disruption is part of a pro-democracy movement that has seen hundreds of thousands take to the streets this summer for marches and rallies. The protests have shaken the government in Hong Kong and raised concerns in Beijing. Hong Kong is part of China, but it has a fair degree of autonomy in local affairs.On Sunday, police repeatedly fired tear gas and rubber bullets to drive back protesters blocking Hong Kong streets with road signs and umbrellas.The protesters have demanded an independent inquiry into police conduct at the demonstrations, which they say has been abusive.China on Monday accused unidentified foreign actors of encouraging the protests. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Tuesday that the central government "resolutely opposes any foreign forces' attempts to intervene in Hong Kong affairs.""We have the determination and ability to safeguard peace and stability in Hong Kong," Hua said at a daily briefing.On Saturday, Hong Kong police fired tear gas, swung batons and forcefully cleared out protesters who defied warnings not to march._____AP reporter Sally Ho contributed from Seattle, Washington.Load-Date: July 31, 2019End of Document

Super-Fast M2M Payments Are Finally a Blockchain Reality; MXC Foundation released the M2M Payment Mechanism for machine-to-machine payments, creating the first autonomous blockchain connected payment system for wireless devices.PR NewswireJuly 10, 2019 Wednesday 6:00 AM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 424 wordsDateline: BERLIN, July 10, 2019 BodyPR NewswireBERLIN, July 10, 2019 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- The MXC Foundation, widely known for its integrated Blockchain partnerships with the Chinese government inShanghaias well as China's version of Amazon, "JD.com", released today the M2M Payments Mechanism, a revolutionary way to automate payments between machines. The M2M Payment Mechanism cleverly enables devices to autonomously process financial transactions within seconds, providing a state-of-the-art device payment mechanism and laying the foundation for automated payments between wireless devices."At MXC we're building a world where literally anyone is able to financially benefit from data, providing Smart City Networks and Device Data connectivity, we're standing on the verge of the next global data movement," said Aaron Wagener, co-founder of the MXC Foundation. "This M2M Payment Mechanism is the first step towards building the world's fastest IoT blockchain machine payment platform."The M2M Payments Mechanism allows for rapid transactions between devices. This makes it possible for a wireless sensor to autonomously pay for network access without requiring oversight or authorization from the company owning it. If it has data to send, it will pay for the access needed to send this data.As part of the mechanism, device owners will have the option to subscribe various LPWAN sensors to third-party LPWAN Gateways. This creates a whole new level of mobility among LoRaWAN sensors while providing multiple failover options to ensure the steady and reliable transmission of the collected data.Corporate partners also benefit from the MXC M2M Payments Mechanism. Part of this software release adds the tools needed for corporate adoption of the MXProtocol; including transaction history, low balance warnings, device subscription management and the ability to generate invoices.MXC's M2M Payments Mechanism integrates flawlessly with theAXS Wallet, providing a single dashboard from which to manage both MXC and MXC earnings from MXProtocol enabled LPWAN devices, providing a mechanism to profit from the devices of this world. Anyone wishing to contribute to, or view the code behind MXC M2M Payments Mechanism can find it in the open-sourceMXC Foundation GitHub repository.###The MXC Foundation is a purpose-built Blockchain Foundation, based in Berlin. Its mission is to inspire fast, efficient, decentralized data exchanges using LPWAN and Blockchain technology. MXC is currently working on projects in New York City, South Korea, and Shanghai.SOURCE MXC Foundation gGmbHLoad-Date: July 11, 2019End of Document

Good morning, everyone, happy Thursday to you, I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, August 8th, your top stories right now, just before 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast.Markets pointing to a higher opening this morning, take a look at Futures up 77 points on the Dow Industrials, coming after a wild end Wall Street, the NASDAQ, the S&P able to come back from sharp losses to end the day in the green yesterday. The Dow finishing the day slightly lower after a 2.6 percent plunge earlier in the session.Oil, sliding into bear market territory yesterday, reports that Saudi Arabia is discussing options with other producers to send the decline. And U.S.-China trade turmoil, once again, President Trump saying thousands of companies are leaving China due to the tariffs and that China would like to make a deal badly, this as the U.S. moves to ban Huawei and some other Chinese companies from governments.Boycotts over support of President Trump, Equinox and SoulCycle, facing backlash this morning, due to its chairman, holding a fundraiser for the president, more on the controversy, coming up, another rate cut to tell you about, MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.And we've got a big show this morning, joining the conversation, FOX Business Networks' Dagen McDowell, Farvahar Partners, founder and CEO, Omeed Malik is back with us, and FOX News contributor, columnist for the Hill, Liz Peek, great to see everybody this morning.LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good to see you.BARTIROMO: Yes, we've got lots to talk about, also on deck, this morning, by the way, IHS Market vice chairman, Daniel Yergin is here, we're talking oil, just entered a bear market. Assistant to President Trump for Trade and Manufacturing Policy, Peter Navarro, to talk China and the Fed, check out the op-ed in the Journal about that today.And then three-time MLB, MVP and 14-time all-star Alex Rodriguez, A-Rod, in the studio with us, along with Barstool Sports CEO, Erika Nardini. They discuss the sports business, the rise of podcast and all things baseball. Don't miss a moment of it.All right, we've got a lot to talk about. We had another rate cut overnight, this morning, from the Philippines. Look at these markets up 67 on the Dow Industrials, S&P up 10, and the NASDAQ up 40 points, all three major averages rebounded from yesterday's steep losses.Investors shaking off the trade tensions and growth worries when all was said and done yesterday, with the Dow Industrials down 22 at the close, but the S&P in positive territory, and the NASDAQ up almost 30 points, a fourth Central Bank in 2 days, cutting interest rates today, it is the Philippines, your reaction to this, we are on a race to the bottom, in terms of interest rates across the world.PEEK: I think that's the 15th or 16th rate cut by a major Central Bank, and I think yesterday, what we saw at the open, thankfully, not later in the day, was kind of everyone panicking and saying what is going on here? How is this happening that now probably 60 percent of the dead instruments around the world have a negative yield.That's -- when has that ever happened before? Thankfully, overnight, China had a little bit better economic data come out, better exports than expected, better imports than expected, suggesting that China slowdown is yes, underway, but it's not horrifying.So, you know, when we start off well, like we're doing today, I'm kind of nervous, you know, who knows what the day will hold, but at least, right now, that that is not so concerning.BARTIROMO: Yes, because sometimes you want to see the capitulation, Dagen.PEEK: Yes, a little bit.BARTIROMO: You felt like it was happening yesterday, and two days ago as well, but we came back.PEEK: Yes.OMEED MALIK, FOUNDER AND CEO, FARVAHAR PARTNERS: Well, look, I mean, I hope we aren't going to start emulating the Central Bank of the Philippines any time soon. But, you know, with that said, I mean, yes, a lot of developing economies are doing this. It was overblown the day that the market tanked a few days ago, based on the trade deal or lack thereof, and I think it was an overreaction.So, we're going to see things start to stabilize and hopefully we can let the president implement his tariffs program, and see how that works out.MCDOWELL: But the timing of the U.S. labeling China, essentially, a currency manipulator, was poor, to say the least, in assets, because, again, you already have a trade fight, but now you're going to start a currency fight.And when you have the currencies of Asian nations that hold a lot of foreign currency denominated debt dollar -- denominated debt, and their currency starts falling and you have weakness there. These are borrowers from South Korea to China and across Asia, will then struggle to repay those debts.So, you have to be careful about what you do in an environment like this, because it could trigger. It only takes one small thing, panic.PEEK: Yes.MCDOWELL: And that was some of what we have seen, again, stabilization, certainly yesterday, and later in the week, but, again, policy matters. And it's not just monetary policy.PEEK: Although, I think China has to be concerned about a capital flight, and I think that's one of the reasons they set their long rate higher than expected yesterday, and I think, overnight, the same thing happened.BARTIROMO: That's what they're all worried about.PEEK: I think the biggest problem for China, right now, is Hong Kong. I think Xi and for us -- because Xi, I think, bases this challenge to his authority, to Beijing's authority in Hong Kong. And I think he cannot be seen to be weak on both fronts -- on both -- dealing with the U.S. and also dealing with Hong Kong.MCDOWELL: So that means, to Maria's point earlier in the week, no deal until after the election.PEEK: Yes.MALIK: Yes, I agree with that.BARTIROMO: I don't see it happening. Meanwhile, there's backlash across the country again, billionaire Steven Ross, getting heat for his upcoming fundraiser supporting President Trump. Now, Ross is a passive investor in Equinox and SoulCycle gym brands. Some customers are calling for a boycott over his political stance, the fact that he's supporting President Trump.He responded in a statement saying this, I have known Donald Trump for 40 years, and while we agree on some issues, we strongly disagree on many others and I have never been bashful about expressing my opinion. This shaming of anybody who supports Donald Trump, Liz, is just incredible.It's so horrifying, but I have to tell you, I know these SoulCycle people. They're not going to abandon SoulCycle. There is no more religious workout group than the people who go to SoulCycle. I'm kidding, but the truth is, I think it's horrifying. And by the way, so was yesterday, Joaquin Castro, trying to shame people by posting online.Small, you know, households and small businesses that were supporting Donald Trump, this is the President of the United States. You may not like him, everyone has their own opinion. It's ridiculous.BARTIROMO: It's ridiculous.PEEK: It is.MCDOWELL: So, Steve Scalise has a Wall Street Journal editorial about what Congressman Castro, and him, basically, revealing not just the names of --PEEK: Yes.MCDOWELL: -- donors, one of whom donated to him as well. So, there you go.BARTIROMO: Yes, I know.MCDOWELL: But the place that they work and Steve Scalise says this insane hyper partisanship is a sickness. I want to point that out. But in terms of Stephen Ross and the related companies and SoulCycle and Equinox, you said religious, or religion at SoulCycle, but you know what, it's not a church, get over yourself.These are physical activity centers. The only expectation that you should have going in, is that, well, the bathroom doesn't have mold in it, and there isn't sweat all over the equipment. But people -- why are people treating gyms as if they are cult centers? When are we going to start doing polling everybody who works there to find out who they voted for?I don't care if someone voted for Bernie Sanders in the primary. I don't care if the guy working at the desk voted for Hillary Clinton, I don't care. That is your right as an American, and it's my right to go in there and not have to worry about people wringing their hands about who you voted for.BARTIROMO: It's the bigger issue of this Trump derangement syndrome, and the left constantly trying to shame anybody who they don't agree with, and it's disgusting, it has to stop, I mean, the fact that they are all over Stephen Ross today and last night, I mean, it was all over the place last night.MALIK: I also think --BARTIROMO: It's an embarrassment.MALIK: it's also short-sighted. This is political grand standing in the social media environment that we live in today. So, you have celebrities going on and bragging about cancelling their membership. What they don't seem to understand is that there are actual employees at these companies that they will harm. That they probably have more in common than they think.So, the actual people that are affected by these types of (INAUDIBLE)BARTIROMO: Good point.MALIK: -- are not really thought out at all.BARTIROMO: It's like Bill Maher on a show, saying, bring the recession on, I really want a recession, because it will -- it will get Donald Trump out of office, he doesn't care. The recession is not going to hit, you know, a T.V. comedian who's making millions.MALIK: Right.MCDOWELL: But with Bill Maher, I don't -- like, Bill Maher is a -- I mean, he makes jokes and he's trying to be funny, that he is in the outrage and funny business. That's what he does for a living. This is different. These are people essentially calling for, you, not to show up, it's a gym.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: It's a gym. It's -- I know that it is very cultish, but to your point, where do you -- where are you going to stop because the related companies just put up the -- is putting steel up. The biggest development in New York City since Rockefeller Center --BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: -- was built in the late 1920s, I think it was finished in the early 30s. But, again, how many jobs are you going to put at risk because somebody had a fundraiser for President Trump.BARTIROMO: Yes. And that --MCDOWELL: And that's exactly to your point.BARTIROMO: And Stephen Ross who did Hudson Yards, same guy who did Time Warner center, by the way, right?PEEK: That's right.MCDOWELL: They have -- they have building -- rental buildings all over the country, so --PEEK: Look, and we're only getting started in this step. You're going to see more and more of this as the 2020 election goes on.MCDOWELL: But it's not --PEEK: Because there's a lot of people are going to be holding fundraisers for President Trump --BARTIROMO: Yes.PEEK: -- and they're going to stir the raft of the left, what gets me, is the left is always taking about hate speech and the divisive language.BARTIROMO: Right.PEEK: What, you know, look at your own glass houses, how it can break, right?MCDOWELL: People know who are -- the smart Democrats know that if you don't like President Trump, then you have to pick somebody who can --PEEK: That's right.MCDOWELL: -- beat him and you have to get out to vote, and this does not get people out to vote, it alienates people.BARTIROMO: Well, I'll tell you what is going to happen, this is going to stir up the Trump supporters.PEEK: That's exactly right.BARTIROMO: They're going to come out in force -- in force, because people do not like the shaming and this constant. It's like bullying, all of the time.PEEK: And being called a racist.BARTIROMO: Exactly.PEEK: Now, we have several Democrats come out -- serious Democrats come out and say, every Trump supporter is a racist.BARTIROMO: Yes.PEEK: You know what? That got people dug in.BARTIROMO: Absolutely. Trump supporters are going to come out --MALIK: Actually, independence, as well -- independence as well will come out.BARTIROMO: Let me ask you about this sparring over taxes, 2020 presidential candidate New York City mayor Bill de Blasio, he came on FOX News last night, debating taxes, with Sean Hannity, watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO (D-NY), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The rich have gotten richer for 40 years and paid less and less in taxes, corporations in America paying nothing in taxes, that's not America. That's not America where the chosen few get all the money.SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: What do you -- what do you think corporations, when they -- when you raise their taxes, what do you think they do?DE BLASIO: I think the problem with your whole line here is that you seem to think the status quo is OK.(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: What do corporations do when you raise taxes?DE BLASIO: I don't think -- I don't think your viewers think the status quo is OK.HANNITY: What do you think corporations do when government like you raises their taxes?DE BLASIO: They have to pay their fair share.HANNITY: No, they passed the cost on to the consumer.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: It was a heated conversation last night, your reaction, Omeed?MALIK: Well, I think it's somewhat simplistic. You know, just raising taxes on income does not necessarily solve what he's talking about, as we know, income inequality hit all record highs during the Obama administration, that's when we actually raised the federal tax rate at the highest level.So, that's not a panacea. What we should be talking about is how to create jobs for people that need them and improve wages which have started to rise for the first time in a very long time, rather than just taxing the rich.PEEK: And the gap is narrowed between the top earners and the -- and the bottom earners for the first time in a very long time and the black-white gap has closed, so we are on the right trend here, and we can talk about how much of the federal tax load is lifted by the top one percent, it's gigantic. So, this whole fair share argument, I think, is preposterous, probably.MCDOWELL: The bigger issue for New York City is when you tax people. The people who live here have the expectation that you're going to then spend the money well. And New York City already had a vast social safety net for those most in need.And Bill de Blasio has failed the city and the people who need these services more than any other mayor in modern history, whether it's children services, taking care of the homeless, mental health services, public housing --BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: -- you name it, he is a failure.PEEK: That's a good point.MCDOWELL: That's why he ran to Iowa.BARTIROMO: Yes. And that came up in the interview last night. We'll show you more of that interview and more of what we've been talking about this morning, but let's take a quick break, when we come back, President Trump visited El Paso and Dayton, yesterday, visiting with victims and first responders, how Democrats are responding to that.Then ride-share earnings, Lyft reporting last night, Uber is on top today. We've got all the numbers, straight ahead, back in a minute, markets going up today at the open. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Well, another disturbing claim related to the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, Lauren Simonetti with details and headlines this morning, Lauren, good morning to you.LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning to you, Maria, the billionaire behind Victoria's Secret says the accuser accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, misappropriated more than $46 million of his fortune.L Brands CEO Leslie Wexner, wrote a letter to members of his foundation, detailing how the funds were uncovered after he decided to break ties with Epstein back in 2007. Now, up to that point, Wexner had given Epstein control of his finances and had even given him power of attorney.Former Illinois governor, Rod Blagojevich, could have his prison sentence reduced soon. President Trump says he is very strongly considering a pardon.Blagojevich was sentenced to 14 years in jail, in 2011, following a corruption conviction of trying to sell his senate seat or that of Barack Obama, Trump telling supporters yesterday that Blagojevich was treated unfairly. The former governor appeared on Trump's Celebrity Apprentice reality show in 2010.Let's take a look at shares of Lyft. The stock is rallying in the premarket by six percent after the company's second-quarter revenue, jumped more than 70 percent from a year ago. Lyft raised its sales guidance for the current quarter as well, ridership up more than 40 percent.Also, take a look here at Uber, it is rising with Lyft, up 4.6 percent here in the premarket, but Uber does report after the close today. Uber is expected to post a quarterly loss, that loss is expected despite recent price increases, analyst looking for growth from Uber Eats, a popular division.And the latest earnings from FOX Corp came in better-than-expected. Revenue jumped five percent from a year ago, driven by higher affiliate revenue. FOX is the parent company of the FOX Business Network, Maria.BARTIROMO: All right, Lauren, thank you so much.SIMONETTI: Sure.BARTIROMO: We'll take a break, when we come back, U.S.-China trade in focus, global markets rallying after better-than-expected China manufacturing data this morning, what it means for a trade deal, what it means for the economy there and its impact, globally.Plus, Home Alone again, actor Macaulay Culkin responds to Disney about rebooting the classic Christmas movie, his tweet, coming up. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Futures are higher this morning. Take a look. This on top of a comeback yesterday, Dow Futures right now showing a gain of 84 points at the start of trading, that's a third of a percent, S&P is up 12, and the NASDAQ is up 47.Markets rallying after better-than-expected import data from China, amid the ongoing trade dispute, President Trump weighed in on the market reaction to trade tensions yesterday, watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think the market reaction is anticipated, I would have anticipated, I would have maybe anticipated even more, but ultimately, it's going to go much higher than it ever would have gone, because China was like an anchor on us. China is killing us with unfair trade deals. The people that allowed that to happen are a disgrace.China, what they were doing to us for years and years, taking hundreds of billions of dollars out, stealing intellectual property, targeting our farmers, all of that ending, and they understand that.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Still global growth concerns persist, the Philippines' Central Bank cut interest rate cuts overnight. That's four rate cuts in just 24 hours. Joining me right now is BNY Mellon Investment Management chief strategist, Alicia Levine.And Alicia, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much for weighing in here. What did you make of the three rate cuts yesterday, another one today, and this move toward the bottom, look at the 10-year at 1.6 percent.ALICIA LEVINE, CHIEF STRATEGIST, BNY MELLON INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT: Yes, it's shocking and, you know, what we've see is that the Fed cut last week, really gave the green light to emerging markets to start cutting their rates as well.And we are, unfortunately, in a downward spiral and the markets are expecting it. But it's not -- it's not -- it's not a positive, it's a global growth fear as we have seen.BARTIROMO: But are there negative implications to all these negative rates like Dagen has been saying.LEVINE: Yes, so I think that negative rates are actually quite frightening, because what it means is that the Central Banks are really losing any kind of ammunition to goose the real economy, and if you look at Europe, it's a great example of how negative rates actually have not been able to stimulate the economy.They've murdered the banking sector, and you have not been able to bring risk on it all, and all you have is a misallocation of capital and you can't get the real economy going, and I think that's a very frightening scene and there's some concern that very low rates here could possibly be in effective as well.PEEK: So, it seems, to me, the big conundrum is that the United States' economy, up until, at least, right now, has done pretty well. The consumer is strong, job creation is, obviously, still strong, et cetera, and yet, our two -- our Fed funds rate at over two percent is way out of sync with the 10-year and also what's going on around the world.How do we re-balance? How do we respond? Should we be involved in this race to the bottom or should we just pretend like the rest of the world doesn't matter?LEVINE: So that's the question of the moment. And, you know, we saw the Fed is really having to cut last week, and having to cut because other developed markets, Central Banks, were easing.And so, you cannot have such a high-Fed funds rate when other banks are easing, at the same time, you need to have some ammunition for the real downturn, I mean, we're -- the U.S. is growing at two percent. We have the best labor market in over 50 years. We have more jobs available than we have unemployed.So, if you look at the data, actually, we're doing OK, what's starting to become concerning is that the sentiment data is starting to roll over. So, while the U.S. economy has been more or less immune to the manufacturing slowdown globally, over time, that is going to start hitting the service's sector.And if you start hitting the service's sector here, that's when you can really start weakening the economy here.MALIK: You mentioned negative interest rates potential to hurt Europe and how it's not going to panacea. I mean, you can also look at Japan, and that's been going on from a lot longer, right? So, you have two decades of basically negative rates and it's done nothing.So, I think you'd agree that monetary policy alone, cannot solve the oils, and it's really more appropriate for downturn as opposed to a policy on an ongoing basis.PEEK: Right. So, one of -- one of the greatest marker since the end of the great recession has been the focus on Central Bank policy, as sort of the only game in town. And we believe that ultimately, to get out of this cycle, Germany needs to have a fiscal stimulus.And as we know, part of the reason that German yields were negative and negative early, because there's not enough supply, because Germany does not run a deficit in the same way, so to go to safety, you wind up with negative yields because there's not enough supply of the boon out there for investors.So, I think that if there is to be a change in the conversation and to stop this race to the bottom, there has to be some fiscal stimulus in the world. And my guess is going to be Germany first.MCDOWELL: So you're saying borrow more money? Borrow more money and spend it.LEVINE: Yes, to spend it.MCDOWELL: But borrow money and spend it because that's actually what the U.S. is doing with this new budget deal, as much as you might hate, adding to, what, 2 -- almost $2 trillion dollars to the debt. We're running 1 trillion dollar, annual budget deficits right now. So, again, that's kind of where we are.BARTIROMO: Markets don't seem to care.MCDOWELL: No.(CROSSTALK)LEVINE: They don't care because the way out of this debt problem is growth.BARTIROMO: Exactly.LEVINE: And what we've seen is that the negative rates are not allowing countries to actually grow or to get inflation going or getting, you know, domestic demand going. So, debt is not bad if you create demand and you grow your way out of it. Right now, we have a race to the bottom. It's not just a simple equation, you to know where you're starting from or what the trajectory is.PEEK: It seems to me Europe really is the problem, and part of it is, they never fix the banks after the financial crisis.BARTIROMO: And the labor laws.PEEK: Yes, exactly. I'd rather blame Europe than Trump's trade policy.BARTIROMO: Yes. Real quick, would you put new money to work --MCDOWELL: Trump trading policy is awful.BARTIROMO: -- all of this volatility and stocks, do -- what are you telling clients? Do you want to buy stocks or not?LEVINE: I have a couple of levels here around the 2,800 mark. I'd be more comfortable if that breaks at all, in any kind of risk of sentiment, then your next up is about 2,730, which were the lows from earlier in the year, seems like a reasonable place to stop. I don't believe this is the beginning of the end of the bull market.BARTIROMO: OK.LEVINE: I think this is more or less a correction.BARTIROMO: So, use weakness to get in.LEVINE: Use weakness to get in.BARTIROMO: Alicia, thank you.LEVINE: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Alicia Levine, joining us there. Coming up, Mr. Castro's move to shame President Trump's donors, backfires. Turns out, at least one of them donated Castro and his brother, the story coming up.

The original star's hilarious reaction to Disney's plans for a reboot of the comedy classic. All those stories coming up this Thursday morning.But first, our top story this half an hour. President Trump traveled to Dayton, Ohio and El Paso, Texas yesterday. Visiting victims and first responders of mass shootings -- of those two mass shootings earlier in the week.This as the president faces a wave of criticism from Democrats, who claim his rhetoric is to blame for what happened.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)TRUMP: My critics are political people that trying to make a point. In many cases, they're running for presidents and they're very low in the polls that just came out.The Dayton situation, he was a fan of Antifa, he was a fan of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. No, I don't blame Elizabeth Warren, and I don't blame Bernie Sanders in the case of Ohio. And I don't blame anybody. But I think we have toned it down. We've been hitting -- we've been getting hit left and right from everybody.BETO O'ROURKE (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He is trying to intimidate this community. He is in large part to blame for what has taken place.SEN. CORY BOOKER (D-NJ), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It was sewed by those who spoke the same words. The El Paso murderer did, warning of an invasion.JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He's both clear language and in code. This president has fanned the flames of white supremacy in this nation.(END VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: Joining me right now, former Trump campaign director of Data and Strategy. And look ahead, America executive director Matt Braynard is here along with former adviser to Hillary Clinton. Presidential campaign, Democratic strategist, and Blueprint Strategy founder and CEO Antjuan Seawright.Gentlemen, good to see you this morning. Thanks very much for joining us. Antjuan, I want to kick it off with you because of all of this shaming going on, anybody who supports Donald Trump. You see what's happening with Steve Ross this morning.All of this -- you know, upset because the president is actually doing what any president would do, going to visit the victims of these mass shootings. How did the Democrats explain this behavior?ANTJUAN SEAWRIGHT, FOUNDER, BLUEPRINT STRATEGY: I don't know it's about if it's about explaining behavior. But before I even say that, let me just say I'm praying for the community of an impact that I was impacted by Charleston, South Carolina four years ago, so, I know what that feels like.Look, I think, I commend the president for going to visit these communities because I think that's what the leader of the free world should do. The problem I have with the president again, goes back to everyone else's problems, his rhetoric.On the day that he should be concentrated or mourning with families and embraced them, he takes to Twitter or takes the opportunity to talk to the media, and goes into bashing his political opponents or people who may disagree with him or who people may call him out.That's not where this time should be about in this country. You cannot disagree with the president, or you can agree with the president but he should stay focused on trying to make sure these communities heal and doing everything he can to prevent that from happening, and he's not.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Yes, but Antjuan, that's not what's happening. Joaquin Castro, the brother of 2020 hopeful Julian Castro and his campaign chairman outed at least one of his own donors in addition to all of Donald Trump's donors in a bid to shame Trump supporters. So, it's not like you can say, oh, you can disagree with the president. But, you know, we're still going to do what we're going to do and progress.(CROSSTALK)SEAWRIGHT: Maria, Maria, Maria, Maria, Maria.BARTIROMO: That's not what's happening the Democrats are shaming people and they are trying to bully people into not supporting this president. He is a duly elected president, Antjuan.SEAWRIGHT: That -- Maria. Maria, Maria. First of all, this story has changed so much on this network. First, it was in Joaquin Castro did something that was not even public by calling out donors that is public information. That's number one.Now, the storyline that's he's trying to shame. And the point he was trying to make is, well, you --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: The story has not changed, Antjuan.SEAWRIGHT: It has changed.MATT BRAYNARD, FORMER DATA CHIEF AND STRATEGIST FOR TRUMP CAMPAIGN: Absolutely, not.BARTIROMO: The story is the story. The story has not changed.(CROSSTALK)SEAWRIGHT: Absolutely no, no. Maria, Maria -- absolutely had changed. The story has -- Maria, the story --BARTIROMO: The story is the story and it has been the same story from the (INAUDIBLE).SEAWRIGHT: That's not true. That's not true. The story on "FOX & FRIEND".(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: What are you talking about Antjuan?SEAWRIGHT: If you let me finish, I'll tell you. The story on "FOX & FRIENDS" was simply that he did something that was an -- not public by revealing who these people are. Now, it's the story, he's trying to shame the donors.The point he was making was when these people donated to its campaign, they're fueling the rhetoric while he's running ads that has been the cause of some of the violence we see in these communities.MACCALLUM: Matt, what's you're -- what's your reaction?BRAYNARD: That's not. This is -- all right. First of all, yesterday presented a real contrast of substance and style between the president who was unifying, was warm, was bringing a message of healing, and unity, versus these has been Democrats like Beto O'Rourke and former Vice President Biden, who are frothing at the mouth trying to divide people and incite racial hatred.Regarding Representative Castro, there is a word for doxing people, revealing their names and employers, and then, threatening them to think twice --(CROSSTALK)SEAWRIGHT: That's public information, Matt.BRAYNARD: No, let me -- hey, you spoke, let me talk. And threatening them to think twice about exercising their First Amendment right. That word -- that word is racketeering, and it's a federal crime. And I think that the Justice Department needs to open investigations to Representative Castro and see if charges should be brought.And anybody named in that should be racing to a lawyer to think about bringing civil charges because the Democratic Party and their leaders like Maxine Waters and left-wing journalists like that CNN, like Chris Cuomo have been calling for violence against President Trump's supporters.(CROSSTALK)SEAWRIGHT: Oh, here we go. My goodness.BRAYNARD: So, for Representative Castro to do this, it's true incitement, and I believe it's racketeering.BARTIROMO: But what about that? What about that, Antjuan?(CROSSTALK)SEAWRIGHT: But that is that --BARTIROMO: How about Maxine Waters? How about Maxine Waters over the last year? When you see him in the gym, when you see him in restaurants, when you see Trump supporters here, get in their faces. Remember that?SEAWRIGHT: Maria, do you remember the president inciting violence at his own rallies when he (INAUDIBLE) for president?BARTIROMO: No, I don't. No, actually I don't.BRAYNARD: Never, never. He's never done that. He's never done that.SEAWRIGHT: Do you -- do you -- do you remember him saying a party when the face?BARTIROMO: No, I actually don't, Antjuan.SEAWRIGHT: Oh, Maria, let's that -- Maria let --BARTIROMO: What you hear panel, we've got -- we've got three phenomenal people on the panel right now, let's get their opinions.MCDOWELL: Antjuan, its Dagen. I do have to push back on one thing that you said. That information about donors is public to prevent corruption. And the exchange of money -- that information is not public for a member -- a sitting member of Congress to come at --(CROSSTALK)SEAWRIGHT: Maria.MCDOWELL: No, it's Dagen.SEAWRIGHT: No, I know -- I know, but I'm saying --MCDOWELL: To come out -- to come out and say and print people's their places of work. Antjuan, the only reason that you would do that is to inflict some sort of financial at the very least pain on these individuals. There's no other reason.(CROSSTALK)SEAWRIGHT: Dagen. Dagen, Dagen Dagen. Dagen, Dagen.PEEK: And, by the way, it's public information, but it's not easy to get this sort out all that information. Actually, find those people and post it publicly. I mean, what purpose that is serve?BRAYNARD: For -- to threaten as Representative Castro did.SEAWRIGHT: OK, OK. So, I don't know where you all living, but I can go to the -- a web site right now and find out who, where I donated, who my place of employment is and all those things.(CROSSTALK)PEEK: Right. They can -- you can find out your information, but it's harder to find out just sort of a --(CROSSTALK)SEAWRIGHT: No, it's not. That's not true.PEEK: It is. It is. I've done it. I do it all the time.SEAWRIGHT: Yes, me too. Because I do it for a living. That is easy access information.(CROSSTALK)BRAYNARD: But, what's important -- what's --SEAWRIGHT: The point is, that what the representative was trying to do is highlight to people when these people donate to campaigns? That money is being used for x, y, z, 1, 2, 3.In this case, he's saying that money is being used to promote hate, violence, and message --(CROSSTALK)PEEK: But, OK.BRAYNARD: No, what happened with that data? There is people who are going to be sick --MCDOWELL: Wait, I'm going to -- wait, I want to say something. But Antjuan, but by publishing these people's names and their places of employment, he's actually promoting indirectly violence on these people. That's what -- so it --(CROSSTALK)BRAYNARD: I never heard Mr. -- Dagen. I never heard Mr. Castro say, insight violence on these people.MCDOWELL: So, but again, like your -- you'd only print somebody's name if you're a sitting member of Congress. If you want some pain inflicted on them, be it financial on them, and their families, or that you're -- basic, why would you do it, otherwise? Why would you print their names other than to inflict some sort of pain on them?PEEK: So, can I follow up in that by saying --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: How about some money?PEEK: That the Dayton shooter -- let's face it was a fan of Elizabeth Warren. What would you think if people started putting out all the people's names in Dayton, and their places of work who are supporting Elizabeth Warren? Would you not consider that an offense?BARTIROMO: Good point. And notice how we haven't heard anything anymore about the Dayton shooter.PEEK: Never, never. That's right.BARTIROMO: It's not on the -- on the pages in the newspapers anymore. You don't hear it because now we know, he was Antifa and Elizabeth Warren. Yes.PEEK: Exactly right. That's exactly right.BRAYNARD: Nobody. I want -- can I, I like to get in here. But I like to make a point, though. I like to make a point. It's not just that he published their names and employ -- the only reason for also publishing the employers is to get them harassed or -- and potentially fight.PEEK: That's right.BRAYNARD: But the only thing that could come of losing their ports.BARTIROMO: So, what was the point then?BRAYNARD: But that he specifically, out of his own mouth said that he wanted these people to think twice. That is an implicit threat about exercising their own First Amendment rights. That is entirely un-American.SEAWRIGHT: That's not true. That's not true. I wish, when you guys (INAUDIBLE).BRAYNARD: Think twice.BARTIROMO: What was the point, Antjuan?BRAYNARD: What does that mean?BARTIROMO: What do you think the point was then, Antjuan? Go ahead, what was the point? Yes.SEAWRIGHT: The point was to remind these people what they're doing when they give money to Donald Trump's campaign is not to incite violence.BRAYNARD: What (INAUDIBLE) have to do with that?BARTIROMO: Remind them?MALIK: It wasn't to remind them, it was to slander them.BARTIROMO: Of course.SEAWRIGHT: Go, go, -- this is -- this is public information. What do you get missing in all of this?MALIK: That it was -- it was slander appearance simple.BARTIROMO: Go ahead Omeed, Omeed.MALIK: If I may -- if I may, I'm sorry just to jump in here, if I may. It was more than just listing them their names, it was to actually slander them and basically accuse them of being racist.You have no idea why any of those people donated to the president. You have no idea why anyone donates by simply going on an FEC web site, and then listing a name. It was slander, plain and simple.BARTIROMO: Why do we need Castro to remind anybody about anything?(CROSSTALK)SEAWRIGHT: So, when Marco Rubio did in 2016 -- when Marco Rubio did in 2016, did I hear the same energy from you all? Because go back in seconds tweets, he did it about a chef in Florida. I didn't hear the same energy dance. So, why this issue now when Mr. Castro did it?MALIK: Did he call the chef a racist?SEAWRIGHT: He didn't have to. Go look at the tweet.BARTIROMO: You know, such a politicized environment. You would think that we could have a little honesty in something so obvious, Antjuan. Give me a break. Give me a break.SEAWRIGHT: All right, I give you honesty. I'm giving you honesty, Maria. I'm got to tell me to give you honesty.MCDOWELL: You know, Juan -- Antjuan, I will call -- Antjuan, I will call Marco Rubio out for doing that. But the timing is important. This was after two mass shootings in this country.PEEK: Yes.MCDOWELL: This was after two mass shootings in this country.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: So, rather than trying to bring peace and some sort of understanding and healing to the people, what do you do? You print their names and where they work and the businesses that they operate? What do you trying to do?SEAWRIGHT: Dagen.BARTIROMO: Bottom line, we will end it there.BRAYNARD: I have a question for Antjuan.BARTIROMO: We will end it there.BRAYNARD: OK.BARTIROMO: Matt Braynard, Antjuan Seawright, thank you so much.BRAYNARD: Thank you.SEAWRIIGHT: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Yes. Nearing a deal, meanwhile, Broadcom reportedly set to acquire Symantec's enterprise business. We've got those details after this short break.And then he's back, sort of. Colin Kaepernick tweets a video that shows he's ready to return to the NFL. More on that coming up. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Nearly 700 people arrested in immigration raids in Mississippi. Lauren Simonetti with the details this morning and headline, Lauren.SIMONETTI: Maria, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents raiding seven food processing plants in six cities across the State of Mississippi yesterday. Officials called this the largest single state workplace enforcement action in U.S. history. They say about 680 undocumented immigrants have been detained, some of those arrested will prosecuted, others deported.Shares of Symantec sharply higher right here in the premarket, jumping 12 percent, Broadcom reportedly close to acquiring the company's enterprise business. Sources telling the Wall Street Journal that official word could come as early as today when Symantec report its earnings after the closing bell. Broadcom, as you recall, was in talks to acquire all of Symantec before the talks broke down last month.And Disney is getting an invitation from the star of a holiday classic.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm up here, you moron! Come and get me! You got to give up or you're thirsty for more?(END VIDEO CLIP)SIMONETTI: Cannot wait! Disney is reviving "Home Alone" as part of its upcoming streaming service and the original movie star, Macaulay Culkin, weighing in; he tweeted this photo captioned: "This is what an updated 'Home Alone' would actually look like." Following that up with: "Hey, Disney, call me." I love the snowman pillow on the side. So, that's the iconic scene from the "Home Alone" in the 1990s. But I think he should play the dad, right? He should play the dad.BARTIROMO: That was pretty cool. That was a good movie.MCDOWELL: Yes. You can't remake it. You just -- some things are sacred. It's like remaking (INAUDIBLE) -- you just can't do it.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Or making "Top Gun."MCDOWELL: No, that's a sequel.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, a sequel, right. But if they don't have new ideas is the point.MCDOWELL: "Top Gun" is so bad; the original is so bad, it's good. I feel the need, the need for speed.BARTIROMO: All right, quick break, and then when we come back, he's back - - sort of -- Colin Kaepernick tweets a video to show the NFL he's ready to hit the field again. Then, super dad. Watch this as this baseball fan catches the ball while holding his infant baby. Back in a minute with this.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Former NFL quarterback, Colin Kaepernick, ready to get back on the game in the field. Jared Max has the story now in sports. Good morning, Jared.JARED MAX, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SPORTS REPORTER: Good morning, Maria. In case you have not been keeping track, Colin Kaepernick has not played in the NFL since 2016 and he reminds us in a video posted on Twitter. Kap says, it's been 889 days that he's been denied work. His voice opens the video saying: 5:00 a.m., five days a week for three years, still ready. Kaepernick obviously in great shape but is he trying to get a job as body builder or football player? NFL preseason kicks in a high gear with 11 games tonight.While the United States Women's National Soccer team is in a legal fight for gender equality in pay on scale with the men's team. The U.S. Soccer Federation trying to build its defense by hiring two Washington lobbying firms, which according to Politico in (INAUDIBLE) last month, shared a presentation that says players on the women's team were paid far more than those on men's team last year. Over $275,000 versus $57,000 and change. Also, that the women received benefits and guaranteed salary unlike the men's team.All right, you're at a baseball game and you're holding your baby, suddenly foul ball comes your way, what do you do?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: With a baby in hand he was able to make the grab.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We've seen a lot of them recently.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, man. What a baller.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let's get him up here.(END VIDEO CLIP)MAX: What a baller! So, he makes the grab. This could have gone a lot differently but we're happy to see that he gets it. These days, a lot of folks are getting hit --BARTIROMO: I think it was so dangerous to have the baby and then catch the ball like that. I would have sat down and forget about the ball, you have the baby in your hand. I mean, I'm happy he caught it and all, but this was a dangerous, risky move.MAX: We see it at games, you know, a lot. Colin Kaepernick, when I saw this yesterday, I thought now what? 889 days -- denied work he says. Was he really denied work? What does he really want to do? I don't really believe him and haven't believed him for a long time. There was the XFL, there was the Alliance of American Football. He's reported to have put up essentially $10 million ransom what I think it was, an offer that they'd never accept. Does he really want to play football?MCDOWELL: He got a settlement from the NFL. We don't have --MAX: Who's pulling the strings?MCDOWELL: Ended the seven figures.MAX: Who made this video? What's this really about?BARTIROMO: He wants to get back on the field and be activist once again.LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Exactly.MCDOWELL: And he's making money from Nike, clearly.BARTIROMO: That's right.PEEK: Is he good enough to --MCDOWELL: You know, brand on him.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Don't we have to deal with his antics again.MAX: You could be Tom Brady and step out of NFL for three years, you're not just going to step back in.PEEK: Right, right. It's just too difficult.MAX: Yes.PEEK: I mean, was he that good to begin with that he should have been able to do it? Or --BARTIROMO: Wasn't he not playing well when all this started to happened?MAX: Yes. I mean, look, he's kind of a middle-tier quarterback. He did lead them to the Super Bowl once and then it kind of just went mediocre from there.BARTIROMO: Well, we'll see. Jared, thank you. Catch Jared's sports reports on Fox News Headlines 24/7 or on Sirius Radio XM 115. Stay with us in the 8:00 hour, I'm sitting down with baseball all-star, Alex Rodriguez, A-Rod, in the studio.
