Hungary says Huawei to help build its 5G wireless networkAssociated Press Financial WireNovember 5, 2019 Tuesday 2:15 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 506 wordsByline: By PABLO GORONDI, Associated PressDateline: BUDAPEST, Hungary BodyBUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) - Chinese tech company Huawei will take part in the construction of Hungary's next-generation 5G wireless network despite concerns among key allies like the U.S. about potential snooping by Beijing.Speaking at China's International Import Expo in Shanghai, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said Tuesday that Huawei will cooperate with Britain's Vodafone and Germany's Deutsche Telekom in the project.He said Hungary does not discriminate between companies based on their country of origin, as long as they respect Hungary's laws and regulations.The United States has tried to persuade allies to shun Huawei, which it says can be forced to give the Chinese government backdoor access to data.The question was a key issue during a February meeting in Budapest between Szijjarto and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo."We know about the risks that Huawei's presence in their networks present - actual risks to their people, to the loss of privacy protections for their own people, to the risk that China will use this in a way that is not in the best interest of Hungary," Pompeo said at the time.In April, Szijjarto said that Hungary's good cooperation with Huawei was in the country's economic and strategic interests. He has called disapproval of Hungary's openness toward China "hypocritical," as countries and companies all over the world do business with the country.Without specifically targeting Huawei, the European Union recently has also expressed security concerns about the involvement of "states or state-backed actors" like the Chinese company in the development of 5G networks."Hostile third countries may exercise pressure on 5G suppliers in order to facilitate cyberattacks serving their national interests," the EU said in a security assessment released last month.Under Prime Minister Viktor Orban, Hungary has made "mutual respect" a cornerstone of its foreign policy, a pragmatic approach that, in China's case, for example, has mostly avoided sensitive topics like Beijing's treatment of its Uighur minority or the protests in Hong Kong.In 2013, Huawei became the first Chinese company to strike a "strategic partnership" with the Hungarian government, a deal meant to ensure and expand the company's role in the country's economy, and the Orban government has emphasized the need to attract Chinese investments.Huawei's decade-old production and logistics facilities in Hungary, its Europe Supply Center, provides products to over 40 countries and is the company's largest such complex outside China.Hungary is also taking part in China's multibillion-dollar "Belt and Road" infrastructure initiative. Beijing is financing the reconstruction of railway lines between Budapest and Belgrade, the capital of Serbia, supposedly to facilitate the transportation of Chinese goods to Europe.The project has been criticized as needless and too expensive, but Orban has said it enhances Hungary's economic position regardless of its profitability, which he said was of secondary importance.Load-Date: November 6, 2019End of Document

There's a lot at stake in the cyber-currency warCE Noticias Financieras EnglishNovember 30, 2019 SaturdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 944 wordsBodyWhen Facebook's top executive, Mark Zuckerberg, recently testified before the U.S. Congress that the U.S. has no monopoly on regulating the next generation of payment technologies, it wasn't entirely wrong. Zuckerberg wanted to imply that, like it or not Libra, the (pseudo) cryptocurrency that Facebook proposes, in a few months there may be a digital currency with global ambitions managed by the Chinese state, and we are likely to like that currency even less.Perhaps Zuckerberg exaggerated by suggesting that the looming rise of a Chinese digital currency may weaken the dollar's general dominance over international trade and finance (at least the large part that is legal and taxed and regulated). In fact, US authorities have immense power not only over local entities but also over any financial firm that needs access to dollar markets, something that Europe recently learned when the United States imposed tough restraints on European banks in transactions with Iran.The depth and liquidity of America's financial markets, the strength of its institutions, and the rule of law will long prevail over China's attempts at monetary dominance. China's burdensome capital controls, limits on foreign bond and stock holding, and the general opacity of its financial system leave the yuan many decades away to supplant the dollar in the legal world economy.But controlling the underground economy is something else. The global volume of this economy (which includes above all tax evasion and various criminal activities, but also terrorism) is much smaller than that of the legal economy (perhaps one-fifth), but it is still very important. The question here is not so much what currency dominates, but how to minimize adverse effects. And a widely used, state-backed Chinese digital currency can certainly have repercussions, especially in areas where China's interests do not match those of the West.In principle, a U.S.-regulated digital currency may be required to be tracked by US authorities, so that if North Korea were to use it to hire Russian nuclear physicists, or Iran to finance terrorist activities, would be at high risk of transactions being uncovered and perhaps even blocked. But in the case of a digital currency of Chinese origin, the United States would have much fewer instruments at its disposal. Western authorities could ultimately ban it, but that would not prevent its use in many parts of Africa, Latin America and Asia, which in turn could lead to some underground demand, even in the United States and Europe.Can't cryptocurrencies already created, such as bitcoin, fulfill the same function? In fact, they meet it to a very limited degree. But around the world the authorities have immense incentives to set limits on cryptocurrencies, by a marked restriction on their use in banks and retailers. These restrictions detract from liquidity from current cryptocurrencies and ultimately significantly reduce their core underlying value. But the same would not happen with a Chinese digital yuan, which could easily be spent on one of the world's two largest economies. It is true that China's future digital currency will almost certainly use blockchain technology with "permissions," so a central clearing camera will give the Chinese government control of everything that happens with that currency. Not America, though.The Facebook Pound cryptocurrency also uses permissions, in this case, under the auspices of the Swiss authorities. Isit will undoubtedly be much easier to cooperate with Switzerland (Libra's official registration headquarters) than with China, despite Switzerland's long tradition of granting privacy to financial transactions, especially with regard to tax evasion.Moreover, the fact that Libra is tied to the dollar expands the ability of US authorities to monitor it, as all dollar transactions are currently settled through US-regulated entities. However, because much of Libra's functionality can be duplicated with traditional financial instruments, it is difficult to see a significant demand base for you, except for people interested in going unnoticed. Unless technology-sponsored currencies offer truly superior technology (and this is far from obvious) they should be regulated just like everyone else.Pound encouraged central banks in many advanced economies to accelerate programs for the wider provision of retail digital currencies. And hopefully it will serve to reinforce their attempts to improve financial inclusion. But this battle is not just for the gains derived from the issuance of currency; ultimately, it's because of the state's ability to regulate and tax the economy as a whole, and because of the US government's ability to use the dollar's global role as an instrument of international policy.Today, the United States has financial sanctions in place against 12 countries. Turkey was briefly in this group last month after the invasion of Kurdish territory in Syria, but sanctions were overturned soon after. Those applied to Russia have been in place for five years.Just as technology transformed media, politics, and business, it is about to cause a similar disruption in America's ability to leverage confidence in its currency as an instrument of its broader national interests. Libra is probably not the answer to the impending disruption of state-backed digital currencies from China and elsewhere. But if it is not, Western governments must start thinking of an answer already, before it is too late.Kenneth Rogoff, a former imf chief economist, is a professor of Economics and Public Policy at Harvard University. © Project Syndicate 1995–2019.

TikTok, Huawei Helping China's Campaign To Repress Uighur MuslimsStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeNovember 30, 2019 SaturdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: WORLD NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 757 wordsByline: Steven ClarkeBodyHere's a rundown of those reports:In September, The Guardian reported on leaked internal guidelines instructing moderators to censor content that criticize controversial topics about China, such as its socialist system, Tiananmen Square, and Tibet.Moderators were also told to censor LGBTQ content in conservative countries, like Turkey, according to The Guardian.TikTok confirmed the guidelines in bothreports, but said they were no longer in use and that "we have since made significant progress in establishing a more robust localized approach."On November 5, six formerTikTok employees based in the United States told The Washington Post that moderators in China told them to censor "culturally problematic" videos showing vaping, "heavy kissing and more suggestive dance moves", and "social political topics."TikTok has said that it doesn't censor political content or take instructions from China.On November 22, the German news site Netzpolitik published a leaked excerpt from TikTok's new moderation guidelines, which included instructions not to promote videos related to political protest.The company did not deny the authenticity of the Netzpolitik documents, but said it "does not moderate content due to political sensitivities".Feroza Aziz, a 17-year-old from New Jersey, said her account on the Chinese-owned social network was suspended after she posted three videos in which she condemned China's policy against the Uighurs."No China-related content was moderated on this account", Han wrote.Representatives for ByteDance andTikTok did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.The agreement also reportedly says ByteDance will increase its offline cooperation with the police department, although the details of this cooperation are not clear.Xinjiang has a population of about 10 million citizens, many of whom are Uighur or other ethnic minorities, and in May, Assistant Secretary of US Defense Randall Schriver said "at least a million but likely closer to 3 million citizens" were detained detention camps.The firm said it had now lifted the ban and said it was not related to Chinese politics but her prior behaviour of the app.Testimony from a huge sequence of folks to private escaped China and troves of leaked documents all level to that the camps are no longer the vocational training centers that the Chinese language government says they are.Since final yr, ByteDance has flourished. ItsTikTok app has been downloaded a billion times, of which almost 100 million came from the United States, and it has a jaw-dropping valuation of $75 billion.Former Ohio State quarterback, Browns receiver Terrelle Pryor stabbed in PittsburghThe news was broken by ESPN's National Football League insider Adam Schefter, who shared the frightful story via twitter. In 2016, for the Browns, Pryor had a career year, finishing with 77 catches for 1,007 yards and four touchdowns.ByteDance has been guiding and serving to Xinjiang authorities and media shops to make use of its information aggregation app and Douyin to "propagate and showcase Hotan's new picture", in keeping with the ASPIreport.The ByteDance spokeswoman said that in Hotan, Douyin and Toutiao "work on poverty alleviation efforts, similar to what they do in many regions across China".ByteDance is uniquely susceptible to being used by the Communist Party because of its closeness to the censorship and surveillance apparatus of the party-led state, the authors wrote."Beijing has demonstrated a propensity for controlling and shaping overseas Chinese language-language media", the authors wrote. However, mistakes like these, as observers have it, are not helping the perception of the public, of the firm."We have consistently spoken out against the existence of political re-education camps, widespread surveillance and restrictions of freedom of religion or belief against Uighurs and other minorities in Xinjiang", a spokesperson for the European Commission said in a statement this week.The tech big reportedly constructed the police surveillance equipment in Karamay and Kashgar prefectures, which have grow to be a central a part of the ever present monitoring system in Xinjiang.A Huawei statement said it doesn't comment on specific customer programs but affirms that its technology complies with the laws where it is sold.Thesereports are consistent with an overwhelming and growing body of evidence that the Chinese Communist Party is committing human rights violations and abuses against individuals in mass detention, Pompeo said.Load-Date: December 1, 2019End of Document

IS TIKTOK A THREAT TO THE UNITED STATES?States News ServiceNovember 22, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 545 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: ALEXANDRIA, VA BodyThe following information was released by the American Spectator Foundation:byJohn JiangA "substantial security problem" and "tools for espionage" are not accusations one might normally expect to be leveled against a music-based social media app marketed to teenage girls. Yet these are just a few of the charges being made against TikTok by everyone from tech titans to senators and think tanks.While many Americans are aware of TikTok it has been the most-downloaded social media app in the United States for some time, beating out Instagram and Facebook fewer know about its origins and ownership. The app was launched in 2017 by ByteDance, a Chinese tech firm. While TikTok itself is headquartered in Los Angeles, it ultimately answers to its parent company's office in Beijing. As with all Chinese companies, ByteDance's obligations to the Chinese Communist Party are murky: though ostensibly independent, its full cooperation is expected when needed to "maintain national security." Whether or not China's security concerns will mandate turning over data from Americans, now or in the future, remains to be seen.In the meantime, legislators are beginning to pay attention. Congress held a hearing two weeks ago to probe ties between the tech industry and China, though TikTok turned down its invitation to appear. Suspicion of the app has been bipartisan: Sen. Tom Cotton has joined Sen. Marco Rubio and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer in voicing concern that TikTok may be censoring mentions of the ongoing Hong Kong protests.Yet the loudest criticism of the app has come from its competitors in Silicon Valley, such as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who has repeatedly attacked his company's fastest-growing competitor. In a fiery speech delivered at Georgetown University last month, the billionaire tech tycoon attempted to cast TikTok as an enemy of free speech and a vessel for the Chinese government to spread its authoritarian norms. By Zuckerberg's estimation, Facebook is the natural great defender of American values, alongside its messaging software WhatsApp. TikTok has fired back, asserting that The more Mark Zuckerberg has come under scrutiny, the more TikTok has shown up in his speeches, interviews and op-eds. You would have to ask him if this is pure coincidence.The concern about TikTok from Silicon Valley is certainly cynical. What Zuckerberg failed to mention in his speech is that his company had tried and failed to buy TikTok's predecessor, a fact that threatens to reframe his warnings as nothing more than attempts to use government power to suppress a potent rival. Facebook is also currently enduring its own share of congressional scrutiny over accusations of monopoly and user privacy violations and will do whatever it can to divert the gaze of lawmakers.But Congress need not prosecute one case at the expense of the other. This is the view of Sen. Josh Hawley, who has positioned himself as Big Tech's nemesis on Capitol Hill. Hawley chaired the hearing on TikTok not long after he introduced a bill to regulate addictive social media features with Twitter and Facebook in mind. As he put it to reporters, "Thankfully, they're not the Communist Chinese government, but I don't know that they're exactly good actors, either."Load-Date: November 22, 2019End of Document

Sinovac Reports Unaudited Third Quarter 2019 Financial ResultsBusiness WireNovember 15, 2019 Friday 1:40 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Business Wire, Inc.Length: 4654 wordsDateline: BEIJING BodySinovac Biotech Ltd. (NASDAQ: SVA) ("Sinovac" or the "Company"), a leading provider of biopharmaceutical products in China, announced today its unaudited financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2019.Third Quarter and First Nine Months of 2019 Financial Summary• Sales for the third quarter of 2019 were $64.3 million, an increase of 19.3% from $53.9 million in the prior year period.• Sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, were $164.9 million, a decrease of 6.5% from $176.4 million in the prior year period. $8.9 million of this decrease is attributable to changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and Chinese renminbi.• Operating income for the third quarter decreased 15.7% from the prior year period due to a change in sales mix, with a greater proportion of revenue generated from the lower-margin influenza vaccine.• Operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, decreased 11.7% from the prior year period due to lower sales.• The Company posted $6.3 million of net income attributable to common shareholders, or $0.06 per basic and diluted share in the third quarter, compared to net income attributable to common shareholders of $8.9 million, or $0.12 per basic and diluted share, in the prior year period.• The Company posted $18.1 million of net income attributable to common shareholders, or $0.19 per basic and diluted share in the nine months ended September 30, 2019, compared to net income attributable to common shareholders of $22.9 million, or $0.37 per basic and $0.36 per diluted share, in the prior year period.Mr. Weidong Yin, Chairman, President, and CEO of Sinovac, commented, "We delivered sales growth this quarter despite facing challenges from market demand for some of our vaccines and a lack of supply of certain products. We are pleased to report that during the quarter, Anflu, the seasonal influenza vaccine, was relaunched to the market after a one-year absence due to the manufacturing disruption orchestrated by the minority shareholder of our Beijing operation last year.""We have made strong progress in our pipeline development in 2019, and we expect the commercial launches of varicella, sIPV, and QIV in 2020. We also welcome the implementation of the new vaccine legislation, which will ultimately benefit high-quality vaccine manufacturers such as Sinovac as well as public health in China," Mr. Yin concluded.Pipeline DevelopmentVaricella -The Company filed an application for a production license for its varicella vaccine with the National Medical Products Administration ("NMPA"), previously known as the China State Food and Drug Administration, in November 2017. The site inspection by the NMPA in July 2019 was successfully passed. The Company expects the license to be issued in early 2020.23-valent Pneumococcalpolysaccharidevaccine (or PPV-23) - The Company submitted its application for a production license in 2017. In 2018, the NMPA requested a supplementary submission. The technical review by NMPA was completed at the end of September and a notice of site inspection was issued to the Company. The on-site inspection is currently being prepared. The Company expects the license to be issued in 2021.Quadrivalent influenza vaccine (or QIV) - The Company filed an application with the NMPA for a production license for the QIV vaccine in March 2019. Preliminary questions and answers have been submitted. Sinovac's application is currently under review, and the Company expects the production license to be issued in 2020.Sabin Inactivated Polio vaccine (or sIPV) - The production license application for the sIPV vaccine was accepted by the NMPA in January 2019. In March 2019, given the high demand for effective polio vaccines, the application was granted fast track review. Currently, the application is under review. The Company expects the license to be issued in 2020.Unaudited Financial Results for the Third Quarter of 2019Summary of sales and gross profit(In $000 except percentage data)2019 Q3% of Sales2018 Q3% of SalesHepatitis A vaccine - Healive®14,68922.8%10,04018.6%Hepatitis A&B vaccine - Bilive®--9461.8%Hepatitis vaccines subtotal14,68922.8%10,98620.4%Influenza vaccine12,96620.2%140.0%EV71 vaccine - Inlive®32,47150.4%42,54278.8%Mumps vaccine4,2176.6%4070.8%Total sales64,343100.0%53,949100.0%Cost of sales10,34716.1%4,6548.6%Gross profit53,99683.9%49,29591.4%Sales for the third quarter of 2019 were $64.3 million, an increase of 19.3% from $53.9 million in the prior year period. The increase was due to higher sales of influenza vaccines.The lack of Bilive® sales is still attributed to the suspended production of the product, which was due to a lack of supply of the hepatitis B vaccine from the Company's sole supplier.Gross profit in the third quarter of 2019 was $54.0 million compared to gross profit of $49.3 million in the prior year period. Gross margin was 83.9% compared to 91.4% in the prior year period. The decrease of gross margin was due to a change of sales mix, primarily caused by increased sales of the lower-margin influenza vaccine.Selling, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter of 2019 were $34.4 million compared to $28.5 million in the prior year period. The Company incurred higher selling expenses in the third quarter of 2019 due to higher sales and marketing activities.R&D expenses in the third quarter of 2019 were $5.7 million, compared to $4.7 million in the prior year period, as the Company continued to invest in the development of its pipeline of product candidates, including sIPV, PPV, and the varicella vaccine.Net income in the third quarter of 2019 was $11.7 million compared to $13.2 million in the prior year period. Net income decreased as a higher proportion of revenue was generated from the lower-margin influenza vaccines.Net income attributable to common shareholders was $6.3 million, or $0.06 per basic and diluted share, compared to net income attributable to common shareholders of $8.9 million, or $0.12 per basic and diluted share, in the prior year period.As the Company announced on February 22, 2019, the Company's Board of Directors determined that certain shareholders became "Acquiring Persons," as defined in the Company's Rights Agreement ("Rights Agreement"), and a "Trigger Event" occurred under the Rights Agreement. As a result, new common and preferred shares of the Company were issued. Without the effect of the implementation of the Rights Agreement and the newly issued common and preferred shares, basic and diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2019 would be $0.11.Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA was $15.8 million in the third quarter of 2019 compared to $18.4 million in the prior year period. Non-GAAP net income in the third quarter of 2019 was $12.5 million compared to $14.9 million in the prior year period. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the third quarter of 2019 were $0.07 per share compared to $0.14 per share in the prior year period. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the third quarter of 2019 excluding the implementation of the Rights Agreement and the newly issued common and preferred shares would be $0.12 per share. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures are included at the end of this earnings announcement.Unaudited Financial Results for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019Summary of sales and gross profit(In $000 except percentage data)2019 YTD% of Sales2018 YTD% of SalesHepatitis A vaccine - Healive®39,09023.7%35,89220.3%Hepatitis A&B vaccine - Bilive®--11,2906.4%Hepatitis vaccines subtotal39,09023.7%47,18226.7%Influenza vaccine12,9667.9%2,0781.2%EV 71 vaccine - Inlive®105,69764.0%126,65571.8%Mumps vaccine7,1894.4%5240.3%Total sales164,942100.0%176,439100.0%Cost of sales20,21812.3%17,99110.2%Gross profit144,72487.7%158,44889.8%Sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, were $164.9 million, a decrease of 6.5% from $176.4 million in the prior year period. The decrease was due to zero sales of Bilive® and lower sales in Inlive®. The sales decrease was partly offset by sales increases in Healive®, the influenza vaccine, and the mumps vaccine. In addition, $8.9 million of the decline in sales for the first nine months of 2019 were attributable to the depreciation of the Chinese renminbi against the U.S. dollar.Gross profit in the nine months ended September 30, 2019, was $144.7 million compared to gross profit of $158.4 million in the prior year period. Gross margin was 87.7% compared to 89.8% in the prior year period. The decrease of gross margin was due to a change in sales mix, with a higher proportion of sales of the influenza vaccine, which has a lower profit margin.Selling, general and administrative expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2019, were $88.2 million compared to $96.3 million in the prior year period. The Company incurred lower legal and consulting fees associated with the Company's ongoing litigation matters in the 2019 period.R&D expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2019, were $16.5 million compared to $14.8 million in the prior year period.Net income in the nine months ended September 30, 2019, was $32.4 million compared to $35.8 million in the prior year period. Net income decreased primarily due to lower revenue.Net income attributable to common shareholders was $18.1 million, or $0.19 per basic and diluted share, compared to net income attributable to common shareholders of $22.9 million, or $0.37 per basic and $0.36 per diluted share, in the prior year period.Excluding the implementation of the Rights Agreement, as described above, and the newly issued common and preferred shares, basic and diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, would be $0.31 and $0.30, respectively.Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA was $45.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019, compared to $52.6 million in the prior year period. Non-GAAP net income in the nine months ended September 30, 2019, was $34.5 million compared to $38.9 million in the prior year period. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the nine months ended September 30, 2019, were $0.21 per share compared to $0.41 per share in the prior year period. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the nine months ended September 30, 2019, excluding the implementation of the Rights Agreement and the newly issued common and preferred shares, would be $0.32 per share. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures are included at the end of this earnings announcement.As of September 30, 2019, cash and cash equivalents totaled $156.7 million compared to $158.2 million as of December 31, 2018. In the nine months ended September 30, 2019, net cash provided by operating activities was $12.6 million, net cash used in investing activities was $10.2 million, and net cash used in financing activities was $1.0 million, including loan repayment of $3.3 million. As of September 30, 2019, the Company had $3.7 million in bank loans due within one year. The Company expects that its current cash position will be able to support its operations for at least the next 12 months.The Company's Interim Financial Statements are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, the Interim Financial Statements have not been audited or reviewed by the Company's independent registered accounting firm.Legal ProceedingsAs previously disclosed by the Company, on March 13, 2018, 1Globe Capital LLC ("1Globe") filed a complaint against the Company in the Antigua Court. The trial of the matter took place from December 3 to 5, 2018. On December 19, 2018, the Antigua judge handed down his judgment (the "Antigua Judgment"), finding in the Company's favor in full, dismissing 1Globe's claim and declaring that the Rights Agreement was validly adopted as a matter of Antigua law. On January 29, 2019, 1Globe filed a Notice of Appeal against the Antigua Judgment. On March 4, 2019, 1Globe filed an application for urgent interim relief, seeking an injunction to prevent the Company from continuing to implement its Rights Agreement until the resolution of the appeal. This application was heard on April 4, 2019, at which the Court of Appeal issued an order restraining the Company from operating the Rights Agreement in any way that affects 1Globe's rights or shareholding or otherwise distributing the exchange shares to the Company's shareholders who did not trigger the Rights Plan until after the determination of the appeal (the "Exchange Shares"). 1Globe's appeal against the Antigua Judgment was heard in the week of September 16, 2019, and the appeal decision is now pending.As disclosed previously, on March 5, 2018, the Company filed a lawsuit in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware seeking a determination whether 1Globe, the Chiang Li Family, OrbiMed Advisors, LLC and certain other shareholders of the Company had triggered the Rights Agreement. On April 12, 2018, 1Globe filed an amended answer to the Company's complaint, counterclaims, and a third-party complaint against the Company and Mr. Weidong Yin alleging, among other allegations, that the Rights Agreement is not valid. On March 6, 2019, the Delaware Chancery Court entered a status quo order providing that the Company not distribute any of the Exchange Shares to the Company's shareholders who did not trigger the Rights Plan until the final disposition of the pending Delaware litigation or further order of the Court. On April 8, 2019, the Delaware Chancery Court stayed the Delaware litigation pending the outcome of 1Globe's appeal of the Antigua Judgment.Status of Exchange Shares and Trading in the Company's SharesAs a result of the pending legal proceedings described above, the Exchange Shares are expected to remain in a trust for the benefit of the Company's shareholders who did not trigger the Rights Plan until, at least, the conclusion of the appeal against the Antigua Judgment and final disposition of the Delaware litigation or further order of the Delaware Chancery Court. The Exchange Shares remain issued and outstanding. The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC implemented a halt on trading of the Company's common shares at the time of issuance of the Exchange Shares to the trust and the Company is currently unable to estimate when trading will resume, or whether Nasdaq will take any additional action regarding the trading of the Company's common shares.About SinovacSinovac Biotech Ltd. is a China-based biopharmaceutical company that focuses on the research, development, manufacturing and commercialization of vaccines that protect against human infectious diseases. Sinovac's product portfolio includes vaccines against enterovirus71 (EV71), hepatitis A and B, seasonal influenza, H5N1 pandemic influenza (avian flu), H1N1 influenza (swine flu), and mumps. Healive, the hepatitis A vaccine manufactured by the Company, has passed the assessment under WHO prequalification procedures in 2017. The EV71 vaccine, an innovative vaccine developed by Sinovac against hand foot and mouth disease caused by EV71, was commercialized in China in 2016.

The Company is also the only supplier of the H5N1 pandemic influenza vaccine to the government stockpiling program. The Company is developing a number of new products including a Sabin-strain inactivated polio vaccine, pneumococcal polysaccharides vaccine, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and varicella vaccine. Sinovac primarily sells its vaccines in China, while also exploring growth opportunities in international markets. The Company has exported select vaccines to over 10 countries in Asia and South America.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to differ materially from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a difference include our inability to compete successfully in the competitive and rapidly changing marketplace in which we operate, failure to retain key employees, cancellation or delay of projects, failure to satisfy regulatory and other requirements, disapproval or delay in approval of new products by regulatory bodies, disruptions to our operations, the results of any pending litigation (including litigation relating to the 2018 annual general meeting, the validity of our Rights Agreement, and the issuance of the Exchange Shares), Nasdaq's halt in trading of the Company's securities and any future action taken by Nasdaq regarding the trading of the Company's securities, and adverse general economic conditions in China, the United States and elsewhere. These risks and other factors include those listed under "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form 20-F as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as "may," "will," "should," "expects," "intends," "plans," "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "predicts," "potential," "continue," or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. The Company assumes no obligation to update the forward-looking information contained in this release.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresTo supplement its consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, Sinovac uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to the table captioned "Reconciliations of non-GAAP Measures to the Nearest Comparable GAAP Measures" in this results announcement.Sinovac believes that non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS help identify underlying trends in its business that could otherwise be distorted by the effect of certain income or expenses that Sinovac includes in net income and diluted EPS. Sinovac believes that non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS provide useful information about its core operating results, enhance the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision-making. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS should not be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to income from operations, net income, diluted EPS, or any other measure of performance or as an indicator of Sinovac's operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures presented here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures to our data.Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA represents net income and excludes interest and financing expenses, interest income, net other income (expenses) and income tax benefit (expenses), and certain non-cash expenses, consisting of share-based compensation expenses, amortization and depreciation that Sinovac does not believe are reflective of the core operating performance during the periods presented.Non-GAAP net income represents net income before share-based compensation expenses and foreign exchange gain or loss.Non-GAAP diluted EPS represents non-GAAP net income attributable to common shareholders divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the periods on a diluted basis, including accounting for the effect of the assumed conversion of options.SINOVAC BIOTECH LTD.Consolidated Balance sheetsAs of September 30, 2019 and December 31,

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -7.50.The S&P 500 futures trade roughly in-line with fair value following a quiet weekend in news, muted sessions in Asia and Europe, and a dearth of earnings reports today. The benchmark index enters this week less than nine points from its all-time high.With no economic reports set to be released today, either, the market will remain focused on any U.S.-China trade progress ahead of the Dec. 15 tariffs. Central bank meetings have also crept into the market's radar, although no change is policy is expected from either the Fed on Wednesday or the ECB on Thursday.In the health care space, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY 61.10, +1.15, +1.9%) has pleased investors with data for a cancer treatment while ArQule (ARQL 19.53, +9.87, +102.3%) has agreed to be acquired by Merck (MRK 88.97, +0.12, +0.1%) for $20 per share or about $2.7 billion.U.S. Treasuries are little changed this morning.

The S&P 500 rose 0.9%, which was slightly less than the gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.2%), Nasdaq Composite (+1.0%), and Russell 2000 (+1.2%).The headline nonfarm payrolls figure increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus of 182,000), which blew past many of the estimates on Wall Street. Other key figures included the unemployment rate declining to 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%) from 3.6% in October and average hourly earnings increasing 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).Supporting risk sentiment was a better-than-expected preliminary consumer sentiment reading for December and an announcement from China that it started to exempt some U.S. agricultural purchases from tariffs. Altogether, the news reinforced a positive economic outlook with the Fed presumably on hold, the state of the consumer in good shape, and the trade situation seemingly improving.It was no surprise, then, to see a cyclically-charged rally. The energy sector (+2.0%) led the advance amid some key OPEC+ news that contributed to higher oil prices ($59.20, +0.75, +1.3%). The oil producers agreed to cut production by 500,000 barrels per day until March, with Saudi Arabia also offering up to an additional 400,000 barrel cut of its own.The rate-sensitive utilities sector (-0.2%) struggled during the day, largely due to the increase in Treasury yields that resulted from the jobs report waning demand for bonds. The 2-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.84%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 97.68.In corporate news, Goldman Sachs (GS 224.61, +7.47, +3.4%) outperformed after Bloomberg reported that the bank could settle its 1MDB scandal for less than $2 billion, which would also be less than expected. Ulta Beauty (ULTA 262.20, +26.18, +11.1%) climbed more than 10% after providing positive earnings results and upbeat earnings guidance.Separately, Dow components Apple (AAPL 270.71, +5.13, +1.9%), JPMorgan Chase (JPM 135.04, +1.98, +1.5%), and Nike (NKE 97.00, +1.21, +1.3%) set new all-time highs on Friday.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for November:November nonfarm payrolls increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus 182,000); private sector payrolls increased by 254,000 (Briefing.com consensus 175,000); the unemployment rate was 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%), versus 3.6% in October; average hourly earnings were up 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.4% (from 0.2%) in October.The key takeaway, from the spike in nonfarm payrolls to the drop in the unemployment rate to the increase in wages, is that it was a very encouraging report for the U.S. economic outlook.The preliminary December reading for the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 99.2 from 96.8 in November, hitting the upper end of the range it has been in since the beginning of 2017.The key takeaway from the report is that it bodes well for the consumer spending outlook, as rising levels of consumer sentiment pair nicely with income gains to lend confidence to increased spending activity.Wholesale inventories increased 0.1% m/m in October (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%), on top of a downwardly revised 0.7% decline (from -0.4%) in September, which was the largest decline since February 2016. Wholesale sales were down 0.7% in October after declining 0.1% in September.The key takeaway from the report is that it could prove difficult for wholesalers to gain pricing power given that inventory growth remains well ahead of sales growth on a yr/yr basis.Consumer credit increased by $18.90 bln in October (Briefing.com consensus $17.30 bln) after increasing an upwardly revised $9.60 bln (from $9.50 bln) in September.The key takeaway from the report is that the October increase was fairly evenly distributed between nonrevolving credit like student or auto loans and revolving credit like credit cards.Investors will not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +30.5% YTDS&P 500 +25.5% YTDRussell 2000 +21.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.1% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 2135/743. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2209/891.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: December 9, 2019End of Document

Wholesale sales were down 0.7% in October after declining 0.1% in September.The key takeaway from the report is that it could prove difficult for wholesalers to gain pricing power given that inventory growth remains well ahead of sales growth on a yr/yr basis.Consumer credit increased by $18.90 bln in October (Briefing.com consensus $17.30 bln) after increasing an upwardly revised $9.60 bln (from $9.50 bln) in September.The key takeaway from the report is that the October increase was fairly evenly distributed between nonrevolving credit like student or auto loans and revolving credit like credit cards.Investors will not receive any notable economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +30.5% YTDS&P 500 +25.5% YTDRussell 2000 +21.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.1% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 2135/743. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2209/891.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: December 9, 2019End of Document

ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL BRIAN A. BENCZKOWSKI DELIVERS REMARKS AT THE THIRTEENTH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND INDUSTRY MEETING ON INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ENFORCEMENTStates News ServiceNovember 6, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1963 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the U.S. Department of Justice:Washington, DCUnited States~Wednesday, November 6, 2019Remarks as Prepared for DeliveryGood afternoon. It's a great honor to welcome you to the 13th edition of the Law Enforcement and Industry Meeting on Intellectual Property Enforcement.This conference offers a great opportunity for CCIPS, the Department, and each of our law enforcement colleagues gathered at the table today to discuss our shared efforts in IP enforcement, and to hear your comments about the latest successes and challenges. It's an event that benefits all of us.Since this conference first began more than a decade ago, we have seen dramatic changes in IP crime:Copyright pirates have moved from peddling individual copies of movies, music, and software on street corners or offering individual downloads online, to operating technologically advanced, multi-national streaming services that generate millions of dollars in illicit profits.These services also pose a risk to consumers by coupling malicious code with the stolen content.Trademark counterfeiters are leveraging the power of online sales to copy and sell knock-offs of any product imaginable, using recognized streams of commerce upon which Americans have come to rely.These counterfeiters deliver substandard and sometimes hazardous goods to an unsuspecting public.Finally, the theft of trade secrets has morphed from individualized action into the highly-refined, publically-stated goal of certain nation-states that see themselves as America's economic adversaries rather than as responsible trading partners.So what is the Department doing to keep up in this ever-changing landscape?First and foremost, we employ the expertise of attorneys across the Department and our federal prosecutors across the country to bring high-impact cases to deter IP crime.I wanted to highlight some examples of recent prosecutions that show the diligence and creativity of our investigators and prosecutors in bringing these cases.Online Copyright Infringement JetflicksIn August, we announced charges in the Eastern District of Virginia against eight Las Vegas residents for running two of the largest unauthorized streaming services in the country.One of the services known as Jetflicks allegedly obtained infringing television programs by using sophisticated computer scripts to scour pirate websites around the world and collect the television shows.It then made the programming available for paying Jetflicks subscribers to stream and download, often just one day after the original episodes aired.The scheme, as charged, resulted in the loss of millions of dollars by television program and motion picture copyright owners.This case demonstrates how IP criminals are leveraging technology to operate at unprecedented scale and speed.The Jetflicks case is indicative of other technological challenges we are facing in copyright, such as the explosive growth of internet streaming devices, or "set top boxes," which likewise can deliver massive amounts of pirated content.CCIPS Senior Counsel Matt Lamberti, who is working with the Eastern District of Virginia U.S. Attorney's Office on the Jetflicks prosecution, is here with us today.In addition to unlimited free content, these services will often install malicious software that can compromise the computer security of unwitting consumers, sending passwords, financial information and other personal information to be distributed for profit on the internet.Trafficking In Counterfeit Goods Container ShippingThe Department of Justice also has obtained a slew of guilty pleas in a massive 22-defendant counterfeit importation conspiracy charged in the Eastern District of New York, resulting in the dismantling of one of the largest counterfeit goods trafficking rings ever uncovered in the United States.These conspirators trafficked not drugs nor electronics, but counterfeit luxury goods that were made in China: fake Louis Vuitton, Gucci, and Michael Kors handbags, wallets, belts, perfume, and other merchandise.This operation is significant in both its scope and scalehad the items been legitimate, it is estimated that the value would be over $1 billion in total, making it one of the largest counterfeit luxury goods cases in U.S. history.Members of the conspiracy engaged in multiple schemes to avoid detection, pretending to be representatives of legitimate importation companies, submitting false paperwork to customs authorities, and lying about the nature of the goods in customs declarations.Once the goods were in the U.S., conspirators sold those counterfeit items in multiple jurisdictions across the country, and laundered millions of dollars of proceeds.To date, 20 defendants have pleaded guilty in the Eastern District of New York and New York state court in this investigation and related cases. CCIPS Senior Counsel James Yoon, one of the prosecutors working on Operation TMG, is in the audience today.Trade Secret Theft Syntactic FoamThis past summer, following a nine-day jury trial, an engineer and former employee of a Houston company was convicted of conspiracy to commit theft of trade secrets in federal court in the District of Columbia.This prosecution represented the joint effort of FBI counterintelligence agents, the DC U.S. Attorney's Office and prosecutors from CCIPS, and the National Security Division's Counterintelligence and Espionage Section.The defendant, Shan Shi, and four co-defendants were charged with conspiring to steal trade secrets from a business in the United States on behalf of a company in China that was engaged in manufacturing syntactic foam, a high-performance, naval-grade product with commercial and military uses that is essential for deep-sea oil and gas drilling.Shan Shi and his coconspirators went to great lengths to cash in on the Chinese government's desire to obtain syntactic foam technology.During the course of the trial, the jury heard about the economic incentives in place in China that facilitate and even encourage the theft of American IP where it meets a perceived technological need of the Chinese state.We need to focus future enforcement efforts on counteracting these incentives.International Engagement The China InitiativeWhether it is manufactured goods violating trademarks and counterfeits, or the theft of valuable trade secret information, we at the Department have our eyes wide open when it comes to the common denominator in the vast majority of these cases: China.China's state-provided economic incentives, vast manufacturing base, and limited domestic enforcement combine to create an environment that encourages IP theft.And China is at the forefront of the conversation as we address the uptick in trade secret thefts on behalf of foreign corporations or foreign government interests.In November 2018, I stood together with then-Attorney General Sessions to announce the Department's new "China Initiative" which has proceeded full steam ahead under the leadership of Attorney General Barr.Under the China Initiative, the Criminal Division, National Security Division, FBI, and U.S. Attorney's Offices have redoubled our efforts to investigate Chinese companies and individuals for the theft of trade secrets.We have increased our outreach efforts to U.S. Attorneys with materials to raise awareness of these threats.We have fostered a dialogue between the government and private sector to ensure that, whether we are dealing with counterfeiting, trade secret theft, a data breach, or ransomware, the Department is well-positioned to obtain evidence from industry.And we have sought to find opportunities to better fight against threats to supply chains for components used in military and government systems and in critical civilian infrastructure.Each of these efforts stem from the recognition that we must not stand by and allow our intellectual property to be stolen.Expansion of the ICHIP ProgramWhile we continue to focus on China as a source of IP violations, we would be remiss if we did not acknowledge the impact on American companies of IP and high-tech crime around the world.In 2006, just before the original IP Industry Conference, DOJ placed the first IP Law Enforcement Coordinator in Bangkok, Thailand, to provide training and technical assistance to build the capacity of our foreign counterparts to combat IP crimes.Working with our colleagues in the State Department, we have been forward-leaning in seeking to enhance our relationships with foreign counterparts specifically in combatting IP and cybercrimes to level the global playing field and reduce the number of safe havens available to IP criminals.Last year at this meeting, I announced the expansion and re-naming of the Department's experts posted around the globe, now known as International Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property or "ICHIPs."Our ICHIPs deliver basic and advanced law enforcement training, case-based mentoring, and other technical assistance to investigators, prosecutors, judges, and other government officials.They have been instrumental in developing successful cases in their regions, and turning those cases into sustainable models for continued enforcement.I'm thrilled that with the support of the State Department, we have been able to expand the ICHIP program, and I am proud to introduce to you today the two Washington, DC-based ICHIPs with subject matter expertise in dark markets, cryptocurrencies, and internet-based fraud.Michael Chu hails from the Houston U.S. Attorney's Office, and will be serving as our internet-based fraud and public health and safety subject matter expert.John Ghose joins our ICHIP Network from the Atlanta U.S. Attorney's Office, and will offer subject matter expertise on virtual currencies and dark markets.In addition, we also have our incoming Eastern Europe ICHIP Scott Keirin in attendance today. Scott will be moving later this month from the Portland, Oregon U.S. Attorney's Office to Bucharest, Romania.Looking ForwardIn recent months I've had the opportunity to interact with representatives across the many industries in the U.S. that rely on intellectual property to succeed.Based on those discussions, I'm acutely aware of the challenges facing each of us in the room today, whether from the perspective of a company trying to compete in a global marketplace or government agencies charged with the responsibility to protect IP.Several themes run through these discussions, and I'd like to close with areas where I believe we can work together in the coming year to address the challenges:Existing laws do not always address the conduct that IP criminals are engaging in today. Or, put differently, smart criminals may seek to avoid serious repercussions by developing new technologies or security measures to skirt legal authorities.We need to be creative and cooperative in thinking about possible solutions, whether through looking at additional charging strategies, or considering legislative amendments.We will never be in a position where we can prosecute our way out of the problem of IP crime. However, by working together to identify the worst actors, we can have a measurable effect on decreasing the profitability of criminal IP infringement.Gatherings such as our meeting today provide an excellent opportunity to share the work that we have been doing on the enforcement side, and to hear from you about developing trends and new concerns.I trust that today's conversation with the experts gathered around the table will be as informative as it has been in each of the prior meetings.I look forward to hearing back from CCIPS about your input today, and in continuing to work together to combat IP crime in the coming year.Thank you for your attention.Load-Date: November 6, 2019End of Document

He also noted the achievements of the Institute's leadership and entire staff in efficiently and impeccably organising the latest SCO Forum whose participants tried to answer highly important questions linked with the Organisation's evolution and provided important recommendations regarding its long-term development.According to Vladimir Norov, the Blue Book will become an important reference point in ensuring a high standard of preparations for the SCO's 2020 Bishkek Forum. The SCO Secretariat and their Kyrgyz colleagues will use the Book in order to draft a detailed agenda for future meetings between scholars, experts and political analysts in China and other countries within the SCO Family.Vladimir Norov also informed event participants about the SCO's activities in the period since the 14th SCO Forum. He noted the purposeful significance of the Bishkek Forum and focused on practical aspects of the Organisation's work in the areas of politics, security, economic, cultural and humanitarian cooperation. The SCO Secretary-General also noted the SCO's increasingly greater regional and global role in fighting international terrorism and extremism, and drug and arms trafficking. "The Organisation's voice resounds loudly during the discussion of matters of international information security and the use of information and communications technologies for peaceful and constructive purposes," he added.While discussing security matters, Vladimir Norov drew the attention of experts to the deteriorating situation in the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and underscored the intention of the eight SCO member states to impart a new lease of life to the work of the Contact Group with Afghanistan. The implementation of the roadmap is seen as particularly topical nowadays when an incipient opportunity is emerging forlaunching peaceful dialogue and withdrawing US and NATO forces from the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. In this connection, the SCO Secretary-General urged Chinese and foreign experts to promote sustained dialogue on Afghan matters.Vladimir Norov linked the SCO's continued dynamic economic development with the approval of the Programme for the Development of Inter-Regional Cooperation and the Regulations of the Forum of the Heads of Regions of SCO Member States. The task of analysing matters in order to expand the SCO's transport and communications capabilities could play a highly important part in this respect.He also drew the attention of event participants to the resolutions of the 2 November 2019 SCO Heads of Government Council (HGC) Meeting in Tashkent whose participants, he said, had responded well to the above-mentioned challenges by approving the new Programme of Multilateral Trade and Economic Cooperation of SCO Member States until 2035. "The SCO boasts real capabilities for becoming an economic centre in the short-term perspective, and the consolidated efforts of member states will make a substantial contribution to determining the development vector of the global financial-economic and trade system," Vladimir Norov noted.The forging of a positive perception of the SCO among citizens of SCO member states and the building of a positive image of the Organisation in the world and the region is one of the SCO's important tasks in the area of the information/media support of its activities, the SCO Secretary-General noted. This is aimed at facilitating the rapprochement of member-states and their peoples and at strengthening neighbourliness and mutual trust among them. For this purpose, the SCO Secretariat holds regular interviews, briefings and news conferences, as well as meetings with Chinese and foreign experts. It is also establishing a network of research centres dealing with SCO-related matters.In conclusion, Vladimir Norov invited researchers and political analysts to step up expert dialogue and contacts between research institutions.Synopsis of the SCO Blue Book, Shanghai Cooperation Organisation in the New Era: Situation and Tasks (2018-2019)The book was prepared by the China Centre for SCO Studies of the China Institute of International Studies, affiliated with the Ministry of Foreign A'airs of the People's Republic of China, and printed by the Shijie Zhishi Chubangshe Publishing House which specialises in historical, political, foreign policy and diplomatic subjects. The Institute's President and Director of the Centre for SCO Studies, Qi Zhenghua, is the book's Editor-in-Chief. Deng Hao, Executive Secretary at the Centre for SCO Studies, edited the book.The book consists mainly of reports by participants in the April 2019 SCO Forum that took place at the China Institute of International Studies in Beijing. They are prefaced by SCO Secretary-General Vladimir Norov, who analyses the significance of the SCOForum as a highly important platform for exchanging experience between research centres of SCO member states.The book's contents include analytical materials by scholars, experts and diplomats studying the SCO's economic, political, cultural and humanitarian activities, as well as those in the area of security. The book provides an insight into the Organisation's regional and global status and explores the subject of security within the context of the fight against the Three Evils, and drug and arms trafficking. The book covers various aspects of the Afghan settlement and the SCO's long-term role in advancing the peace process.Researchers attach great importance to coordinating the economic strategies of the SCO member states. They perceive this as a foundation for expediting the pace of socioeconomic development and for bridging gaps in living standards in the SCO region.Experts also focus on deepening cooperation between member states, observer countries and dialogue partners. They view cultural cooperation and artistic exchanges and their harmonisation as promising.Load-Date: December 27, 2019End of Document

Jim Cramer: Trade Talks Just Aren't That Big of a Deal to U.S.' AdvanceRealMoneyDecember 3, 2019 Tuesday 7:01 PM EDTCopyright 2019 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1254 wordsByline: Jim CramerHighlight: Let me tell you why this China trade game is only an impediment a relatively small amount of the market, and what to expect going forward.BodyAre we going to remain hostage to these trade talks between China and the U.S. for the duration? Is this all that really matters in the end, and as long as the fighting goes on we are done for? Is there no real hope for advancement?No. That's just not the case.If it were the case, do you think the averages would be anywhere near where they are now? Do you think we would have had such a magnificent run for so many stocks?The answer, from 30,000 feet, is that the trade talks, as tense as they are, simply are not an impediment to the entire market advance. In fact, they are an impediment to a much smaller amount than people realize. I am going to explain what happened in the last four days, tell you why they seem so frightening, and then give you the real skinny on what's occurring and what can occur in the future.A week ago, we learned that the globalists in this administration, and here I am speaking about Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chief Economic Adviser Larry Kudlow, coupled with their private sector allies, Hank Paulsen and John Thornton, former Goldman Sachs  execs and Stephen Schwarzman, CEO of the Blackstone Group  , had high hopes that the U.S. could reach a deal with the Chinese that, perhaps in return from staying the Dec. 15 tariffs, could open up the Chinese market to our financial companies in an unfettered way.On the other side, the less globalist, more realist advisers to the president warned him that if the globalist wing kept talking deal, what would happen is that China would change the terms it's offering. The hardliners said that the globalists were tying the president's hands and that he would not be abler to walk away from a deal that had already been made.The president seemed willing to go with a deal and had spoken positively about it, which made it seem that we were about to have our first real break in the talks and that sent the stock market higher in anticipation of a deal. He apparently felt this way, despite that the hardliners have repeatedly told the president that China had made no efforts to cut down cyber hacking -- something I know is the case because I talk to literally all of the cyber security companies -- and had no real intention to sop the theft of intellectual property.The president didn't have long to wait. This weekend he apparently learned that China was no longer content with a stay of the Dec. 15 tariffs, it now wanted a rollback of the existing tariffs as a precondition for any deal involving the so-called "phase one" agreement, which the president increasingly was seeing as a giveaway to large, undeserving banks, anyway.So, in two days, the president struck back. First he brought back tariffs on steel imported from Argentina and Brazil. Why not? Those are countries that China has historically sold steel into that could be dumped into the U.S., aided by the pathetically low valuation of their currencies -- hence the president's lash out once again about the federal reserve and how strong the dollar is because our rates are so high relative to most of the developed world.Second, backed into a corner by his own globalist team, the president decided to throw a real roundhouse, saying maybe it would be better to wait until the election to make a deal.Here, I think the so-called omnipotent Chinese government -- a government that is perceived by the mainstream media to be made up of geniuses who never fail, again overplayed its hand. Imbued by endless talk of impeachment, I think China forgot how to count votes: No Republican senators have broken rank with the president, and they are the jury. Right now the jury has judged the president to be innocent. Second, I don't think China sees the common ground the leading Democratic candidates other than Joe Biden have with Trump. They are pro-worker and they don't want opioid deaths from Chinese fentanyl and they are even getting push back from big businesses that enough is enough with China. As long as China was trying to be greener, there seemed to be some commonality. But now China's going headlong into coal plants again, which means that it will be the sworn enemy of every Democrat. So the "why not wait to the election" statement of the president is a not an idle threat.Now all of this news broke Monday and Tuesday. At first investors seemed skeptical that Trump meant business against China when he put the kibosh on Argentinian and Brazilian steel. By the end of Monday, however, they were getting rumblings that things were a little off track.By 4 a.m. Tuesday, the pajama traders started feeling their bullish oats, though, sending the futures higher, giving the appearance of a bounce-back.Then, by 5:18, the president made the off-handed comment about the open-ended time frame on the tariffs with China. Plus, he flaunted new tariffs against the French, right in front of the French leader, saying that tariffs will double on cheese, wine and fancy goods because of the insistence of France that it can tax American tech companies, companies the president admitted he didn't even like, but certainly reserved to do the taxing.That sent the futures cascading to levels that made it clear that Friday and Monday dip buyers were mistaken.So what happens now? I think that we have to remember that not everything hinges on trade. Let me give you some examples of how a lack of a trade deal actually helps more stocks than it hurts right now.First, remember, we are a service economy that runs on employment and we are pretty darned close to full employment. Second, we have secular trends, trends like digitization and excellent medical and pharmaceutical companies that do not get hurt by higher tariffs. Third, when tariffs go up, bond prices advance, because it means economic growth should be slowing and that causes higher yielding stocks to rally. Fourth, the immense power of our major retailers to squeeze even all-powerful China on prices keeps prices down and the federal reserve in check from raising short-rates. If anything, the Fed stands ready to lower rates, even as the Fed acolytes keep up their long-standing tradition about getting everything wrong about the direction of the Fed funds.Finally, the averages are no longer industrial enough to be impacted longer-term by trade. Ironically, China has been so great at destroying our industries that it has created a world in which we don't have enough industrial stocks to keep the averages down. So when the president threatens to make no deal, it hurts China more than us.So why do we not shrug it off entirely? Tech. Tech's too big. We have immense tech companies with tons of business in China including the largest of all, Apple  . The idea of Apple somehow crashing because of China has been a major theme for more than 150 points of the stock.It bleeds into so many other stocks that Apple has become the faux Achilles heel, faux until China really does something, which it hasn't yet.So what happens is the negatives surface first and they bring down everything. Then the stocks that do well from the sectors I just described, bounce back. But tech? It's endlessly negative and that's the real issue we face right now. Discounts can lead to great opportunities. These will be like that. Just be aware that the market is slow to figure out the positives and fast to identify the negatives, which is why we have days like today, and could have a lot more like them.(AAPL and GS are holdings in Jim Cramer's  .

Dec: 1526Moving the MarketSector Watch-- Stock markets edges higher into record territory-- Trade sentiment remains upbeat-- Relative strength in the real estate sector amid another decline in Treasury yields-- Many retail stocks gain after reporting earnings todayStrong: Real Estate, Consumer DiscretionaryWeak: Energy, Financials14:25 ETDow +31.29 at 28097.67, Nasdaq +17.04 at 8649.52, S&P +3.70 at 3137.34[BRIEFING.COM] We're still higher across the board in the major averages; the S&P 500 gains 0.12%, the Nasdaq Composite adds 0.20%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average advances 0.11%.Some of the better-performing names in the S&P 500 include Hormel Foods (HRL 44.34, +1.58, +3.70%), Intuit (INTU 265.44, +8.37, +3.26%), and Abiomed (ABMD 192.49, +4.92, +2.62%). Hormel gains as mixed earnings were seen as generally "good enough" owing to strength in the Jennie-O turkey brand. Abiomed gained some traction on a technical level, edging above its 50-day SMA (187.83) after resistance had held the stock below that level for the past few days. Intuit, helped by broader gains in the software sector, pushed above its moving averages, recouping a portion of last week's post-earnings selloff.Conversely, Iron Mountain (IRM 32.39, -1.66, -4.88%) is near the bottom of the index. Iron Mountain is weaker in response to the announcement that the company's CFO, Stuart Brown, would be leaving Dec. 31 to pursue other interests. Barry Hytinen, current EVP and CFO at HanesBrands (HBI 14.96, -0.20, -1.32%), has been named as his successor; what's more, IRM reaffirmed its FY19 guidance.14:00 ETDow +25.73 at 28092.11, Nasdaq +16.99 at 8649.47, S&P +3.55 at 3137.19[BRIEFING.COM] The Nasdaq Composite still garners the best gains to this point on Tuesday, up 0.20%, as the major averages continue to march sideways into the final two hours of action.Gold futures settled $3.40 higher (+0.2%) to $1,456.90/oz, helped in part by this morning's fourth-straight monthly decline in the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index reading.The U.S. Dollar Index holds losses under 0.1% to 98.27.13:30 ETDow +29.16 at 28095.54, Nasdaq +19.82 at 8652.3, S&P +4.36 at 3138[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages stand little changed in the last half hour with the Dow Jones Industrial Average still bringing up the rear, +0.10%.The best performers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average include Walt Disney (DIS 152.94, +3.25, +2.17%), Merck (MRK 86.87, +1.17, +1.37%), and Procter & Gamble (PG 122.10, +1.59, +1.32%). Helping Disney higher today is a NYPost article out earlier suggesting Disney+ is averaging one million new subscribers a day, as well as a bullish initiation out of sell side shop Consumer Edge Research. Merck made a three-week high this morning in reaction to Chinese approval of KEYTRUDA.Conversely, Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA 59.32, -1.35, -2.23%) sits at the bottom of the index.The DJIA holds gains of 0.79% on the week, pushing its month-to-date advance to 3.88%.Elsewhere, at the top of the hour, the Treasury's $41 bln 5-year note auction drew a high yield of 1.587% on a bid-to-cover of 2.50.12:55 ETDow +46.21 at 28112.59, Nasdaq +24.01 at 8656.49, S&P +6.53 at 3140.17[BRIEFING.COM] The large-cap indices have drifted higher into record territory today as the market's bullish narrative remains intact. The S&P 500 (+0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.2%), and Nasdaq Composite (+0.3%) edge above their flat lines.Chief among today's news is a report that top trade negotiators from the U.S. and China reportedly reached a consensus on how to properly resolve core issues. Tucked behind the trade news are Treasury yields that remain persistently low, a CBOE Volatility Index (11.66, -0.21, -1.8%) that is trading at its lowest level since April, and a speech from Fed Chair Powell last evening that maintained the market's positive view on monetary policy.A flat start for the stock market has transitioned into marginal gains across the indices. From a sector standpoint, nine of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are up, with the real estate sector (+1.1%) rising above the rest amid another decline in Treasury yields. The benchmark 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.74%.The financials (-0.3%) and energy (-0.6%) sectors are the lone holdouts.Retailers remain in focus after Best Buy (BBY 82.74, +8.45, +11.4%), Burlington Stores (BURL 226.83, +18.55, +8.9%), and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS 47.11, +7.68, +19.4%) impressed investors with their results and/or guidance. Fellow retailer Dollar Tree (DLTR 94.07, -18.32, -16.3%), however, has disappointed investors with its results.Separately, shares of Walt Disney (DIS 153.29, +3.60, +2.4%) have climbed to a new all-time high after Consumer Edge Research initiated coverage on the stock with an Overweight rating. The firm has a $175 price target for the stock.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-0.3%) may be struggling after Analog Devices (ADI 114.71, +1.78, +1.6%) missed earnings estimates and provided downside Q1 guidance. Shares of Analog Devices, however, have erased early losses and now trade firmly higher. The broader semiconductor space could be taking a much-needed breather.Reviewing today's batch of economic data, which featured the New Home Sales report for October:New home sales in October decreased 0.7% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 733,000 units (Briefing.com consensus 710,000) from an upwardly revised 738,000 (from 701,000) in September. On a yr/yr basis, new home sales were up 31.6%.The key takeaway from the report is that the October showing was better than what meets the eye at first blush given the large, upward revision to the prior month's number.The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for November eased to 125.5 (Briefing.com consensus 126.9) from 125.9 in October, marking the fourth straight monthly retreat.The key takeaway from the report is that consumers continue to remain relatively upbeat about the short-term outlook based in part on income prospects, which should be a support for holiday spending activity.The Advance International Trade in Goods report for October showed a narrowing in the deficit to $66.5 billion from $70.5 billion in September. Advance Retail Inventories were up 0.3% on top of a 0.2% increase in September and Advance Wholesale Inventories increased 0.2% after declining 0.7% in September.The FHFA Housing Price Index for September increased 0.6% following an unrevised 0.2% increase in August. The S&P Case-Shiller Housing Price Index for September increased 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus 2.6%) following an unrevised 2.0% increase in August. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1582/1255. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1595/1412.12:25 ETDow +60.58 at 28126.96, Nasdaq +23.83 at 8656.31, S&P +7.19 at 3140.83[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is trading near session highs with a gain of 0.2%. The Nasdaq is up 0.3%.Amazon (AMZN 1791.98, +18.13, +1.0%) continues to lead the FAANG stocks higher, followed by a modest gain in Alphabet (GOOG 1311.84, +5.15, +0.4%). Facebook (FB 199.50, -0.28, -0.1%), Apple (AAPL 266.46, +0.10, unch), and Netflix (NFLX 314.74, -0.81, -0.3%) trade near their flat lines.Separately, the CBOE Volatility Index (11.70, -0.17, -1.4%) is trading at its lowest level since April and is on pace to close at its lowest level since October 2018.11:55 ETDow +40.27 at 28106.65, Nasdaq +18.32 at 8650.8, S&P +5.31 at 3138.95[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade higher by 0.2%.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is finally taking a breather today, as the group trades lower by 0.7%. The semiconductor space may be struggling after Analog Devices (ADI 113.28, +0.35, +0.3%) missed earnings estimates and guided Q1 top and bottom lines below consensus.Overseas, the major European indices closed near their flat lines. Germany's DAX declined 0.1%, UK's FTSE finished flat, and France's CAC increased 0.1%. The Europe Stoxx 600 increased 0.2%.11:25 ETDow +36.88 at 28103.26, Nasdaq +20.81 at 8653.29, S&P +5.37 at 3139.01[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to drift in positive territory, with the S&P 500 up 0.2%, the Dow up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq up 0.2%.Most sectors are up, except for the S&P 500 energy (-0.7%) and financials (-0.4%) sectors, which are succumbing to broad-based losses. The real estate sector (+0.9%) remains firmly atop the standings amid the decline in Treasury yields.Amazon's (AMZN 1789.50, +15.60, +0.9%) price target was lowered to $2100 from $2500 at Pivotal Research Group, but the stock is outperforming nicely today. This new price target still represents a 17% increase from the current price today. The firm is somewhat cautious about AWS margins meaningfully declining and about the introduction of one-day shipping.10:55 ETDow +30.93 at 28097.31, Nasdaq +15.02 at 8647.5, S&P +2.55 at 3136.19[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades higher by 0.1%. Earnings reports continued to trickle in earlier this morning.Best Buy (BBY 80.57, +6.32, +8.5%), Burlington Stores (BURL 226.40, +18.14, +8.7%), and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS 47.04, +7.62, +19.3%) have impressed investors with their earnings results and/or guidance. Fellow retailer Dollar Tree (DLTR 96.32, -16.08, -14.3%), on the other hand, has disappointed investors with its results.Elsewhere, shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE 15.99, -1.46, -8.3%) are also on the retreat after the company missed revenue estimates.10:25 ETDow +35.84 at 28102.22, Nasdaq +13.48 at 8645.96, S&P +3.29 at 3136.93[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade higher by 0.1% and recently set another new intraday high.The continued advance in the Treasury market, which is driving yields lower, has reflected a defensive mindset despite the resiliency in the stock market. Equities have had a great run in part due to expectations for a trade deal, but some investors are leaning cautiously with a muted VIX (11.80, -0.07, -0.6%) amid the possibility a deal isn't reached.This isn't to say a deal won't be reached, though. China reported top negotiators had a phone call last evening and agreed to keep talking to resolve core issues in order to get a Phase One deal signed. The market is still pricing in the completion of this agreement.The benchmark 10-yr yield is down three basis points to 1.73%.10:00 ETDow +43.99 at 28110.37, Nasdaq +13.33 at 8645.81, S&P +4.46 at 3138.1[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is now up 0.2%, while the Russell 2000 is down 0.1%.Just in, New Home Sales in October hit an annualized rate of 733,000, coming in above the Briefing.com consensus of 710,000. The September reading was revised to 738,000 (from 701,000).Separately, the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index ticked down to 125.5 in November (Briefing.com consensus 126.9) from a revised 126.1 in October (from 125.9).09:40 ETDow +0.80 at 28067.18, Nasdaq +0.78 at 8633.26, S&P -0.15 at 3133.49[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 (unch), Dow Jones Industrial Average (unch), and Nasdaq Composite (unch) open the session little changed after each closed at record highs yesterday.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows nine of the 11 sectors trading within 0.3% of their flat lines. The energy sector (-0.4%) is today's early laggard despite the higher oil prices ($58.41, +0.40, +0.7%), while the real estate sector (+0.4%) outperforms.U.S. Treasuries have edged higher, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.74%. The U.S. Dollar Index is little changed at 98.34.09:10 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -0.10. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +1.80.The stock market is headed for a flat start, as the S&P 500 futures trade in-line with fair value. The market has received trade news, earnings reports, and economic data, but none of it is having a meaningful impact on trading this morning.There was a modest advance in the futures trade last evening after a report from China indicated that top trade negotiators held a phone call, but the initial enthusiasm waned upon realization that nothing substantial was included in that report.Notable pre-market moves include earnings-driven gains in Best Buy (BBY 77.35, +3.10, +4.2%) and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS 43.89, +4.46, +11.3%), while Dollar Tree (DLTR 97.48, -14.91, -13.3%) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW 230.40, -19.40, -7.9%) are on the retreat following their reports.Separately, investors received some housing data earlier. The FHFA Housing Price Index for September increased 0.6% following an unrevised 0.2% increase in August. The S&P Case-Shiller Housing Price Index for September increased 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus 2.6%) following an unrevised 2.0% increase in August.08:50 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: +1.10. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +5.30.The S&P 500 futures trade one point above fair value.Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region ended Tuesday on a mixed note. Xinhua reported that Chinese trade negotiators held a phone call with their U.S. counterparts, agreeing to keep working toward a partial trade deal.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +2.10.The S&P 500 futures trade roughly in-line with fair value after another record-setting day on Wall Street yesterday. Futures were up as much as 0.4% above fair value after China's Xinhua News Agency reported that top trade negotiators held a phone call last evening.Both the U.S. and China reportedly reached an agreement in that call to continue to work toward resolving key issues for a Phase One trade agreement. The market, which already expects both sides to talk until a deal is reached, has justifiably tempered its initial enthusiasm but will likely continue to react to trade headlines moving forward.On the data front, investors will receive the Advance reports for International Trade in Goods, Retail Inventories, and Wholesale Inventories at 8:30 a.m. ET, followed by the FHFA Housing Price Index for September and the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for September (Briefing.com consensus 2.6%) at 9:00 a.m. ET.After the open, investors will receive the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for November (Briefing.com consensus 126.9) and the New Home Sales report for October (Briefing.com consensus 710,000) at 10:00 a.m. ET.U.S. Treasuries have extended yesterday's modest advance, pushing yields slightly lower again this morning. The 2-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.75%. The U.S. Dollar Index is little changed at 98.30.

Sizable M&A activity across several sectors also supported risk sentiment.The Russell 2000 rose 2.1%, climbing past its large-cap peers to close at a 52-week high.Press reports indicated that Chinese government officials called to increase penalties on IP theft, which was interpreted as a move that could help strike a Phase One deal. It should be noted that a separate report from Reuters that suggested a Phase Two deal before the 2020 election is unlikely to be reached did not have a noticeable effect on the market.The S&P 500 information technology sector (+1.4%), which typically outperforms when the prevailing view on trade is positive, led all sectors in gains amid strength in the semiconductor stocks. NVIDIA (NVDA 221.21, +10.32, +4.9%) was a notable gainer after the stock was upgraded to Overweight from Equal Weight at Morgan Stanley. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose 2.4%.The health care (+1.1%) and consumer discretionary (+0.9%) sectors also rose more than the S&P 500, while the utilities sector (-0.4%) was today's lone sector to finish in negative territory.Two of today's M&A deals were ones that were already on the market's radar: Charles Schwab (SCHW 49.31, +1.11, +2.3%) agreed to acquire TD Ameritrade (AMTD 51.78, +3.65, +7.6%) for $26 billion in an all-stock transaction, and LVMH (LVMUY 89.37, +1.98, +2.3%) agreed to acquire Tiffany & Co. (TIF 133.25, +7.74, +6.2%) for $16.2 billion in cash.New deals included Novartis (NVS 91.30, +0.82, +0.9%) agreeing to acquire The Medicines Co. (MDCO 83.80, +15.25, +22.3%) for $9.7 billion in cash and eBay (EBAY 35.85, +0.73, +2.1%) agreeing to sell StubHub to Viagogo for $4.05 billion in cash.Strikingly, U.S. Treasuries finished the session on a higher note despite the risk sentiment displayed in the stock market. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield declined one basis point to 1.76%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 98.32. WTI crude increased 0.2%, or $0.10, to $57.98/bbl.Investors did not receive any notable economic data on Monday.

Hormel gains as mixed earnings were seen as generally "good enough" owing to strength in the Jennie-O turkey brand. Abiomed gained some traction on a technical level, edging above its 50-day SMA (187.83) after resistance had held the stock below that level for the past few days. Intuit, helped by broader gains in the software sector, pushed above its moving averages, recouping a portion of last week's post-earnings selloff.Conversely, Iron Mountain (IRM 32.39, -1.66, -4.88%) is near the bottom of the index. Iron Mountain is weaker in response to the announcement that the company's CFO, Stuart Brown, would be leaving Dec. 31 to pursue other interests. Barry Hytinen, current EVP and CFO at HanesBrands (HBI 14.96, -0.20, -1.32%), has been named as his successor; what's more, IRM reaffirmed its FY19 guidance.14:00 ETDow +25.73 at 28092.11, Nasdaq +16.99 at 8649.47, S&P +3.55 at 3137.19[BRIEFING.COM] The Nasdaq Composite still garners the best gains to this point on Tuesday, up 0.20%, as the major averages continue to march sideways into the final two hours of action.Gold futures settled $3.40 higher (+0.2%) to $1,456.90/oz, helped in part by this morning's fourth-straight monthly decline in the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index reading.The U.S. Dollar Index holds losses under 0.1% to 98.27.13:30 ETDow +29.16 at 28095.54, Nasdaq +19.82 at 8652.3, S&P +4.36 at 3138[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages stand little changed in the last half hour with the Dow Jones Industrial Average still bringing up the rear, +0.10%.The best performers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average include Walt Disney (DIS 152.94, +3.25, +2.17%), Merck (MRK 86.87, +1.17, +1.37%), and Procter & Gamble (PG 122.10, +1.59, +1.32%). Helping Disney higher today is a NYPost article out earlier suggesting Disney+ is averaging one million new subscribers a day, as well as a bullish initiation out of sell side shop Consumer Edge Research. Merck made a three-week high this morning in reaction to Chinese approval of KEYTRUDA.Conversely, Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA 59.32, -1.35, -2.23%) sits at the bottom of the index.The DJIA holds gains of 0.79% on the week, pushing its month-to-date advance to 3.88%.Elsewhere, at the top of the hour, the Treasury's $41 bln 5-year note auction drew a high yield of 1.587% on a bid-to-cover of 2.50.12:55 ETDow +46.21 at 28112.59, Nasdaq +24.01 at 8656.49, S&P +6.53 at 3140.17[BRIEFING.COM] The large-cap indices have drifted higher into record territory today as the market's bullish narrative remains intact. The S&P 500 (+0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.2%), and Nasdaq Composite (+0.3%) edge above their flat lines.Chief among today's news is a report that top trade negotiators from the U.S. and China reportedly reached a consensus on how to properly resolve core issues. Tucked behind the trade news are Treasury yields that remain persistently low, a CBOE Volatility Index (11.66, -0.21, -1.8%) that is trading at its lowest level since April, and a speech from Fed Chair Powell last evening that maintained the market's positive view on monetary policy.A flat start for the stock market has transitioned into marginal gains across the indices. From a sector standpoint, nine of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are up, with the real estate sector (+1.1%) rising above the rest amid another decline in Treasury yields. The benchmark 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.74%.The financials (-0.3%) and energy (-0.6%) sectors are the lone holdouts.Retailers remain in focus after Best Buy (BBY 82.74, +8.45, +11.4%), Burlington Stores (BURL 226.83, +18.55, +8.9%), and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS 47.11, +7.68, +19.4%) impressed investors with their results and/or guidance. Fellow retailer Dollar Tree (DLTR 94.07, -18.32, -16.3%), however, has disappointed investors with its results.Separately, shares of Walt Disney (DIS 153.29, +3.60, +2.4%) have climbed to a new all-time high after Consumer Edge Research initiated coverage on the stock with an Overweight rating. The firm has a $175 price target for the stock.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-0.3%) may be struggling after Analog Devices (ADI 114.71, +1.78, +1.6%) missed earnings estimates and provided downside Q1 guidance. Shares of Analog Devices, however, have erased early losses and now trade firmly higher. The broader semiconductor space could be taking a much-needed breather.Reviewing today's batch of economic data, which featured the New Home Sales report for October:New home sales in October decreased 0.7% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 733,000 units (Briefing.com consensus 710,000) from an upwardly revised 738,000 (from 701,000) in September. On a yr/yr basis, new home sales were up 31.6%.The key takeaway from the report is that the October showing was better than what meets the eye at first blush given the large, upward revision to the prior month's number.The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for November eased to 125.5 (Briefing.com consensus 126.9) from 125.9 in October, marking the fourth straight monthly retreat.The key takeaway from the report is that consumers continue to remain relatively upbeat about the short-term outlook based in part on income prospects, which should be a support for holiday spending activity.The Advance International Trade in Goods report for October showed a narrowing in the deficit to $66.5 billion from $70.5 billion in September. Advance Retail Inventories were up 0.3% on top of a 0.2% increase in September and Advance Wholesale Inventories increased 0.2% after declining 0.7% in September.The FHFA Housing Price Index for September increased 0.6% following an unrevised 0.2% increase in August. The S&P Case-Shiller Housing Price Index for September increased 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus 2.6%) following an unrevised 2.0% increase in August. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1582/1255. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1595/1412.12:25 ETDow +60.58 at 28126.96, Nasdaq +23.83 at 8656.31, S&P +7.19 at 3140.83[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is trading near session highs with a gain of 0.2%. The Nasdaq is up 0.3%.Amazon (AMZN 1791.98, +18.13, +1.0%) continues to lead the FAANG stocks higher, followed by a modest gain in Alphabet (GOOG 1311.84, +5.15, +0.4%). Facebook (FB 199.50, -0.28, -0.1%), Apple (AAPL 266.46, +0.10, unch), and Netflix (NFLX 314.74, -0.81, -0.3%) trade near their flat lines.Separately, the CBOE Volatility Index (11.70, -0.17, -1.4%) is trading at its lowest level since April and is on pace to close at its lowest level since October 2018.11:55 ETDow +40.27 at 28106.65, Nasdaq +18.32 at 8650.8, S&P +5.31 at 3138.95[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade higher by 0.2%.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is finally taking a breather today, as the group trades lower by 0.7%. The semiconductor space may be struggling after Analog Devices (ADI 113.28, +0.35, +0.3%) missed earnings estimates and guided Q1 top and bottom lines below consensus.Overseas, the major European indices closed near their flat lines. Germany's DAX declined 0.1%, UK's FTSE finished flat, and France's CAC increased 0.1%. The Europe Stoxx 600 increased 0.2%.11:25 ETDow +36.88 at 28103.26, Nasdaq +20.81 at 8653.29, S&P +5.37 at 3139.01[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to drift in positive territory, with the S&P 500 up 0.2%, the Dow up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq up 0.2%.Most sectors are up, except for the S&P 500 energy (-0.7%) and financials (-0.4%) sectors, which are succumbing to broad-based losses. The real estate sector (+0.9%) remains firmly atop the standings amid the decline in Treasury yields.Amazon's (AMZN 1789.50, +15.60, +0.9%) price target was lowered to $2100 from $2500 at Pivotal Research Group, but the stock is outperforming nicely today. This new price target still represents a 17% increase from the current price today. The firm is somewhat cautious about AWS margins meaningfully declining and about the introduction of one-day shipping.10:55 ETDow +30.93 at 28097.31, Nasdaq +15.02 at 8647.5, S&P +2.55 at 3136.19[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades higher by 0.1%. Earnings reports continued to trickle in earlier this morning.Best Buy (BBY 80.57, +6.32, +8.5%), Burlington Stores (BURL 226.40, +18.14, +8.7%), and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS 47.04, +7.62, +19.3%) have impressed investors with their earnings results and/or guidance. Fellow retailer Dollar Tree (DLTR 96.32, -16.08, -14.3%), on the other hand, has disappointed investors with its results.Elsewhere, shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE 15.99, -1.46, -8.3%) are also on the retreat after the company missed revenue estimates.10:25 ETDow +35.84 at 28102.22, Nasdaq +13.48 at 8645.96, S&P +3.29 at 3136.93[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade higher by 0.1% and recently set another new intraday high.The continued advance in the Treasury market, which is driving yields lower, has reflected a defensive mindset despite the resiliency in the stock market. Equities have had a great run in part due to expectations for a trade deal, but some investors are leaning cautiously with a muted VIX (11.80, -0.07, -0.6%) amid the possibility a deal isn't reached.This isn't to say a deal won't be reached, though. China reported top negotiators had a phone call last evening and agreed to keep talking to resolve core issues in order to get a Phase One deal signed. The market is still pricing in the completion of this agreement.The benchmark 10-yr yield is down three basis points to 1.73%.10:00 ETDow +43.99 at 28110.37, Nasdaq +13.33 at 8645.81, S&P +4.46 at 3138.1[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is now up 0.2%, while the Russell 2000 is down 0.1%.Just in, New Home Sales in October hit an annualized rate of 733,000, coming in above the Briefing.com consensus of 710,000. The September reading was revised to 738,000 (from 701,000).Separately, the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index ticked down to 125.5 in November (Briefing.com consensus 126.9) from a revised 126.1 in October (from 125.9).09:40 ETDow +0.80 at 28067.18, Nasdaq +0.78 at 8633.26, S&P -0.15 at 3133.49[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 (unch), Dow Jones Industrial Average (unch), and Nasdaq Composite (unch) open the session little changed after each closed at record highs yesterday.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows nine of the 11 sectors trading within 0.3% of their flat lines. The energy sector (-0.4%) is today's early laggard despite the higher oil prices ($58.41, +0.40, +0.7%), while the real estate sector (+0.4%) outperforms.U.S. Treasuries have edged higher, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.74%. The U.S. Dollar Index is little changed at 98.34.09:10 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -0.10. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +1.80.The stock market is headed for a flat start, as the S&P 500 futures trade in-line with fair value. The market has received trade news, earnings reports, and economic data, but none of it is having a meaningful impact on trading this morning.There was a modest advance in the futures trade last evening after a report from China indicated that top trade negotiators held a phone call, but the initial enthusiasm waned upon realization that nothing substantial was included in that report.Notable pre-market moves include earnings-driven gains in Best Buy (BBY 77.35, +3.10, +4.2%) and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS 43.89, +4.46, +11.3%), while Dollar Tree (DLTR 97.48, -14.91, -13.3%) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW 230.40, -19.40, -7.9%) are on the retreat following their reports.Separately, investors received some housing data earlier. The FHFA Housing Price Index for September increased 0.6% following an unrevised 0.2% increase in August.

Futures were up as much as 0.4% above fair value after China's Xinhua News Agency reported that top trade negotiators held a phone call last evening.Both the U.S. and China reportedly reached an agreement in that call to continue to work toward resolving key issues for a Phase One trade agreement. The market, which already expects both sides to talk until a deal is reached, has justifiably tempered its initial enthusiasm but will likely continue to react to trade headlines moving forward.On the data front, investors will receive the Advance reports for International Trade in Goods, Retail Inventories, and Wholesale Inventories at 8:30 a.m. ET, followed by the FHFA Housing Price Index for September and the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for September (Briefing.com consensus 2.6%) at 9:00 a.m. ET.After the open, investors will receive the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for November (Briefing.com consensus 126.9) and the New Home Sales report for October (Briefing.com consensus 710,000) at 10:00 a.m. ET.U.S. Treasuries have extended yesterday's modest advance, pushing yields slightly lower again this morning. The 2-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.75%. The U.S. Dollar Index is little changed at 98.30.

Burlington Stores (BURL 211.67, +3.41): +1.6% after beating earnings estimates and raising its FY20 EPS guidance above consensus.Reviewing overnight developments:Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region ended Tuesday on a mixed note.

Sizable M&A activity across several sectors also supported risk sentiment.The Russell 2000 rose 2.1%, climbing past its large-cap peers to close at a 52-week high.Press reports indicated that Chinese government officials called to increase penalties on IP theft, which was interpreted as a move that could help strike a Phase One deal. It should be noted that a separate report from Reuters that suggested a Phase Two deal before the 2020 election is unlikely to be reached did not have a noticeable effect on the market.The S&P 500 information technology sector (+1.4%), which typically outperforms when the prevailing view on trade is positive, led all sectors in gains amid strength in the semiconductor stocks. NVIDIA (NVDA 221.21, +10.32, +4.9%) was a notable gainer after the stock was upgraded to Overweight from Equal Weight at Morgan Stanley. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose 2.4%.The health care (+1.1%) and consumer discretionary (+0.9%) sectors also rose more than the S&P 500, while the utilities sector (-0.4%) was today's lone sector to finish in negative territory.Two of today's M&A deals were ones that were already on the market's radar: Charles Schwab (SCHW 49.31, +1.11, +2.3%) agreed to acquire TD Ameritrade (AMTD 51.78, +3.65, +7.6%) for $26 billion in an all-stock transaction, and LVMH (LVMUY 89.37, +1.98, +2.3%) agreed to acquire Tiffany & Co. (TIF 133.25, +7.74, +6.2%) for $16.2 billion in cash.New deals included Novartis (NVS 91.30, +0.82, +0.9%) agreeing to acquire The Medicines Co. (MDCO 83.80, +15.25, +22.3%) for $9.7 billion in cash and eBay (EBAY 35.85, +0.73, +2.1%) agreeing to sell StubHub to Viagogo for $4.05 billion in cash.Strikingly, U.S. Treasuries finished the session on a higher note despite the risk sentiment displayed in the stock market. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield declined one basis point to 1.76%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 98.32. WTI crude increased 0.2%, or $0.10, to $57.98/bbl.Investors did not receive any notable economic data on Monday.

That hasn't happened since 2007. The iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (ITB 45.76, +0.48, +1.0%) is up 1%.Looking ahead to after the close, Dell (DELL 53.90, -1.16, -2.1%), HP Inc. (HPQ 19.90, -0.26, -1.3%), and VMWare (VMW 166.22, -2.43, -1.4%) are some notable companies that will report earnings results. Deere (DE 177.05, +0.44, +0.3%) will report tomorrow morning.14:25 ETDow +31.29 at 28097.67, Nasdaq +17.04 at 8649.52, S&P +3.70 at 3137.34[BRIEFING.COM] We're still higher across the board in the major averages; the S&P 500 gains 0.12%, the Nasdaq Composite adds 0.20%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average advances 0.11%.Some of the better-performing names in the S&P 500 include Hormel Foods (HRL 44.34, +1.58, +3.70%), Intuit (INTU 265.44, +8.37, +3.26%), and Abiomed (ABMD 192.49, +4.92, +2.62%). Hormel gains as mixed earnings were seen as generally "good enough" owing to strength in the Jennie-O turkey brand. Abiomed gained some traction on a technical level, edging above its 50-day SMA (187.83) after resistance had held the stock below that level for the past few days. Intuit, helped by broader gains in the software sector, pushed above its moving averages, recouping a portion of last week's post-earnings selloff.Conversely, Iron Mountain (IRM 32.39, -1.66, -4.88%) is near the bottom of the index. Iron Mountain is weaker in response to the announcement that the company's CFO, Stuart Brown, would be leaving Dec. 31 to pursue other interests. Barry Hytinen, current EVP and CFO at HanesBrands (HBI 14.96, -0.20, -1.32%), has been named as his successor; what's more, IRM reaffirmed its FY19 guidance.14:00 ETDow +25.73 at 28092.11, Nasdaq +16.99 at 8649.47, S&P +3.55 at 3137.19[BRIEFING.COM] The Nasdaq Composite still garners the best gains to this point on Tuesday, up 0.20%, as the major averages continue to march sideways into the final two hours of action.Gold futures settled $3.40 higher (+0.2%) to $1,456.90/oz, helped in part by this morning's fourth-straight monthly decline in the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index reading.The U.S. Dollar Index holds losses under 0.1% to 98.27.13:30 ETDow +29.16 at 28095.54, Nasdaq +19.82 at 8652.3, S&P +4.36 at 3138[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages stand little changed in the last half hour with the Dow Jones Industrial Average still bringing up the rear, +0.10%.The best performers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average include Walt Disney (DIS 152.94, +3.25, +2.17%), Merck (MRK 86.87, +1.17, +1.37%), and Procter & Gamble (PG 122.10, +1.59, +1.32%). Helping Disney higher today is a NYPost article out earlier suggesting Disney+ is averaging one million new subscribers a day, as well as a bullish initiation out of sell side shop Consumer Edge Research. Merck made a three-week high this morning in reaction to Chinese approval of KEYTRUDA.Conversely, Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA 59.32, -1.35, -2.23%) sits at the bottom of the index.The DJIA holds gains of 0.79% on the week, pushing its month-to-date advance to 3.88%.Elsewhere, at the top of the hour, the Treasury's $41 bln 5-year note auction drew a high yield of 1.587% on a bid-to-cover of 2.50.12:55 ETDow +46.21 at 28112.59, Nasdaq +24.01 at 8656.49, S&P +6.53 at 3140.17[BRIEFING.COM] The large-cap indices have drifted higher into record territory today as the market's bullish narrative remains intact. The S&P 500 (+0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.2%), and Nasdaq Composite (+0.3%) edge above their flat lines.Chief among today's news is a report that top trade negotiators from the U.S. and China reportedly reached a consensus on how to properly resolve core issues. Tucked behind the trade news are Treasury yields that remain persistently low, a CBOE Volatility Index (11.66, -0.21, -1.8%) that is trading at its lowest level since April, and a speech from Fed Chair Powell last evening that maintained the market's positive view on monetary policy.A flat start for the stock market has transitioned into marginal gains across the indices. From a sector standpoint, nine of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are up, with the real estate sector (+1.1%) rising above the rest amid another decline in Treasury yields. The benchmark 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.74%.The financials (-0.3%) and energy (-0.6%) sectors are the lone holdouts.Retailers remain in focus after Best Buy (BBY 82.74, +8.45, +11.4%), Burlington Stores (BURL 226.83, +18.55, +8.9%), and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS 47.11, +7.68, +19.4%) impressed investors with their results and/or guidance. Fellow retailer Dollar Tree (DLTR 94.07, -18.32, -16.3%), however, has disappointed investors with its results.Separately, shares of Walt Disney (DIS 153.29, +3.60, +2.4%) have climbed to a new all-time high after Consumer Edge Research initiated coverage on the stock with an Overweight rating. The firm has a $175 price target for the stock.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-0.3%) may be struggling after Analog Devices (ADI 114.71, +1.78, +1.6%) missed earnings estimates and provided downside Q1 guidance. Shares of Analog Devices, however, have erased early losses and now trade firmly higher. The broader semiconductor space could be taking a much-needed breather.Reviewing today's batch of economic data, which featured the New Home Sales report for October:New home sales in October decreased 0.7% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 733,000 units (Briefing.com consensus 710,000) from an upwardly revised 738,000 (from 701,000) in September. On a yr/yr basis, new home sales were up 31.6%.The key takeaway from the report is that the October showing was better than what meets the eye at first blush given the large, upward revision to the prior month's number.The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for November eased to 125.5 (Briefing.com consensus 126.9) from 125.9 in October, marking the fourth straight monthly retreat.The key takeaway from the report is that consumers continue to remain relatively upbeat about the short-term outlook based in part on income prospects, which should be a support for holiday spending activity.The Advance International Trade in Goods report for October showed a narrowing in the deficit to $66.5 billion from $70.5 billion in September. Advance Retail Inventories were up 0.3% on top of a 0.2% increase in September and Advance Wholesale Inventories increased 0.2% after declining 0.7% in September.The FHFA Housing Price Index for September increased 0.6% following an unrevised 0.2% increase in August. The S&P Case-Shiller Housing Price Index for September increased 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus 2.6%) following an unrevised 2.0% increase in August. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1582/1255. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1595/1412.12:25 ETDow +60.58 at 28126.96, Nasdaq +23.83 at 8656.31, S&P +7.19 at 3140.83[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is trading near session highs with a gain of 0.2%. The Nasdaq is up 0.3%.Amazon (AMZN 1791.98, +18.13, +1.0%) continues to lead the FAANG stocks higher, followed by a modest gain in Alphabet (GOOG 1311.84, +5.15, +0.4%). Facebook (FB 199.50, -0.28, -0.1%), Apple (AAPL 266.46, +0.10, unch), and Netflix (NFLX 314.74, -0.81, -0.3%) trade near their flat lines.Separately, the CBOE Volatility Index (11.70, -0.17, -1.4%) is trading at its lowest level since April and is on pace to close at its lowest level since October 2018.11:55 ETDow +40.27 at 28106.65, Nasdaq +18.32 at 8650.8, S&P +5.31 at 3138.95[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade higher by 0.2%.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is finally taking a breather today, as the group trades lower by 0.7%. The semiconductor space may be struggling after Analog Devices (ADI 113.28, +0.35, +0.3%) missed earnings estimates and guided Q1 top and bottom lines below consensus.Overseas, the major European indices closed near their flat lines. Germany's DAX declined 0.1%, UK's FTSE finished flat, and France's CAC increased 0.1%. The Europe Stoxx 600 increased 0.2%.11:25 ETDow +36.88 at 28103.26, Nasdaq +20.81 at 8653.29, S&P +5.37 at 3139.01[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to drift in positive territory, with the S&P 500 up 0.2%, the Dow up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq up 0.2%.Most sectors are up, except for the S&P 500 energy (-0.7%) and financials (-0.4%) sectors, which are succumbing to broad-based losses. The real estate sector (+0.9%) remains firmly atop the standings amid the decline in Treasury yields.Amazon's (AMZN 1789.50, +15.60, +0.9%) price target was lowered to $2100 from $2500 at Pivotal Research Group, but the stock is outperforming nicely today. This new price target still represents a 17% increase from the current price today. The firm is somewhat cautious about AWS margins meaningfully declining and about the introduction of one-day shipping.10:55 ETDow +30.93 at 28097.31, Nasdaq +15.02 at 8647.5, S&P +2.55 at 3136.19[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades higher by 0.1%. Earnings reports continued to trickle in earlier this morning.Best Buy (BBY 80.57, +6.32, +8.5%), Burlington Stores (BURL 226.40, +18.14, +8.7%), and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS 47.04, +7.62, +19.3%) have impressed investors with their earnings results and/or guidance. Fellow retailer Dollar Tree (DLTR 96.32, -16.08, -14.3%), on the other hand, has disappointed investors with its results.Elsewhere, shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE 15.99, -1.46, -8.3%) are also on the retreat after the company missed revenue estimates.10:25 ETDow +35.84 at 28102.22, Nasdaq +13.48 at 8645.96, S&P +3.29 at 3136.93[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade higher by 0.1% and recently set another new intraday high.The continued advance in the Treasury market, which is driving yields lower, has reflected a defensive mindset despite the resiliency in the stock market. Equities have had a great run in part due to expectations for a trade deal, but some investors are leaning cautiously with a muted VIX (11.80, -0.07, -0.6%) amid the possibility a deal isn't reached.This isn't to say a deal won't be reached, though. China reported top negotiators had a phone call last evening and agreed to keep talking to resolve core issues in order to get a Phase One deal signed. The market is still pricing in the completion of this agreement.The benchmark 10-yr yield is down three basis points to 1.73%.10:00 ETDow +43.99 at 28110.37, Nasdaq +13.33 at 8645.81, S&P +4.46 at 3138.1[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is now up 0.2%, while the Russell 2000 is down 0.1%.Just in, New Home Sales in October hit an annualized rate of 733,000, coming in above the Briefing.com consensus of 710,000. The September reading was revised to 738,000 (from 701,000).Separately, the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index ticked down to 125.5 in November (Briefing.com consensus 126.9) from a revised 126.1 in October (from 125.9).09:40 ETDow +0.80 at 28067.18, Nasdaq +0.78 at 8633.26, S&P -0.15 at 3133.49[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 (unch), Dow Jones Industrial Average (unch), and Nasdaq Composite (unch) open the session little changed after each closed at record highs yesterday.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows nine of the 11 sectors trading within 0.3% of their flat lines. The energy sector (-0.4%) is today's early laggard despite the higher oil prices ($58.41, +0.40, +0.7%), while the real estate sector (+0.4%) outperforms.U.S. Treasuries have edged higher, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.74%. The U.S. Dollar Index is little changed at 98.34.09:10 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -0.10. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +1.80.The stock market is headed for a flat start, as the S&P 500 futures trade in-line with fair value. The market has received trade news, earnings reports, and economic data, but none of it is having a meaningful impact on trading this morning.There was a modest advance in the futures trade last evening after a report from China indicated that top trade negotiators held a phone call, but the initial enthusiasm waned upon realization that nothing substantial was included in that report.Notable pre-market moves include earnings-driven gains in Best Buy (BBY 77.35, +3.10, +4.2%) and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS 43.89, +4.46, +11.3%), while Dollar Tree (DLTR 97.48, -14.91, -13.3%) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW 230.40, -19.40, -7.9%) are on the retreat following their reports.Separately, investors received some housing data earlier. The FHFA Housing Price Index for September increased 0.6% following an unrevised 0.2% increase in August.

The 2-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.75%. The U.S. Dollar Index is little changed at 98.30.

Sizable M&A activity across several sectors also supported risk sentiment.The Russell 2000 rose 2.1%, climbing past its large-cap peers to close at a 52-week high.Press reports indicated that Chinese government officials called to increase penalties on IP theft, which was interpreted as a move that could help strike a Phase One deal. It should be noted that a separate report from Reuters that suggested a Phase Two deal before the 2020 election is unlikely to be reached did not have a noticeable effect on the market.The S&P 500 information technology sector (+1.4%), which typically outperforms when the prevailing view on trade is positive, led all sectors in gains amid strength in the semiconductor stocks. NVIDIA (NVDA 221.21, +10.32, +4.9%) was a notable gainer after the stock was upgraded to Overweight from Equal Weight at Morgan Stanley. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose 2.4%.The health care (+1.1%) and consumer discretionary (+0.9%) sectors also rose more than the S&P 500, while the utilities sector (-0.4%) was today's lone sector to finish in negative territory.Two of today's M&A deals were ones that were already on the market's radar: Charles Schwab (SCHW 49.31, +1.11, +2.3%) agreed to acquire TD Ameritrade (AMTD 51.78, +3.65, +7.6%) for $26 billion in an all-stock transaction, and LVMH (LVMUY 89.37, +1.98, +2.3%) agreed to acquire Tiffany & Co. (TIF 133.25, +7.74, +6.2%) for $16.2 billion in cash.New deals included Novartis (NVS 91.30, +0.82, +0.9%) agreeing to acquire The Medicines Co. (MDCO 83.80, +15.25, +22.3%) for $9.7 billion in cash and eBay (EBAY 35.85, +0.73, +2.1%) agreeing to sell StubHub to Viagogo for $4.05 billion in cash.Strikingly, U.S. Treasuries finished the session on a higher note despite the risk sentiment displayed in the stock market. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield declined one basis point to 1.76%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 98.32. WTI crude increased 0.2%, or $0.10, to $57.98/bbl.Investors did not receive any notable economic data on Monday.

That hasn't happened since 2007. The iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (ITB 45.76, +0.48, +1.0%) is up 1%.Looking ahead to after the close, Dell (DELL 53.90, -1.16, -2.1%), HP Inc. (HPQ 19.90, -0.26, -1.3%), and VMWare (VMW 166.22, -2.43, -1.4%) are some notable companies that will report earnings results. Deere (DE 177.05, +0.44, +0.3%) will report tomorrow morning.14:25 ETDow +31.29 at 28097.67, Nasdaq +17.04 at 8649.52, S&P +3.70 at 3137.34[BRIEFING.COM] We're still higher across the board in the major averages; the S&P 500 gains 0.12%, the Nasdaq Composite adds 0.20%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average advances 0.11%.Some of the better-performing names in the S&P 500 include Hormel Foods (HRL 44.34, +1.58, +3.70%), Intuit (INTU 265.44, +8.37, +3.26%), and Abiomed (ABMD 192.49, +4.92, +2.62%). Hormel gains as mixed earnings were seen as generally "good enough" owing to strength in the Jennie-O turkey brand. Abiomed gained some traction on a technical level, edging above its 50-day SMA (187.83) after resistance had held the stock below that level for the past few days. Intuit, helped by broader gains in the software sector, pushed above its moving averages, recouping a portion of last week's post-earnings selloff.Conversely, Iron Mountain (IRM 32.39, -1.66, -4.88%) is near the bottom of the index. Iron Mountain is weaker in response to the announcement that the company's CFO, Stuart Brown, would be leaving Dec. 31 to pursue other interests. Barry Hytinen, current EVP and CFO at HanesBrands (HBI 14.96, -0.20, -1.32%), has been named as his successor; what's more, IRM reaffirmed its FY19 guidance.14:00 ETDow +25.73 at 28092.11, Nasdaq +16.99 at 8649.47, S&P +3.55 at 3137.19[BRIEFING.COM] The Nasdaq Composite still garners the best gains to this point on Tuesday, up 0.20%, as the major averages continue to march sideways into the final two hours of action.Gold futures settled $3.40 higher (+0.2%) to $1,456.90/oz, helped in part by this morning's fourth-straight monthly decline in the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index reading.The U.S. Dollar Index holds losses under 0.1% to 98.27.13:30 ETDow +29.16 at 28095.54, Nasdaq +19.82 at 8652.3, S&P +4.36 at 3138[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages stand little changed in the last half hour with the Dow Jones Industrial Average still bringing up the rear, +0.10%.The best performers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average include Walt Disney (DIS 152.94, +3.25, +2.17%), Merck (MRK 86.87, +1.17, +1.37%), and Procter & Gamble (PG 122.10, +1.59, +1.32%). Helping Disney higher today is a NYPost article out earlier suggesting Disney+ is averaging one million new subscribers a day, as well as a bullish initiation out of sell side shop Consumer Edge Research. Merck made a three-week high this morning in reaction to Chinese approval of KEYTRUDA.Conversely, Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA 59.32, -1.35, -2.23%) sits at the bottom of the index.The DJIA holds gains of 0.79% on the week, pushing its month-to-date advance to 3.88%.Elsewhere, at the top of the hour, the Treasury's $41 bln 5-year note auction drew a high yield of 1.587% on a bid-to-cover of 2.50.12:55 ETDow +46.21 at 28112.59, Nasdaq +24.01 at 8656.49, S&P +6.53 at 3140.17[BRIEFING.COM] The large-cap indices have drifted higher into record territory today as the market's bullish narrative remains intact. The S&P 500 (+0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.2%), and Nasdaq Composite (+0.3%) edge above their flat lines.Chief among today's news is a report that top trade negotiators from the U.S. and China reportedly reached a consensus on how to properly resolve core issues. Tucked behind the trade news are Treasury yields that remain persistently low, a CBOE Volatility Index (11.66, -0.21, -1.8%) that is trading at its lowest level since April, and a speech from Fed Chair Powell last evening that maintained the market's positive view on monetary policy.A flat start for the stock market has transitioned into marginal gains across the indices. From a sector standpoint, nine of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are up, with the real estate sector (+1.1%) rising above the rest amid another decline in Treasury yields. The benchmark 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.74%.The financials (-0.3%) and energy (-0.6%) sectors are the lone holdouts.Retailers remain in focus after Best Buy (BBY 82.74, +8.45, +11.4%), Burlington Stores (BURL 226.83, +18.55, +8.9%), and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS 47.11, +7.68, +19.4%) impressed investors with their results and/or guidance. Fellow retailer Dollar Tree (DLTR 94.07, -18.32, -16.3%), however, has disappointed investors with its results.Separately, shares of Walt Disney (DIS 153.29, +3.60, +2.4%) have climbed to a new all-time high after Consumer Edge Research initiated coverage on the stock with an Overweight rating. The firm has a $175 price target for the stock.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-0.3%) may be struggling after Analog Devices (ADI 114.71, +1.78, +1.6%) missed earnings estimates and provided downside Q1 guidance. Shares of Analog Devices, however, have erased early losses and now trade firmly higher. The broader semiconductor space could be taking a much-needed breather.Reviewing today's batch of economic data, which featured the New Home Sales report for October:New home sales in October decreased 0.7% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 733,000 units (Briefing.com consensus 710,000) from an upwardly revised 738,000 (from 701,000) in September. On a yr/yr basis, new home sales were up 31.6%.The key takeaway from the report is that the October showing was better than what meets the eye at first blush given the large, upward revision to the prior month's number.The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for November eased to 125.5 (Briefing.com consensus 126.9) from 125.9 in October, marking the fourth straight monthly retreat.The key takeaway from the report is that consumers continue to remain relatively upbeat about the short-term outlook based in part on income prospects, which should be a support for holiday spending activity.The Advance International Trade in Goods report for October showed a narrowing in the deficit to $66.5 billion from $70.5 billion in September. Advance Retail Inventories were up 0.3% on top of a 0.2% increase in September and Advance Wholesale Inventories increased 0.2% after declining 0.7% in September.The FHFA Housing Price Index for September increased 0.6% following an unrevised 0.2% increase in August. The S&P Case-Shiller Housing Price Index for September increased 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus 2.6%) following an unrevised 2.0% increase in August. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1582/1255. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1595/1412.12:25 ETDow +60.58 at 28126.96, Nasdaq +23.83 at 8656.31, S&P +7.19 at 3140.83[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is trading near session highs with a gain of 0.2%. The Nasdaq is up 0.3%.Amazon (AMZN 1791.98, +18.13, +1.0%) continues to lead the FAANG stocks higher, followed by a modest gain in Alphabet (GOOG 1311.84, +5.15, +0.4%). Facebook (FB 199.50, -0.28, -0.1%), Apple (AAPL 266.46, +0.10, unch), and Netflix (NFLX 314.74, -0.81, -0.3%) trade near their flat lines.Separately, the CBOE Volatility Index (11.70, -0.17, -1.4%) is trading at its lowest level since April and is on pace to close at its lowest level since October 2018.11:55 ETDow +40.27 at 28106.65, Nasdaq +18.32 at 8650.8, S&P +5.31 at 3138.95[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade higher by 0.2%.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is finally taking a breather today, as the group trades lower by 0.7%. The semiconductor space may be struggling after Analog Devices (ADI 113.28, +0.35, +0.3%) missed earnings estimates and guided Q1 top and bottom lines below consensus.Overseas, the major European indices closed near their flat lines. Germany's DAX declined 0.1%, UK's FTSE finished flat, and France's CAC increased 0.1%. The Europe Stoxx 600 increased 0.2%.11:25 ETDow +36.88 at 28103.26, Nasdaq +20.81 at 8653.29, S&P +5.37 at 3139.01[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to drift in positive territory, with the S&P 500 up 0.2%, the Dow up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq up 0.2%.Most sectors are up, except for the S&P 500 energy (-0.7%) and financials (-0.4%) sectors, which are succumbing to broad-based losses. The real estate sector (+0.9%) remains firmly atop the standings amid the decline in Treasury yields.Amazon's (AMZN 1789.50, +15.60, +0.9%) price target was lowered to $2100 from $2500 at Pivotal Research Group, but the stock is outperforming nicely today. This new price target still represents a 17% increase from the current price today. The firm is somewhat cautious about AWS margins meaningfully declining and about the introduction of one-day shipping.10:55 ETDow +30.93 at 28097.31, Nasdaq +15.02 at 8647.5, S&P +2.55 at 3136.19[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades higher by 0.1%. Earnings reports continued to trickle in earlier this morning.Best Buy (BBY 80.57, +6.32, +8.5%), Burlington Stores (BURL 226.40, +18.14, +8.7%), and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS 47.04, +7.62, +19.3%) have impressed investors with their earnings results and/or guidance. Fellow retailer Dollar Tree (DLTR 96.32, -16.08, -14.3%), on the other hand, has disappointed investors with its results.Elsewhere, shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE 15.99, -1.46, -8.3%) are also on the retreat after the company missed revenue estimates.10:25 ETDow +35.84 at 28102.22, Nasdaq +13.48 at 8645.96, S&P +3.29 at 3136.93[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade higher by 0.1% and recently set another new intraday high.The continued advance in the Treasury market, which is driving yields lower, has reflected a defensive mindset despite the resiliency in the stock market. Equities have had a great run in part due to expectations for a trade deal, but some investors are leaning cautiously with a muted VIX (11.80, -0.07, -0.6%) amid the possibility a deal isn't reached.This isn't to say a deal won't be reached, though. China reported top negotiators had a phone call last evening and agreed to keep talking to resolve core issues in order to get a Phase One deal signed. The market is still pricing in the completion of this agreement.The benchmark 10-yr yield is down three basis points to 1.73%.10:00 ETDow +43.99 at 28110.37, Nasdaq +13.33 at 8645.81, S&P +4.46 at 3138.1[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is now up 0.2%, while the Russell 2000 is down 0.1%.Just in, New Home Sales in October hit an annualized rate of 733,000, coming in above the Briefing.com consensus of 710,000. The September reading was revised to 738,000 (from 701,000).Separately, the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index ticked down to 125.5 in November (Briefing.com consensus 126.9) from a revised 126.1 in October (from 125.9).09:40 ETDow +0.80 at 28067.18, Nasdaq +0.78 at 8633.26, S&P -0.15 at 3133.49[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 (unch), Dow Jones Industrial Average (unch), and Nasdaq Composite (unch) open the session little changed after each closed at record highs yesterday.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows nine of the 11 sectors trading within 0.3% of their flat lines. The energy sector (-0.4%) is today's early laggard despite the higher oil prices ($58.41, +0.40, +0.7%), while the real estate sector (+0.4%) outperforms.U.S. Treasuries have edged higher, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.74%. The U.S. Dollar Index is little changed at 98.34.09:10 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -0.10. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +1.80.The stock market is headed for a flat start, as the S&P 500 futures trade in-line with fair value. The market has received trade news, earnings reports, and economic data, but none of it is having a meaningful impact on trading this morning.There was a modest advance in the futures trade last evening after a report from China indicated that top trade negotiators held a phone call, but the initial enthusiasm waned upon realization that nothing substantial was included in that report.Notable pre-market moves include earnings-driven gains in Best Buy (BBY 77.35, +3.10, +4.2%) and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS 43.89, +4.46, +11.3%), while Dollar Tree (DLTR 97.48, -14.91, -13.3%) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW 230.40, -19.40, -7.9%) are on the retreat following their reports.Separately, investors received some housing data earlier. The FHFA Housing Price Index for September increased 0.6% following an unrevised 0.2% increase in August. The S&P Case-Shiller Housing Price Index for September increased 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus 2.6%) following an unrevised 2.0% increase in August.08:50 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: +1.10.

Sizable M&A activity across several sectors also supported risk sentiment.The Russell 2000 rose 2.1%, climbing past its large-cap peers to close at a 52-week high.Press reports indicated that Chinese government officials called to increase penalties on IP theft, which was interpreted as a move that could help strike a Phase One deal. It should be noted that a separate report from Reuters that suggested a Phase Two deal before the 2020 election is unlikely to be reached did not have a noticeable effect on the market.The S&P 500 information technology sector (+1.4%), which typically outperforms when the prevailing view on trade is positive, led all sectors in gains amid strength in the semiconductor stocks. NVIDIA (NVDA 221.21, +10.32, +4.9%) was a notable gainer after the stock was upgraded to Overweight from Equal Weight at Morgan Stanley. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose 2.4%.The health care (+1.1%) and consumer discretionary (+0.9%) sectors also rose more than the S&P 500, while the utilities sector (-0.4%) was today's lone sector to finish in negative territory.Two of today's M&A deals were ones that were already on the market's radar: Charles Schwab (SCHW 49.31, +1.11, +2.3%) agreed to acquire TD Ameritrade (AMTD 51.78, +3.65, +7.6%) for $26 billion in an all-stock transaction, and LVMH (LVMUY 89.37, +1.98, +2.3%) agreed to acquire Tiffany & Co. (TIF 133.25, +7.74, +6.2%) for $16.2 billion in cash.New deals included Novartis (NVS 91.30, +0.82, +0.9%) agreeing to acquire The Medicines Co. (MDCO 83.80, +15.25, +22.3%) for $9.7 billion in cash and eBay (EBAY 35.85, +0.73, +2.1%) agreeing to sell StubHub to Viagogo for $4.05 billion in cash.Strikingly, U.S. Treasuries finished the session on a higher note despite the risk sentiment displayed in the stock market. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield declined one basis point to 1.76%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 98.32. WTI crude increased 0.2%, or $0.10, to $57.98/bbl.Investors did not receive any notable economic data on Monday.

That hasn't happened since 2007. The iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (ITB 45.76, +0.48, +1.0%) is up 1%.Looking ahead to after the close, Dell (DELL 53.90, -1.16, -2.1%), HP Inc. (HPQ 19.90, -0.26, -1.3%), and VMWare (VMW 166.22, -2.43, -1.4%) are some notable companies that will report earnings results. Deere (DE 177.05, +0.44, +0.3%) will report tomorrow morning.14:25 ETDow +31.29 at 28097.67, Nasdaq +17.04 at 8649.52, S&P +3.70 at 3137.34[BRIEFING.COM] We're still higher across the board in the major averages; the S&P 500 gains 0.12%, the Nasdaq Composite adds 0.20%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average advances 0.11%.Some of the better-performing names in the S&P 500 include Hormel Foods (HRL 44.34, +1.58, +3.70%), Intuit (INTU 265.44, +8.37, +3.26%), and Abiomed (ABMD 192.49, +4.92, +2.62%). Hormel gains as mixed earnings were seen as generally "good enough" owing to strength in the Jennie-O turkey brand. Abiomed gained some traction on a technical level, edging above its 50-day SMA (187.83) after resistance had held the stock below that level for the past few days. Intuit, helped by broader gains in the software sector, pushed above its moving averages, recouping a portion of last week's post-earnings selloff.Conversely, Iron Mountain (IRM 32.39, -1.66, -4.88%) is near the bottom of the index. Iron Mountain is weaker in response to the announcement that the company's CFO, Stuart Brown, would be leaving Dec. 31 to pursue other interests. Barry Hytinen, current EVP and CFO at HanesBrands (HBI 14.96, -0.20, -1.32%), has been named as his successor; what's more, IRM reaffirmed its FY19 guidance.14:00 ETDow +25.73 at 28092.11, Nasdaq +16.99 at 8649.47, S&P +3.55 at 3137.19[BRIEFING.COM] The Nasdaq Composite still garners the best gains to this point on Tuesday, up 0.20%, as the major averages continue to march sideways into the final two hours of action.Gold futures settled $3.40 higher (+0.2%) to $1,456.90/oz, helped in part by this morning's fourth-straight monthly decline in the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index reading.The U.S. Dollar Index holds losses under 0.1% to 98.27.13:30 ETDow +29.16 at 28095.54, Nasdaq +19.82 at 8652.3, S&P +4.36 at 3138[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages stand little changed in the last half hour with the Dow Jones Industrial Average still bringing up the rear, +0.10%.The best performers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average include Walt Disney (DIS 152.94, +3.25, +2.17%), Merck (MRK 86.87, +1.17, +1.37%), and Procter & Gamble (PG 122.10, +1.59, +1.32%). Helping Disney higher today is a NYPost article out earlier suggesting Disney+ is averaging one million new subscribers a day, as well as a bullish initiation out of sell side shop Consumer Edge Research. Merck made a three-week high this morning in reaction to Chinese approval of KEYTRUDA.Conversely, Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA 59.32, -1.35, -2.23%) sits at the bottom of the index.The DJIA holds gains of 0.79% on the week, pushing its month-to-date advance to 3.88%.Elsewhere, at the top of the hour, the Treasury's $41 bln 5-year note auction drew a high yield of 1.587% on a bid-to-cover of 2.50.12:55 ETDow +46.21 at 28112.59, Nasdaq +24.01 at 8656.49, S&P +6.53 at 3140.17[BRIEFING.COM] The large-cap indices have drifted higher into record territory today as the market's bullish narrative remains intact. The S&P 500 (+0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.2%), and Nasdaq Composite (+0.3%) edge above their flat lines.Chief among today's news is a report that top trade negotiators from the U.S. and China reportedly reached a consensus on how to properly resolve core issues. Tucked behind the trade news are Treasury yields that remain persistently low, a CBOE Volatility Index (11.66, -0.21, -1.8%) that is trading at its lowest level since April, and a speech from Fed Chair Powell last evening that maintained the market's positive view on monetary policy.A flat start for the stock market has transitioned into marginal gains across the indices. From a sector standpoint, nine of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are up, with the real estate sector (+1.1%) rising above the rest amid another decline in Treasury yields. The benchmark 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.74%.The financials (-0.3%) and energy (-0.6%) sectors are the lone holdouts.Retailers remain in focus after Best Buy (BBY 82.74, +8.45, +11.4%), Burlington Stores (BURL 226.83, +18.55, +8.9%), and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS 47.11, +7.68, +19.4%) impressed investors with their results and/or guidance. Fellow retailer Dollar Tree (DLTR 94.07, -18.32, -16.3%), however, has disappointed investors with its results.Separately, shares of Walt Disney (DIS 153.29, +3.60, +2.4%) have climbed to a new all-time high after Consumer Edge Research initiated coverage on the stock with an Overweight rating. The firm has a $175 price target for the stock.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-0.3%) may be struggling after Analog Devices (ADI 114.71, +1.78, +1.6%) missed earnings estimates and provided downside Q1 guidance. Shares of Analog Devices, however, have erased early losses and now trade firmly higher. The broader semiconductor space could be taking a much-needed breather.Reviewing today's batch of economic data, which featured the New Home Sales report for October:New home sales in October decreased 0.7% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 733,000 units (Briefing.com consensus 710,000) from an upwardly revised 738,000 (from 701,000) in September. On a yr/yr basis, new home sales were up 31.6%.The key takeaway from the report is that the October showing was better than what meets the eye at first blush given the large, upward revision to the prior month's number.The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for November eased to 125.5 (Briefing.com consensus 126.9) from 125.9 in October, marking the fourth straight monthly retreat.The key takeaway from the report is that consumers continue to remain relatively upbeat about the short-term outlook based in part on income prospects, which should be a support for holiday spending activity.The Advance International Trade in Goods report for October showed a narrowing in the deficit to $66.5 billion from $70.5 billion in September. Advance Retail Inventories were up 0.3% on top of a 0.2% increase in September and Advance Wholesale Inventories increased 0.2% after declining 0.7% in September.The FHFA Housing Price Index for September increased 0.6% following an unrevised 0.2% increase in August. The S&P Case-Shiller Housing Price Index for September increased 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus 2.6%) following an unrevised 2.0% increase in August. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1582/1255. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1595/1412.12:25 ETDow +60.58 at 28126.96, Nasdaq +23.83 at 8656.31, S&P +7.19 at 3140.83[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is trading near session highs with a gain of 0.2%. The Nasdaq is up 0.3%.Amazon (AMZN 1791.98, +18.13, +1.0%) continues to lead the FAANG stocks higher, followed by a modest gain in Alphabet (GOOG 1311.84, +5.15, +0.4%). Facebook (FB 199.50, -0.28, -0.1%), Apple (AAPL 266.46, +0.10, unch), and Netflix (NFLX 314.74, -0.81, -0.3%) trade near their flat lines.Separately, the CBOE Volatility Index (11.70, -0.17, -1.4%) is trading at its lowest level since April and is on pace to close at its lowest level since October 2018.11:55 ETDow +40.27 at 28106.65, Nasdaq +18.32 at 8650.8, S&P +5.31 at 3138.95[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade higher by 0.2%.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is finally taking a breather today, as the group trades lower by 0.7%. The semiconductor space may be struggling after Analog Devices (ADI 113.28, +0.35, +0.3%) missed earnings estimates and guided Q1 top and bottom lines below consensus.Overseas, the major European indices closed near their flat lines. Germany's DAX declined 0.1%, UK's FTSE finished flat, and France's CAC increased 0.1%. The Europe Stoxx 600 increased 0.2%.11:25 ETDow +36.88 at 28103.26, Nasdaq +20.81 at 8653.29, S&P +5.37 at 3139.01[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to drift in positive territory, with the S&P 500 up 0.2%, the Dow up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq up 0.2%.Most sectors are up, except for the S&P 500 energy (-0.7%) and financials (-0.4%) sectors, which are succumbing to broad-based losses. The real estate sector (+0.9%) remains firmly atop the standings amid the decline in Treasury yields.Amazon's (AMZN 1789.50, +15.60, +0.9%) price target was lowered to $2100 from $2500 at Pivotal Research Group, but the stock is outperforming nicely today. This new price target still represents a 17% increase from the current price today. The firm is somewhat cautious about AWS margins meaningfully declining and about the introduction of one-day shipping.10:55 ETDow +30.93 at 28097.31, Nasdaq +15.02 at 8647.5, S&P +2.55 at 3136.19[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades higher by 0.1%. Earnings reports continued to trickle in earlier this morning.Best Buy (BBY 80.57, +6.32, +8.5%), Burlington Stores (BURL 226.40, +18.14, +8.7%), and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS 47.04, +7.62, +19.3%) have impressed investors with their earnings results and/or guidance. Fellow retailer Dollar Tree (DLTR 96.32, -16.08, -14.3%), on the other hand, has disappointed investors with its results.Elsewhere, shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE 15.99, -1.46, -8.3%) are also on the retreat after the company missed revenue estimates.10:25 ETDow +35.84 at 28102.22, Nasdaq +13.48 at 8645.96, S&P +3.29 at 3136.93[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade higher by 0.1% and recently set another new intraday high.The continued advance in the Treasury market, which is driving yields lower, has reflected a defensive mindset despite the resiliency in the stock market. Equities have had a great run in part due to expectations for a trade deal, but some investors are leaning cautiously with a muted VIX (11.80, -0.07, -0.6%) amid the possibility a deal isn't reached.This isn't to say a deal won't be reached, though. China reported top negotiators had a phone call last evening and agreed to keep talking to resolve core issues in order to get a Phase One deal signed. The market is still pricing in the completion of this agreement.The benchmark 10-yr yield is down three basis points to 1.73%.10:00 ETDow +43.99 at 28110.37, Nasdaq +13.33 at 8645.81, S&P +4.46 at 3138.1[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is now up 0.2%, while the Russell 2000 is down 0.1%.Just in, New Home Sales in October hit an annualized rate of 733,000, coming in above the Briefing.com consensus of 710,000. The September reading was revised to 738,000 (from 701,000).Separately, the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index ticked down to 125.5 in November (Briefing.com consensus 126.9) from a revised 126.1 in October (from 125.9).09:40 ETDow +0.80 at 28067.18, Nasdaq +0.78 at 8633.26, S&P -0.15 at 3133.49[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 (unch), Dow Jones Industrial Average (unch), and Nasdaq Composite (unch) open the session little changed after each closed at record highs yesterday.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows nine of the 11 sectors trading within 0.3% of their flat lines. The energy sector (-0.4%) is today's early laggard despite the higher oil prices ($58.41, +0.40, +0.7%), while the real estate sector (+0.4%) outperforms.U.S. Treasuries have edged higher, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.74%. The U.S. Dollar Index is little changed at 98.34.09:10 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -0.10. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +1.80.The stock market is headed for a flat start, as the S&P 500 futures trade in-line with fair value. The market has received trade news, earnings reports, and economic data, but none of it is having a meaningful impact on trading this morning.There was a modest advance in the futures trade last evening after a report from China indicated that top trade negotiators held a phone call, but the initial enthusiasm waned upon realization that nothing substantial was included in that report.Notable pre-market moves include earnings-driven gains in Best Buy (BBY 77.35, +3.10, +4.2%) and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS 43.89, +4.46, +11.3%), while Dollar Tree (DLTR 97.48, -14.91, -13.3%) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW 230.40, -19.40, -7.9%) are on the retreat following their reports.Separately, investors received some housing data earlier. The FHFA Housing Price Index for September increased 0.6% following an unrevised 0.2% increase in August. The S&P Case-Shiller Housing Price Index for September increased 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus 2.6%) following an unrevised 2.0% increase in August.08:50 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: +1.10.

Xinhua reported that Chinese trade negotiators held a phone call with their U.S. counterparts, agreeing to keep working toward a partial trade deal.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +2.10.The S&P 500 futures trade roughly in-line with fair value after another record-setting day on Wall Street yesterday. Futures were up as much as 0.4% above fair value after China's Xinhua News Agency reported that top trade negotiators held a phone call last evening.Both the U.S. and China reportedly reached an agreement in that call to continue to work toward resolving key issues for a Phase One trade agreement. The market, which already expects both sides to talk until a deal is reached, has justifiably tempered its initial enthusiasm but will likely continue to react to trade headlines moving forward.On the data front, investors will receive the Advance reports for International Trade in Goods, Retail Inventories, and Wholesale Inventories at 8:30 a.m. ET, followed by the FHFA Housing Price Index for September and the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for September (Briefing.com consensus 2.6%) at 9:00 a.m. ET.After the open, investors will receive the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for November (Briefing.com consensus 126.9) and the New Home Sales report for October (Briefing.com consensus 710,000) at 10:00 a.m. ET.U.S. Treasuries have extended yesterday's modest advance, pushing yields slightly lower again this morning.

Sizable M&A activity across several sectors also supported risk sentiment.The Russell 2000 rose 2.1%, climbing past its large-cap peers to close at a 52-week high.Press reports indicated that Chinese government officials called to increase penalties on IP theft, which was interpreted as a move that could help strike a Phase One deal. It should be noted that a separate report from Reuters that suggested a Phase Two deal before the 2020 election is unlikely to be reached did not have a noticeable effect on the market.The S&P 500 information technology sector (+1.4%), which typically outperforms when the prevailing view on trade is positive, led all sectors in gains amid strength in the semiconductor stocks. NVIDIA (NVDA 221.21, +10.32, +4.9%) was a notable gainer after the stock was upgraded to Overweight from Equal Weight at Morgan Stanley. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose 2.4%.The health care (+1.1%) and consumer discretionary (+0.9%) sectors also rose more than the S&P 500, while the utilities sector (-0.4%) was today's lone sector to finish in negative territory.Two of today's M&A deals were ones that were already on the market's radar: Charles Schwab (SCHW 49.31, +1.11, +2.3%) agreed to acquire TD Ameritrade (AMTD 51.78, +3.65, +7.6%) for $26 billion in an all-stock transaction, and LVMH (LVMUY 89.37, +1.98, +2.3%) agreed to acquire Tiffany & Co. (TIF 133.25, +7.74, +6.2%) for $16.2 billion in cash.New deals included Novartis (NVS 91.30, +0.82, +0.9%) agreeing to acquire The Medicines Co. (MDCO 83.80, +15.25, +22.3%) for $9.7 billion in cash and eBay (EBAY 35.85, +0.73, +2.1%) agreeing to sell StubHub to Viagogo for $4.05 billion in cash.Strikingly, U.S. Treasuries finished the session on a higher note despite the risk sentiment displayed in the stock market. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield declined one basis point to 1.76%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 98.32. WTI crude increased 0.2%, or $0.10, to $57.98/bbl.Investors did not receive any notable economic data on Monday.

That hasn't happened since 2007. The iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (ITB 45.76, +0.48, +1.0%) is up 1%.Looking ahead to after the close, Dell (DELL 53.90, -1.16, -2.1%), HP Inc. (HPQ 19.90, -0.26, -1.3%), and VMWare (VMW 166.22, -2.43, -1.4%) are some notable companies that will report earnings results. Deere (DE 177.05, +0.44, +0.3%) will report tomorrow morning.14:25 ETDow +31.29 at 28097.67, Nasdaq +17.04 at 8649.52, S&P +3.70 at 3137.34[BRIEFING.COM] We're still higher across the board in the major averages; the S&P 500 gains 0.12%, the Nasdaq Composite adds 0.20%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average advances 0.11%.Some of the better-performing names in the S&P 500 include Hormel Foods (HRL 44.34, +1.58, +3.70%), Intuit (INTU 265.44, +8.37, +3.26%), and Abiomed (ABMD 192.49, +4.92, +2.62%). Hormel gains as mixed earnings were seen as generally "good enough" owing to strength in the Jennie-O turkey brand. Abiomed gained some traction on a technical level, edging above its 50-day SMA (187.83) after resistance had held the stock below that level for the past few days. Intuit, helped by broader gains in the software sector, pushed above its moving averages, recouping a portion of last week's post-earnings selloff.Conversely, Iron Mountain (IRM 32.39, -1.66, -4.88%) is near the bottom of the index. Iron Mountain is weaker in response to the announcement that the company's CFO, Stuart Brown, would be leaving Dec. 31 to pursue other interests. Barry Hytinen, current EVP and CFO at HanesBrands (HBI 14.96, -0.20, -1.32%), has been named as his successor; what's more, IRM reaffirmed its FY19 guidance.14:00 ETDow +25.73 at 28092.11, Nasdaq +16.99 at 8649.47, S&P +3.55 at 3137.19[BRIEFING.COM] The Nasdaq Composite still garners the best gains to this point on Tuesday, up 0.20%, as the major averages continue to march sideways into the final two hours of action.Gold futures settled $3.40 higher (+0.2%) to $1,456.90/oz, helped in part by this morning's fourth-straight monthly decline in the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index reading.The U.S. Dollar Index holds losses under 0.1% to 98.27.13:30 ETDow +29.16 at 28095.54, Nasdaq +19.82 at 8652.3, S&P +4.36 at 3138[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages stand little changed in the last half hour with the Dow Jones Industrial Average still bringing up the rear, +0.10%.The best performers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average include Walt Disney (DIS 152.94, +3.25, +2.17%), Merck (MRK 86.87, +1.17, +1.37%), and Procter & Gamble (PG 122.10, +1.59, +1.32%). Helping Disney higher today is a NYPost article out earlier suggesting Disney+ is averaging one million new subscribers a day, as well as a bullish initiation out of sell side shop Consumer Edge Research. Merck made a three-week high this morning in reaction to Chinese approval of KEYTRUDA.Conversely, Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA 59.32, -1.35, -2.23%) sits at the bottom of the index.The DJIA holds gains of 0.79% on the week, pushing its month-to-date advance to 3.88%.Elsewhere, at the top of the hour, the Treasury's $41 bln 5-year note auction drew a high yield of 1.587% on a bid-to-cover of 2.50.12:55 ETDow +46.21 at 28112.59, Nasdaq +24.01 at 8656.49, S&P +6.53 at 3140.17[BRIEFING.COM] The large-cap indices have drifted higher into record territory today as the market's bullish narrative remains intact. The S&P 500 (+0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.2%), and Nasdaq Composite (+0.3%) edge above their flat lines.Chief among today's news is a report that top trade negotiators from the U.S. and China reportedly reached a consensus on how to properly resolve core issues. Tucked behind the trade news are Treasury yields that remain persistently low, a CBOE Volatility Index (11.66, -0.21, -1.8%) that is trading at its lowest level since April, and a speech from Fed Chair Powell last evening that maintained the market's positive view on monetary policy.A flat start for the stock market has transitioned into marginal gains across the indices. From a sector standpoint, nine of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are up, with the real estate sector (+1.1%) rising above the rest amid another decline in Treasury yields. The benchmark 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.74%.The financials (-0.3%) and energy (-0.6%) sectors are the lone holdouts.Retailers remain in focus after Best Buy (BBY 82.74, +8.45, +11.4%), Burlington Stores (BURL 226.83, +18.55, +8.9%), and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS 47.11, +7.68, +19.4%) impressed investors with their results and/or guidance. Fellow retailer Dollar Tree (DLTR 94.07, -18.32, -16.3%), however, has disappointed investors with its results.Separately, shares of Walt Disney (DIS 153.29, +3.60, +2.4%) have climbed to a new all-time high after Consumer Edge Research initiated coverage on the stock with an Overweight rating. The firm has a $175 price target for the stock.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-0.3%) may be struggling after Analog Devices (ADI 114.71, +1.78, +1.6%) missed earnings estimates and provided downside Q1 guidance. Shares of Analog Devices, however, have erased early losses and now trade firmly higher. The broader semiconductor space could be taking a much-needed breather.Reviewing today's batch of economic data, which featured the New Home Sales report for October:New home sales in October decreased 0.7% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 733,000 units (Briefing.com consensus 710,000) from an upwardly revised 738,000 (from 701,000) in September. On a yr/yr basis, new home sales were up 31.6%.The key takeaway from the report is that the October showing was better than what meets the eye at first blush given the large, upward revision to the prior month's number.The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for November eased to 125.5 (Briefing.com consensus 126.9) from 125.9 in October, marking the fourth straight monthly retreat.The key takeaway from the report is that consumers continue to remain relatively upbeat about the short-term outlook based in part on income prospects, which should be a support for holiday spending activity.The Advance International Trade in Goods report for October showed a narrowing in the deficit to $66.5 billion from $70.5 billion in September. Advance Retail Inventories were up 0.3% on top of a 0.2% increase in September and Advance Wholesale Inventories increased 0.2% after declining 0.7% in September.The FHFA Housing Price Index for September increased 0.6% following an unrevised 0.2% increase in August. The S&P Case-Shiller Housing Price Index for September increased 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus 2.6%) following an unrevised 2.0% increase in August. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1582/1255. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1595/1412.12:25 ETDow +60.58 at 28126.96, Nasdaq +23.83 at 8656.31, S&P +7.19 at 3140.83[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is trading near session highs with a gain of 0.2%. The Nasdaq is up 0.3%.Amazon (AMZN 1791.98, +18.13, +1.0%) continues to lead the FAANG stocks higher, followed by a modest gain in Alphabet (GOOG 1311.84, +5.15, +0.4%). Facebook (FB 199.50, -0.28, -0.1%), Apple (AAPL 266.46, +0.10, unch), and Netflix (NFLX 314.74, -0.81, -0.3%) trade near their flat lines.Separately, the CBOE Volatility Index (11.70, -0.17, -1.4%) is trading at its lowest level since April and is on pace to close at its lowest level since October 2018.11:55 ETDow +40.27 at 28106.65, Nasdaq +18.32 at 8650.8, S&P +5.31 at 3138.95[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade higher by 0.2%.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is finally taking a breather today, as the group trades lower by 0.7%. The semiconductor space may be struggling after Analog Devices (ADI 113.28, +0.35, +0.3%) missed earnings estimates and guided Q1 top and bottom lines below consensus.Overseas, the major European indices closed near their flat lines. Germany's DAX declined 0.1%, UK's FTSE finished flat, and France's CAC increased 0.1%. The Europe Stoxx 600 increased 0.2%.11:25 ETDow +36.88 at 28103.26, Nasdaq +20.81 at 8653.29, S&P +5.37 at 3139.01[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to drift in positive territory, with the S&P 500 up 0.2%, the Dow up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq up 0.2%.Most sectors are up, except for the S&P 500 energy (-0.7%) and financials (-0.4%) sectors, which are succumbing to broad-based losses. The real estate sector (+0.9%) remains firmly atop the standings amid the decline in Treasury yields.Amazon's (AMZN 1789.50, +15.60, +0.9%) price target was lowered to $2100 from $2500 at Pivotal Research Group, but the stock is outperforming nicely today. This new price target still represents a 17% increase from the current price today. The firm is somewhat cautious about AWS margins meaningfully declining and about the introduction of one-day shipping.10:55 ETDow +30.93 at 28097.31, Nasdaq +15.02 at 8647.5, S&P +2.55 at 3136.19[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades higher by 0.1%. Earnings reports continued to trickle in earlier this morning.Best Buy (BBY 80.57, +6.32, +8.5%), Burlington Stores (BURL 226.40, +18.14, +8.7%), and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS 47.04, +7.62, +19.3%) have impressed investors with their earnings results and/or guidance. Fellow retailer Dollar Tree (DLTR 96.32, -16.08, -14.3%), on the other hand, has disappointed investors with its results.Elsewhere, shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE 15.99, -1.46, -8.3%) are also on the retreat after the company missed revenue estimates.10:25 ETDow +35.84 at 28102.22, Nasdaq +13.48 at 8645.96, S&P +3.29 at 3136.93[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade higher by 0.1% and recently set another new intraday high.The continued advance in the Treasury market, which is driving yields lower, has reflected a defensive mindset despite the resiliency in the stock market. Equities have had a great run in part due to expectations for a trade deal, but some investors are leaning cautiously with a muted VIX (11.80, -0.07, -0.6%) amid the possibility a deal isn't reached.This isn't to say a deal won't be reached, though. China reported top negotiators had a phone call last evening and agreed to keep talking to resolve core issues in order to get a Phase One deal signed. The market is still pricing in the completion of this agreement.The benchmark 10-yr yield is down three basis points to 1.73%.10:00 ETDow +43.99 at 28110.37, Nasdaq +13.33 at 8645.81, S&P +4.46 at 3138.1[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is now up 0.2%, while the Russell 2000 is down 0.1%.Just in, New Home Sales in October hit an annualized rate of 733,000, coming in above the Briefing.com consensus of 710,000. The September reading was revised to 738,000 (from 701,000).Separately, the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index ticked down to 125.5 in November (Briefing.com consensus 126.9) from a revised 126.1 in October (from 125.9).09:40 ETDow +0.80 at 28067.18, Nasdaq +0.78 at 8633.26, S&P -0.15 at 3133.49[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 (unch), Dow Jones Industrial Average (unch), and Nasdaq Composite (unch) open the session little changed after each closed at record highs yesterday.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows nine of the 11 sectors trading within 0.3% of their flat lines. The energy sector (-0.4%) is today's early laggard despite the higher oil prices ($58.41, +0.40, +0.7%), while the real estate sector (+0.4%) outperforms.U.S. Treasuries have edged higher, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.74%. The U.S. Dollar Index is little changed at 98.34.09:10 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -0.10. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +1.80.The stock market is headed for a flat start, as the S&P 500 futures trade in-line with fair value. The market has received trade news, earnings reports, and economic data, but none of it is having a meaningful impact on trading this morning.There was a modest advance in the futures trade last evening after a report from China indicated that top trade negotiators held a phone call, but the initial enthusiasm waned upon realization that nothing substantial was included in that report.Notable pre-market moves include earnings-driven gains in Best Buy (BBY 77.35, +3.10, +4.2%) and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS 43.89, +4.46, +11.3%), while Dollar Tree (DLTR 97.48, -14.91, -13.3%) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW 230.40, -19.40, -7.9%) are on the retreat following their reports.Separately, investors received some housing data earlier. The FHFA Housing Price Index for September increased 0.6% following an unrevised 0.2% increase in August. The S&P Case-Shiller Housing Price Index for September increased 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus 2.6%) following an unrevised 2.0% increase in August.08:50 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: +1.10.

Xinhua reported that Chinese trade negotiators held a phone call with their U.S. counterparts, agreeing to keep working toward a partial trade deal.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +2.10.The S&P 500 futures trade roughly in-line with fair value after another record-setting day on Wall Street yesterday. Futures were up as much as 0.4% above fair value after China's Xinhua News Agency reported that top trade negotiators held a phone call last evening.Both the U.S. and China reportedly reached an agreement in that call to continue to work toward resolving key issues for a Phase One trade agreement. The market, which already expects both sides to talk until a deal is reached, has justifiably tempered its initial enthusiasm but will likely continue to react to trade headlines moving forward.On the data front, investors will receive the Advance reports for International Trade in Goods, Retail Inventories, and Wholesale Inventories at 8:30 a.m. ET, followed by the FHFA Housing Price Index for September and the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for September (Briefing.com consensus 2.6%) at 9:00 a.m. ET.After the open, investors will receive the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for November (Briefing.com consensus 126.9) and the New Home Sales report for October (Briefing.com consensus 710,000) at 10:00 a.m. ET.U.S. Treasuries have extended yesterday's modest advance, pushing yields slightly lower again this morning.

Sizable M&A activity across several sectors also supported risk sentiment.The Russell 2000 rose 2.1%, climbing past its large-cap peers to close at a 52-week high.Press reports indicated that Chinese government officials called to increase penalties on IP theft, which was interpreted as a move that could help strike a Phase One deal. It should be noted that a separate report from Reuters that suggested a Phase Two deal before the 2020 election is unlikely to be reached did not have a noticeable effect on the market.The S&P 500 information technology sector (+1.4%), which typically outperforms when the prevailing view on trade is positive, led all sectors in gains amid strength in the semiconductor stocks. NVIDIA (NVDA 221.21, +10.32, +4.9%) was a notable gainer after the stock was upgraded to Overweight from Equal Weight at Morgan Stanley. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose 2.4%.The health care (+1.1%) and consumer discretionary (+0.9%) sectors also rose more than the S&P 500, while the utilities sector (-0.4%) was today's lone sector to finish in negative territory.Two of today's M&A deals were ones that were already on the market's radar: Charles Schwab (SCHW 49.31, +1.11, +2.3%) agreed to acquire TD Ameritrade (AMTD 51.78, +3.65, +7.6%) for $26 billion in an all-stock transaction, and LVMH (LVMUY 89.37, +1.98, +2.3%) agreed to acquire Tiffany & Co. (TIF 133.25, +7.74, +6.2%) for $16.2 billion in cash.New deals included Novartis (NVS 91.30, +0.82, +0.9%) agreeing to acquire The Medicines Co.

The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield declined one basis point to 1.76%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 98.32.

The Russell 2000 increased 0.1% but closed off its highs.Leading the advance were the S&P 500 real estate (+1.4%), consumer staples (+0.8%), consumer discretionary (+0.8%), and materials (+0.5%) sectors. The energy (-1.0%), financials (-0.1%), and health care (-0.1%) sectors were the lone holdouts.Evidently, buying conviction was less pronounced than yesterday, but the same factors that have contributed to the market's record run -- trade progress, low rates, low volatility, and supportive monetary policy expectations -- remained intact. As for trade, China's Commerce Ministry said top negotiators held a phone call in which both sides agreed on how to properly resolve outstanding issues for a Phase One deal.Other outperformers in the stock market included the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 44.84, +0.27, +0.6%), which benefited from upbeat earnings forecasts, and the iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (ITB 45.89, +0.61, +1.4%), which benefited from new home sales in October coming in better than expected at 733,000 units (Briefing.com consensus 710,000).Best Buy (BBY 81.57, +7.32, +9.9%), Burlington Stores (BURL 225.97, +17.71, +8.5%), and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS 46.77, +7.34, +18.6%) impressed investors with their results and guidance, the latter of which is especially important for the retailers with the holiday-shopping season nearly in full swing. Dollar Tree (DLTR 95.26, -17.13, -15.2%) failed to meet expectations.Separately, several Dow components set new all-time highs today. Walt Disney (DIS 151.64, +1.95, +1.3%) was one of them after the stock was initiated with an Outperform rating at Consumer Edge Research with a price target of $175.U.S. Treasuries continued to increase, which sent yields slightly lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield declined three basis point to 1.58%, and the 10-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.74%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 98.23. WTI crude increased 0.6%, or $0.32, to $58.30/bbl.Reviewing Tuesday's batch of economic data, which featured the New Home Sales report for October:New home sales in October decreased 0.7% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 733,000 units (Briefing.com consensus 710,000) from an upwardly revised 738,000 (from 701,000) in September. On a yr/yr basis, new home sales were up 31.6%.The key takeaway from the report is that the October showing was better than what meets the eye at first blush given the large, upward revision to the prior month's number.The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for November eased to 125.5 (Briefing.com consensus 126.9) from 125.9 in October, marking the fourth straight monthly retreat.The key takeaway from the report is that consumers continue to remain relatively upbeat about the short-term outlook based in part on income prospects, which should be a support for holiday spending activity.The Advance International Trade in Goods report for October showed a narrowing in the deficit to $66.5 billion from $70.5 billion in September. Advance Retail Inventories were up 0.3% on top of a 0.2% increase in September and Advance Wholesale Inventories increased 0.2% after declining 0.7% in September.The FHFA Housing Price Index for September increased 0.6% following an unrevised 0.2% increase in August. The S&P Case-Shiller Housing Price Index for September increased 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus 2.6%) following an unrevised 2.0% increase in August.Looking ahead, investors will be given a cornucopia of reports on Wednesday before Thanksgiving Day: Personal Income and Spending for October, Durable Goods Orders for October, the second estimate for Q3 GDP, Pending Home Sales for October, the weekly reports for MBA Mortgage Applications and jobless claims, and the Fed's Beige Book for December.Nasdaq Composite +30.3% YTDS&P 500 +25.3% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.6% YTDRussell 2000 +20.4% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1565/1302. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1522/1595.15:25 ETDow +23.79 at 28090.17, Nasdaq +9.29 at 8641.77, S&P +2.41 at 3136.05[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 (+0.1%) is vying for another record close, although it has been floundering over the past few hours.One last look inside the benchmark index shows the real estate (+1.0%), consumer staples (+0.6%), and consumer discretionary (+0.6%) sectors atop the standings, while the energy (-1.1%), health care (-0.3%), and financials (-0.3%) sectors trade lower.WTI crude settled up $0.30 (+0.6%) to $58.30/bbl.14:55 ETDow +42.31 at 28108.69, Nasdaq +17.71 at 8650.19, S&P +4.92 at 3138.56[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade higher by 0.2%.Homebuilders are having a good day today after new home sales for October came in better than expected and showed sales exceed 700,000 for three straight months. That hasn't happened since 2007. The iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (ITB 45.76, +0.48, +1.0%) is up 1%.Looking ahead to after the close, Dell (DELL 53.90, -1.16, -2.1%), HP Inc. (HPQ 19.90, -0.26, -1.3%), and VMWare (VMW 166.22, -2.43, -1.4%) are some notable companies that will report earnings results. Deere (DE 177.05, +0.44, +0.3%) will report tomorrow morning.14:25 ETDow +31.29 at 28097.67, Nasdaq +17.04 at 8649.52, S&P +3.70 at 3137.34[BRIEFING.COM] We're still higher across the board in the major averages; the S&P 500 gains 0.12%, the Nasdaq Composite adds 0.20%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average advances 0.11%.Some of the better-performing names in the S&P 500 include Hormel Foods (HRL 44.34, +1.58, +3.70%), Intuit (INTU 265.44, +8.37, +3.26%), and Abiomed (ABMD 192.49, +4.92, +2.62%). Hormel gains as mixed earnings were seen as generally "good enough" owing to strength in the Jennie-O turkey brand. Abiomed gained some traction on a technical level, edging above its 50-day SMA (187.83) after resistance had held the stock below that level for the past few days. Intuit, helped by broader gains in the software sector, pushed above its moving averages, recouping a portion of last week's post-earnings selloff.Conversely, Iron Mountain (IRM 32.39, -1.66, -4.88%) is near the bottom of the index. Iron Mountain is weaker in response to the announcement that the company's CFO, Stuart Brown, would be leaving Dec. 31 to pursue other interests. Barry Hytinen, current EVP and CFO at HanesBrands (HBI 14.96, -0.20, -1.32%), has been named as his successor; what's more, IRM reaffirmed its FY19 guidance.14:00 ETDow +25.73 at 28092.11, Nasdaq +16.99 at 8649.47, S&P +3.55 at 3137.19[BRIEFING.COM] The Nasdaq Composite still garners the best gains to this point on Tuesday, up 0.20%, as the major averages continue to march sideways into the final two hours of action.Gold futures settled $3.40 higher (+0.2%) to $1,456.90/oz, helped in part by this morning's fourth-straight monthly decline in the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index reading.The U.S. Dollar Index holds losses under 0.1% to 98.27.13:30 ETDow +29.16 at 28095.54, Nasdaq +19.82 at 8652.3, S&P +4.36 at 3138[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages stand little changed in the last half hour with the Dow Jones Industrial Average still bringing up the rear, +0.10%.The best performers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average include Walt Disney (DIS 152.94, +3.25, +2.17%), Merck (MRK 86.87, +1.17, +1.37%), and Procter & Gamble (PG 122.10, +1.59, +1.32%). Helping Disney higher today is a NYPost article out earlier suggesting Disney+ is averaging one million new subscribers a day, as well as a bullish initiation out of sell side shop Consumer Edge Research. Merck made a three-week high this morning in reaction to Chinese approval of KEYTRUDA.Conversely, Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA 59.32, -1.35, -2.23%) sits at the bottom of the index.The DJIA holds gains of 0.79% on the week, pushing its month-to-date advance to 3.88%.Elsewhere, at the top of the hour, the Treasury's $41 bln 5-year note auction drew a high yield of 1.587% on a bid-to-cover of 2.50.12:55 ETDow +46.21 at 28112.59, Nasdaq +24.01 at 8656.49, S&P +6.53 at 3140.17[BRIEFING.COM] The large-cap indices have drifted higher into record territory today as the market's bullish narrative remains intact. The S&P 500 (+0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.2%), and Nasdaq Composite (+0.3%) edge above their flat lines.Chief among today's news is a report that top trade negotiators from the U.S. and China reportedly reached a consensus on how to properly resolve core issues. Tucked behind the trade news are Treasury yields that remain persistently low, a CBOE Volatility Index (11.66, -0.21, -1.8%) that is trading at its lowest level since April, and a speech from Fed Chair Powell last evening that maintained the market's positive view on monetary policy.A flat start for the stock market has transitioned into marginal gains across the indices. From a sector standpoint, nine of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are up, with the real estate sector (+1.1%) rising above the rest amid another decline in Treasury yields. The benchmark 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.74%.The financials (-0.3%) and energy (-0.6%) sectors are the lone holdouts.Retailers remain in focus after Best Buy (BBY 82.74, +8.45, +11.4%), Burlington Stores (BURL 226.83, +18.55, +8.9%), and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS 47.11, +7.68, +19.4%) impressed investors with their results and/or guidance. Fellow retailer Dollar Tree (DLTR 94.07, -18.32, -16.3%), however, has disappointed investors with its results.Separately, shares of Walt Disney (DIS 153.29, +3.60, +2.4%) have climbed to a new all-time high after Consumer Edge Research initiated coverage on the stock with an Overweight rating. The firm has a $175 price target for the stock.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-0.3%) may be struggling after Analog Devices (ADI 114.71, +1.78, +1.6%) missed earnings estimates and provided downside Q1 guidance. Shares of Analog Devices, however, have erased early losses and now trade firmly higher. The broader semiconductor space could be taking a much-needed breather.Reviewing today's batch of economic data, which featured the New Home Sales report for October:New home sales in October decreased 0.7% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 733,000 units (Briefing.com consensus 710,000) from an upwardly revised 738,000 (from 701,000) in September. On a yr/yr basis, new home sales were up 31.6%.The key takeaway from the report is that the October showing was better than what meets the eye at first blush given the large, upward revision to the prior month's number.The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for November eased to 125.5 (Briefing.com consensus 126.9) from 125.9 in October, marking the fourth straight monthly retreat.The key takeaway from the report is that consumers continue to remain relatively upbeat about the short-term outlook based in part on income prospects, which should be a support for holiday spending activity.The Advance International Trade in Goods report for October showed a narrowing in the deficit to $66.5 billion from $70.5 billion in September.

The S&P Case-Shiller Housing Price Index for September increased 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus 2.6%) following an unrevised 2.0% increase in August. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1582/1255. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1595/1412.12:25 ETDow +60.58 at 28126.96, Nasdaq +23.83 at 8656.31, S&P +7.19 at 3140.83[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is trading near session highs with a gain of 0.2%. The Nasdaq is up 0.3%.Amazon (AMZN 1791.98, +18.13, +1.0%) continues to lead the FAANG stocks higher, followed by a modest gain in Alphabet (GOOG 1311.84, +5.15, +0.4%). Facebook (FB 199.50, -0.28, -0.1%), Apple (AAPL 266.46, +0.10, unch), and Netflix (NFLX 314.74, -0.81, -0.3%) trade near their flat lines.Separately, the CBOE Volatility Index (11.70, -0.17, -1.4%) is trading at its lowest level since April and is on pace to close at its lowest level since October 2018.11:55 ETDow +40.27 at 28106.65, Nasdaq +18.32 at 8650.8, S&P +5.31 at 3138.95[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade higher by 0.2%.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is finally taking a breather today, as the group trades lower by 0.7%. The semiconductor space may be struggling after Analog Devices (ADI 113.28, +0.35, +0.3%) missed earnings estimates and guided Q1 top and bottom lines below consensus.Overseas, the major European indices closed near their flat lines. Germany's DAX declined 0.1%, UK's FTSE finished flat, and France's CAC increased 0.1%. The Europe Stoxx 600 increased 0.2%.11:25 ETDow +36.88 at 28103.26, Nasdaq +20.81 at 8653.29, S&P +5.37 at 3139.01[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to drift in positive territory, with the S&P 500 up 0.2%, the Dow up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq up 0.2%.Most sectors are up, except for the S&P 500 energy (-0.7%) and financials (-0.4%) sectors, which are succumbing to broad-based losses. The real estate sector (+0.9%) remains firmly atop the standings amid the decline in Treasury yields.Amazon's (AMZN 1789.50, +15.60, +0.9%) price target was lowered to $2100 from $2500 at Pivotal Research Group, but the stock is outperforming nicely today. This new price target still represents a 17% increase from the current price today. The firm is somewhat cautious about AWS margins meaningfully declining and about the introduction of one-day shipping.10:55 ETDow +30.93 at 28097.31, Nasdaq +15.02 at 8647.5, S&P +2.55 at 3136.19[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades higher by 0.1%. Earnings reports continued to trickle in earlier this morning.Best Buy (BBY 80.57, +6.32, +8.5%), Burlington Stores (BURL 226.40, +18.14, +8.7%), and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS 47.04, +7.62, +19.3%) have impressed investors with their earnings results and/or guidance. Fellow retailer Dollar Tree (DLTR 96.32, -16.08, -14.3%), on the other hand, has disappointed investors with its results.Elsewhere, shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE 15.99, -1.46, -8.3%) are also on the retreat after the company missed revenue estimates.10:25 ETDow +35.84 at 28102.22, Nasdaq +13.48 at 8645.96, S&P +3.29 at 3136.93[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade higher by 0.1% and recently set another new intraday high.The continued advance in the Treasury market, which is driving yields lower, has reflected a defensive mindset despite the resiliency in the stock market. Equities have had a great run in part due to expectations for a trade deal, but some investors are leaning cautiously with a muted VIX (11.80, -0.07, -0.6%) amid the possibility a deal isn't reached.This isn't to say a deal won't be reached, though. China reported top negotiators had a phone call last evening and agreed to keep talking to resolve core issues in order to get a Phase One deal signed. The market is still pricing in the completion of this agreement.The benchmark 10-yr yield is down three basis points to 1.73%.10:00 ETDow +43.99 at 28110.37, Nasdaq +13.33 at 8645.81, S&P +4.46 at 3138.1[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is now up 0.2%, while the Russell 2000 is down 0.1%.Just in, New Home Sales in October hit an annualized rate of 733,000, coming in above the Briefing.com consensus of 710,000. The September reading was revised to 738,000 (from 701,000).Separately, the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index ticked down to 125.5 in November (Briefing.com consensus 126.9) from a revised 126.1 in October (from 125.9).09:40 ETDow +0.80 at 28067.18, Nasdaq +0.78 at 8633.26, S&P -0.15 at 3133.49[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 (unch), Dow Jones Industrial Average (unch), and Nasdaq Composite (unch) open the session little changed after each closed at record highs yesterday.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows nine of the 11 sectors trading within 0.3% of their flat lines. The energy sector (-0.4%) is today's early laggard despite the higher oil prices ($58.41, +0.40, +0.7%), while the real estate sector (+0.4%) outperforms.U.S. Treasuries have edged higher, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.74%.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +1.80.The stock market is headed for a flat start, as the S&P 500 futures trade in-line with fair value. The market has received trade news, earnings reports, and economic data, but none of it is having a meaningful impact on trading this morning.There was a modest advance in the futures trade last evening after a report from China indicated that top trade negotiators held a phone call, but the initial enthusiasm waned upon realization that nothing substantial was included in that report.Notable pre-market moves include earnings-driven gains in Best Buy (BBY 77.35, +3.10, +4.2%) and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS 43.89, +4.46, +11.3%), while Dollar Tree (DLTR 97.48, -14.91, -13.3%) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW 230.40, -19.40, -7.9%) are on the retreat following their reports.Separately, investors received some housing data earlier. The FHFA Housing Price Index for September increased 0.6% following an unrevised 0.2% increase in August. The S&P Case-Shiller Housing Price Index for September increased 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus 2.6%) following an unrevised 2.0% increase in August.08:50 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: +1.10.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +2.10.The S&P 500 futures trade roughly in-line with fair value after another record-setting day on Wall Street yesterday. Futures were up as much as 0.4% above fair value after China's Xinhua News Agency reported that top trade negotiators held a phone call last evening.Both the U.S. and China reportedly reached an agreement in that call to continue to work toward resolving key issues for a Phase One trade agreement. The market, which already expects both sides to talk until a deal is reached, has justifiably tempered its initial enthusiasm but will likely continue to react to trade headlines moving forward.On the data front, investors will receive the Advance reports for International Trade in Goods, Retail Inventories, and Wholesale Inventories at 8:30 a.m. ET, followed by the FHFA Housing Price Index for September and the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for September (Briefing.com consensus 2.6%) at 9:00 a.m. ET.After the open, investors will receive the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for November (Briefing.com consensus 126.9) and the New Home Sales report for October (Briefing.com consensus 710,000) at 10:00 a.m. ET.U.S. Treasuries have extended yesterday's modest advance, pushing yields slightly lower again this morning.

Sizable M&A activity across several sectors also supported risk sentiment.The Russell 2000 rose 2.1%, climbing past its large-cap peers to close at a 52-week high.Press reports indicated that Chinese government officials called to increase penalties on IP theft, which was interpreted as a move that could help strike a Phase One deal. It should be noted that a separate report from Reuters that suggested a Phase Two deal before the 2020 election is unlikely to be reached did not have a noticeable effect on the market.The S&P 500 information technology sector (+1.4%), which typically outperforms when the prevailing view on trade is positive, led all sectors in gains amid strength in the semiconductor stocks. NVIDIA (NVDA 221.21, +10.32, +4.9%) was a notable gainer after the stock was upgraded to Overweight from Equal Weight at Morgan Stanley. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose 2.4%.The health care (+1.1%) and consumer discretionary (+0.9%) sectors also rose more than the S&P 500, while the utilities sector (-0.4%) was today's lone sector to finish in negative territory.Two of today's M&A deals were ones that were already on the market's radar: Charles Schwab (SCHW 49.31, +1.11, +2.3%) agreed to acquire TD Ameritrade (AMTD 51.78, +3.65, +7.6%) for $26 billion in an all-stock transaction, and LVMH (LVMUY 89.37, +1.98, +2.3%) agreed to acquire Tiffany & Co. (TIF 133.25, +7.74, +6.2%) for $16.2 billion in cash.New deals included Novartis (NVS 91.30, +0.82, +0.9%) agreeing to acquire The Medicines Co. (MDCO 83.80, +15.25, +22.3%) for $9.7 billion in cash and eBay (EBAY 35.85, +0.73, +2.1%) agreeing to sell StubHub to Viagogo for $4.05 billion in cash.Strikingly, U.S. Treasuries finished the session on a higher note despite the risk sentiment displayed in the stock market. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield declined one basis point to 1.76%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 98.32. WTI crude increased 0.2%, or $0.10, to $57.98/bbl.Investors did not receive any notable economic data on Monday.

The Russell 2000 increased 0.1% but closed off its highs.Leading the advance were the S&P 500 real estate (+1.4%), consumer staples (+0.8%), consumer discretionary (+0.8%), and materials (+0.5%) sectors. The energy (-1.0%), financials (-0.1%), and health care (-0.1%) sectors were the lone holdouts.Evidently, buying conviction was less pronounced than yesterday, but the same factors that have contributed to the market's record run -- trade progress, low rates, low volatility, and supportive monetary policy expectations -- remained intact. As for trade, China's Commerce Ministry said top negotiators held a phone call in which both sides agreed on how to properly resolve outstanding issues for a Phase One deal.Other outperformers in the stock market included the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 44.84, +0.27, +0.6%), which benefited from upbeat earnings forecasts, and the iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (ITB 45.89, +0.61, +1.4%), which benefited from new home sales in October coming in better than expected at 733,000 units (Briefing.com consensus 710,000).Best Buy (BBY 81.57, +7.32, +9.9%), Burlington Stores (BURL 225.97, +17.71, +8.5%), and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS 46.77, +7.34, +18.6%) impressed investors with their results and guidance, the latter of which is especially important for the retailers with the holiday-shopping season nearly in full swing. Dollar Tree (DLTR 95.26, -17.13, -15.2%) failed to meet expectations.Separately, three Dow components set new all-time highs today. Walt Disney (DIS 151.64, +1.95, +1.3%) was one of them after the stock was initiated with an Outperform rating at Consumer Edge Research with a price target of $175.U.S. Treasuries continued to increase, which sent yields slightly lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield declined three basis point to 1.58%, and the 10-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.74%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 98.23. WTI crude increased 0.6%, or $0.32, to $58.30/bbl.Reviewing Tuesday's batch of economic data, which featured the New Home Sales report for October:New home sales in October decreased 0.7% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 733,000 units (Briefing.com consensus 710,000) from an upwardly revised 738,000 (from 701,000) in September. On a yr/yr basis, new home sales were up 31.6%.The key takeaway from the report is that the October showing was better than what meets the eye at first blush given the large, upward revision to the prior month's number.The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for November eased to 125.5 (Briefing.com consensus 126.9) from 125.9 in October, marking the fourth straight monthly retreat.The key takeaway from the report is that consumers continue to remain relatively upbeat about the short-term outlook based in part on income prospects, which should be a support for holiday spending activity.The Advance International Trade in Goods report for October showed a narrowing in the deficit to $66.5 billion from $70.5 billion in September. Advance Retail Inventories were up 0.3% on top of a 0.2% increase in September and Advance Wholesale Inventories increased 0.2% after declining 0.7% in September.The FHFA Housing Price Index for September increased 0.6% following an unrevised 0.2% increase in August. The S&P Case-Shiller Housing Price Index for September increased 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus 2.6%) following an unrevised 2.0% increase in August.Looking ahead, investors will be given a cornucopia of reports on Wednesday before Thanksgiving Day: Personal Income and Spending for October, Durable Goods Orders for October, the second estimate for Q3 GDP, Pending Home Sales for October, the weekly reports for MBA Mortgage Applications and jobless claims, and the Fed's Beige Book for December.Nasdaq Composite +30.3% YTDS&P 500 +25.3% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.6% YTDRussell 2000 +20.4% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1565/1302. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec /.15:25 ETDow +23.79 at 28090.17, Nasdaq +9.29 at 8641.77, S&P +2.41 at 3136.05[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 (+0.1%) is vying for another record close, although it has been floundering over the past few hours.One last look inside the benchmark index shows the real estate (+1.0%), consumer staples (+0.6%), and consumer discretionary (+0.6%) sectors atop the standings, while the energy (-1.1%), health care (-0.3%), and financials (-0.3%) sectors trade lower.WTI crude settled up $0.30 (+0.6%) to $58.30/bbl.14:55 ETDow +42.31 at 28108.69, Nasdaq +17.71 at 8650.19, S&P +4.92 at 3138.56[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade higher by 0.2%.Homebuilders are having a good day today after new home sales for October came in better than expected and showed sales exceed 700,000 for three straight months. That hasn't happened since 2007. The iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (ITB 45.76, +0.48, +1.0%) is up 1%.Looking ahead to after the close, Dell (DELL 53.90, -1.16, -2.1%), HP Inc. (HPQ 19.90, -0.26, -1.3%), and VMWare (VMW 166.22, -2.43, -1.4%) are some notable companies that will report earnings results. Deere (DE 177.05, +0.44, +0.3%) will report tomorrow morning.14:25 ETDow +31.29 at 28097.67, Nasdaq +17.04 at 8649.52, S&P +3.70 at 3137.34[BRIEFING.COM] We're still higher across the board in the major averages; the S&P 500 gains 0.12%, the Nasdaq Composite adds 0.20%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average advances 0.11%.Some of the better-performing names in the S&P 500 include Hormel Foods (HRL 44.34, +1.58, +3.70%), Intuit (INTU 265.44, +8.37, +3.26%), and Abiomed (ABMD 192.49, +4.92, +2.62%). Hormel gains as mixed earnings were seen as generally "good enough" owing to strength in the Jennie-O turkey brand. Abiomed gained some traction on a technical level, edging above its 50-day SMA (187.83) after resistance had held the stock below that level for the past few days. Intuit, helped by broader gains in the software sector, pushed above its moving averages, recouping a portion of last week's post-earnings selloff.Conversely, Iron Mountain (IRM 32.39, -1.66, -4.88%) is near the bottom of the index. Iron Mountain is weaker in response to the announcement that the company's CFO, Stuart Brown, would be leaving Dec. 31 to pursue other interests. Barry Hytinen, current EVP and CFO at HanesBrands (HBI 14.96, -0.20, -1.32%), has been named as his successor; what's more, IRM reaffirmed its FY19 guidance.14:00 ETDow +25.73 at 28092.11, Nasdaq +16.99 at 8649.47, S&P +3.55 at 3137.19[BRIEFING.COM] The Nasdaq Composite still garners the best gains to this point on Tuesday, up 0.20%, as the major averages continue to march sideways into the final two hours of action.Gold futures settled $3.40 higher (+0.2%) to $1,456.90/oz, helped in part by this morning's fourth-straight monthly decline in the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index reading.The U.S. Dollar Index holds losses under 0.1% to 98.27.13:30 ETDow +29.16 at 28095.54, Nasdaq +19.82 at 8652.3, S&P +4.36 at 3138[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages stand little changed in the last half hour with the Dow Jones Industrial Average still bringing up the rear, +0.10%.The best performers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average include Walt Disney (DIS 152.94, +3.25, +2.17%), Merck (MRK 86.87, +1.17, +1.37%), and Procter & Gamble (PG 122.10, +1.59, +1.32%). Helping Disney higher today is a NYPost article out earlier suggesting Disney+ is averaging one million new subscribers a day, as well as a bullish initiation out of sell side shop Consumer Edge Research. Merck made a three-week high this morning in reaction to Chinese approval of KEYTRUDA.Conversely, Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA 59.32, -1.35, -2.23%) sits at the bottom of the index.The DJIA holds gains of 0.79% on the week, pushing its month-to-date advance to 3.88%.Elsewhere, at the top of the hour, the Treasury's $41 bln 5-year note auction drew a high yield of 1.587% on a bid-to-cover of 2.50.12:55 ETDow +46.21 at 28112.59, Nasdaq +24.01 at 8656.49, S&P +6.53 at 3140.17[BRIEFING.COM] The large-cap indices have drifted higher into record territory today as the market's bullish narrative remains intact. The S&P 500 (+0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.2%), and Nasdaq Composite (+0.3%) edge above their flat lines.Chief among today's news is a report that top trade negotiators from the U.S. and China reportedly reached a consensus on how to properly resolve core issues. Tucked behind the trade news are Treasury yields that remain persistently low, a CBOE Volatility Index (11.66, -0.21, -1.8%) that is trading at its lowest level since April, and a speech from Fed Chair Powell last evening that maintained the market's positive view on monetary policy.A flat start for the stock market has transitioned into marginal gains across the indices. From a sector standpoint, nine of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are up, with the real estate sector (+1.1%) rising above the rest amid another decline in Treasury yields. The benchmark 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.74%.The financials (-0.3%) and energy (-0.6%) sectors are the lone holdouts.Retailers remain in focus after Best Buy (BBY 82.74, +8.45, +11.4%), Burlington Stores (BURL 226.83, +18.55, +8.9%), and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS 47.11, +7.68, +19.4%) impressed investors with their results and/or guidance. Fellow retailer Dollar Tree (DLTR 94.07, -18.32, -16.3%), however, has disappointed investors with its results.Separately, shares of Walt Disney (DIS 153.29, +3.60, +2.4%) have climbed to a new all-time high after Consumer Edge Research initiated coverage on the stock with an Overweight rating. The firm has a $175 price target for the stock.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-0.3%) may be struggling after Analog Devices (ADI 114.71, +1.78, +1.6%) missed earnings estimates and provided downside Q1 guidance. Shares of Analog Devices, however, have erased early losses and now trade firmly higher. The broader semiconductor space could be taking a much-needed breather.Reviewing today's batch of economic data, which featured the New Home Sales report for October:New home sales in October decreased 0.7% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 733,000 units (Briefing.com consensus 710,000) from an upwardly revised 738,000 (from 701,000) in September.

The Nasdaq is up 0.3%.Amazon (AMZN 1791.98, +18.13, +1.0%) continues to lead the FAANG stocks higher, followed by a modest gain in Alphabet (GOOG 1311.84, +5.15, +0.4%). Facebook (FB 199.50, -0.28, -0.1%), Apple (AAPL 266.46, +0.10, unch), and Netflix (NFLX 314.74, -0.81, -0.3%) trade near their flat lines.Separately, the CBOE Volatility Index (11.70, -0.17, -1.4%) is trading at its lowest level since April and is on pace to close at its lowest level since October 2018.11:55 ETDow +40.27 at 28106.65, Nasdaq +18.32 at 8650.8, S&P +5.31 at 3138.95[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade higher by 0.2%.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is finally taking a breather today, as the group trades lower by 0.7%. The semiconductor space may be struggling after Analog Devices (ADI 113.28, +0.35, +0.3%) missed earnings estimates and guided Q1 top and bottom lines below consensus.Overseas, the major European indices closed near their flat lines. Germany's DAX declined 0.1%, UK's FTSE finished flat, and France's CAC increased 0.1%. The Europe Stoxx 600 increased 0.2%.11:25 ETDow +36.88 at 28103.26, Nasdaq +20.81 at 8653.29, S&P +5.37 at 3139.01[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to drift in positive territory, with the S&P 500 up 0.2%, the Dow up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq up 0.2%.Most sectors are up, except for the S&P 500 energy (-0.7%) and financials (-0.4%) sectors, which are succumbing to broad-based losses. The real estate sector (+0.9%) remains firmly atop the standings amid the decline in Treasury yields.Amazon's (AMZN 1789.50, +15.60, +0.9%) price target was lowered to $2100 from $2500 at Pivotal Research Group, but the stock is outperforming nicely today. This new price target still represents a 17% increase from the current price today. The firm is somewhat cautious about AWS margins meaningfully declining and about the introduction of one-day shipping.10:55 ETDow +30.93 at 28097.31, Nasdaq +15.02 at 8647.5, S&P +2.55 at 3136.19[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades higher by 0.1%.

Fellow retailer Dollar Tree (DLTR 96.32, -16.08, -14.3%), on the other hand, has disappointed investors with its results.Elsewhere, shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE 15.99, -1.46, -8.3%) are also on the retreat after the company missed revenue estimates.10:25 ETDow +35.84 at 28102.22, Nasdaq +13.48 at 8645.96, S&P +3.29 at 3136.93[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade higher by 0.1% and recently set another new intraday high.The continued advance in the Treasury market, which is driving yields lower, has reflected a defensive mindset despite the resiliency in the stock market. Equities have had a great run in part due to expectations for a trade deal, but some investors are leaning cautiously with a muted VIX (11.80, -0.07, -0.6%) amid the possibility a deal isn't reached.This isn't to say a deal won't be reached, though. China reported top negotiators had a phone call last evening and agreed to keep talking to resolve core issues in order to get a Phase One deal signed. The market is still pricing in the completion of this agreement.The benchmark 10-yr yield is down three basis points to 1.73%.10:00 ETDow +43.99 at 28110.37, Nasdaq +13.33 at 8645.81, S&P +4.46 at 3138.1[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is now up 0.2%, while the Russell 2000 is down 0.1%.Just in, New Home Sales in October hit an annualized rate of 733,000, coming in above the Briefing.com consensus of 710,000. The September reading was revised to 738,000 (from 701,000).Separately, the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index ticked down to 125.5 in November (Briefing.com consensus 126.9) from a revised 126.1 in October (from 125.9).09:40 ETDow +0.80 at 28067.18, Nasdaq +0.78 at 8633.26, S&P -0.15 at 3133.49[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 (unch), Dow Jones Industrial Average (unch), and Nasdaq Composite (unch) open the session little changed after each closed at record highs yesterday.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows nine of the 11 sectors trading within 0.3% of their flat lines. The energy sector (-0.4%) is today's early laggard despite the higher oil prices ($58.41, +0.40, +0.7%), while the real estate sector (+0.4%) outperforms.U.S. Treasuries have edged higher, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.74%. The U.S. Dollar Index is little changed at 98.34.09:10 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: -0.10. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +1.80.The stock market is headed for a flat start, as the S&P 500 futures trade in-line with fair value. The market has received trade news, earnings reports, and economic data, but none of it is having a meaningful impact on trading this morning.There was a modest advance in the futures trade last evening after a report from China indicated that top trade negotiators held a phone call, but the initial enthusiasm waned upon realization that nothing substantial was included in that report.Notable pre-market moves include earnings-driven gains in Best Buy (BBY 77.35, +3.10, +4.2%) and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS 43.89, +4.46, +11.3%), while Dollar Tree (DLTR 97.48, -14.91, -13.3%) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW 230.40, -19.40, -7.9%) are on the retreat following their reports.Separately, investors received some housing data earlier. The FHFA Housing Price Index for September increased 0.6% following an unrevised 0.2% increase in August. The S&P Case-Shiller Housing Price Index for September increased 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus 2.6%) following an unrevised 2.0% increase in August.08:50 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: +1.10.

Xinhua reported that Chinese trade negotiators held a phone call with their U.S. counterparts, agreeing to keep working toward a partial trade deal. Japan's Finance Minister, Taro Aso, said that Japan needs to maintain the market's trust in government finances, adding that trust is the key reason why JGB yields have not increased significantly.In economic data: Japan's October Corporate Services Price Index +2.1% yr/yr (last 0.5%) Singapore's October Industrial Production +3.4% m/m (expected -0.5%; last 4.0%); +4.0% yr/yr (expected -1.7%; last 0.7%) Hong Kong's October trade deficit HKD30.60 bln (last deficit of HKD31.60 bln) New Zealand's Q3 Retail Sales +1.6% qtr/qtr (last 0.2%) and Core Retail Sales +1.8% qtr/qtr (last 0.3%)---Equity Markets---Japan's Nikkei: +0.4% Hong Kong's Hang Seng: -0.3% China's Shanghai Composite: UNCH India's Sensex: -0.2% South Korea's Kospi: -0.1% Australia's ASX All Ordinaries: +0.8%Major European indices trade near their flat lines.

Futures were up as much as 0.4% above fair value after China's Xinhua News Agency reported that top trade negotiators held a phone call last evening.Both the U.S. and China reportedly reached an agreement in that call to continue to work toward resolving key issues for a Phase One trade agreement. The market, which already expects both sides to talk until a deal is reached, has justifiably tempered its initial enthusiasm but will likely continue to react to trade headlines moving forward.On the data front, investors will receive the Advance reports for International Trade in Goods, Retail Inventories, and Wholesale Inventories at 8:30 a.m. ET, followed by the FHFA Housing Price Index for September and the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for September (Briefing.com consensus 2.6%) at 9:00 a.m. ET.After the open, investors will receive the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for November (Briefing.com consensus 126.9) and the New Home Sales report for October (Briefing.com consensus 710,000) at 10:00 a.m. ET.U.S. Treasuries have extended yesterday's modest advance, pushing yields slightly lower again this morning.

Sizable M&A activity across several sectors also supported risk sentiment.The Russell 2000 rose 2.1%, climbing past its large-cap peers to close at a 52-week high.Press reports indicated that Chinese government officials called to increase penalties on IP theft, which was interpreted as a move that could help strike a Phase One deal. It should be noted that a separate report from Reuters that suggested a Phase Two deal before the 2020 election is unlikely to be reached did not have a noticeable effect on the market.The S&P 500 information technology sector (+1.4%), which typically outperforms when the prevailing view on trade is positive, led all sectors in gains amid strength in the semiconductor stocks. NVIDIA (NVDA 221.21, +10.32, +4.9%) was a notable gainer after the stock was upgraded to Overweight from Equal Weight at Morgan Stanley. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose 2.4%.The health care (+1.1%) and consumer discretionary (+0.9%) sectors also rose more than the S&P 500, while the utilities sector (-0.4%) was today's lone sector to finish in negative territory.Two of today's M&A deals were ones that were already on the market's radar: Charles Schwab (SCHW 49.31, +1.11, +2.3%) agreed to acquire TD Ameritrade (AMTD 51.78, +3.65, +7.6%) for $26 billion in an all-stock transaction, and LVMH (LVMUY 89.37, +1.98, +2.3%) agreed to acquire Tiffany & Co. (TIF 133.25, +7.74, +6.2%) for $16.2 billion in cash.New deals included Novartis (NVS 91.30, +0.82, +0.9%) agreeing to acquire The Medicines Co. (MDCO 83.80, +15.25, +22.3%) for $9.7 billion in cash and eBay (EBAY 35.85, +0.73, +2.1%) agreeing to sell StubHub to Viagogo for $4.05 billion in cash.Strikingly, U.S. Treasuries finished the session on a higher note despite the risk sentiment displayed in the stock market. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield declined one basis point to 1.76%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 98.32. WTI crude increased 0.2%, or $0.10, to $57.98/bbl.Investors did not receive any notable economic data on Monday.

The Russell 2000 increased 0.1% but closed off its highs.Leading the advance were the S&P 500 real estate (+1.4%), consumer staples (+0.8%), consumer discretionary (+0.8%), and materials (+0.5%) sectors. The energy (-1.0%), financials (-0.1%), and health care (-0.1%) sectors were the lone holdouts.Evidently, buying conviction was less pronounced than yesterday, but the same factors that have contributed to the market's record run -- trade progress, low rates, low volatility, and supportive monetary policy expectations -- remained intact. As for trade, China's Commerce Ministry said top negotiators held a phone call in which both sides agreed on how to properly resolve outstanding issues for a Phase One deal.Other outperformers in the stock market included the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 44.84, +0.27, +0.6%), which benefited from upbeat earnings forecasts, and the iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (ITB 45.89, +0.61, +1.4%), which benefited from new home sales in October coming in better than expected at 733,000 units (Briefing.com consensus 710,000).Best Buy (BBY 81.57, +7.32, +9.9%), Burlington Stores (BURL 225.97, +17.71, +8.5%), and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS 46.77, +7.34, +18.6%) impressed investors with their results and guidance, the latter of which is especially important for the retailers with the holiday-shopping season nearly in full swing. Dollar Tree (DLTR 95.26, -17.13, -15.2%) failed to meet expectations.Separately, several Dow components set new all-time highs today. Walt Disney (DIS 151.64, +1.95, +1.3%) was one of them after the stock was initiated with an Outperform rating at Consumer Edge Research with a price target of $175.U.S. Treasuries continued to increase, which sent yields slightly lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield declined three basis point to 1.58%, and the 10-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.74%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 98.23. WTI crude increased 0.6%, or $0.32, to $58.30/bbl.Reviewing Tuesday's batch of economic data, which featured the New Home Sales report for October:New home sales in October decreased 0.7% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 733,000 units (Briefing.com consensus 710,000) from an upwardly revised 738,000 (from 701,000) in September. On a yr/yr basis, new home sales were up 31.6%.The key takeaway from the report is that the October showing was better than what meets the eye at first blush given the large, upward revision to the prior month's number.The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for November eased to 125.5 (Briefing.com consensus 126.9) from 125.9 in October, marking the fourth straight monthly retreat.The key takeaway from the report is that consumers continue to remain relatively upbeat about the short-term outlook based in part on income prospects, which should be a support for holiday spending activity.The Advance International Trade in Goods report for October showed a narrowing in the deficit to $66.5 billion from $70.5 billion in September. Advance Retail Inventories were up 0.3% on top of a 0.2% increase in September and Advance Wholesale Inventories increased 0.2% after declining 0.7% in September.The FHFA Housing Price Index for September increased 0.6% following an unrevised 0.2% increase in August. The S&P Case-Shiller Housing Price Index for September increased 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus 2.6%) following an unrevised 2.0% increase in August.Looking ahead, investors will be given a cornucopia of reports on Wednesday before Thanksgiving Day: Personal Income and Spending for October, Durable Goods Orders for October, the second estimate for Q3 GDP, Pending Home Sales for October, the weekly reports for MBA Mortgage Applications and jobless claims, and the Fed's Beige Book for December.Nasdaq Composite +30.3% YTDS&P 500 +25.3% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.6% YTDRussell 2000 +20.4% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1565/1302. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1522/1595.15:25 ETDow +23.79 at 28090.17, Nasdaq +9.29 at 8641.77, S&P +2.41 at 3136.05[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 (+0.1%) is vying for another record close, although it has been floundering over the past few hours.One last look inside the benchmark index shows the real estate (+1.0%), consumer staples (+0.6%), and consumer discretionary (+0.6%) sectors atop the standings, while the energy (-1.1%), health care (-0.3%), and financials (-0.3%) sectors trade lower.WTI crude settled up $0.30 (+0.6%) to $58.30/bbl.14:55 ETDow +42.31 at 28108.69, Nasdaq +17.71 at 8650.19, S&P +4.92 at 3138.56[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade higher by 0.2%.Homebuilders are having a good day today after new home sales for October came in better than expected and showed sales exceed 700,000 for three straight months. That hasn't happened since 2007. The iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (ITB 45.76, +0.48, +1.0%) is up 1%.Looking ahead to after the close, Dell (DELL 53.90, -1.16, -2.1%), HP Inc. (HPQ 19.90, -0.26, -1.3%), and VMWare (VMW 166.22, -2.43, -1.4%) are some notable companies that will report earnings results. Deere (DE 177.05, +0.44, +0.3%) will report tomorrow morning.14:25 ETDow +31.29 at 28097.67, Nasdaq +17.04 at 8649.52, S&P +3.70 at 3137.34[BRIEFING.COM] We're still higher across the board in the major averages; the S&P 500 gains 0.12%, the Nasdaq Composite adds 0.20%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average advances 0.11%.Some of the better-performing names in the S&P 500 include Hormel Foods (HRL 44.34, +1.58, +3.70%), Intuit (INTU 265.44, +8.37, +3.26%), and Abiomed (ABMD 192.49, +4.92, +2.62%). Hormel gains as mixed earnings were seen as generally "good enough" owing to strength in the Jennie-O turkey brand. Abiomed gained some traction on a technical level, edging above its 50-day SMA (187.83) after resistance had held the stock below that level for the past few days. Intuit, helped by broader gains in the software sector, pushed above its moving averages, recouping a portion of last week's post-earnings selloff.Conversely, Iron Mountain (IRM 32.39, -1.66, -4.88%) is near the bottom of the index. Iron Mountain is weaker in response to the announcement that the company's CFO, Stuart Brown, would be leaving Dec. 31 to pursue other interests. Barry Hytinen, current EVP and CFO at HanesBrands (HBI 14.96, -0.20, -1.32%), has been named as his successor; what's more, IRM reaffirmed its FY19 guidance.14:00 ETDow +25.73 at 28092.11, Nasdaq +16.99 at 8649.47, S&P +3.55 at 3137.19[BRIEFING.COM] The Nasdaq Composite still garners the best gains to this point on Tuesday, up 0.20%, as the major averages continue to march sideways into the final two hours of action.Gold futures settled $3.40 higher (+0.2%) to $1,456.90/oz, helped in part by this morning's fourth-straight monthly decline in the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index reading.The U.S. Dollar Index holds losses under 0.1% to 98.27.13:30 ETDow +29.16 at 28095.54, Nasdaq +19.82 at 8652.3, S&P +4.36 at 3138[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages stand little changed in the last half hour with the Dow Jones Industrial Average still bringing up the rear, +0.10%.The best performers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average include Walt Disney (DIS 152.94, +3.25, +2.17%), Merck (MRK 86.87, +1.17, +1.37%), and Procter & Gamble (PG 122.10, +1.59, +1.32%). Helping Disney higher today is a NYPost article out earlier suggesting Disney+ is averaging one million new subscribers a day, as well as a bullish initiation out of sell side shop Consumer Edge Research. Merck made a three-week high this morning in reaction to Chinese approval of KEYTRUDA.Conversely, Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA 59.32, -1.35, -2.23%) sits at the bottom of the index.The DJIA holds gains of 0.79% on the week, pushing its month-to-date advance to 3.88%.Elsewhere, at the top of the hour, the Treasury's $41 bln 5-year note auction drew a high yield of 1.587% on a bid-to-cover of 2.50.12:55 ETDow +46.21 at 28112.59, Nasdaq +24.01 at 8656.49, S&P +6.53 at 3140.17[BRIEFING.COM] The large-cap indices have drifted higher into record territory today as the market's bullish narrative remains intact. The S&P 500 (+0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.2%), and Nasdaq Composite (+0.3%) edge above their flat lines.Chief among today's news is a report that top trade negotiators from the U.S. and China reportedly reached a consensus on how to properly resolve core issues. Tucked behind the trade news are Treasury yields that remain persistently low, a CBOE Volatility Index (11.66, -0.21, -1.8%) that is trading at its lowest level since April, and a speech from Fed Chair Powell last evening that maintained the market's positive view on monetary policy.A flat start for the stock market has transitioned into marginal gains across the indices. From a sector standpoint, nine of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are up, with the real estate sector (+1.1%) rising above the rest amid another decline in Treasury yields. The benchmark 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.74%.The financials (-0.3%) and energy (-0.6%) sectors are the lone holdouts.Retailers remain in focus after Best Buy (BBY 82.74, +8.45, +11.4%), Burlington Stores (BURL 226.83, +18.55, +8.9%), and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS 47.11, +7.68, +19.4%) impressed investors with their results and/or guidance. Fellow retailer Dollar Tree (DLTR 94.07, -18.32, -16.3%), however, has disappointed investors with its results.Separately, shares of Walt Disney (DIS 153.29, +3.60, +2.4%) have climbed to a new all-time high after Consumer Edge Research initiated coverage on the stock with an Overweight rating. The firm has a $175 price target for the stock.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-0.3%) may be struggling after Analog Devices (ADI 114.71, +1.78, +1.6%) missed earnings estimates and provided downside Q1 guidance. Shares of Analog Devices, however, have erased early losses and now trade firmly higher. The broader semiconductor space could be taking a much-needed breather.Reviewing today's batch of economic data, which featured the New Home Sales report for October:New home sales in October decreased 0.7% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 733,000 units (Briefing.com consensus 710,000) from an upwardly revised 738,000 (from 701,000) in September. On a yr/yr basis, new home sales were up 31.6%.The key takeaway from the report is that the October showing was better than what meets the eye at first blush given the large, upward revision to the prior month's number.The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for November eased to 125.5 (Briefing.com consensus 126.9) from 125.9 in October, marking the fourth straight monthly retreat.The key takeaway from the report is that consumers continue to remain relatively upbeat about the short-term outlook based in part on income prospects, which should be a support for holiday spending activity.The Advance International Trade in Goods report for October showed a narrowing in the deficit to $66.5 billion from $70.5 billion in September. Advance Retail Inventories were up 0.3% on top of a 0.2% increase in September and Advance Wholesale Inventories increased 0.2% after declining 0.7% in September.The FHFA Housing Price Index for September increased 0.6% following an unrevised 0.2% increase in August.

The real estate sector (+0.9%) remains firmly atop the standings amid the decline in Treasury yields.Amazon's (AMZN 1789.50, +15.60, +0.9%) price target was lowered to $2100 from $2500 at Pivotal Research Group, but the stock is outperforming nicely today. This new price target still represents a 17% increase from the current price today.

The market has received trade news, earnings reports, and economic data, but none of it is having a meaningful impact on trading this morning.There was a modest advance in the futures trade last evening after a report from China indicated that top trade negotiators held a phone call, but the initial enthusiasm waned upon realization that nothing substantial was included in that report.Notable pre-market moves include earnings-driven gains in Best Buy (BBY 77.35, +3.10, +4.2%) and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS 43.89, +4.46, +11.3%), while Dollar Tree (DLTR 97.48, -14.91, -13.3%) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW 230.40, -19.40, -7.9%) are on the retreat following their reports.Separately, investors received some housing data earlier.

The market, which already expects both sides to talk until a deal is reached, has justifiably tempered its initial enthusiasm but will likely continue to react to trade headlines moving forward.On the data front, investors will receive the Advance reports for International Trade in Goods, Retail Inventories, and Wholesale Inventories at 8:30 a.m. ET, followed by the FHFA Housing Price Index for September and the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for September (Briefing.com consensus 2.6%) at 9:00 a.m. ET.After the open, investors will receive the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for November (Briefing.com consensus 126.9) and the New Home Sales report for October (Briefing.com consensus 710,000) at 10:00 a.m. ET.U.S. Treasuries have extended yesterday's modest advance, pushing yields slightly lower again this morning.

Sizable M&A activity across several sectors also supported risk sentiment.The Russell 2000 rose 2.1%, climbing past its large-cap peers to close at a 52-week high.Press reports indicated that Chinese government officials called to increase penalties on IP theft, which was interpreted as a move that could help strike a Phase One deal. It should be noted that a separate report from Reuters that suggested a Phase Two deal before the 2020 election is unlikely to be reached did not have a noticeable effect on the market.The S&P 500 information technology sector (+1.4%), which typically outperforms when the prevailing view on trade is positive, led all sectors in gains amid strength in the semiconductor stocks. NVIDIA (NVDA 221.21, +10.32, +4.9%) was a notable gainer after the stock was upgraded to Overweight from Equal Weight at Morgan Stanley. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose 2.4%.The health care (+1.1%) and consumer discretionary (+0.9%) sectors also rose more than the S&P 500, while the utilities sector (-0.4%) was today's lone sector to finish in negative territory.Two of today's M&A deals were ones that were already on the market's radar: Charles Schwab (SCHW 49.31, +1.11, +2.3%) agreed to acquire TD Ameritrade (AMTD 51.78, +3.65, +7.6%) for $26 billion in an all-stock transaction, and LVMH (LVMUY 89.37, +1.98, +2.3%) agreed to acquire Tiffany & Co.

The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield declined one basis point to 1.76%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 98.32.

The Russell 2000 increased 0.1% but closed off its highs.Leading the advance were the S&P 500 real estate (+1.4%), consumer staples (+0.8%), consumer discretionary (+0.8%), and materials (+0.5%) sectors. The energy (-1.0%), financials (-0.1%), and health care (-0.1%) sectors were the lone holdouts.Evidently, buying conviction was less pronounced than yesterday, but the same factors that have contributed to the market's record run -- trade progress, low rates, low volatility, and supportive monetary policy expectations -- remained intact. As for trade, China's Commerce Ministry said top negotiators held a phone call in which both sides agreed on how to properly resolve outstanding issues for a Phase One deal.Other outperformers in the stock market included the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 44.84, +0.27, +0.6%), which benefited from upbeat earnings forecasts, and the iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (ITB 45.89, +0.61, +1.4%), which benefited from new home sales in October coming in better than expected at 733,000 units (Briefing.com consensus 710,000).Best Buy (BBY 81.57, +7.32, +9.9%), Burlington Stores (BURL 225.97, +17.71, +8.5%), and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS 46.77, +7.34, +18.6%) impressed investors with their results and guidance, the latter of which is especially important for the retailers with the holiday-shopping season nearly in full swing. Dollar Tree (DLTR 95.26, -17.13, -15.2%) failed to meet expectations.Separately, three Dow components set new all-time highs today. Walt Disney (DIS 151.64, +1.95, +1.3%) was one of them after the stock was initiated with an Outperform rating at Consumer Edge Research with a price target of $175.U.S. Treasuries continued to increase, which sent yields slightly lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield declined three basis point to 1.58%, and the 10-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.74%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 98.23. WTI crude increased 0.6%, or $0.32, to $58.30/bbl.Reviewing Tuesday's batch of economic data, which featured the New Home Sales report for October:New home sales in October decreased 0.7% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 733,000 units (Briefing.com consensus 710,000) from an upwardly revised 738,000 (from 701,000) in September. On a yr/yr basis, new home sales were up 31.6%.The key takeaway from the report is that the October showing was better than what meets the eye at first blush given the large, upward revision to the prior month's number.The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for November eased to 125.5 (Briefing.com consensus 126.9) from 125.9 in October, marking the fourth straight monthly retreat.The key takeaway from the report is that consumers continue to remain relatively upbeat about the short-term outlook based in part on income prospects, which should be a support for holiday spending activity.The Advance International Trade in Goods report for October showed a narrowing in the deficit to $66.5 billion from $70.5 billion in September. Advance Retail Inventories were up 0.3% on top of a 0.2% increase in September and Advance Wholesale Inventories increased 0.2% after declining 0.7% in September.The FHFA Housing Price Index for September increased 0.6% following an unrevised 0.2% increase in August. The S&P Case-Shiller Housing Price Index for September increased 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus 2.6%) following an unrevised 2.0% increase in August.Looking ahead, investors will be given a cornucopia of reports on Wednesday before Thanksgiving Day: Personal Income and Spending for October, Durable Goods Orders for October, the second estimate for Q3 GDP, Pending Home Sales for October, the weekly reports for MBA Mortgage Applications and jobless claims, and the Fed's Beige Book for December.Nasdaq Composite +30.3% YTDS&P 500 +25.3% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +20.6% YTDRussell 2000 +20.4% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1565/1302. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec /.15:25 ETDow +23.79 at 28090.17, Nasdaq +9.29 at 8641.77, S&P +2.41 at 3136.05[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 (+0.1%) is vying for another record close, although it has been floundering over the past few hours.One last look inside the benchmark index shows the real estate (+1.0%), consumer staples (+0.6%), and consumer discretionary (+0.6%) sectors atop the standings, while the energy (-1.1%), health care (-0.3%), and financials (-0.3%) sectors trade lower.WTI crude settled up $0.30 (+0.6%) to $58.30/bbl.14:55 ETDow +42.31 at 28108.69, Nasdaq +17.71 at 8650.19, S&P +4.92 at 3138.56[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade higher by 0.2%.Homebuilders are having a good day today after new home sales for October came in better than expected and showed sales exceed 700,000 for three straight months. That hasn't happened since 2007. The iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (ITB 45.76, +0.48, +1.0%) is up 1%.Looking ahead to after the close, Dell (DELL 53.90, -1.16, -2.1%), HP Inc. (HPQ 19.90, -0.26, -1.3%), and VMWare (VMW 166.22, -2.43, -1.4%) are some notable companies that will report earnings results.

Hormel gains as mixed earnings were seen as generally "good enough" owing to strength in the Jennie-O turkey brand. Abiomed gained some traction on a technical level, edging above its 50-day SMA (187.83) after resistance had held the stock below that level for the past few days. Intuit, helped by broader gains in the software sector, pushed above its moving averages, recouping a portion of last week's post-earnings selloff.Conversely, Iron Mountain (IRM 32.39, -1.66, -4.88%) is near the bottom of the index. Iron Mountain is weaker in response to the announcement that the company's CFO, Stuart Brown, would be leaving Dec. 31 to pursue other interests. Barry Hytinen, current EVP and CFO at HanesBrands (HBI 14.96, -0.20, -1.32%), has been named as his successor; what's more, IRM reaffirmed its FY19 guidance.14:00 ETDow +25.73 at 28092.11, Nasdaq +16.99 at 8649.47, S&P +3.55 at 3137.19[BRIEFING.COM] The Nasdaq Composite still garners the best gains to this point on Tuesday, up 0.20%, as the major averages continue to march sideways into the final two hours of action.Gold futures settled $3.40 higher (+0.2%) to $1,456.90/oz, helped in part by this morning's fourth-straight monthly decline in the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index reading.The U.S. Dollar Index holds losses under 0.1% to 98.27.13:30 ETDow +29.16 at 28095.54, Nasdaq +19.82 at 8652.3, S&P +4.36 at 3138[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages stand little changed in the last half hour with the Dow Jones Industrial Average still bringing up the rear, +0.10%.The best performers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average include Walt Disney (DIS 152.94, +3.25, +2.17%), Merck (MRK 86.87, +1.17, +1.37%), and Procter & Gamble (PG 122.10, +1.59, +1.32%). Helping Disney higher today is a NYPost article out earlier suggesting Disney+ is averaging one million new subscribers a day, as well as a bullish initiation out of sell side shop Consumer Edge Research. Merck made a three-week high this morning in reaction to Chinese approval of KEYTRUDA.Conversely, Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA 59.32, -1.35, -2.23%) sits at the bottom of the index.The DJIA holds gains of 0.79% on the week, pushing its month-to-date advance to 3.88%.Elsewhere, at the top of the hour, the Treasury's $41 bln 5-year note auction drew a high yield of 1.587% on a bid-to-cover of 2.50.12:55 ETDow +46.21 at 28112.59, Nasdaq +24.01 at 8656.49, S&P +6.53 at 3140.17[BRIEFING.COM] The large-cap indices have drifted higher into record territory today as the market's bullish narrative remains intact. The S&P 500 (+0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.2%), and Nasdaq Composite (+0.3%) edge above their flat lines.Chief among today's news is a report that top trade negotiators from the U.S. and China reportedly reached a consensus on how to properly resolve core issues. Tucked behind the trade news are Treasury yields that remain persistently low, a CBOE Volatility Index (11.66, -0.21, -1.8%) that is trading at its lowest level since April, and a speech from Fed Chair Powell last evening that maintained the market's positive view on monetary policy.A flat start for the stock market has transitioned into marginal gains across the indices. From a sector standpoint, nine of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are up, with the real estate sector (+1.1%) rising above the rest amid another decline in Treasury yields. The benchmark 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.74%.The financials (-0.3%) and energy (-0.6%) sectors are the lone holdouts.Retailers remain in focus after Best Buy (BBY 82.74, +8.45, +11.4%), Burlington Stores (BURL 226.83, +18.55, +8.9%), and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS 47.11, +7.68, +19.4%) impressed investors with their results and/or guidance. Fellow retailer Dollar Tree (DLTR 94.07, -18.32, -16.3%), however, has disappointed investors with its results.Separately, shares of Walt Disney (DIS 153.29, +3.60, +2.4%) have climbed to a new all-time high after Consumer Edge Research initiated coverage on the stock with an Overweight rating. The firm has a $175 price target for the stock.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-0.3%) may be struggling after Analog Devices (ADI 114.71, +1.78, +1.6%) missed earnings estimates and provided downside Q1 guidance. Shares of Analog Devices, however, have erased early losses and now trade firmly higher. The broader semiconductor space could be taking a much-needed breather.Reviewing today's batch of economic data, which featured the New Home Sales report for October:New home sales in October decreased 0.7% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 733,000 units (Briefing.com consensus 710,000) from an upwardly revised 738,000 (from 701,000) in September. On a yr/yr basis, new home sales were up 31.6%.The key takeaway from the report is that the October showing was better than what meets the eye at first blush given the large, upward revision to the prior month's number.The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for November eased to 125.5 (Briefing.com consensus 126.9) from 125.9 in October, marking the fourth straight monthly retreat.The key takeaway from the report is that consumers continue to remain relatively upbeat about the short-term outlook based in part on income prospects, which should be a support for holiday spending activity.The Advance International Trade in Goods report for October showed a narrowing in the deficit to $66.5 billion from $70.5 billion in September. Advance Retail Inventories were up 0.3% on top of a 0.2% increase in September and Advance Wholesale Inventories increased 0.2% after declining 0.7% in September.The FHFA Housing Price Index for September increased 0.6% following an unrevised 0.2% increase in August.

The real estate sector (+0.9%) remains firmly atop the standings amid the decline in Treasury yields.Amazon's (AMZN 1789.50, +15.60, +0.9%) price target was lowered to $2100 from $2500 at Pivotal Research Group, but the stock is outperforming nicely today. This new price target still represents a 17% increase from the current price today.

Sizable M&A activity across several sectors also supported risk sentiment.The Russell 2000 rose 2.1%, climbing past its large-cap peers to close at a 52-week high.Press reports indicated that Chinese government officials called to increase penalties on IP theft, which was interpreted as a move that could help strike a Phase One deal. It should be noted that a separate report from Reuters that suggested a Phase Two deal before the 2020 election is unlikely to be reached did not have a noticeable effect on the market.The S&P 500 information technology sector (+1.4%), which typically outperforms when the prevailing view on trade is positive, led all sectors in gains amid strength in the semiconductor stocks. NVIDIA (NVDA 221.21, +10.32, +4.9%) was a notable gainer after the stock was upgraded to Overweight from Equal Weight at Morgan Stanley. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose 2.4%.The health care (+1.1%) and consumer discretionary (+0.9%) sectors also rose more than the S&P 500, while the utilities sector (-0.4%) was today's lone sector to finish in negative territory.Two of today's M&A deals were ones that were already on the market's radar: Charles Schwab (SCHW 49.31, +1.11, +2.3%) agreed to acquire TD Ameritrade (AMTD 51.78, +3.65, +7.6%) for $26 billion in an all-stock transaction, and LVMH (LVMUY 89.37, +1.98, +2.3%) agreed to acquire Tiffany & Co.

The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield declined one basis point to 1.76%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 98.32.

Continue reading Sacha Baron Cohen is the latest powerful voice to misunderstand Section 230Photo by Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagicWelcome back to our discussion about platforms and democracy! I had a great time meetingInterfacereaders last week at the Techonomy conference in Half Moon Bay and the Conference on New Media and Democracy at Tufts University. I also made great progress on a special report I plan to have for you here before the end of the year. But enough prelude   on with today's update. I'm one of the last people you'd expect to hear warning about the danger of conspiracies and lies,  the actor and comedian Sacha Baron Cohen said today in an op-ed in theWashington Post, adapted from last week's viral speech about the dangers of social networks at an Anti-Defamation League conference.In fact, Baron Cohen is exactly the sort of person I'd expect to be warning us about social networks. As a rich celebrity who has no need for the free communication tools they provide, and who can thrive without relying on the promotional benefits that come with active use of the platforms, blasting Big Tech costs Baron Cohen nothing.Meanwhile, few people would have ever even heard of Baron Cohen's speech had it not thrived on social media   first on Twitter, then on YouTube   where social media critiques, particularly of Facebook, have grown increasingly popular. In coming to bury the big platforms, Baron Cohen inadvertently proved their benefit: providing a wide lane for an outsider   in this case, a comedian with no previous experience as a tech pundit   to come in and start a worthwhile discussion.To be sure, Baron Cohen raises some valuable points   and he does so with more nuance and detail than the average  Zuck sucks  Twitter egg in my mentions. (Note the way he cites academic research in his links   a welcome touch.) Baron Cohen is right, for example, about the unique danger of algorithmic recommendations on social platforms   the way they give fringe viewpoints unearned reach, and recruit followers for violent ideologies, most prominently on the far right:The algorithms these platforms depend on deliberately amplify content that keeps users engaged   stories that appeal to our baser instincts and trigger outrage and fear. That's why fake news outperforms real news on social media; studies show lies spread faster than truth.On the Internet, everything can appear equally legitimate. Breitbart resembles the BBC, and the rantings of a lunatic seem as credible as the findings of a Nobel Prize winner. We have lost a shared sense of the basic facts upon which democracy depends.Baron Cohen also picks up on issue we have discussed here quite often in recent months: the fact that large technology companies, thanks to a combination of ignorance and inattention from our elected officials, are essentially accountable to no one, even as their products have unleashed dangerous, rippling butterfly effects the world over:These super-rich  Silicon Six  care more about boosting their share price than about protecting democracy. This is ideological imperialism   six unelected individuals in Silicon Valley imposing their vision on the rest of the world, unaccountable to any government and acting like they're above the reach of law. Surely, instead of letting the Silicon Six decide the fate of the world order, our democratically elected representatives should have at least some say.Amen.Unfortunately, Baron Cohen's proposed solution for making tech platforms accountable is to amend Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act to make Facebook and other sites legally liable for what their users post. He approvingly cites the passage last year of FOSTA-SESTA, an act nominally intended to reduce sex trafficking that was really about scrubbing sexual content off the internet. By all accounts, it has done almost nothing to reduce sex trafficking. Instead, it has forced sex workers to once again rely on abusive pimps and put themselves into unnecessary danger.Websites reacted to the passage of FOSTA-SESTA by overreacting. Once Craigslist could be found legally liable for unwittingly hosting an ad that enabled sex trafficking, it removed all personals from its service altogether. Reddit removed several communities associated with sex work. Several sites that allowed sex workers to vet potential clients shut down entirely.It seems likely that amending Section 230 to introduce what scholars call  intermediary liability  for Facebook et al would play out in much the same way: by over-moderating and censoring speech. In an environment in which democracy is in retreat around the world, and the internet is increasingly controlled by far-right authoritarian governments, the prospect of surging censorship in our communications tools sends a chill down my spine. How will Baron Cohen feel when a government orders the takedown of one of his satires across the entire internet? If 230 disappears, and other countries adopt similar measures, I can't imagine a likelier target.Moreover, it's Section 230 that enables platforms to be more aggressive in pulling down hate speech and abusive content   the outcome that Baron Cohen argues for most passionately in his speech. His argument to eliminate Section 230 protections glosses right over this point, likely because Baron Cohen misunderstands what Section 230 actually does. (See also Mike Masnick on this point.)Those qualms aside, what has stayed with me most about Baron Cohen's speech is the way it captures the new conventional wisdom among left-leaning critics: that Facebook disproportionately benefits the right wing. (Plenty of conservatives believe the exact opposite, of course.)The thought that Facebook empowers the far right is not exactly new. Anxiety that Facebook had become a handmaiden to the conservative movement lay at the root of Cambridge Analytica blowing up into a global scandal in 2018, two years after we knew most of the details. (We knew that Facebook was sharing our data with third parties. What most of us didn't know was that third parties were using that data as part of sophisticated, micro-targeted political influence campaigns.)But there is new evidence of Facebook's material support of the right wing. In theWall Street Journalthis weekend, Deepa Seetharaman profiled James Barnes, who Facebook once embedded in the Trump campaign to help officials there use the company's advertising platform. Barnes, who like a growing number of former Facebook employees experienced a crisis of conscience over the work he did there, revealed that the company had made unusual arrangements to ensure Trump could buy the maximum amount of ads.The profile lays out the extraordinary amount of assistance that Facebook lent Trump. In theory, the same amount of assistance was available to Hillary Clinton, but she declined. Barnes hand-coded custom advertising tools for Trump, ran split tests on advertising copy to see which would be most effective, and offered troubleshooting help whenever asked during what he describes as 12-hour days working on the campaign. He also ensured the company could access a larger line of credit than Facebook had ever previously extended:The Trump campaign needed a large credit line from Facebook, according to Mr. Barnes and others familiar with the situation. This issue posed special challenges. Facebook sometimes extends credit to a select group of digital agencies, but Mr. Parscale's outfit didn't qualify for a large line because it didn't have a track record with Facebook, according to people familiar with the matter. The Trump team also wanted to pay for ads with a credit card, but Facebook's transactions system wasn't set up to handle payments of as much as $300,000 to $400,000 a day on a credit card, according to Mr. Barnes and others familiar with the matter.As employees looked for ways to address the problem, Mr. Parscale texted Mr. Barnes to say Mr. Trump would go on TV and  say Facebook was being unfair to him  if the issue wasn't resolved quickly, Mr. Barnes said. Eventually, Facebook came up with a fix.Of course, it's possible that Facebook bent over backwards for Trump for simple reasons of self-preservation. In an environment where regulation seems increasingly likely, a corporation will naturally seek to make nice with any potential nemesis.Still, the scope of Facebook's aid to the Trump campaign is surprising. And it gives credence to one of the arguments made forcefully by Baron Cohen: that social networks have been far more successful at empowering dangerous reactionaries than they have more progressive forces.In most ways, 2019 was a stellar year for Facebook's business. (Alex Heath has a nice [paywalled!] overview here.) But it was a bad year for Facebook's reputation. And until the company is held accountable for the misuses of its products in some meaningful way, it's hard to see how that will improve. I only hope that when regulation comes, policymakers come up with better solutions than Baron Cohen did.The RatioToday in news that could affect public perception of the big tech platforms.Trending up:Googlechanged its political ad policy last week to limit the ways in which politicians can target potential voters.

USD/JPY:108.63.. EUR/USD:1.1064Long Bond Leads Quiet Monday AdvanceU.S. Treasuries of most tenors began the week with modest gains while the 5-yr note underperformed, finishing just above its flat line. The first session of the week was very quiet, and it followed an overnight affair that was just as subdued. Economic data received overnight painted a mixed picture, as China reported a smaller than expected trade surplus for November (actual $38.73 bln; expected $46.30 bln) while Japan's Q3 GDP growth was revised up to 0.4% from 0.1%. Treasuries started the cash session with modest gains, climbing toward their intraday highs from Friday shortly after the open. However, the rest of the session saw a slow return to today's opening levels. The U.S. Treasury sold $38 bln in 3-yr notes to solid demand, as the high yield stopped through the when issued yield by 0.2 bps while the bid-to-cover ratio and indirect takedown were above average. The U.S. Dollar Index faced some morning pressure but returned to little changed as the day went on, reclaiming its 200-day moving average (97.65) in the process. Yield Check: 2-yr: -1 bp to 1.62% 3-yr: -1 bp to 1.64% 5-yr: UNCH at 1.67% 10-yr: -1 bp to 1.83% 30-yr: -2 bps to 2.26%News: The House of Representatives could vote on the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement on December 18, according to CNBC. The Bank of International Settlements published its latest quarterly review, which noted that structural issues rather than temporary factors were responsible for the mid-September shortage in the funding market that prompted the Fed to begin conducting daily reverse repurchases. The BIS added that liquidity demand from hedge funds exacerbated the funding stress. Financial Times reported that the Chinese government has ordered the removal of all foreign computer equipment and software from government offices. The Bank of Japan will reportedly lower its assessment of industrial production due to prolonged weakness. Former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker died on Sunday. China's November trade surplus totaled $38.73 bln (expected $46.30 bln; last $43.02 bln). Exports fell 1.1% yr/yr (expected 1.0%; last -0.8%) while imports rose 0.3% yr/yr (expected -1.8%; last -6.2%). Japan's Q3 GDP rose 0.4% qtr/qtr (expected 0.2%; last 0.1%), growing 1.8% yr/yr (expected 0.7%; last 0.2%). The latest set of election polls from the U.K. suggest that Conservatives will win majority on Thursday with a margin between 9 and 15 percentage points. Eurozone's December Sentix Investor Confidence rose to 0.7 from -4.5 (expected -4.9). Germany's October trade surplus totaled EUR20.60 bln (expected surplus of EUR19.00 bln; last surplus of EUR19.20 bln). October imports were unchanged m/m (expected -0.1%; last 1.2%) while exports rose 1.2% m/m (expected -0.7%; last 1.5%). $38 bln 3-year Treasury note auction results (prior 12-auction average): High yield: 1.632% (2.059%).

This leaves the market with modest gains ahead of the results of today's $38 bln 3-yr Treasury note auction, the results of which will be released atop the hour. Today's sale will follow last month's solid offering and it comes ahead of a 10-yr note reopening on Tuesday and a 30-yr bond reopening on Thursday. The U.S. Dollar Index remains down 0.1% at 97.64.

Treasuries followed their higher start with an extension of their gains, but a shallow pullback followed in short order. The recent backtracking has all tenors back near their starting levels with the long bond showing relative strength. Equities hover near their flat lines with the S&P 500 defending a two-point gain. Yield Check: 2-yr: UNCH at 1.63% 3-yr: -1 bp to 1.64% 5-yr: -1 bp to 1.66% 10-yr: -2 bps to 1.83% 30-yr: -2 bps to 2.26%08:11 ET10-Yr:+5/32..1.824%.. USD/JPY:108.48.. EUR/USD:1.1076Rebound in ProgressU.S. Treasuries will attempt to snap their three-day skid after Treasury futures inched higher during a quiet overnight session. China reported a smaller than expected trade surplus for November with exports contracting against expectations for an increase. Treasury futures hit pre-market highs around 4:00 ET, and they remain just below those levels at this time. Investors will not receive any economic data today, but the U.S. Treasury will sell $38 bln in 3-yr Treasury notes. The FOMC will hold a policy meeting this week, but it is expected to be a non-event. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% at 97.57.

The cash session started in flat fashion after overnight action saw more of the same. Namely, there was a token headline pointing to "trade optimism" after China's Ministry of Finance announced that some U.S. soybeans, pork, and other commodities will be excluded from tariffs while economic data from Europe showed another drop in Germany's industrial production. Treasuries followed their flat start with a slide to fresh lows for the week after the Employment Situation report for November easily exceeded estimates. However, it wasn't long before the market bounced off lows, finding support near levels from Monday afternoon. Solid U.S. data helped the U.S. Dollar Index climb 0.3% to 97.70 after five days of losses. The Index lost 0.6% for the week but was able to claw back above its 200-day moving average (97.65). Yield Check: 2-yr: +4 bps to 1.63% 3-yr: +6 bps to 1.65% 5-yr: +5 bps to 1.67% 10-yr: +5 bps to 1.84% 30-yr: +4 bps to 2.28%News: The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow forecast for Q4 GDP was increased to 2.0% from 1.5% following the release of the Employment Situation report for November. Bank of Canada Governor, Stephen Poloz, will not seek another term once his current term ends in June 2020. Japan's October Leading Index fell to 91.8 from 92.2 (expected 92.0) while Coincident Indicator decreased 5.6% m/m (last 1.7%). October Household Spending fell 11.5% m/m (expected -9.8%; last 5.5%), contracting 5.1% yr/yr (expected -3.0%; last 9.5%). October Average Cash Earnings increased 0.5% yr/yr (expected 1.1%; last 0.5%). Australia's November AIG Construction Index fell to 40.0 from 43.9. Germany's October Industrial Production fell 1.7% m/m (expected 0.1%; last -0.6%). Italy's October Retail Sales fell 0.2% m/m (expected 0.5%; last 0.6%) but were up 1.0% yr/yr, as expected (last 0.8%). Today's Data: November nonfarm payrolls increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus 182,000) and October nonfarm payrolls revised to 156,000 from 128,000. November private sector payrolls increased by 254,000 (Briefing.com consensus 175,000) while October private sector payrolls revised to 163,000 from 131,000. November unemployment rate was 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%), versus 3.6% in October. The U6 unemployment rate, which accounts for unemployed and underemployed workers, was 6.9%, versus 7.0% in October. November average hourly earnings were up 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.4% (from 0.2%) in October. Over the last 12 months, average hourly earnings have risen 3.1%, versus 3.2% for the 12 months ending in October. The average workweek in November was 34.4 hours (Briefing.com consensus 34.4) versus 34.4 hours in October. The labor force participation rate was 63.2% in November versus 63.3% in October. The preliminary December reading for the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 99.2 from 96.8 in November, hitting the upper end of the range it has been in since the beginning of 2017. The key takeaway from the report is that it bodes well for the consumer spending outlook, as rising levels of consumer sentiment pair nicely with income gains to lend confidence to increased spending activity. Wholesale inventories increased 0.1% m/m in October (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%), on top of a downwardly revised 0.7% decline (from -0.4%) in September, which was the largest decline since February 2016. Wholesale sales were down 0.7% in October after declining 0.1% in September. The key takeaway from the report is that it could prove difficult for wholesalers to gain pricing power given that inventory growth remains well ahead of sales growth on a yr/yr basis. Consumer credit increased by $18.90 bln in October (Briefing.com consensus $17.30 bln) after increasing an upwardly revised $9.60 bln (from $9.50 bln) in September. The key takeaway from the report is that the October increase was fairly evenly distributed between nonrevolving credit like student or auto loans and revolving credit like credit cards.

USD/JPY:108.63.. EUR/USD:1.1064Long Bond Leads Quiet Monday AdvanceU.S. Treasuries of most tenors began the week with modest gains while the 5-yr note underperformed, finishing just above its flat line. The first session of the week was very quiet, and it followed an overnight affair that was just as subdued. Economic data received overnight painted a mixed picture, as China reported a smaller than expected trade surplus for November (actual $38.73 bln; expected $46.30 bln) while Japan's Q3 GDP growth was revised up to 0.4% from 0.1%. Treasuries started the cash session with modest gains, climbing toward their intraday highs from Friday shortly after the open. However, the rest of the session saw a slow return to today's opening levels. The U.S. Treasury sold $38 bln in 3-yr notes to solid demand, as the high yield stopped through the when issued yield by 0.2 bps while the bid-to-cover ratio and indirect takedown were above average. The U.S. Dollar Index faced some morning pressure but returned to little changed as the day went on, reclaiming its 200-day moving average (97.65) in the process. Yield Check: 2-yr: -1 bp to 1.62% 3-yr: -1 bp to 1.64% 5-yr: UNCH at 1.67% 10-yr: -1 bp to 1.83% 30-yr: -2 bps to 2.26%News: The House of Representatives could vote on the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement on December 18, according to CNBC. The Bank of International Settlements published its latest quarterly review, which noted that structural issues rather than temporary factors were responsible for the mid-September shortage in the funding market that prompted the Fed to begin conducting daily reverse repurchases. The BIS added that liquidity demand from hedge funds exacerbated the funding stress. Financial Times reported that the Chinese government has ordered the removal of all foreign computer equipment and software from government offices. The Bank of Japan will reportedly lower its assessment of industrial production due to prolonged weakness. Former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker died on Sunday. China's November trade surplus totaled $38.73 bln (expected $46.30 bln; last $43.02 bln). Exports fell 1.1% yr/yr (expected 1.0%; last -0.8%) while imports rose 0.3% yr/yr (expected -1.8%; last -6.2%). Japan's Q3 GDP rose 0.4% qtr/qtr (expected 0.2%; last 0.1%), growing 1.8% yr/yr (expected 0.7%; last 0.2%). The latest set of election polls from the U.K. suggest that Conservatives will win majority on Thursday with a margin between 9 and 15 percentage points. Eurozone's December Sentix Investor Confidence rose to 0.7 from -4.5 (expected -4.9). Germany's October trade surplus totaled EUR20.60 bln (expected surplus of EUR19.00 bln; last surplus of EUR19.20 bln). October imports were unchanged m/m (expected -0.1%; last 1.2%) while exports rose 1.2% m/m (expected -0.7%; last 1.5%). $38 bln 3-year Treasury note auction results (prior 12-auction average): High yield: 1.632% (2.059%).

This leaves the market with modest gains ahead of the results of today's $38 bln 3-yr Treasury note auction, the results of which will be released atop the hour. Today's sale will follow last month's solid offering and it comes ahead of a 10-yr note reopening on Tuesday and a 30-yr bond reopening on Thursday. The U.S. Dollar Index remains down 0.1% at 97.64.

USD/JPY:108.51.. EUR/USD:1.1074Longer Tenors AheadU.S. Treasuries hover near their opening levels after seeing limited movement during the first two hours of the session. Treasuries followed their higher start with an extension of their gains, but a shallow pullback followed in short order. The recent backtracking has all tenors back near their starting levels with the long bond showing relative strength. Equities hover near their flat lines with the S&P 500 defending a two-point gain. Yield Check: 2-yr: UNCH at 1.63% 3-yr: -1 bp to 1.64% 5-yr: -1 bp to 1.66% 10-yr: -2 bps to 1.83% 30-yr: -2 bps to 2.26%08:11 ET10-Yr:+5/32..1.824%.. USD/JPY:108.48.. EUR/USD:1.1076Rebound in ProgressU.S. Treasuries will attempt to snap their three-day skid after Treasury futures inched higher during a quiet overnight session. China reported a smaller than expected trade surplus for November with exports contracting against expectations for an increase. Treasury futures hit pre-market highs around 4:00 ET, and they remain just below those levels at this time. Investors will not receive any economic data today, but the U.S. Treasury will sell $38 bln in 3-yr Treasury notes. The FOMC will hold a policy meeting this week, but it is expected to be a non-event. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% at 97.57. Yield Check: 2-yr: -2 bps to 1.61% 3-yr: -2 bps to 1.63% 5-yr: -2 bps to 1.65% 10-yr: -2 bps to 1.82% 30-yr: -2 bps to 2.26%News: Financial Times reported that the Chinese government has ordered the removal of all foreign computer equipment and software from government offices.

The cash session started in flat fashion after overnight action saw more of the same. Namely, there was a token headline pointing to "trade optimism" after China's Ministry of Finance announced that some U.S. soybeans, pork, and other commodities will be excluded from tariffs while economic data from Europe showed another drop in Germany's industrial production. Treasuries followed their flat start with a slide to fresh lows for the week after the Employment Situation report for November easily exceeded estimates. However, it wasn't long before the market bounced off lows, finding support near levels from Monday afternoon. Solid U.S. data helped the U.S. Dollar Index climb 0.3% to 97.70 after five days of losses. The Index lost 0.6% for the week but was able to claw back above its 200-day moving average (97.65). Yield Check: 2-yr: +4 bps to 1.63% 3-yr: +6 bps to 1.65% 5-yr: +5 bps to 1.67% 10-yr: +5 bps to 1.84% 30-yr: +4 bps to 2.28%News: The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow forecast for Q4 GDP was increased to 2.0% from 1.5% following the release of the Employment Situation report for November. Bank of Canada Governor, Stephen Poloz, will not seek another term once his current term ends in June 2020. Japan's October Leading Index fell to 91.8 from 92.2 (expected 92.0) while Coincident Indicator decreased 5.6% m/m (last 1.7%). October Household Spending fell 11.5% m/m (expected -9.8%; last 5.5%), contracting 5.1% yr/yr (expected -3.0%; last 9.5%). October Average Cash Earnings increased 0.5% yr/yr (expected 1.1%; last 0.5%). Australia's November AIG Construction Index fell to 40.0 from 43.9. Germany's October Industrial Production fell 1.7% m/m (expected 0.1%; last -0.6%). Italy's October Retail Sales fell 0.2% m/m (expected 0.5%; last 0.6%) but were up 1.0% yr/yr, as expected (last 0.8%). Today's Data: November nonfarm payrolls increased by 266,000 (Briefing.com consensus 182,000) and October nonfarm payrolls revised to 156,000 from 128,000. November private sector payrolls increased by 254,000 (Briefing.com consensus 175,000) while October private sector payrolls revised to 163,000 from 131,000. November unemployment rate was 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.6%), versus 3.6% in October. The U6 unemployment rate, which accounts for unemployed and underemployed workers, was 6.9%, versus 7.0% in October. November average hourly earnings were up 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) after increasing an upwardly revised 0.4% (from 0.2%) in October. Over the last 12 months, average hourly earnings have risen 3.1%, versus 3.2% for the 12 months ending in October. The average workweek in November was 34.4 hours (Briefing.com consensus 34.4) versus 34.4 hours in October. The labor force participation rate was 63.2% in November versus 63.3% in October. The preliminary December reading for the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 99.2 from 96.8 in November, hitting the upper end of the range it has been in since the beginning of 2017. The key takeaway from the report is that it bodes well for the consumer spending outlook, as rising levels of consumer sentiment pair nicely with income gains to lend confidence to increased spending activity. Wholesale inventories increased 0.1% m/m in October (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%), on top of a downwardly revised 0.7% decline (from -0.4%) in September, which was the largest decline since February 2016. Wholesale sales were down 0.7% in October after declining 0.1% in September. The key takeaway from the report is that it could prove difficult for wholesalers to gain pricing power given that inventory growth remains well ahead of sales growth on a yr/yr basis. Consumer credit increased by $18.90 bln in October (Briefing.com consensus $17.30 bln) after increasing an upwardly revised $9.60 bln (from $9.50 bln) in September. The key takeaway from the report is that the October increase was fairly evenly distributed between nonrevolving credit like student or auto loans and revolving credit like credit cards.

It remains unclear whether President Donald Trump will sign the bill.Sometimes-violent protests have occurred in Hong Kong over fears the Chinese government is chipping away at territory's autonomy.Each version of the legislation requires a review each year of Hong Kong's autonomy from mainland China and allows for sanctions against officials responsible for human rights violations in the territory.Meanwhile, The Wall Street Journal reported early Thursday that China's top trade negotiator has invited US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to Beijing for direct talks.Consumer staples led declining sectors, falling more than 0.5%.

All Rights ReservedLength: 989 wordsByline: Brian O'ConnellHighlight: Singles Day is one of the most popular shopping holidays in the world. Here's the backstory behind the big day, which is Nov. 11, 2019.BodyThe U.S. may have Black Friday but in China, another November shopping holiday rules -- Singles Day.Singles Day, a retail shopping holiday invented by  , founder of the China-based online retail platform Alibaba  , is Nov. 11, a day that many Americans will celebrate military veterans, past and present, on Veteran's Day.In 2019, it starts at 11 a.m. ET in the U.S.Tune in and watch Taylor Swift perform at Youku's 11.11 Global Shopping Festival Countdown Gala!    - Alibaba Group (@AlibabaGroup)  Singles Day, known in China as Guanggun Jie or "Single Sticks Holiday," is a big deal for Alibaba and legions of online shoppers.Last year, Singles Day took in approximately  and digital shopping analysts estimate that this year's holiday will rake in $37 billion on goods sold on the Alibaba site within a 24-hour period.That's significantly more than the $12 billion in revenues expected for Black Friday (Nov. 29) this year.A $37 billion take in one shopping day is a blockbuster, and so is the back story behind Singles Day.Let's take a closer look at the biggest shopping holiday in the world.A Brief History of Singles DayAlibaba founded Singles Day after the company got wind of a new trend sweeping China's college campuses in the 1990s -- men celebrating their singlehood. Ma and his executive staff toyed with the idea for years and finally formalized the occasion by marking Nov. 11, 2009, as the first-ever Singles Day. (Nov. 11 jives well with Singles Day -- Alibaba chose the date because the two "1's" in the date signify the single experience.)Strangely enough, Chinese couples have begun ringing in Singles Day with a very un-single like tradition -- getting married. In 2011, for example, 4,000 couples got married in Beijing, China. Compare that to an average of 700 marriages on an average day in the Chinese city.Singles Day is also generating other non-shopping traditions in China. For example, blind date parties are becoming more common on Singles Day, thus morphing the holiday into something of a Valentine's Day, as well.Back on the revenue beat, Alibaba is also getting a great deal of financial mileage out its network of online retail platforms. For example, the company deeply discounted goods on its popular Tmall shopping platform last year and the holiday was an immediate hit. The retail giant crested $7.8 million its first spin around the shopping block.The company has also increasingly relied on U.S.-based celebrities to tout their own product lines on Singles Day.  and Mariah Carey have shilled via live-streaming for Singles Day in the past and this year Kim Kardashian is out promoting Alibaba, Singles Day and her new perfume brand available this year (pre-orders for Kardashian's product -- and about 500,000 other items on the platform -- is allowed.)Live streaming is another big deal on Singles Day -- consumers can tune in knowing that the streaming session will come with discounts on the products advertised. A recent live-stream from Chinese cell phone maker Ziaomi pulled in over 200,000 users in half a day.Financial Growth Every YearFrom a financial perspective, Singles Day is a big winner for  .Since its inception, Singles Day has had double-digit and triple-digit growth. One year even saw a 1,700% gain in revenues (the holiday's second year in 2010.)Here's a closer look at how Singles Day has fared on the revenue side of Alibaba's ledger:Year Revenues Growth Rate Percentage2009: $7 million 2010: $135 million +1700%2011: $75 million +456%2012: $3.04 billion +267%2013: $5.75 billion +83%2014: $9.3 billion +63%2015: $14.3 billion +60%2016: $17.7 billion +32%2017: $25.3 billion +39%2018: $30.7 billion +27%2019: (Est.) $37 billion Clearly, Singles Day has been a big breadwinner for Alibaba, and for other Chinese retailers, as well.For example, JD.com earned $19 billion for its multi-day 6.18 holiday shopping festival in 2017 and Taobao, a China-based shopping mall, earned $3 billion on Singles Day in 2012.At $30.7 billion, 2018 was far and away Alibaba's best Singles Day revenue benchmark.But the holiday revenue's growth rate slowed somewhat during last year's shopping holiday, posting a 25% growth rate. That figure is nothing to sneeze at, but compared to previous years there is no doubt it slowed down. Economists cite the slowing Chinese economy as the reason for slower Singles Day spending growth last year, but do call for a rebound in 2019, with estimated revenues clocking in at $37 billion this year.Singles Day Vs. Black Friday in 2019With the estimated $37 billion in 2019 Singles Day sales, the unofficial Chinese holiday will blow the doors off Black Friday, which is expected to ave sales of $12 billion this year.That's the case even if you combine Cyber Monday and Black Friday sales figures.For example, in 2017, Cyber Monday and Black Friday sales combined for $10.6 billion. But Singles Day more than doubled that amount clocking in at $25.3 billion. Singles Day revenues are also expected to be about five times higher than Amazon Prime Day in 2019, which generated $7.3 billion and sold 175 million products on the Amazon  platform.The Takeaway on Singles DayWhile Nov. 11 officially heralds Singles Day, the Chinese government does not formally recognize Singles Day as a national holiday.But that doesn't matter to tens of millions of Chinese consumers. This year, they'll be lining up to buy smart phones, televisions, blue jeans, and even cars and trucks (yes, Alibaba sells those too.)You don't have to be single to get in on the action on Singles Day (although there's more to do than just shop if you're solo.) All you need is credit or debit card, a smartphone or computer, and a hunger for snagging deeply discounted deals.That's the main attraction of Singles Day and this year, more shoppers than ever will be partaking in the festivities, thus marking the largest Single's Day in the holiday's brief, but profitable, history.Load-Date: November 11, 2019End of Document

Newly Leaked Documents Shed Additional Light On China's Mass Detention CampsThe FrontrunnerNovember 25, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 Bulletin News Network, Inc.Section: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 172 wordsBodyThe New York Times (11/24, Ramzy, Buckley, 18.61M) reports six internal documents have been obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, shedding "new light on China's crackdown in the Xinjiang region, where a million or more ethnic Uighurs, Kazakhs and others have been detained in the past three years." The leak of "the 24 pages of documents amounts to a second significant leak from inside China's ruling Communist Party related to the crackdown." According to the article, "while the source of the new documents is unknown - they were provided by Uighur overseas networks - their disclosure may amount to another sign of dissent in the party over the crackdown."The AP (11/24) reports the classified documents "lay out the Chinese government's deliberate strategy to lock up ethnic minorities even before they commit a crime, to rewire their thoughts and the language they speak." The documents "also show how Beijing is pioneering a new form of social control using data and artificial intelligence."Load-Date: November 25, 2019End of Document

All rights reserved.This content is provided to LexisNexis by Comtex News Network, Inc.Length: 16200 wordsBodyHourly In Play (R)Updated: 19-Nov-19 14:00 ET13:49LOW Lowe's: Earnings Preview -- Disappointing report from Home Depot is casting a shadow over Lowe's earnings (113.16 -1.86)Lowe's (LOW) is set to report Q3 (Oct) earnings results tomorrow before the open (last quarter they released at 6:00 ET) with a conference call to follow at 9am ET. LOW has reported EPS upside in four of the past five quarters.The CapitalIQ consensus estimate for Q3 EPS is $1.35. The revenue consensus estimate is $17.69 bln. Note: LOW typically guides for revenue, EPS and comps in the press release for the full year. Its current full year guidance is for adjusted EPS of $5.45-5.65 while sales are expected to increase +2%. It'll be important to see if the company reaffirms or changes this guidance. Same store comps are always a key metric for Lowe's. In Q2 (Jul), comps came in at +2.3% and +3.2% for the US home improvement business. Home Depot (HD) is always a key barometer as to what to expect from Lowe's. HD was not super impressive as comps underwhelmed and HD lowered full year guidance. It's not all doom and gloom for Lowe's because HD cited some internal initiatives that are taking longer to materialize, so much of it may be company-specific and not industry-wide problems. Specifically, HD was emphatic on the call that it "sees a strong and engaged customer" and that "housing is healthy and stable." Another area to watch is tariffs. HD said that tariffs are having an impact but are manageable as its merchants have done a good job at mitigating the impact. Aside from the Home Depot angle, another aspect to this earnings report will be progress on Lowe's turnaround. Despite having a similar number of stores, Lowe's is dwarfed by Home Depot (HD) in terms of annual revenue ($72 bln vs $111 bln for HD) and HD holds a sizeable profitability gap. Lowe's wants to improve merchandising availability, to improve its digital presence/app, to increase the use of self-check-out lanes and cut worker hours to boost productivity. It'll be interesting to get an update on its progress. Overall, our sense is that the weak comps/guidance from Home Depot has lowered expectations for Lowe's this quarter. However, with Lowe's, we think investors are more focused on the bigger picture, namely how is the turnaround going.13:42TPX Tempur Sealy Int'l: US ITC determines mattresses from China injure US industry; Department of Commerce will issue antidumping duty order on imports of this product from China (85.44 -1.05)The United States International Trade Commission (USITC) today determined that a U.S. industry is materially injured by reason of imports of mattresses from China that the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) has determined are sold in the United States at less than fair value. As a result of the USITC's affirmative determination, Commerce will issue an antidumping duty order on imports of this product from China. ITC Release13:15ABMD Abiomed says Abiomed medical office is issuing publication review of observational analysis of Impella that was presented by Amin et al. at the American Heart Association Conference on November 17 (186.19 +8.10)According to the company, the AHA analysis is flawed because:The data source has significant limitations, containing just a fraction of Impella patients and unable to delineate between common adverse events.The Impella patients were much sicker and had greater baseline and procedural risks.The analysis excluded the costliest IABP patients who were escalated to other therapies.Additionally, the conclusion is aggressive because administrative coding data cannot delineate between adverse events common to high-risk patients and device related events.13:08SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: ACB (37.93 mln +2.94%), TEVA (22.61 mln +0.97%), BMY (19.42 mln -1.7%), CELG (13.89 mln -0.93%), CLVS (13.81 mln +6.23%)Industrials: GE (17.95 mln -0.6%)Consumer Discretionary: M (32.83 mln -10.04%), ROKU (21.57 mln -1.82%), KSS (19.77 mln -18.61%), NIO (18.01 mln +3.06%), F (17.54 mln -0.28%)Information Technology: AMD (54.78 mln +2.61%), NOK (20.12 mln -0.72%)Financials: BAC (17.88 mln -0.27%)Energy: CHK (55.18 mln -8.31%), ET (13.13 mln -1.99%), ECA (12.04 mln -4.56%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: MDCO (6.75x +19.55%), CRSP (5.7x +16.03%), EDIT (3.67x +11.4%), ATNX (3.12x +34.53%), CELG (2.97x -0.93%), NTLA (2.83x +12.13%)Materials: ASH (3.23x -4.14%)Industrials: WWD (3.27x -0.37%)Consumer Discretionary: KSS (6.3x -18.61%), HD (3.61x -5.23%)Information Technology: JKS (4.05x +12.71%)Financials: EFC (18.2x -3.03%), GBDC (3.31x +1.91%)Consumer Staples: CHEF (3.43x -8.38%)Utilities: DUK (3.42x -1.97%), ELP (3.22x +2.42%)13:06SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: ATNX (15.39 +34.53%), MDCO (70.12 +19.55%), BCRX (2 +17.35%), CRSP (67.92 +16.03%), NTLA (15.25 +12.13%), DRNA (23.87 +11.59%), EDIT (25.79 +11.4%), ARQL (8.4 +10.67%), APHA (4.21 +10.08%), TCDA (37.66 +9.92%), BOLD (28.08 +9.9%), WVE (31.02 +8.58%), TBIO (10.45 +8.52%), ASND (115.61 +8.07%), GLYC (6.18 +8.04%), AMRX (3.05 +7.6%), PRQR (6.71 +7.36%), PRTA (10.99 +7.28%)Information Technology: JKS (16.76 +12.71%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: VAPO (10.77 -7.08%)Industrials: BLDP (6.52 -10.19%)Consumer Discretionary: KSS (47.53 -18.61%), M (15.19 -10.04%), SIG (15.7 -8.61%)Financials: PPDF (2.5 -12.89%), JT (1.86 -10.39%), YRD (5.51 -9.97%)Energy: KLXE (5.44 -26.19%), UNT (0.72 -11.3%), CRC (7.58 -10.67%), ESV (3.82 -8.95%), SPN (0.33 -8.45%), CHK (0.59 -8.31%), EXTN (6.31 -7.82%), TUSK (1.38 -7.38%), PVAC (24.25 -7.35%)Consumer Staples: CHEF (32.57 -8.38%), DF (0.07 -7.5%)12:57WRAPX Midday Market Summary: Stock market trades mixed; Home Depot, Kohl's weigh on retail spaceThe S&P 500 is currently down 0.1% in midday action, with weakness concentrated in the retail space following disappointing quarterly results and guidance from Home Depot (HD 226.39, -12.46, -5.2%) and Kohl's (KSS 47.58, -10.82, -18.5%).The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.4%, but the Nasdaq Composite (+0.2%) and Russell 2000 (+0.4%) trade higher.The underperformance of the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 44.12, -0.71, -1.6%) best displays the negative sentiment that has subsumed the retail industry today. Both the Dow and S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (-0.8%), meanwhile, can attribute their underperformance to Home Depot.The S&P 500 energy sector (-1.1%) is down even more amid a sharp decline in oil prices ($55.69, -1.45, -2.5%), but the market isn't getting concerned about the U.S. consumer based on a couple of reports. Instead, the market is hanging in there amid gains in the heavily-weighted health care (+0.3%), information technology (+0.1%), and financials (+0.1%) sectors.The consensus among many investors is that the market is due for a pullback, but the absence of one has created a sort of pain trade for investors fearful of missing out on further gains. The S&P 500 was down just 0.3% at its low earlier today before a buy-the-dip effort briefly brought it back above its flat line.Separately, shares of AT&T (T 37.65, -1.99) are down 5.0% after the stock was downgraded to Sell from Neutral at MoffettNathanson with a price target of $30. Shares of Slack (WORK 20.88, -2.24, -9.7%) are down 10% on news that Microsoft's (MSFT 150.99, +0.65, +0.4%) competitive product, Teams, has increased daily active users by nearly 50% since July.In the Treasury market, demand for longer-dated bonds has caused some minor curve-flattening activity. The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.79%. The U.S. Dollar Index is flat at 97.79.Today's economic calendar was limited to Housing Starts and Building Permits for October:Total housing starts increased 3.8% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.314 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.300 million) while total building permits increased 5.0% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.461 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.365 million).There was a sizable jump in starts (+8.6%) and permits (+8.2%) for multi-unit dwellings, yet the key takeaway from the report is that starts (+2.0%) and permits (+3.2%) increased for single-family units in an inventory-constrained environment for single-family homes.12:45MRK Merck increases quarterly dividend to $0.61 from $0.55/share (84.21 +0.08)12:25SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Myovant Sciences (MYOV) gains on Phase 3 relugolix data -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersMYOV (10.86 +79.21%): Announced results from the Phase 3 HERO study of once-daily, oral relugolix in men with advanced prostate cancer; the trial met its primary efficacy endpoint and all six key secondary endpoints -- in the primary endpoint responder analysis, 96.7% of men receiving the relugolix regimen achieved sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels through 48 weeks. These results, noted co, support NDA submission to the FDA in Q2 of 2020 and future regulatory submissions in Europe and Japan. Jumps to six-month highs. ATNX (15.12 +32.12%): Moves to its highest levels since August after previewing its presentation at the 2019 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium; co's abstract for the Phase 3 study of oral paclitaxel and encequidar in metastatic breast cancer has been selected for the conference's press program. DRNA (23.72 +10.89%): Price target raised to $30 from $22 at H.C. Wainwright, citing a positive view of co's new strategic alliance with Novo Nordisk (NVO), which was announced yesterday; the firm views the deal as underscoring a "Burgeoning RNAi Powerhouse." Continued strength sees the stock touch up to new four-year highs.Small Cap LosersI (6.19 -22.91%): Continued weakness following FCC Chairman Ajit Pai's announcement midday yesterday of support for a public auction of 280 megahertz of the C-band spectrum; the C-Band Alliance, a satellite operator group of which co is a member, issued a statement yesterday following the Chairman's communication, noting, among other comments, that the announcement "does not address the critical involvement of the incumbent satellite operators in executing the complex task of reconfiguring and transitioning their networks." Following yesterday's developments, the stock was downgraded to In-Line from Outperform at Evercore ISI, which also cut co's price target to $11 from $38; JPMorgan lowered co's target to $9 from $22. Wells Fargo noted that embrace of a public auction "does not seem to offer much potential capital to the satellite players" and also noted the impact that the public approach will have on timing, saying, "Getting this spectrum auctioned off in 1H 2020 (as the C-Band Alliance plan had outlined) seems naively optimistic at this point." The stock again records new 52-week lows, now down circa 76% month-to-date. PPDF (2.53 -11.85%): Missed estimates for Q3 EPS and revs (+35.0% yr/yr to RMB1.51 bln). Cumulative registered users increased to approx. 102.8 mln while cumulative number of borrowers reached 17.4 mln as of September 30; number of unique borrowers increased +28.6% yr/yr. Co expects total loan origination volume between RMB16-19 bln for Q4. Co also noted that it plans to discontinue its online information intermediary business between individual borrowers and individual investors. At all-time lows. PLUG (3.33 -11.12%): Pulls back from yesterday's four-year highs with above average volume; factoring in today's move, the stock continues to trade higher by circa +26% month-to-date.11:59SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (95) outpacing new lows (63) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: AAPL, AES, AGEN, AIZ, ALL, AMD, AME, AMED, ANSS, AON, APD, ARDX, ARMK, ARVN, ARWR, ATEC, ATRS, AVGO, AZO, BIO, BIP, BLDR, BLK, BLMN, BRO, CACI, CATM, CDE, CDW, CLH, CPRT, CRSP, CSGS, CSL, CVNA, CZR, DEA, DEI, DKS, DOX, DRNA, DXCM, EIDX, EPAM, ESE, EVRI, EW, FISV, FNF, FTNT, GLIBA, GPN, HALO, HIG, INFO, INOV, INST, KMX, KRG, KRTX, LDOS, LIN, LPT, LULU, LXP, LZB, MCO, MDCO, MGM, MMC, MSCI, MSFT, NSIT, OC, PFSI, PLMR, PRFT, RDN, RLI, SEM, SHOO, SPGI, TDY, TJX, TMO, TROW, TRU, UI, USB, VAC, VRTX, XBIT, XPEL, XRX, ZYMEStocks that traded to 52 week lows: AM, AR, ASIX, BCEI, BIG, BTU, BXC, CDEV, CEIX, CHK, CNP, CPS, CRZO, CTRA, CVEO, DCP, ENBL, ENLC, EQM, ETRN, EXPE, EXTN, EZPW, FLNT, FOSL, FPRX, FTSI, GLOG, GLOP, GSM, GTE, GTLS, I, IIVI, KLXE, LBRT, MDR, MPLX, NEWM, NVEE, OAS, PAA, PAGP, PBT, PNNT, PRMW, QUAD, RBBN, RVLV, SDRL, SINA, SMLP, SNH, TCO, TCS, TDW, TH, TRIP, UPWK, VG, VNOM, WES, WLLThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: CABO, FWONA, IHC, LACQ, NWPX, PLOW, WDFCETFs that traded to 52 week highs: CUT, DIA, EWC, EWG, EWQ, EZU, FAN, GREK, IAI, IOO, ITA, IWF, IYF, IYG, IYH, IYJ, KCE, OEF, QQQ, SPY, UYG, VGK, VTI, XLKETFs that traded to 52 week lows: AMJ, VXX, XES11:53TALKX Market Briefing: Price action getting technicalThere hasn't been a lot of conviction in the morning session, evidenced by an S&P 500 that is basically unchanged through the first two hours of trading.Retail stocks have been a notable pocket of weakness following the disappointments from Home Depot (HD 226.88, -11.98, -5.0%) and Kohl's (KSS 48.21, -10.19, -17.5%). Their weakness has acted as a weight on the broader market, yet the movement of the S&P 500 index has been largely a function of technical price action.Briefing.com's Technical Take page identified 3127 as a secondary resistance level for the S&P 500. That level was tested with the opening move (3127.64) but quickly failed as steady selling eventually dropped the S&P 500 back to 3113.46 at this morning's low, which was reached just before 11:00 a.m. ET. That level fell within a secondary support level (3115/3112) that was also identified on the Technical Take Page.Traders, therefore, appear to be respecting these technical boundaries for now on a day that is devoid of any major macro news drivers, particularly as they relate to trade, and as it is suggested that the market is short-term overextended and due for a pullback.The Russell 2000 is up 0.4%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.3%; the S&P 500 is unchanged; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.4%.11:51QCOM Qualcomm issues 3 year targets at Analyst Day (88.73 -1.78)From CFO's presentation at Analyst Day:3 year targets as earnings mix shift to QCT from QTLRevenue: QCT segment SAM: 10% CAGR, grow faster than SAM and Apple product revenues QTL: current run rate + Huawei resolution Operating margin: QCT grows to >20%; QTL: ~70%Summarizing Qualcomm opportunities: Mature handset industry and current macroeconomic environment; Accelerated 5G migration compared to 4G; Mobile handset platform: 4G->5G transition, RF Front-End growth; Growth beyond mobile: Auto, IoT, Compute, ADAS, Cloud/Edge AI 75+ 5G licenses including key anchor agreements.Grow earnings faster than revenues.

The ACHIEVE II trial evaluated ubrogepant 50 mg and 25 mg, compared with placebo, across a wide range of clinical endpoints, including the co-primary endpoints of pain freedom (no pain) and freedom from the most bothersome migraine-associated symptom at two hours post-initial dose. For the two co-primary endpoints, ubrogepant 50 mg and 25 mg showed statistically significant higher response rates for pain freedom at two hours (21.8% for 50 mg, 20.7% for 25 mg and 14.3% for placebo), and the 50 mg dose demonstrated statistically significant higher response rates for the freedom from the most bothersome migraine-associated symptom at two hours (38.9% for 50 mg and 27.4% for placebo). Additionally, ubrogepant 50 mg was statistically superior to placebo in the absence of light sensitivity (43.8% for 50 mg and 35.5% for placebo) and sound sensitivity (54.1% for 50 mg and 46.3% for placebo).FDA action on the NDA for ubrogepant is expected in December 2019, potentially making it the first oral CGRP to address unmet patient needs in acute treatment of migraine and the first FDA-approved gepant.11:21XLE Sector Briefing: Energy (58.71 -0.65)The energy sector (-1.1%) sits at the bottom of today's sector standings after showing relative weakness yesterday. The growth-sensitive sector is now down 2.4% since Friday versus a much more modest 0.1% week-to-date downtick in the S&P 500. Factors contributing to the underperformance:Notable pressure on crude oil. The energy component is down more than $1.00 today (-2.3%) and down $2.01 (-3.5%) since Friday's settlement. This has sent the price of oil beneath its 200-day moving average (57.37) with the 50-day average (55.65) looming just below. Tax-loss related selling. The energy sector has been the weakest performer of 2019, meaning the group contains a fair share of names that have underperformed since the end of 2018. These names are more likely to be sold before the end of 2019 as investors look to reduce some of the tax impact of taking capital gains this year.Notable movers:HollyFrontier (HFC 51.56, -2.35, -4.4%): falling to its lowest level since early October. The company announced a new project and a new buyback authorization yesterday morning. Noble Energy (NBL 19.41, -0.51, -2.6%): nearing its 2019 low after finding resistance at its 50-day moving average (21.34) at the end of last week.

That corner is the retail industry, which has been broadsided today by disappointing earnings/sales results and guidance from Home Depot (HD 226.60, -12.25, -5.1%) and Kohl's (KSS 48.09, -10.31, -17.7%).The weakness in HD is having an outsized impact on the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (-0.9%); meanwhile, the combined impact of the disappointments from these well-known retailers is creating some angst about consumer spending activity entering the all-important holiday selling season.That angst is showing up in a sympathy trade that has knocked down the prices of many other retail stocks today, like Macy's (M 15.36, -1.51, -9.0%), Best Buy (BBY 75.61, -1.68, -2.2%), and Gap (GPS 16.62, -0.68, -3.9%) to name a few. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.97, -0.85, -1.9%) reflects the broader trend of underperformance for the retailers in today's market action.Those issues notwithstanding, the broader market is still holding up just fine as it is drawing influential support from the information technology (+0.3%), healthcare (+0.3%), and financial (+0.2%) sectors, which continue to attract interest from value and growth-minded investors alike.Separately, the market's overall resilience to selling pressure remains a tying factor for a number of participants who are fearful of missing out on further gains. That fear, ostensibly, is lending some buying support that has kept downside pressure in check.The Russell 2000 is up 0.2%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.1%; the S&P 500 is down 0.1%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%.10:00XLY Sector Briefing: Consumer Discretionary (120.74 -1.05)The consumer discretionary sector (-0.8%) represents an early pocket of relative weakness in a flat market. This makes for a continuation of this month's underperformance, which has the sector trading down 0.3% since the end of October versus a 2.8% gain in the S&P 500. Factors contributing to today's underperformance:Home Depot's (HD 227.72, -11.13, -4.7%) Q3 earnings report, which showed lower than expected revenue and lowered comparable sales guidance for FY20. Granted, Home Depot met Q3 EPS expectations, but the revenue shortfall and lowered comparable sales guidance have pressured the stock from a record high. Furthermore, the outlook is leading to some questions about the overall strength of consumer spending. Disappointing Q3 results and lowered FY20 guidance from Kohl's (KSS 48.86, -9.54, -16.4%), fueling worries that other apparel retailers could also report underwhelming results.Notable movers:Home Depot (HD 227.72, -11.13, -4.7%): falling back below its 50-day moving average (232.37) after setting a fresh record high on Monday. Kohl's (KSS 48.86, -9.54, -16.4%): falling to its lowest level in more than a month in response to weaker than expected quarterly results. Macy's (M 15.35, -1.53, -9.0%): sliding back below its 50-day moving average (15.76) after weak results from Kohl's. Nordstrom (JWN 35.10, -2.78, -7.3%): falling below its 200-day moving average (36.33) and toward its 50-day moving average (34.94) in sympathy with Kohl's. Gap (GPS 16.70, -0.60, -3.4%): approaching its October low after Kohl's disappointing results. TJX (TJX 60.68, +1.13, +1.9%): touched a fresh record after better than expected Q3 results overshadowed below-consensus Q4 EPS guidance. Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL 119.72, +1.32, +1.1%): bucking the overall trend in the sector.09:46SCANX Earnings mvoersJKS +13.79% WUBA +7.04% NJR +3.91% CRMT +3.57% TJX +2.82% DAVA +2.24% ASND +2.07% ESE +1.57%KSS -15.96% PPDF -7.14% HD -5.30% ASH -4.63% MMS -2.59% BILI -2.32% WWD -2.00% ZTO -1.29% KRNT -1.30% TDG -0.78% ALV -0.56% MDT -0.36%09:41WRAPX Opening Market Summary: Stock market opens slightly higher, retail dragsThe major indices open slightly higher at new all-time highs. The S&P 500 is up 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.3%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows financials (+0.4%) and information technology (+0.3%) leading the early advance. Conversely, the utilities (-0.6%) and consumer discretionary (-0.4%) sectors underperform, with the latter pressured by Home Depot (HD 228.90, -9.94, -4.2%) following its earnings results and guidance.The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 44.37, -0.45, -1.0%) is being dragged lower by shares of Kohl's (KSS 49.48, -8.86, -15.1%) after the company missed earnings estimates and lowered its FY20 EPS below consensus.U.S. Treasuries are little changed. The 2-yr yield is up one basis point to 1.60%, and the 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.80%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 97.79. WTI crude is down 1.9% to $56.06/bbl.09:29WIRES On The WiresOmeros (OMER) announced new findings on GPR174, its novel cancer immunotherapy target, demonstrating that GPR174-deficiency enhances anti-tumor immune responses in animals.

Potential headwinds include lower inflator replacement sales and higher depreciation and amortization. Considering these potential tailwinds and headwinds we expect a year over year improvement in adjusted operating margin*, absent unforeseen events."09:14WRAPX S&P futures vs fair value: +7.60.

In the primary endpoint responder analysis, 96.7% (95% CI: 94.9%, 97.9%) of men receiving once-daily, oral relugolix achieved sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels. A responder was defined as achieving and maintaining testosterone suppression to less than or equal to 50 ng/dL from Week 5 through Week 48. For the study to be successful, the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of the response rate had to be at least 90%.The study achieved all six key secondary endpoints, including superiority to leuprolide acetate on rapid suppression of testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA), all with p-values <0.0001.Five key secondary endpoints demonstrated superiority to leuprolide acetate, including rapid suppression of testosterone at Day 4 and Day 15, profound suppression of testosterone at Day 15, rapid suppression of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at Day 15, and suppression of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) at Week 24 (all p-values <0.0001). In addition, relugolix demonstrated non-inferiority to leuprolide acetate on sustained testosterone suppression through 48 weeks (96.7% vs. 88.8%, respectively) with a between-group difference of 7.9% (95% CI: 4.1%,11.8%), the primary endpoint required for regulatory submissions outside of the U.S. In addition, the pharmacodynamic results showed no testosterone flare after initiation of relugolix and mean testosterone levels returned to normal levels within 90 days after treatment discontinuation.A New Drug Application (NDA) submission is expected in the second quarter of 2020.A conference call and webcast are to be held today at 8:30 a.m. EST / 5:30 a.m. PST.07:32SRRK Scholar Rock announces preliminary pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic results from the TOPAZ Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial of SRK-015 for the treatment of patients with spinal muscular atrophy (7.20 )The planned preliminary PK/PD analysis, which includes data from 29 patients with SMA across all three cohorts, showed dose-proportional drug exposure and demonstrated target engagement, as evidenced by dose-dependent increases of up to 100-fold in the serum levels of latent myostatin following SRK-015 treatment (2 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg doses).

Khoury, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of KLX Energy Services commented, "Contemporaneously with the abrupt decline in activity, we took steps to align our business with current customer demand. Specifically, we implemented an approximate 17 percent reduction in force, as compared with the Company's July 31, 2019 staffing levels, consistent with the approximate 18 percent sequential quarterly decline in our third quarter revenues. We aggressively cut costs in every area of our business, and we warm stacked the vast majority of our Permian based wireline assets. As a result of these and other measures, we expect to take a third quarter charge of approximately $13 million. Notwithstanding the precipitous decline in industry conditions, we generated approximately $44 million in cash flow from operations and approximately $31 million in free cash flow, bringing our cash balance to approximately $121 million for the quarter ended October 31, 2019. In addition, our $100 million credit facility remains undrawn.""The abrupt deterioration in industry conditions, which accelerated through the end of our third quarter, was driven by a sharp sequential quarterly decline in U.S. land rig count and an unprecedented decline in active frac spreads from the second quarter to the third quarter. In fact, there was a significant sequential decline in hydraulic fracturing activity during each month of the third quarter. The decline in Exploration & Production activity resulted in lower demand levels and lower current and expected revenues for our business, which led the Company to accelerate its annual testing for asset impairment into the third quarter. While the Company has not yet completed this analysis, we expect to report a non-cash asset impairment charge in the range of approximately $45 million to $60 million. The Company is in the process of finalizing the actual amount of the impairment charge, which will be completed prior to reporting its third quarter financial results."06:00CEO CNOOC Ltd names President Xu Keqiang as CEO (152.50 )06:00TRP TC Energy to provide financial update and review strategic plans at Investor Day, reaffirms expectation to grow common share dividend at an annual rate of 8-10% through 2021 (51.44 )"Our $100 billion portfolio of high-quality, long-life energy infrastructure assets are expected to generate record financial results again in 2019 underpinned by strong market fundamentals," said Russ Girling, TC Energy's president and chief executive officer. "Looking forward, we continue to advance $30 billion of commercially secured projects that will expand and extend our asset footprint across North America."As those projects enter service, TC Energy expects comparable earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to exceed $10 billion in 2022. This represents an increase of more than 16 per cent when compared to comparable EBITDA of $8.6 billion in 2018 despite significant asset sales that have accelerated the strengthening of the company's balance sheet. Notably, approximately 95 per cent of comparable EBITDA is expected to come from regulated assets or long-term contracts. At the same time, the company continues to methodically advance more than $20 billion of projects under development including Keystone XL and the Bruce Power life extension program. Success in advancing these and other organic growth opportunities that are expected to emanate from TC Energy's five operating businesses across North America would add to the company's growth outlook."Based on the confidence we have in our business plans, we are reaffirming that we expect to grow our common share dividend at an annual rate of eight to 10 per cent through 2021," added Girling. "Our dividend outlook is supported by expected growth in earnings and cash flow and in line with our historically strong dividend coverage ratios."06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- World markets continue climb higher; US Futures in record territoryThe global equity markets are mostly higher once again with US Futures venturing into all-time high territory for a second straight night.

The Russell 2000 (-0.3%) closed in negative territory.The day began with the market digesting a tweet from a China-based CNBC reporter, who said she was informed by a Chinese government source that Beijing is pessimistic about a trade deal because President Trump hasn't supported a tariff rollback. Based on the modest losses and ensuing price action, the market presumably remained optimistic about a Phase One agreement.The large-cap indices eased their way into positive territory thanks to the turnarounds in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (+0.3%), information technology (+0.3%), and communication services (+0.3%) sectors. Consistent leaders included the consumer staples (+0.5%) and real estate (+0.5%) sectors, as the negative-sounding trade headline likely fostered some conservative-minded interest.The trade-sensitive industrials (-0.3%) and materials (-0.2%) sectors were among today's laggards, but their losses were small compared to the 1.3% drop in the energy sector, which was pressured by the decline in oil prices ($57.04, -0.71, -1.2%).Generally, there wasn't any concerted effort to sell a market trading at all-time highs, but investors weren't eager to embrace risk, either. The trend has been positive, which has likely drawn in some reluctant investors into the market, and today simply may have been a natural breather for a market breaking out to new highs.Notable corporate news included HP Inc. (HPQ 20.01, -0.17, -0.8%) turning down the takeover bid from Xerox (XRX 39.30, +0.36, +0.9%). HP remained open to a deal, though. Netflix (NFLX 302.57, +7.54, +2.6%) shares outperformed on speculation that either Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman built a large stake in the company.U.S. Treasuries extended last week's advance, pushing yields slightly lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points to 1.81%.

LOW has reported EPS upside in four of the past five quarters.The CapitalIQ consensus estimate for Q3 EPS is $1.35. The revenue consensus estimate is $17.69 bln. Note: LOW typically guides for revenue, EPS and comps in the press release for the full year. Its current full year guidance is for adjusted EPS of $5.45-5.65 while sales are expected to increase +2%. It'll be important to see if the company reaffirms or changes this guidance. Same store comps are always a key metric for Lowe's. In Q2 (Jul), comps came in at +2.3% and +3.2% for the US home improvement business. Home Depot (HD) is always a key barometer as to what to expect from Lowe's. HD was not super impressive as comps underwhelmed and HD lowered full year guidance. It's not all doom and gloom for Lowe's because HD cited some internal initiatives that are taking longer to materialize, so much of it may be company-specific and not industry-wide problems. Specifically, HD was emphatic on the call that it "sees a strong and engaged customer" and that "housing is healthy and stable." Another area to watch is tariffs. HD said that tariffs are having an impact but are manageable as its merchants have done a good job at mitigating the impact. Aside from the Home Depot angle, another aspect to this earnings report will be progress on Lowe's turnaround. Despite having a similar number of stores, Lowe's is dwarfed by Home Depot (HD) in terms of annual revenue ($72 bln vs $111 bln for HD) and HD holds a sizeable profitability gap. Lowe's wants to improve merchandising availability, to improve its digital presence/app, to increase the use of self-check-out lanes and cut worker hours to boost productivity. It'll be interesting to get an update on its progress. Overall, our sense is that the weak comps/guidance from Home Depot has lowered expectations for Lowe's this quarter. However, with Lowe's, we think investors are more focused on the bigger picture, namely how is the turnaround going.13:42TPX Tempur Sealy Int'l: US ITC determines mattresses from China injure US industry; Department of Commerce will issue antidumping duty order on imports of this product from China (85.44 -1.05)The United States International Trade Commission (USITC) today determined that a U.S. industry is materially injured by reason of imports of mattresses from China that the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) has determined are sold in the United States at less than fair value. As a result of the USITC's affirmative determination, Commerce will issue an antidumping duty order on imports of this product from China. ITC Release13:15ABMD Abiomed says Abiomed medical office is issuing publication review of observational analysis of Impella that was presented by Amin et al. at the American Heart Association Conference on November 17 (186.19 +8.10)According to the company, the AHA analysis is flawed because:The data source has significant limitations, containing just a fraction of Impella patients and unable to delineate between common adverse events.The Impella patients were much sicker and had greater baseline and procedural risks.The analysis excluded the costliest IABP patients who were escalated to other therapies.Additionally, the conclusion is aggressive because administrative coding data cannot delineate between adverse events common to high-risk patients and device related events.13:08SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: ACB (37.93 mln +2.94%), TEVA (22.61 mln +0.97%), BMY (19.42 mln -1.7%), CELG (13.89 mln -0.93%), CLVS (13.81 mln +6.23%)Industrials: GE (17.95 mln -0.6%)Consumer Discretionary: M (32.83 mln -10.04%), ROKU (21.57 mln -1.82%), KSS (19.77 mln -18.61%), NIO (18.01 mln +3.06%), F (17.54 mln -0.28%)Information Technology: AMD (54.78 mln +2.61%), NOK (20.12 mln -0.72%)Financials: BAC (17.88 mln -0.27%)Energy: CHK (55.18 mln -8.31%), ET (13.13 mln -1.99%), ECA (12.04 mln -4.56%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: MDCO (6.75x +19.55%), CRSP (5.7x +16.03%), EDIT (3.67x +11.4%), ATNX (3.12x +34.53%), CELG (2.97x -0.93%), NTLA (2.83x +12.13%)Materials: ASH (3.23x -4.14%)Industrials: WWD (3.27x -0.37%)Consumer Discretionary: KSS (6.3x -18.61%), HD (3.61x -5.23%)Information Technology: JKS (4.05x +12.71%)Financials: EFC (18.2x -3.03%), GBDC (3.31x +1.91%)Consumer Staples: CHEF (3.43x -8.38%)Utilities: DUK (3.42x -1.97%), ELP (3.22x +2.42%)13:06SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: ATNX (15.39 +34.53%), MDCO (70.12 +19.55%), BCRX (2 +17.35%), CRSP (67.92 +16.03%), NTLA (15.25 +12.13%), DRNA (23.87 +11.59%), EDIT (25.79 +11.4%), ARQL (8.4 +10.67%), APHA (4.21 +10.08%), TCDA (37.66 +9.92%), BOLD (28.08 +9.9%), WVE (31.02 +8.58%), TBIO (10.45 +8.52%), ASND (115.61 +8.07%), GLYC (6.18 +8.04%), AMRX (3.05 +7.6%), PRQR (6.71 +7.36%), PRTA (10.99 +7.28%)Information Technology: JKS (16.76 +12.71%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: VAPO (10.77 -7.08%)Industrials: BLDP (6.52 -10.19%)Consumer Discretionary: KSS (47.53 -18.61%), M (15.19 -10.04%), SIG (15.7 -8.61%)Financials: PPDF (2.5 -12.89%), JT (1.86 -10.39%), YRD (5.51 -9.97%)Energy: KLXE (5.44 -26.19%), UNT (0.72 -11.3%), CRC (7.58 -10.67%), ESV (3.82 -8.95%), SPN (0.33 -8.45%), CHK (0.59 -8.31%), EXTN (6.31 -7.82%), TUSK (1.38 -7.38%), PVAC (24.25 -7.35%)Consumer Staples: CHEF (32.57 -8.38%), DF (0.07 -7.5%)12:57WRAPX Midday Market Summary: Stock market trades mixed; Home Depot, Kohl's weigh on retail spaceThe S&P 500 is currently down 0.1% in midday action, with weakness concentrated in the retail space following disappointing quarterly results and guidance from Home Depot (HD 226.39, -12.46, -5.2%) and Kohl's (KSS 47.58, -10.82, -18.5%).The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.4%, but the Nasdaq Composite (+0.2%) and Russell 2000 (+0.4%) trade higher.The underperformance of the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 44.12, -0.71, -1.6%) best displays the negative sentiment that has subsumed the retail industry today. Both the Dow and S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (-0.8%), meanwhile, can attribute their underperformance to Home Depot.The S&P 500 energy sector (-1.1%) is down even more amid a sharp decline in oil prices ($55.69, -1.45, -2.5%), but the market isn't getting concerned about the U.S. consumer based on a couple of reports. Instead, the market is hanging in there amid gains in the heavily-weighted health care (+0.3%), information technology (+0.1%), and financials (+0.1%) sectors.The consensus among many investors is that the market is due for a pullback, but the absence of one has created a sort of pain trade for investors fearful of missing out on further gains. The S&P 500 was down just 0.3% at its low earlier today before a buy-the-dip effort briefly brought it back above its flat line.Separately, shares of AT&T (T 37.65, -1.99) are down 5.0% after the stock was downgraded to Sell from Neutral at MoffettNathanson with a price target of $30. Shares of Slack (WORK 20.88, -2.24, -9.7%) are down 10% on news that Microsoft's (MSFT 150.99, +0.65, +0.4%) competitive product, Teams, has increased daily active users by nearly 50% since July.In the Treasury market, demand for longer-dated bonds has caused some minor curve-flattening activity. The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.79%. The U.S. Dollar Index is flat at 97.79.Today's economic calendar was limited to Housing Starts and Building Permits for October:Total housing starts increased 3.8% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.314 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.300 million) while total building permits increased 5.0% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.461 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.365 million).There was a sizable jump in starts (+8.6%) and permits (+8.2%) for multi-unit dwellings, yet the key takeaway from the report is that starts (+2.0%) and permits (+3.2%) increased for single-family units in an inventory-constrained environment for single-family homes.12:45MRK Merck increases quarterly dividend to $0.61 from $0.55/share (84.21 +0.08)12:25SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Myovant Sciences (MYOV) gains on Phase 3 relugolix data -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersMYOV (10.86 +79.21%): Announced results from the Phase 3 HERO study of once-daily, oral relugolix in men with advanced prostate cancer; the trial met its primary efficacy endpoint and all six key secondary endpoints -- in the primary endpoint responder analysis, 96.7% of men receiving the relugolix regimen achieved sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels through 48 weeks. These results, noted co, support NDA submission to the FDA in Q2 of 2020 and future regulatory submissions in Europe and Japan. Jumps to six-month highs. ATNX (15.12 +32.12%): Moves to its highest levels since August after previewing its presentation at the 2019 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium; co's abstract for the Phase 3 study of oral paclitaxel and encequidar in metastatic breast cancer has been selected for the conference's press program. DRNA (23.72 +10.89%): Price target raised to $30 from $22 at H.C. Wainwright, citing a positive view of co's new strategic alliance with Novo Nordisk (NVO), which was announced yesterday; the firm views the deal as underscoring a "Burgeoning RNAi Powerhouse." Continued strength sees the stock touch up to new four-year highs.Small Cap LosersI (6.19 -22.91%): Continued weakness following FCC Chairman Ajit Pai's announcement midday yesterday of support for a public auction of 280 megahertz of the C-band spectrum; the C-Band Alliance, a satellite operator group of which co is a member, issued a statement yesterday following the Chairman's communication, noting, among other comments, that the announcement "does not address the critical involvement of the incumbent satellite operators in executing the complex task of reconfiguring and transitioning their networks." Following yesterday's developments, the stock was downgraded to In-Line from Outperform at Evercore ISI, which also cut co's price target to $11 from $38; JPMorgan lowered co's target to $9 from $22. Wells Fargo noted that embrace of a public auction "does not seem to offer much potential capital to the satellite players" and also noted the impact that the public approach will have on timing, saying, "Getting this spectrum auctioned off in 1H 2020 (as the C-Band Alliance plan had outlined) seems naively optimistic at this point." The stock again records new 52-week lows, now down circa 76% month-to-date. PPDF (2.53 -11.85%): Missed estimates for Q3 EPS and revs (+35.0% yr/yr to RMB1.51 bln). Cumulative registered users increased to approx. 102.8 mln while cumulative number of borrowers reached 17.4 mln as of September 30; number of unique borrowers increased +28.6% yr/yr. Co expects total loan origination volume between RMB16-19 bln for Q4. Co also noted that it plans to discontinue its online information intermediary business between individual borrowers and individual investors. At all-time lows. PLUG (3.33 -11.12%): Pulls back from yesterday's four-year highs with above average volume; factoring in today's move, the stock continues to trade higher by circa +26% month-to-date.11:59SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (95) outpacing new lows (63) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: AAPL, AES, AGEN, AIZ, ALL, AMD, AME, AMED, ANSS, AON, APD, ARDX, ARMK, ARVN, ARWR, ATEC, ATRS, AVGO, AZO, BIO, BIP, BLDR, BLK, BLMN, BRO, CACI, CATM, CDE, CDW, CLH, CPRT, CRSP, CSGS, CSL, CVNA, CZR, DEA, DEI, DKS, DOX, DRNA, DXCM, EIDX, EPAM, ESE, EVRI, EW, FISV, FNF, FTNT, GLIBA, GPN, HALO, HIG, INFO, INOV, INST, KMX, KRG, KRTX, LDOS, LIN, LPT, LULU, LXP, LZB, MCO, MDCO, MGM, MMC, MSCI, MSFT, NSIT, OC, PFSI, PLMR, PRFT, RDN, RLI, SEM, SHOO, SPGI, TDY, TJX, TMO, TROW, TRU, UI, USB, VAC, VRTX, XBIT, XPEL, XRX, ZYMEStocks that traded to 52 week lows: AM, AR, ASIX, BCEI, BIG, BTU, BXC, CDEV, CEIX, CHK, CNP, CPS, CRZO, CTRA, CVEO, DCP, ENBL, ENLC, EQM, ETRN, EXPE, EXTN, EZPW, FLNT, FOSL, FPRX, FTSI, GLOG, GLOP, GSM, GTE, GTLS, I, IIVI, KLXE, LBRT, MDR, MPLX, NEWM, NVEE, OAS, PAA, PAGP, PBT, PNNT, PRMW, QUAD, RBBN, RVLV, SDRL, SINA, SMLP, SNH, TCO, TCS, TDW, TH, TRIP, UPWK, VG, VNOM, WES, WLLThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: CABO, FWONA, IHC, LACQ, NWPX, PLOW, WDFCETFs that traded to 52 week highs: CUT, DIA, EWC, EWG, EWQ, EZU, FAN, GREK, IAI, IOO, ITA, IWF, IYF, IYG, IYH, IYJ, KCE, OEF, QQQ, SPY, UYG, VGK, VTI, XLKETFs that traded to 52 week lows: AMJ, VXX, XES11:53TALKX Market Briefing: Price action getting technicalThere hasn't been a lot of conviction in the morning session, evidenced by an S&P 500 that is basically unchanged through the first two hours of trading.Retail stocks have been a notable pocket of weakness following the disappointments from Home Depot (HD 226.88, -11.98, -5.0%) and Kohl's (KSS 48.21, -10.19, -17.5%). Their weakness has acted as a weight on the broader market, yet the movement of the S&P 500 index has been largely a function of technical price action.Briefing.com's Technical Take page identified 3127 as a secondary resistance level for the S&P 500. That level was tested with the opening move (3127.64) but quickly failed as steady selling eventually dropped the S&P 500 back to 3113.46 at this morning's low, which was reached just before 11:00 a.m. ET. That level fell within a secondary support level (3115/3112) that was also identified on the Technical Take Page.Traders, therefore, appear to be respecting these technical boundaries for now on a day that is devoid of any major macro news drivers, particularly as they relate to trade, and as it is suggested that the market is short-term overextended and due for a pullback.The Russell 2000 is up 0.4%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.3%; the S&P 500 is unchanged; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.4%.11:51QCOM Qualcomm issues 3 year targets at Analyst Day (88.73 -1.78)From CFO's presentation at Analyst Day:3 year targets as earnings mix shift to QCT from QTLRevenue: QCT segment SAM: 10% CAGR, grow faster than SAM and Apple product revenues QTL: current run rate + Huawei resolution Operating margin: QCT grows to >20%; QTL: ~70%Summarizing Qualcomm opportunities: Mature handset industry and current macroeconomic environment; Accelerated 5G migration compared to 4G; Mobile handset platform: 4G->5G transition, RF Front-End growth; Growth beyond mobile: Auto, IoT, Compute, ADAS, Cloud/Edge AI 75+ 5G licenses including key anchor agreements.Grow earnings faster than revenues.

The ACHIEVE II trial evaluated ubrogepant 50 mg and 25 mg, compared with placebo, across a wide range of clinical endpoints, including the co-primary endpoints of pain freedom (no pain) and freedom from the most bothersome migraine-associated symptom at two hours post-initial dose. For the two co-primary endpoints, ubrogepant 50 mg and 25 mg showed statistically significant higher response rates for pain freedom at two hours (21.8% for 50 mg, 20.7% for 25 mg and 14.3% for placebo), and the 50 mg dose demonstrated statistically significant higher response rates for the freedom from the most bothersome migraine-associated symptom at two hours (38.9% for 50 mg and 27.4% for placebo). Additionally, ubrogepant 50 mg was statistically superior to placebo in the absence of light sensitivity (43.8% for 50 mg and 35.5% for placebo) and sound sensitivity (54.1% for 50 mg and 46.3% for placebo).FDA action on the NDA for ubrogepant is expected in December 2019, potentially making it the first oral CGRP to address unmet patient needs in acute treatment of migraine and the first FDA-approved gepant.11:21XLE Sector Briefing: Energy (58.71 -0.65)The energy sector (-1.1%) sits at the bottom of today's sector standings after showing relative weakness yesterday. The growth-sensitive sector is now down 2.4% since Friday versus a much more modest 0.1% week-to-date downtick in the S&P 500. Factors contributing to the underperformance:Notable pressure on crude oil. The energy component is down more than $1.00 today (-2.3%) and down $2.01 (-3.5%) since Friday's settlement. This has sent the price of oil beneath its 200-day moving average (57.37) with the 50-day average (55.65) looming just below. Tax-loss related selling. The energy sector has been the weakest performer of 2019, meaning the group contains a fair share of names that have underperformed since the end of 2018. These names are more likely to be sold before the end of 2019 as investors look to reduce some of the tax impact of taking capital gains this year.Notable movers:HollyFrontier (HFC 51.56, -2.35, -4.4%): falling to its lowest level since early October. The company announced a new project and a new buyback authorization yesterday morning.

That corner is the retail industry, which has been broadsided today by disappointing earnings/sales results and guidance from Home Depot (HD 226.60, -12.25, -5.1%) and Kohl's (KSS 48.09, -10.31, -17.7%).The weakness in HD is having an outsized impact on the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (-0.9%); meanwhile, the combined impact of the disappointments from these well-known retailers is creating some angst about consumer spending activity entering the all-important holiday selling season.That angst is showing up in a sympathy trade that has knocked down the prices of many other retail stocks today, like Macy's (M 15.36, -1.51, -9.0%), Best Buy (BBY 75.61, -1.68, -2.2%), and Gap (GPS 16.62, -0.68, -3.9%) to name a few. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.97, -0.85, -1.9%) reflects the broader trend of underperformance for the retailers in today's market action.Those issues notwithstanding, the broader market is still holding up just fine as it is drawing influential support from the information technology (+0.3%), healthcare (+0.3%), and financial (+0.2%) sectors, which continue to attract interest from value and growth-minded investors alike.Separately, the market's overall resilience to selling pressure remains a tying factor for a number of participants who are fearful of missing out on further gains. That fear, ostensibly, is lending some buying support that has kept downside pressure in check.The Russell 2000 is up 0.2%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.1%; the S&P 500 is down 0.1%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%.10:00XLY Sector Briefing: Consumer Discretionary (120.74 -1.05)The consumer discretionary sector (-0.8%) represents an early pocket of relative weakness in a flat market. This makes for a continuation of this month's underperformance, which has the sector trading down 0.3% since the end of October versus a 2.8% gain in the S&P 500. Factors contributing to today's underperformance:Home Depot's (HD 227.72, -11.13, -4.7%) Q3 earnings report, which showed lower than expected revenue and lowered comparable sales guidance for FY20. Granted, Home Depot met Q3 EPS expectations, but the revenue shortfall and lowered comparable sales guidance have pressured the stock from a record high. Furthermore, the outlook is leading to some questions about the overall strength of consumer spending. Disappointing Q3 results and lowered FY20 guidance from Kohl's (KSS 48.86, -9.54, -16.4%), fueling worries that other apparel retailers could also report underwhelming results.Notable movers:Home Depot (HD 227.72, -11.13, -4.7%): falling back below its 50-day moving average (232.37) after setting a fresh record high on Monday. Kohl's (KSS 48.86, -9.54, -16.4%): falling to its lowest level in more than a month in response to weaker than expected quarterly results. Macy's (M 15.35, -1.53, -9.0%): sliding back below its 50-day moving average (15.76) after weak results from Kohl's. Nordstrom (JWN 35.10, -2.78, -7.3%): falling below its 200-day moving average (36.33) and toward its 50-day moving average (34.94) in sympathy with Kohl's. Gap (GPS 16.70, -0.60, -3.4%): approaching its October low after Kohl's disappointing results. TJX (TJX 60.68, +1.13, +1.9%): touched a fresh record after better than expected Q3 results overshadowed below-consensus Q4 EPS guidance.

In the primary endpoint responder analysis, 96.7% (95% CI: 94.9%, 97.9%) of men receiving once-daily, oral relugolix achieved sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels. A responder was defined as achieving and maintaining testosterone suppression to less than or equal to 50 ng/dL from Week 5 through Week 48. For the study to be successful, the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of the response rate had to be at least 90%.The study achieved all six key secondary endpoints, including superiority to leuprolide acetate on rapid suppression of testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA), all with p-values <0.0001.Five key secondary endpoints demonstrated superiority to leuprolide acetate, including rapid suppression of testosterone at Day 4 and Day 15, profound suppression of testosterone at Day 15, rapid suppression of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at Day 15, and suppression of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) at Week 24 (all p-values <0.0001). In addition, relugolix demonstrated non-inferiority to leuprolide acetate on sustained testosterone suppression through 48 weeks (96.7% vs. 88.8%, respectively) with a between-group difference of 7.9% (95% CI: 4.1%,11.8%), the primary endpoint required for regulatory submissions outside of the U.S. In addition, the pharmacodynamic results showed no testosterone flare after initiation of relugolix and mean testosterone levels returned to normal levels within 90 days after treatment discontinuation.A New Drug Application (NDA) submission is expected in the second quarter of 2020.A conference call and webcast are to be held today at 8:30 a.m. EST / 5:30 a.m. PST.07:32SRRK Scholar Rock announces preliminary pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic results from the TOPAZ Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial of SRK-015 for the treatment of patients with spinal muscular atrophy (7.20 )The planned preliminary PK/PD analysis, which includes data from 29 patients with SMA across all three cohorts, showed dose-proportional drug exposure and demonstrated target engagement, as evidenced by dose-dependent increases of up to 100-fold in the serum levels of latent myostatin following SRK-015 treatment (2 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg doses).

Khoury, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of KLX Energy Services commented, "Contemporaneously with the abrupt decline in activity, we took steps to align our business with current customer demand. Specifically, we implemented an approximate 17 percent reduction in force, as compared with the Company's July 31, 2019 staffing levels, consistent with the approximate 18 percent sequential quarterly decline in our third quarter revenues. We aggressively cut costs in every area of our business, and we warm stacked the vast majority of our Permian based wireline assets. As a result of these and other measures, we expect to take a third quarter charge of approximately $13 million. Notwithstanding the precipitous decline in industry conditions, we generated approximately $44 million in cash flow from operations and approximately $31 million in free cash flow, bringing our cash balance to approximately $121 million for the quarter ended October 31, 2019. In addition, our $100 million credit facility remains undrawn.""The abrupt deterioration in industry conditions, which accelerated through the end of our third quarter, was driven by a sharp sequential quarterly decline in U.S. land rig count and an unprecedented decline in active frac spreads from the second quarter to the third quarter. In fact, there was a significant sequential decline in hydraulic fracturing activity during each month of the third quarter. The decline in Exploration & Production activity resulted in lower demand levels and lower current and expected revenues for our business, which led the Company to accelerate its annual testing for asset impairment into the third quarter. While the Company has not yet completed this analysis, we expect to report a non-cash asset impairment charge in the range of approximately $45 million to $60 million. The Company is in the process of finalizing the actual amount of the impairment charge, which will be completed prior to reporting its third quarter financial results."06:00CEO CNOOC Ltd names President Xu Keqiang as CEO (152.50 )06:00TRP TC Energy to provide financial update and review strategic plans at Investor Day, reaffirms expectation to grow common share dividend at an annual rate of 8-10% through 2021 (51.44 )"Our $100 billion portfolio of high-quality, long-life energy infrastructure assets are expected to generate record financial results again in 2019 underpinned by strong market fundamentals," said Russ Girling, TC Energy's president and chief executive officer. "Looking forward, we continue to advance $30 billion of commercially secured projects that will expand and extend our asset footprint across North America."As those projects enter service, TC Energy expects comparable earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to exceed $10 billion in 2022. This represents an increase of more than 16 per cent when compared to comparable EBITDA of $8.6 billion in 2018 despite significant asset sales that have accelerated the strengthening of the company's balance sheet. Notably, approximately 95 per cent of comparable EBITDA is expected to come from regulated assets or long-term contracts. At the same time, the company continues to methodically advance more than $20 billion of projects under development including Keystone XL and the Bruce Power life extension program. Success in advancing these and other organic growth opportunities that are expected to emanate from TC Energy's five operating businesses across North America would add to the company's growth outlook."Based on the confidence we have in our business plans, we are reaffirming that we expect to grow our common share dividend at an annual rate of eight to 10 per cent through 2021," added Girling. "Our dividend outlook is supported by expected growth in earnings and cash flow and in line with our historically strong dividend coverage ratios."06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- World markets continue climb higher; US Futures in record territoryThe global equity markets are mostly higher once again with US Futures venturing into all-time high territory for a second straight night.

These utility operations have customers in eight states and expect customer growth to continue at a rate of 1-2% annually.

Also included in the utility's five-year program is the construction of an 88-megawatt simple-cycle, natural gas-fired combustion turbine near Mandan, North Dakota.The capital investment plan at the pipeline and midstream business reflects a focus on organic growth. This includes the Demicks Lake Expansion project under construction in North Dakota, which is expected to be in service in the first quarter of 2020 and as designed will increase capacity by 175 mln cubic feet per day. The North Bakken Expansion project is also included in the capital forecast.

The Russell 2000 (-0.3%) closed in negative territory.The day began with the market digesting a tweet from a China-based CNBC reporter, who said she was informed by a Chinese government source that Beijing is pessimistic about a trade deal because President Trump hasn't supported a tariff rollback. Based on the modest losses and ensuing price action, the market presumably remained optimistic about a Phase One agreement.The large-cap indices eased their way into positive territory thanks to the turnarounds in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (+0.3%), information technology (+0.3%), and communication services (+0.3%) sectors. Consistent leaders included the consumer staples (+0.5%) and real estate (+0.5%) sectors, as the negative-sounding trade headline likely fostered some conservative-minded interest.The trade-sensitive industrials (-0.3%) and materials (-0.2%) sectors were among today's laggards, but their losses were small compared to the 1.3% drop in the energy sector, which was pressured by the decline in oil prices ($57.04, -0.71, -1.2%).Generally, there wasn't any concerted effort to sell a market trading at all-time highs, but investors weren't eager to embrace risk, either. The trend has been positive, which has likely drawn in some reluctant investors into the market, and today simply may have been a natural breather for a market breaking out to new highs.Notable corporate news included HP Inc. (HPQ 20.01, -0.17, -0.8%) turning down the takeover bid from Xerox (XRX 39.30, +0.36, +0.9%). HP remained open to a deal, though. Netflix (NFLX 302.57, +7.54, +2.6%) shares outperformed on speculation that either Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman built a large stake in the company.U.S. Treasuries extended last week's advance, pushing yields slightly lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points to 1.81%.

SPE now owns 100% of the multimedia entertainment company. Following the transaction, the Game Show Network channel will continue to be carried on DIRECTV.The sale is consistent with AT&T's strategy to monetize non-strategic assets as it de-levers its balance sheet and begins to retire shares. Prior to the transaction, SPE owned a 58% stake in Game Show Network, and AT&T owned the remaining 42%. In connection with the transaction, AT&T received approx. $500 mln, including proceeds for its equity stake valued at $380 mln (before transaction-related adjustments) and dividends of approx. $130 mln. Game Show Network will continue to be managed by Sony Pictures Television (SPT) with Mark Feldman continuing as President and CEO of the multimedia outlet.16:15EFC Ellington Financial commences public offering of 4.2 mln shares of common stock (18.81 +0.01)The company expects to use proceeds to acquire its targeted assets.

In recent items, The Medicines Co (MDCO) makes continued gains today following yesterday's inclisiran data and on rumors of takeover interest; The Medicines Co obtained global rights to develop, manufacture, and commercialize inclisiran under a license and collaboration agreement with co. OKTA (127.29 +5.07%): Upgraded to Buy from Neutral and assigned a $135 price target at DA Davidson, which views pullback in the stock since July as having presented an attractive entry point into the stock, which the firm names as "one of the top SaaS growth stocks."NOW (278.53 +4.59%): Jumped to three-month highs after being appointed to join the S&P 500, effective prior to the open on November 21; co replaces Celgene (CELG) in the index upon that company's acquisition by Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY).Large Cap LosersWORK (21 -9.15%): Reports today indicate that rival Microsoft (MSFT) said that its workplace messaging app, Teams, has now accrued 20 mln daily active users, representing significant growth from its July user count of 13 mln DAUs.

Macy's has guided its fiscal 2020 EPS down 29% at the midpoint to $2.85-3.05, including $0.25 in asset sale gains, with revenue flat yr/yr, comp sales flat to up 1%, and gross margins down slightly. Macy's expects comp sales to improve meaningfully in the fourth quarter, citing a difficult compare in the month of October.The market remains skeptical that the nation's largest department store can generate long-term profit growth given secular challenges.The company's comparable store sales growth has been muted despite the relative strength of consumer spending, which has been supporting the domestic economy.Department stores continue to struggle with lower mall traffic. Last week, the Census Bureau reported core retail sales up 4.2% yr/yr for the three months ending in October, but Department store sales fell 6.1%.With a $4.7 bln market cap, Macy's trades ~6x EPS and ~6x EV/EBITDA, including $3.9 bln in net debt. That represents a slight discount to department store peers. Fortunately, Macy's does have a strong balance sheet, so it can afford to pay its dividend, which yields a robust 9% payout annually.15:15BONDX Treasury Market SummaryLonger Tenors Pad Recent GainsU.S. Treasuries recorded another round of gains on Tuesday, pressuring yields on the 10-yr note and the 30-yr bond into the neighborhood of their respective 50-day moving averages. The Tuesday session bore some resemblance to Monday's affair, as Treasuries started the day with modest losses, recovering them in short order. The early weakness took place after an upbeat start to the European session, which saw the release of strong vehicle registration figures for October. The 10-yr note and the 30-yr bond made it back to their flat lines just minutes after the cash start while shorter tenors also rebounded but took a bit longer before reaching positive territory. Treasuries overtook their morning highs in the early afternoon, remaining near their best levels of the day until the close. The U.S. Dollar Index rose 0.1% to 97.86, snapping a four-day skid. Yield Check: 2-yr: UNCH at 1.59% 3-yr: UNCH at 1.59% 5-yr: UNCH at 1.62% 10-yr: -2 bps to 1.79% 30-yr: -4 bps to 2.26%News: The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow forecast for Q4 GDP was increased to 0.4% from 0.3% following today's housing data.

There was a sizable jump in starts (+8.6%) and permits (+8.2%) for multi-unit dwellings, yet the key takeaway from the report is that starts (+2.0%) and permits (+3.2%) increased for single-family units in an inventory-constrained environment for single-family homes.

LOW has reported EPS upside in four of the past five quarters.The CapitalIQ consensus estimate for Q3 EPS is $1.35. The revenue consensus estimate is $17.69 bln. Note: LOW typically guides for revenue, EPS and comps in the press release for the full year. Its current full year guidance is for adjusted EPS of $5.45-5.65 while sales are expected to increase +2%. It'll be important to see if the company reaffirms or changes this guidance. Same store comps are always a key metric for Lowe's. In Q2 (Jul), comps came in at +2.3% and +3.2% for the US home improvement business. Home Depot (HD) is always a key barometer as to what to expect from Lowe's. HD was not super impressive as comps underwhelmed and HD lowered full year guidance. It's not all doom and gloom for Lowe's because HD cited some internal initiatives that are taking longer to materialize, so much of it may be company-specific and not industry-wide problems. Specifically, HD was emphatic on the call that it "sees a strong and engaged customer" and that "housing is healthy and stable." Another area to watch is tariffs. HD said that tariffs are having an impact but are manageable as its merchants have done a good job at mitigating the impact. Aside from the Home Depot angle, another aspect to this earnings report will be progress on Lowe's turnaround. Despite having a similar number of stores, Lowe's is dwarfed by Home Depot (HD) in terms of annual revenue ($72 bln vs $111 bln for HD) and HD holds a sizeable profitability gap. Lowe's wants to improve merchandising availability, to improve its digital presence/app, to increase the use of self-check-out lanes and cut worker hours to boost productivity. It'll be interesting to get an update on its progress. Overall, our sense is that the weak comps/guidance from Home Depot has lowered expectations for Lowe's this quarter. However, with Lowe's, we think investors are more focused on the bigger picture, namely how is the turnaround going.13:42TPX Tempur Sealy Int'l: US ITC determines mattresses from China injure US industry; Department of Commerce will issue antidumping duty order on imports of this product from China (85.44 -1.05)The United States International Trade Commission (USITC) today determined that a U.S. industry is materially injured by reason of imports of mattresses from China that the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) has determined are sold in the United States at less than fair value. As a result of the USITC's affirmative determination, Commerce will issue an antidumping duty order on imports of this product from China. ITC Release13:15ABMD Abiomed says Abiomed medical office is issuing publication review of observational analysis of Impella that was presented by Amin et al. at the American Heart Association Conference on November 17 (186.19 +8.10)According to the company, the AHA analysis is flawed because:The data source has significant limitations, containing just a fraction of Impella patients and unable to delineate between common adverse events.The Impella patients were much sicker and had greater baseline and procedural risks.The analysis excluded the costliest IABP patients who were escalated to other therapies.Additionally, the conclusion is aggressive because administrative coding data cannot delineate between adverse events common to high-risk patients and device related events.13:08SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: ACB (37.93 mln +2.94%), TEVA (22.61 mln +0.97%), BMY (19.42 mln -1.7%), CELG (13.89 mln -0.93%), CLVS (13.81 mln +6.23%)Industrials: GE (17.95 mln -0.6%)Consumer Discretionary: M (32.83 mln -10.04%), ROKU (21.57 mln -1.82%), KSS (19.77 mln -18.61%), NIO (18.01 mln +3.06%), F (17.54 mln -0.28%)Information Technology: AMD (54.78 mln +2.61%), NOK (20.12 mln -0.72%)Financials: BAC (17.88 mln -0.27%)Energy: CHK (55.18 mln -8.31%), ET (13.13 mln -1.99%), ECA (12.04 mln -4.56%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: MDCO (6.75x +19.55%), CRSP (5.7x +16.03%), EDIT (3.67x +11.4%), ATNX (3.12x +34.53%), CELG (2.97x -0.93%), NTLA (2.83x +12.13%)Materials: ASH (3.23x -4.14%)Industrials: WWD (3.27x -0.37%)Consumer Discretionary: KSS (6.3x -18.61%), HD (3.61x -5.23%)Information Technology: JKS (4.05x +12.71%)Financials: EFC (18.2x -3.03%), GBDC (3.31x +1.91%)Consumer Staples: CHEF (3.43x -8.38%)Utilities: DUK (3.42x -1.97%), ELP (3.22x +2.42%)13:06SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: ATNX (15.39 +34.53%), MDCO (70.12 +19.55%), BCRX (2 +17.35%), CRSP (67.92 +16.03%), NTLA (15.25 +12.13%), DRNA (23.87 +11.59%), EDIT (25.79 +11.4%), ARQL (8.4 +10.67%), APHA (4.21 +10.08%), TCDA (37.66 +9.92%), BOLD (28.08 +9.9%), WVE (31.02 +8.58%), TBIO (10.45 +8.52%), ASND (115.61 +8.07%), GLYC (6.18 +8.04%), AMRX (3.05 +7.6%), PRQR (6.71 +7.36%), PRTA (10.99 +7.28%)Information Technology: JKS (16.76 +12.71%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: VAPO (10.77 -7.08%)Industrials: BLDP (6.52 -10.19%)Consumer Discretionary: KSS (47.53 -18.61%), M (15.19 -10.04%), SIG (15.7 -8.61%)Financials: PPDF (2.5 -12.89%), JT (1.86 -10.39%), YRD (5.51 -9.97%)Energy: KLXE (5.44 -26.19%), UNT (0.72 -11.3%), CRC (7.58 -10.67%), ESV (3.82 -8.95%), SPN (0.33 -8.45%), CHK (0.59 -8.31%), EXTN (6.31 -7.82%), TUSK (1.38 -7.38%), PVAC (24.25 -7.35%)Consumer Staples: CHEF (32.57 -8.38%), DF (0.07 -7.5%)12:57WRAPX Midday Market Summary: Stock market trades mixed; Home Depot, Kohl's weigh on retail spaceThe S&P 500 is currently down 0.1% in midday action, with weakness concentrated in the retail space following disappointing quarterly results and guidance from Home Depot (HD 226.39, -12.46, -5.2%) and Kohl's (KSS 47.58, -10.82, -18.5%).The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.4%, but the Nasdaq Composite (+0.2%) and Russell 2000 (+0.4%) trade higher.The underperformance of the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 44.12, -0.71, -1.6%) best displays the negative sentiment that has subsumed the retail industry today. Both the Dow and S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (-0.8%), meanwhile, can attribute their underperformance to Home Depot.The S&P 500 energy sector (-1.1%) is down even more amid a sharp decline in oil prices ($55.69, -1.45, -2.5%), but the market isn't getting concerned about the U.S. consumer based on a couple of reports. Instead, the market is hanging in there amid gains in the heavily-weighted health care (+0.3%), information technology (+0.1%), and financials (+0.1%) sectors.The consensus among many investors is that the market is due for a pullback, but the absence of one has created a sort of pain trade for investors fearful of missing out on further gains. The S&P 500 was down just 0.3% at its low earlier today before a buy-the-dip effort briefly brought it back above its flat line.Separately, shares of AT&T (T 37.65, -1.99) are down 5.0% after the stock was downgraded to Sell from Neutral at MoffettNathanson with a price target of $30. Shares of Slack (WORK 20.88, -2.24, -9.7%) are down 10% on news that Microsoft's (MSFT 150.99, +0.65, +0.4%) competitive product, Teams, has increased daily active users by nearly 50% since July.In the Treasury market, demand for longer-dated bonds has caused some minor curve-flattening activity. The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.79%. The U.S. Dollar Index is flat at 97.79.Today's economic calendar was limited to Housing Starts and Building Permits for October:Total housing starts increased 3.8% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.314 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.300 million) while total building permits increased 5.0% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.461 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.365 million).There was a sizable jump in starts (+8.6%) and permits (+8.2%) for multi-unit dwellings, yet the key takeaway from the report is that starts (+2.0%) and permits (+3.2%) increased for single-family units in an inventory-constrained environment for single-family homes.12:45MRK Merck increases quarterly dividend to $0.61 from $0.55/share (84.21 +0.08)12:25SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Myovant Sciences (MYOV) gains on Phase 3 relugolix data -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersMYOV (10.86 +79.21%): Announced results from the Phase 3 HERO study of once-daily, oral relugolix in men with advanced prostate cancer; the trial met its primary efficacy endpoint and all six key secondary endpoints -- in the primary endpoint responder analysis, 96.7% of men receiving the relugolix regimen achieved sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels through 48 weeks. These results, noted co, support NDA submission to the FDA in Q2 of 2020 and future regulatory submissions in Europe and Japan. Jumps to six-month highs. ATNX (15.12 +32.12%): Moves to its highest levels since August after previewing its presentation at the 2019 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium; co's abstract for the Phase 3 study of oral paclitaxel and encequidar in metastatic breast cancer has been selected for the conference's press program. DRNA (23.72 +10.89%): Price target raised to $30 from $22 at H.C. Wainwright, citing a positive view of co's new strategic alliance with Novo Nordisk (NVO), which was announced yesterday; the firm views the deal as underscoring a "Burgeoning RNAi Powerhouse." Continued strength sees the stock touch up to new four-year highs.Small Cap LosersI (6.19 -22.91%): Continued weakness following FCC Chairman Ajit Pai's announcement midday yesterday of support for a public auction of 280 megahertz of the C-band spectrum; the C-Band Alliance, a satellite operator group of which co is a member, issued a statement yesterday following the Chairman's communication, noting, among other comments, that the announcement "does not address the critical involvement of the incumbent satellite operators in executing the complex task of reconfiguring and transitioning their networks." Following yesterday's developments, the stock was downgraded to In-Line from Outperform at Evercore ISI, which also cut co's price target to $11 from $38; JPMorgan lowered co's target to $9 from $22. Wells Fargo noted that embrace of a public auction "does not seem to offer much potential capital to the satellite players" and also noted the impact that the public approach will have on timing, saying, "Getting this spectrum auctioned off in 1H 2020 (as the C-Band Alliance plan had outlined) seems naively optimistic at this point." The stock again records new 52-week lows, now down circa 76% month-to-date. PPDF (2.53 -11.85%): Missed estimates for Q3 EPS and revs (+35.0% yr/yr to RMB1.51 bln). Cumulative registered users increased to approx. 102.8 mln while cumulative number of borrowers reached 17.4 mln as of September 30; number of unique borrowers increased +28.6% yr/yr. Co expects total loan origination volume between RMB16-19 bln for Q4. Co also noted that it plans to discontinue its online information intermediary business between individual borrowers and individual investors. At all-time lows. PLUG (3.33 -11.12%): Pulls back from yesterday's four-year highs with above average volume; factoring in today's move, the stock continues to trade higher by circa +26% month-to-date.11:59SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (95) outpacing new lows (63) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: AAPL, AES, AGEN, AIZ, ALL, AMD, AME, AMED, ANSS, AON, APD, ARDX, ARMK, ARVN, ARWR, ATEC, ATRS, AVGO, AZO, BIO, BIP, BLDR, BLK, BLMN, BRO, CACI, CATM, CDE, CDW, CLH, CPRT, CRSP, CSGS, CSL, CVNA, CZR, DEA, DEI, DKS, DOX, DRNA, DXCM, EIDX, EPAM, ESE, EVRI, EW, FISV, FNF, FTNT, GLIBA, GPN, HALO, HIG, INFO, INOV, INST, KMX, KRG, KRTX, LDOS, LIN, LPT, LULU, LXP, LZB, MCO, MDCO, MGM, MMC, MSCI, MSFT, NSIT, OC, PFSI, PLMR, PRFT, RDN, RLI, SEM, SHOO, SPGI, TDY, TJX, TMO, TROW, TRU, UI, USB, VAC, VRTX, XBIT, XPEL, XRX, ZYMEStocks that traded to 52 week lows: AM, AR, ASIX, BCEI, BIG, BTU, BXC, CDEV, CEIX, CHK, CNP, CPS, CRZO, CTRA, CVEO, DCP, ENBL, ENLC, EQM, ETRN, EXPE, EXTN, EZPW, FLNT, FOSL, FPRX, FTSI, GLOG, GLOP, GSM, GTE, GTLS, I, IIVI, KLXE, LBRT, MDR, MPLX, NEWM, NVEE, OAS, PAA, PAGP, PBT, PNNT, PRMW, QUAD, RBBN, RVLV, SDRL, SINA, SMLP, SNH, TCO, TCS, TDW, TH, TRIP, UPWK, VG, VNOM, WES, WLLThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: CABO, FWONA, IHC, LACQ, NWPX, PLOW, WDFCETFs that traded to 52 week highs: CUT, DIA, EWC, EWG, EWQ, EZU, FAN, GREK, IAI, IOO, ITA, IWF, IYF, IYG, IYH, IYJ, KCE, OEF, QQQ, SPY, UYG, VGK, VTI, XLKETFs that traded to 52 week lows: AMJ, VXX, XES11:53TALKX Market Briefing: Price action getting technicalThere hasn't been a lot of conviction in the morning session, evidenced by an S&P 500 that is basically unchanged through the first two hours of trading.Retail stocks have been a notable pocket of weakness following the disappointments from Home Depot (HD 226.88, -11.98, -5.0%) and Kohl's (KSS 48.21, -10.19, -17.5%). Their weakness has acted as a weight on the broader market, yet the movement of the S&P 500 index has been largely a function of technical price action.Briefing.com's Technical Take page identified 3127 as a secondary resistance level for the S&P 500. That level was tested with the opening move (3127.64) but quickly failed as steady selling eventually dropped the S&P 500 back to 3113.46 at this morning's low, which was reached just before 11:00 a.m. ET. That level fell within a secondary support level (3115/3112) that was also identified on the Technical Take Page.Traders, therefore, appear to be respecting these technical boundaries for now on a day that is devoid of any major macro news drivers, particularly as they relate to trade, and as it is suggested that the market is short-term overextended and due for a pullback.The Russell 2000 is up 0.4%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.3%; the S&P 500 is unchanged; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.4%.11:51QCOM Qualcomm issues 3 year targets at Analyst Day (88.73 -1.78)From CFO's presentation at Analyst Day:3 year targets as earnings mix shift to QCT from QTLRevenue: QCT segment SAM: 10% CAGR, grow faster than SAM and Apple product revenues QTL: current run rate + Huawei resolution Operating margin: QCT grows to >20%; QTL: ~70%Summarizing Qualcomm opportunities: Mature handset industry and current macroeconomic environment; Accelerated 5G migration compared to 4G; Mobile handset platform: 4G->5G transition, RF Front-End growth; Growth beyond mobile: Auto, IoT, Compute, ADAS, Cloud/Edge AI 75+ 5G licenses including key anchor agreements.Grow earnings faster than revenues.

The ACHIEVE II trial evaluated ubrogepant 50 mg and 25 mg, compared with placebo, across a wide range of clinical endpoints, including the co-primary endpoints of pain freedom (no pain) and freedom from the most bothersome migraine-associated symptom at two hours post-initial dose. For the two co-primary endpoints, ubrogepant 50 mg and 25 mg showed statistically significant higher response rates for pain freedom at two hours (21.8% for 50 mg, 20.7% for 25 mg and 14.3% for placebo), and the 50 mg dose demonstrated statistically significant higher response rates for the freedom from the most bothersome migraine-associated symptom at two hours (38.9% for 50 mg and 27.4% for placebo). Additionally, ubrogepant 50 mg was statistically superior to placebo in the absence of light sensitivity (43.8% for 50 mg and 35.5% for placebo) and sound sensitivity (54.1% for 50 mg and 46.3% for placebo).FDA action on the NDA for ubrogepant is expected in December 2019, potentially making it the first oral CGRP to address unmet patient needs in acute treatment of migraine and the first FDA-approved gepant.11:21XLE Sector Briefing: Energy (58.71 -0.65)The energy sector (-1.1%) sits at the bottom of today's sector standings after showing relative weakness yesterday. The growth-sensitive sector is now down 2.4% since Friday versus a much more modest 0.1% week-to-date downtick in the S&P 500. Factors contributing to the underperformance:Notable pressure on crude oil. The energy component is down more than $1.00 today (-2.3%) and down $2.01 (-3.5%) since Friday's settlement. This has sent the price of oil beneath its 200-day moving average (57.37) with the 50-day average (55.65) looming just below. Tax-loss related selling. The energy sector has been the weakest performer of 2019, meaning the group contains a fair share of names that have underperformed since the end of 2018. These names are more likely to be sold before the end of 2019 as investors look to reduce some of the tax impact of taking capital gains this year.Notable movers:HollyFrontier (HFC 51.56, -2.35, -4.4%): falling to its lowest level since early October. The company announced a new project and a new buyback authorization yesterday morning. Noble Energy (NBL 19.41, -0.51, -2.6%): nearing its 2019 low after finding resistance at its 50-day moving average (21.34) at the end of last week. Marathon Petroleum (MPC 62.13, -1.88, -2.9%): falling to its 50-day moving average (61.89). Occidental Petroleum (OXY 38.20, -1.10, -2.8%): on the verge of hitting fresh low for the year. Helmerich & Payne (HP 37.79, -1.05, -2.7%): nearing its 2019 low after being downgraded to Hold from Buy at Argus. ConocoPhillips (COP 57.26, +0.56, +1.0%): best performing sector component, reclaiming its 50-day moving average (57.03). The company is hosting its analyst & investor meeting today, where it is expected to reaffirm its commitment to a strategy unveiled in 2016.10:35OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:DO Jan20 5 calls are seeing interest with 4230 contracts trading vs. open int of 0, pushing implied vol up around 10 points to ~87%.

That corner is the retail industry, which has been broadsided today by disappointing earnings/sales results and guidance from Home Depot (HD 226.60, -12.25, -5.1%) and Kohl's (KSS 48.09, -10.31, -17.7%).The weakness in HD is having an outsized impact on the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (-0.9%); meanwhile, the combined impact of the disappointments from these well-known retailers is creating some angst about consumer spending activity entering the all-important holiday selling season.That angst is showing up in a sympathy trade that has knocked down the prices of many other retail stocks today, like Macy's (M 15.36, -1.51, -9.0%), Best Buy (BBY 75.61, -1.68, -2.2%), and Gap (GPS 16.62, -0.68, -3.9%) to name a few. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.97, -0.85, -1.9%) reflects the broader trend of underperformance for the retailers in today's market action.Those issues notwithstanding, the broader market is still holding up just fine as it is drawing influential support from the information technology (+0.3%), healthcare (+0.3%), and financial (+0.2%) sectors, which continue to attract interest from value and growth-minded investors alike.Separately, the market's overall resilience to selling pressure remains a tying factor for a number of participants who are fearful of missing out on further gains. That fear, ostensibly, is lending some buying support that has kept downside pressure in check.The Russell 2000 is up 0.2%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.1%; the S&P 500 is down 0.1%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%.10:00XLY Sector Briefing: Consumer Discretionary (120.74 -1.05)The consumer discretionary sector (-0.8%) represents an early pocket of relative weakness in a flat market. This makes for a continuation of this month's underperformance, which has the sector trading down 0.3% since the end of October versus a 2.8% gain in the S&P 500. Factors contributing to today's underperformance:Home Depot's (HD 227.72, -11.13, -4.7%) Q3 earnings report, which showed lower than expected revenue and lowered comparable sales guidance for FY20. Granted, Home Depot met Q3 EPS expectations, but the revenue shortfall and lowered comparable sales guidance have pressured the stock from a record high. Furthermore, the outlook is leading to some questions about the overall strength of consumer spending.

For the study to be successful, the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of the response rate had to be at least 90%.The study achieved all six key secondary endpoints, including superiority to leuprolide acetate on rapid suppression of testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA), all with p-values <0.0001.Five key secondary endpoints demonstrated superiority to leuprolide acetate, including rapid suppression of testosterone at Day 4 and Day 15, profound suppression of testosterone at Day 15, rapid suppression of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at Day 15, and suppression of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) at Week 24 (all p-values <0.0001). In addition, relugolix demonstrated non-inferiority to leuprolide acetate on sustained testosterone suppression through 48 weeks (96.7% vs. 88.8%, respectively) with a between-group difference of 7.9% (95% CI: 4.1%,11.8%), the primary endpoint required for regulatory submissions outside of the U.S. In addition, the pharmacodynamic results showed no testosterone flare after initiation of relugolix and mean testosterone levels returned to normal levels within 90 days after treatment discontinuation.A New Drug Application (NDA) submission is expected in the second quarter of 2020.A conference call and webcast are to be held today at 8:30 a.m. EST / 5:30 a.m. PST.07:32SRRK Scholar Rock announces preliminary pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic results from the TOPAZ Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial of SRK-015 for the treatment of patients with spinal muscular atrophy (7.20 )The planned preliminary PK/PD analysis, which includes data from 29 patients with SMA across all three cohorts, showed dose-proportional drug exposure and demonstrated target engagement, as evidenced by dose-dependent increases of up to 100-fold in the serum levels of latent myostatin following SRK-015 treatment (2 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg doses).

Khoury, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of KLX Energy Services commented, "Contemporaneously with the abrupt decline in activity, we took steps to align our business with current customer demand. Specifically, we implemented an approximate 17 percent reduction in force, as compared with the Company's July 31, 2019 staffing levels, consistent with the approximate 18 percent sequential quarterly decline in our third quarter revenues. We aggressively cut costs in every area of our business, and we warm stacked the vast majority of our Permian based wireline assets. As a result of these and other measures, we expect to take a third quarter charge of approximately $13 million. Notwithstanding the precipitous decline in industry conditions, we generated approximately $44 million in cash flow from operations and approximately $31 million in free cash flow, bringing our cash balance to approximately $121 million for the quarter ended October 31, 2019. In addition, our $100 million credit facility remains undrawn.""The abrupt deterioration in industry conditions, which accelerated through the end of our third quarter, was driven by a sharp sequential quarterly decline in U.S. land rig count and an unprecedented decline in active frac spreads from the second quarter to the third quarter. In fact, there was a significant sequential decline in hydraulic fracturing activity during each month of the third quarter. The decline in Exploration & Production activity resulted in lower demand levels and lower current and expected revenues for our business, which led the Company to accelerate its annual testing for asset impairment into the third quarter. While the Company has not yet completed this analysis, we expect to report a non-cash asset impairment charge in the range of approximately $45 million to $60 million. The Company is in the process of finalizing the actual amount of the impairment charge, which will be completed prior to reporting its third quarter financial results."06:00CEO CNOOC Ltd names President Xu Keqiang as CEO (152.50 )06:00TRP TC Energy to provide financial update and review strategic plans at Investor Day, reaffirms expectation to grow common share dividend at an annual rate of 8-10% through 2021 (51.44 )"Our $100 billion portfolio of high-quality, long-life energy infrastructure assets are expected to generate record financial results again in 2019 underpinned by strong market fundamentals," said Russ Girling, TC Energy's president and chief executive officer. "Looking forward, we continue to advance $30 billion of commercially secured projects that will expand and extend our asset footprint across North America."As those projects enter service, TC Energy expects comparable earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to exceed $10 billion in 2022. This represents an increase of more than 16 per cent when compared to comparable EBITDA of $8.6 billion in 2018 despite significant asset sales that have accelerated the strengthening of the company's balance sheet. Notably, approximately 95 per cent of comparable EBITDA is expected to come from regulated assets or long-term contracts. At the same time, the company continues to methodically advance more than $20 billion of projects under development including Keystone XL and the Bruce Power life extension program. Success in advancing these and other organic growth opportunities that are expected to emanate from TC Energy's five operating businesses across North America would add to the company's growth outlook."Based on the confidence we have in our business plans, we are reaffirming that we expect to grow our common share dividend at an annual rate of eight to 10 per cent through 2021," added Girling. "Our dividend outlook is supported by expected growth in earnings and cash flow and in line with our historically strong dividend coverage ratios."06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- World markets continue climb higher; US Futures in record territoryThe global equity markets are mostly higher once again with US Futures venturing into all-time high territory for a second straight night.

Also included in the utility's five-year program is the construction of an 88-megawatt simple-cycle, natural gas-fired combustion turbine near Mandan, North Dakota.The capital investment plan at the pipeline and midstream business reflects a focus on organic growth. This includes the Demicks Lake Expansion project under construction in North Dakota, which is expected to be in service in the first quarter of 2020 and as designed will increase capacity by 175 mln cubic feet per day.

The Russell 2000 (-0.3%) closed in negative territory.The day began with the market digesting a tweet from a China-based CNBC reporter, who said she was informed by a Chinese government source that Beijing is pessimistic about a trade deal because President Trump hasn't supported a tariff rollback. Based on the modest losses and ensuing price action, the market presumably remained optimistic about a Phase One agreement.The large-cap indices eased their way into positive territory thanks to the turnarounds in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (+0.3%), information technology (+0.3%), and communication services (+0.3%) sectors. Consistent leaders included the consumer staples (+0.5%) and real estate (+0.5%) sectors, as the negative-sounding trade headline likely fostered some conservative-minded interest.The trade-sensitive industrials (-0.3%) and materials (-0.2%) sectors were among today's laggards, but their losses were small compared to the 1.3% drop in the energy sector, which was pressured by the decline in oil prices ($57.04, -0.71, -1.2%).Generally, there wasn't any concerted effort to sell a market trading at all-time highs, but investors weren't eager to embrace risk, either. The trend has been positive, which has likely drawn in some reluctant investors into the market, and today simply may have been a natural breather for a market breaking out to new highs.Notable corporate news included HP Inc. (HPQ 20.01, -0.17, -0.8%) turning down the takeover bid from Xerox (XRX 39.30, +0.36, +0.9%). HP remained open to a deal, though. Netflix (NFLX 302.57, +7.54, +2.6%) shares outperformed on speculation that either Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman built a large stake in the company.U.S. Treasuries extended last week's advance, pushing yields slightly lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points to 1.81%.

SPE now owns 100% of the multimedia entertainment company. Following the transaction, the Game Show Network channel will continue to be carried on DIRECTV.The sale is consistent with AT&T's strategy to monetize non-strategic assets as it de-levers its balance sheet and begins to retire shares. Prior to the transaction, SPE owned a 58% stake in Game Show Network, and AT&T owned the remaining 42%. In connection with the transaction, AT&T received approx. $500 mln, including proceeds for its equity stake valued at $380 mln (before transaction-related adjustments) and dividends of approx. $130 mln.

In recent items, The Medicines Co (MDCO) makes continued gains today following yesterday's inclisiran data and on rumors of takeover interest; The Medicines Co obtained global rights to develop, manufacture, and commercialize inclisiran under a license and collaboration agreement with co. OKTA (127.29 +5.07%): Upgraded to Buy from Neutral and assigned a $135 price target at DA Davidson, which views pullback in the stock since July as having presented an attractive entry point into the stock, which the firm names as "one of the top SaaS growth stocks."NOW (278.53 +4.59%): Jumped to three-month highs after being appointed to join the S&P 500, effective prior to the open on November 21; co replaces Celgene (CELG) in the index upon that company's acquisition by Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY).Large Cap LosersWORK (21 -9.15%): Reports today indicate that rival Microsoft (MSFT) said that its workplace messaging app, Teams, has now accrued 20 mln daily active users, representing significant growth from its July user count of 13 mln DAUs.

Macy's has guided its fiscal 2020 EPS down 29% at the midpoint to $2.85-3.05, including $0.25 in asset sale gains, with revenue flat yr/yr, comp sales flat to up 1%, and gross margins down slightly. Macy's expects comp sales to improve meaningfully in the fourth quarter, citing a difficult compare in the month of October.The market remains skeptical that the nation's largest department store can generate long-term profit growth given secular challenges.The company's comparable store sales growth has been muted despite the relative strength of consumer spending, which has been supporting the domestic economy.Department stores continue to struggle with lower mall traffic. Last week, the Census Bureau reported core retail sales up 4.2% yr/yr for the three months ending in October, but Department store sales fell 6.1%.With a $4.7 bln market cap, Macy's trades ~6x EPS and ~6x EV/EBITDA, including $3.9 bln in net debt. That represents a slight discount to department store peers. Fortunately, Macy's does have a strong balance sheet, so it can afford to pay its dividend, which yields a robust 9% payout annually.15:15BONDX Treasury Market SummaryLonger Tenors Pad Recent GainsU.S. Treasuries recorded another round of gains on Tuesday, pressuring yields on the 10-yr note and the 30-yr bond into the neighborhood of their respective 50-day moving averages. The Tuesday session bore some resemblance to Monday's affair, as Treasuries started the day with modest losses, recovering them in short order. The early weakness took place after an upbeat start to the European session, which saw the release of strong vehicle registration figures for October. The 10-yr note and the 30-yr bond made it back to their flat lines just minutes after the cash start while shorter tenors also rebounded but took a bit longer before reaching positive territory. Treasuries overtook their morning highs in the early afternoon, remaining near their best levels of the day until the close. The U.S. Dollar Index rose 0.1% to 97.86, snapping a four-day skid. Yield Check: 2-yr: UNCH at 1.59% 3-yr: UNCH at 1.59% 5-yr: UNCH at 1.62% 10-yr: -2 bps to 1.79% 30-yr: -4 bps to 2.26%News: The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow forecast for Q4 GDP was increased to 0.4% from 0.3% following today's housing data.

There was a sizable jump in starts (+8.6%) and permits (+8.2%) for multi-unit dwellings, yet the key takeaway from the report is that starts (+2.0%) and permits (+3.2%) increased for single-family units in an inventory-constrained environment for single-family homes.

LOW has reported EPS upside in four of the past five quarters.The CapitalIQ consensus estimate for Q3 EPS is $1.35. The revenue consensus estimate is $17.69 bln. Note: LOW typically guides for revenue, EPS and comps in the press release for the full year. Its current full year guidance is for adjusted EPS of $5.45-5.65 while sales are expected to increase +2%. It'll be important to see if the company reaffirms or changes this guidance. Same store comps are always a key metric for Lowe's. In Q2 (Jul), comps came in at +2.3% and +3.2% for the US home improvement business. Home Depot (HD) is always a key barometer as to what to expect from Lowe's. HD was not super impressive as comps underwhelmed and HD lowered full year guidance. It's not all doom and gloom for Lowe's because HD cited some internal initiatives that are taking longer to materialize, so much of it may be company-specific and not industry-wide problems. Specifically, HD was emphatic on the call that it "sees a strong and engaged customer" and that "housing is healthy and stable." Another area to watch is tariffs. HD said that tariffs are having an impact but are manageable as its merchants have done a good job at mitigating the impact. Aside from the Home Depot angle, another aspect to this earnings report will be progress on Lowe's turnaround. Despite having a similar number of stores, Lowe's is dwarfed by Home Depot (HD) in terms of annual revenue ($72 bln vs $111 bln for HD) and HD holds a sizeable profitability gap. Lowe's wants to improve merchandising availability, to improve its digital presence/app, to increase the use of self-check-out lanes and cut worker hours to boost productivity. It'll be interesting to get an update on its progress. Overall, our sense is that the weak comps/guidance from Home Depot has lowered expectations for Lowe's this quarter. However, with Lowe's, we think investors are more focused on the bigger picture, namely how is the turnaround going.13:42TPX Tempur Sealy Int'l: US ITC determines mattresses from China injure US industry; Department of Commerce will issue antidumping duty order on imports of this product from China (85.44 -1.05)The United States International Trade Commission (USITC) today determined that a U.S. industry is materially injured by reason of imports of mattresses from China that the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) has determined are sold in the United States at less than fair value. As a result of the USITC's affirmative determination, Commerce will issue an antidumping duty order on imports of this product from China. ITC Release13:15ABMD Abiomed says Abiomed medical office is issuing publication review of observational analysis of Impella that was presented by Amin et al. at the American Heart Association Conference on November 17 (186.19 +8.10)According to the company, the AHA analysis is flawed because:The data source has significant limitations, containing just a fraction of Impella patients and unable to delineate between common adverse events.The Impella patients were much sicker and had greater baseline and procedural risks.The analysis excluded the costliest IABP patients who were escalated to other therapies.Additionally, the conclusion is aggressive because administrative coding data cannot delineate between adverse events common to high-risk patients and device related events.13:08SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: ACB (37.93 mln +2.94%), TEVA (22.61 mln +0.97%), BMY (19.42 mln -1.7%), CELG (13.89 mln -0.93%), CLVS (13.81 mln +6.23%)Industrials: GE (17.95 mln -0.6%)Consumer Discretionary: M (32.83 mln -10.04%), ROKU (21.57 mln -1.82%), KSS (19.77 mln -18.61%), NIO (18.01 mln +3.06%), F (17.54 mln -0.28%)Information Technology: AMD (54.78 mln +2.61%), NOK (20.12 mln -0.72%)Financials: BAC (17.88 mln -0.27%)Energy: CHK (55.18 mln -8.31%), ET (13.13 mln -1.99%), ECA (12.04 mln -4.56%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: MDCO (6.75x +19.55%), CRSP (5.7x +16.03%), EDIT (3.67x +11.4%), ATNX (3.12x +34.53%), CELG (2.97x -0.93%), NTLA (2.83x +12.13%)Materials: ASH (3.23x -4.14%)Industrials: WWD (3.27x -0.37%)Consumer Discretionary: KSS (6.3x -18.61%), HD (3.61x -5.23%)Information Technology: JKS (4.05x +12.71%)Financials: EFC (18.2x -3.03%), GBDC (3.31x +1.91%)Consumer Staples: CHEF (3.43x -8.38%)Utilities: DUK (3.42x -1.97%), ELP (3.22x +2.42%)13:06SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: ATNX (15.39 +34.53%), MDCO (70.12 +19.55%), BCRX (2 +17.35%), CRSP (67.92 +16.03%), NTLA (15.25 +12.13%), DRNA (23.87 +11.59%), EDIT (25.79 +11.4%), ARQL (8.4 +10.67%), APHA (4.21 +10.08%), TCDA (37.66 +9.92%), BOLD (28.08 +9.9%), WVE (31.02 +8.58%), TBIO (10.45 +8.52%), ASND (115.61 +8.07%), GLYC (6.18 +8.04%), AMRX (3.05 +7.6%), PRQR (6.71 +7.36%), PRTA (10.99 +7.28%)Information Technology: JKS (16.76 +12.71%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: VAPO (10.77 -7.08%)Industrials: BLDP (6.52 -10.19%)Consumer Discretionary: KSS (47.53 -18.61%), M (15.19 -10.04%), SIG (15.7 -8.61%)Financials: PPDF (2.5 -12.89%), JT (1.86 -10.39%), YRD (5.51 -9.97%)Energy: KLXE (5.44 -26.19%), UNT (0.72 -11.3%), CRC (7.58 -10.67%), ESV (3.82 -8.95%), SPN (0.33 -8.45%), CHK (0.59 -8.31%), EXTN (6.31 -7.82%), TUSK (1.38 -7.38%), PVAC (24.25 -7.35%)Consumer Staples: CHEF (32.57 -8.38%), DF (0.07 -7.5%)12:57WRAPX Midday Market Summary: Stock market trades mixed; Home Depot, Kohl's weigh on retail spaceThe S&P 500 is currently down 0.1% in midday action, with weakness concentrated in the retail space following disappointing quarterly results and guidance from Home Depot (HD 226.39, -12.46, -5.2%) and Kohl's (KSS 47.58, -10.82, -18.5%).The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.4%, but the Nasdaq Composite (+0.2%) and Russell 2000 (+0.4%) trade higher.The underperformance of the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 44.12, -0.71, -1.6%) best displays the negative sentiment that has subsumed the retail industry today. Both the Dow and S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (-0.8%), meanwhile, can attribute their underperformance to Home Depot.The S&P 500 energy sector (-1.1%) is down even more amid a sharp decline in oil prices ($55.69, -1.45, -2.5%), but the market isn't getting concerned about the U.S. consumer based on a couple of reports. Instead, the market is hanging in there amid gains in the heavily-weighted health care (+0.3%), information technology (+0.1%), and financials (+0.1%) sectors.The consensus among many investors is that the market is due for a pullback, but the absence of one has created a sort of pain trade for investors fearful of missing out on further gains. The S&P 500 was down just 0.3% at its low earlier today before a buy-the-dip effort briefly brought it back above its flat line.Separately, shares of AT&T (T 37.65, -1.99) are down 5.0% after the stock was downgraded to Sell from Neutral at MoffettNathanson with a price target of $30. Shares of Slack (WORK 20.88, -2.24, -9.7%) are down 10% on news that Microsoft's (MSFT 150.99, +0.65, +0.4%) competitive product, Teams, has increased daily active users by nearly 50% since July.In the Treasury market, demand for longer-dated bonds has caused some minor curve-flattening activity. The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.79%. The U.S. Dollar Index is flat at 97.79.Today's economic calendar was limited to Housing Starts and Building Permits for October:Total housing starts increased 3.8% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.314 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.300 million) while total building permits increased 5.0% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.461 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.365 million).There was a sizable jump in starts (+8.6%) and permits (+8.2%) for multi-unit dwellings, yet the key takeaway from the report is that starts (+2.0%) and permits (+3.2%) increased for single-family units in an inventory-constrained environment for single-family homes.12:45MRK Merck increases quarterly dividend to $0.61 from $0.55/share (84.21 +0.08)12:25SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Myovant Sciences (MYOV) gains on Phase 3 relugolix data -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersMYOV (10.86 +79.21%): Announced results from the Phase 3 HERO study of once-daily, oral relugolix in men with advanced prostate cancer; the trial met its primary efficacy endpoint and all six key secondary endpoints -- in the primary endpoint responder analysis, 96.7% of men receiving the relugolix regimen achieved sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels through 48 weeks. These results, noted co, support NDA submission to the FDA in Q2 of 2020 and future regulatory submissions in Europe and Japan. Jumps to six-month highs. ATNX (15.12 +32.12%): Moves to its highest levels since August after previewing its presentation at the 2019 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium; co's abstract for the Phase 3 study of oral paclitaxel and encequidar in metastatic breast cancer has been selected for the conference's press program. DRNA (23.72 +10.89%): Price target raised to $30 from $22 at H.C. Wainwright, citing a positive view of co's new strategic alliance with Novo Nordisk (NVO), which was announced yesterday; the firm views the deal as underscoring a "Burgeoning RNAi Powerhouse." Continued strength sees the stock touch up to new four-year highs.Small Cap LosersI (6.19 -22.91%): Continued weakness following FCC Chairman Ajit Pai's announcement midday yesterday of support for a public auction of 280 megahertz of the C-band spectrum; the C-Band Alliance, a satellite operator group of which co is a member, issued a statement yesterday following the Chairman's communication, noting, among other comments, that the announcement "does not address the critical involvement of the incumbent satellite operators in executing the complex task of reconfiguring and transitioning their networks." Following yesterday's developments, the stock was downgraded to In-Line from Outperform at Evercore ISI, which also cut co's price target to $11 from $38; JPMorgan lowered co's target to $9 from $22. Wells Fargo noted that embrace of a public auction "does not seem to offer much potential capital to the satellite players" and also noted the impact that the public approach will have on timing, saying, "Getting this spectrum auctioned off in 1H 2020 (as the C-Band Alliance plan had outlined) seems naively optimistic at this point." The stock again records new 52-week lows, now down circa 76% month-to-date. PPDF (2.53 -11.85%): Missed estimates for Q3 EPS and revs (+35.0% yr/yr to RMB1.51 bln). Cumulative registered users increased to approx. 102.8 mln while cumulative number of borrowers reached 17.4 mln as of September 30; number of unique borrowers increased +28.6% yr/yr. Co expects total loan origination volume between RMB16-19 bln for Q4. Co also noted that it plans to discontinue its online information intermediary business between individual borrowers and individual investors. At all-time lows. PLUG (3.33 -11.12%): Pulls back from yesterday's four-year highs with above average volume; factoring in today's move, the stock continues to trade higher by circa +26% month-to-date.11:59SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (95) outpacing new lows (63) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: AAPL, AES, AGEN, AIZ, ALL, AMD, AME, AMED, ANSS, AON, APD, ARDX, ARMK, ARVN, ARWR, ATEC, ATRS, AVGO, AZO, BIO, BIP, BLDR, BLK, BLMN, BRO, CACI, CATM, CDE, CDW, CLH, CPRT, CRSP, CSGS, CSL, CVNA, CZR, DEA, DEI, DKS, DOX, DRNA, DXCM, EIDX, EPAM, ESE, EVRI, EW, FISV, FNF, FTNT, GLIBA, GPN, HALO, HIG, INFO, INOV, INST, KMX, KRG, KRTX, LDOS, LIN, LPT, LULU, LXP, LZB, MCO, MDCO, MGM, MMC, MSCI, MSFT, NSIT, OC, PFSI, PLMR, PRFT, RDN, RLI, SEM, SHOO, SPGI, TDY, TJX, TMO, TROW, TRU, UI, USB, VAC, VRTX, XBIT, XPEL, XRX, ZYMEStocks that traded to 52 week lows: AM, AR, ASIX, BCEI, BIG, BTU, BXC, CDEV, CEIX, CHK, CNP, CPS, CRZO, CTRA, CVEO, DCP, ENBL, ENLC, EQM, ETRN, EXPE, EXTN, EZPW, FLNT, FOSL, FPRX, FTSI, GLOG, GLOP, GSM, GTE, GTLS, I, IIVI, KLXE, LBRT, MDR, MPLX, NEWM, NVEE, OAS, PAA, PAGP, PBT, PNNT, PRMW, QUAD, RBBN, RVLV, SDRL, SINA, SMLP, SNH, TCO, TCS, TDW, TH, TRIP, UPWK, VG, VNOM, WES, WLLThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: CABO, FWONA, IHC, LACQ, NWPX, PLOW, WDFCETFs that traded to 52 week highs: CUT, DIA, EWC, EWG, EWQ, EZU, FAN, GREK, IAI, IOO, ITA, IWF, IYF, IYG, IYH, IYJ, KCE, OEF, QQQ, SPY, UYG, VGK, VTI, XLKETFs that traded to 52 week lows: AMJ, VXX, XES11:53TALKX Market Briefing: Price action getting technicalThere hasn't been a lot of conviction in the morning session, evidenced by an S&P 500 that is basically unchanged through the first two hours of trading.Retail stocks have been a notable pocket of weakness following the disappointments from Home Depot (HD 226.88, -11.98, -5.0%) and Kohl's (KSS 48.21, -10.19, -17.5%). Their weakness has acted as a weight on the broader market, yet the movement of the S&P 500 index has been largely a function of technical price action.Briefing.com's Technical Take page identified 3127 as a secondary resistance level for the S&P 500. That level was tested with the opening move (3127.64) but quickly failed as steady selling eventually dropped the S&P 500 back to 3113.46 at this morning's low, which was reached just before 11:00 a.m. ET. That level fell within a secondary support level (3115/3112) that was also identified on the Technical Take Page.Traders, therefore, appear to be respecting these technical boundaries for now on a day that is devoid of any major macro news drivers, particularly as they relate to trade, and as it is suggested that the market is short-term overextended and due for a pullback.The Russell 2000 is up 0.4%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.3%; the S&P 500 is unchanged; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.4%.11:51QCOM Qualcomm issues 3 year targets at Analyst Day (88.73 -1.78)From CFO's presentation at Analyst Day:3 year targets as earnings mix shift to QCT from QTLRevenue: QCT segment SAM: 10% CAGR, grow faster than SAM and Apple product revenues QTL: current run rate + Huawei resolution Operating margin: QCT grows to >20%; QTL: ~70%Summarizing Qualcomm opportunities: Mature handset industry and current macroeconomic environment; Accelerated 5G migration compared to 4G; Mobile handset platform: 4G->5G transition, RF Front-End growth; Growth beyond mobile: Auto, IoT, Compute, ADAS, Cloud/Edge AI 75+ 5G licenses including key anchor agreements.Grow earnings faster than revenues.

The ACHIEVE II trial evaluated ubrogepant 50 mg and 25 mg, compared with placebo, across a wide range of clinical endpoints, including the co-primary endpoints of pain freedom (no pain) and freedom from the most bothersome migraine-associated symptom at two hours post-initial dose. For the two co-primary endpoints, ubrogepant 50 mg and 25 mg showed statistically significant higher response rates for pain freedom at two hours (21.8% for 50 mg, 20.7% for 25 mg and 14.3% for placebo), and the 50 mg dose demonstrated statistically significant higher response rates for the freedom from the most bothersome migraine-associated symptom at two hours (38.9% for 50 mg and 27.4% for placebo). Additionally, ubrogepant 50 mg was statistically superior to placebo in the absence of light sensitivity (43.8% for 50 mg and 35.5% for placebo) and sound sensitivity (54.1% for 50 mg and 46.3% for placebo).FDA action on the NDA for ubrogepant is expected in December 2019, potentially making it the first oral CGRP to address unmet patient needs in acute treatment of migraine and the first FDA-approved gepant.11:21XLE Sector Briefing: Energy (58.71 -0.65)The energy sector (-1.1%) sits at the bottom of today's sector standings after showing relative weakness yesterday. The growth-sensitive sector is now down 2.4% since Friday versus a much more modest 0.1% week-to-date downtick in the S&P 500. Factors contributing to the underperformance:Notable pressure on crude oil. The energy component is down more than $1.00 today (-2.3%) and down $2.01 (-3.5%) since Friday's settlement. This has sent the price of oil beneath its 200-day moving average (57.37) with the 50-day average (55.65) looming just below. Tax-loss related selling. The energy sector has been the weakest performer of 2019, meaning the group contains a fair share of names that have underperformed since the end of 2018. These names are more likely to be sold before the end of 2019 as investors look to reduce some of the tax impact of taking capital gains this year.Notable movers:HollyFrontier (HFC 51.56, -2.35, -4.4%): falling to its lowest level since early October. The company announced a new project and a new buyback authorization yesterday morning. Noble Energy (NBL 19.41, -0.51, -2.6%): nearing its 2019 low after finding resistance at its 50-day moving average (21.34) at the end of last week. Marathon Petroleum (MPC 62.13, -1.88, -2.9%): falling to its 50-day moving average (61.89). Occidental Petroleum (OXY 38.20, -1.10, -2.8%): on the verge of hitting fresh low for the year. Helmerich & Payne (HP 37.79, -1.05, -2.7%): nearing its 2019 low after being downgraded to Hold from Buy at Argus. ConocoPhillips (COP 57.26, +0.56, +1.0%): best performing sector component, reclaiming its 50-day moving average (57.03). The company is hosting its analyst & investor meeting today, where it is expected to reaffirm its commitment to a strategy unveiled in 2016.10:35OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:DO Jan20 5 calls are seeing interest with 4230 contracts trading vs. open int of 0, pushing implied vol up around 10 points to ~87%.

That corner is the retail industry, which has been broadsided today by disappointing earnings/sales results and guidance from Home Depot (HD 226.60, -12.25, -5.1%) and Kohl's (KSS 48.09, -10.31, -17.7%).The weakness in HD is having an outsized impact on the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (-0.9%); meanwhile, the combined impact of the disappointments from these well-known retailers is creating some angst about consumer spending activity entering the all-important holiday selling season.That angst is showing up in a sympathy trade that has knocked down the prices of many other retail stocks today, like Macy's (M 15.36, -1.51, -9.0%), Best Buy (BBY 75.61, -1.68, -2.2%), and Gap (GPS 16.62, -0.68, -3.9%) to name a few. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.97, -0.85, -1.9%) reflects the broader trend of underperformance for the retailers in today's market action.Those issues notwithstanding, the broader market is still holding up just fine as it is drawing influential support from the information technology (+0.3%), healthcare (+0.3%), and financial (+0.2%) sectors, which continue to attract interest from value and growth-minded investors alike.Separately, the market's overall resilience to selling pressure remains a tying factor for a number of participants who are fearful of missing out on further gains. That fear, ostensibly, is lending some buying support that has kept downside pressure in check.The Russell 2000 is up 0.2%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.1%; the S&P 500 is down 0.1%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%.10:00XLY Sector Briefing: Consumer Discretionary (120.74 -1.05)The consumer discretionary sector (-0.8%) represents an early pocket of relative weakness in a flat market. This makes for a continuation of this month's underperformance, which has the sector trading down 0.3% since the end of October versus a 2.8% gain in the S&P 500. Factors contributing to today's underperformance:Home Depot's (HD 227.72, -11.13, -4.7%) Q3 earnings report, which showed lower than expected revenue and lowered comparable sales guidance for FY20. Granted, Home Depot met Q3 EPS expectations, but the revenue shortfall and lowered comparable sales guidance have pressured the stock from a record high. Furthermore, the outlook is leading to some questions about the overall strength of consumer spending. Disappointing Q3 results and lowered FY20 guidance from Kohl's (KSS 48.86, -9.54, -16.4%), fueling worries that other apparel retailers could also report underwhelming results.Notable movers:Home Depot (HD 227.72, -11.13, -4.7%): falling back below its 50-day moving average (232.37) after setting a fresh record high on Monday.

Macy's (M 15.35, -1.53, -9.0%): sliding back below its 50-day moving average (15.76) after weak results from Kohl's. Nordstrom (JWN 35.10, -2.78, -7.3%): falling below its 200-day moving average (36.33) and toward its 50-day moving average (34.94) in sympathy with Kohl's. Gap (GPS 16.70, -0.60, -3.4%): approaching its October low after Kohl's disappointing results. TJX (TJX 60.68, +1.13, +1.9%): touched a fresh record after better than expected Q3 results overshadowed below-consensus Q4 EPS guidance.

For the study to be successful, the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of the response rate had to be at least 90%.The study achieved all six key secondary endpoints, including superiority to leuprolide acetate on rapid suppression of testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA), all with p-values <0.0001.Five key secondary endpoints demonstrated superiority to leuprolide acetate, including rapid suppression of testosterone at Day 4 and Day 15, profound suppression of testosterone at Day 15, rapid suppression of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at Day 15, and suppression of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) at Week 24 (all p-values <0.0001). In addition, relugolix demonstrated non-inferiority to leuprolide acetate on sustained testosterone suppression through 48 weeks (96.7% vs. 88.8%, respectively) with a between-group difference of 7.9% (95% CI: 4.1%,11.8%), the primary endpoint required for regulatory submissions outside of the U.S. In addition, the pharmacodynamic results showed no testosterone flare after initiation of relugolix and mean testosterone levels returned to normal levels within 90 days after treatment discontinuation.A New Drug Application (NDA) submission is expected in the second quarter of 2020.A conference call and webcast are to be held today at 8:30 a.m. EST / 5:30 a.m. PST.07:32SRRK Scholar Rock announces preliminary pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic results from the TOPAZ Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial of SRK-015 for the treatment of patients with spinal muscular atrophy (7.20 )The planned preliminary PK/PD analysis, which includes data from 29 patients with SMA across all three cohorts, showed dose-proportional drug exposure and demonstrated target engagement, as evidenced by dose-dependent increases of up to 100-fold in the serum levels of latent myostatin following SRK-015 treatment (2 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg doses).

Khoury, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of KLX Energy Services commented, "Contemporaneously with the abrupt decline in activity, we took steps to align our business with current customer demand. Specifically, we implemented an approximate 17 percent reduction in force, as compared with the Company's July 31, 2019 staffing levels, consistent with the approximate 18 percent sequential quarterly decline in our third quarter revenues. We aggressively cut costs in every area of our business, and we warm stacked the vast majority of our Permian based wireline assets. As a result of these and other measures, we expect to take a third quarter charge of approximately $13 million. Notwithstanding the precipitous decline in industry conditions, we generated approximately $44 million in cash flow from operations and approximately $31 million in free cash flow, bringing our cash balance to approximately $121 million for the quarter ended October 31, 2019. In addition, our $100 million credit facility remains undrawn.""The abrupt deterioration in industry conditions, which accelerated through the end of our third quarter, was driven by a sharp sequential quarterly decline in U.S. land rig count and an unprecedented decline in active frac spreads from the second quarter to the third quarter. In fact, there was a significant sequential decline in hydraulic fracturing activity during each month of the third quarter. The decline in Exploration & Production activity resulted in lower demand levels and lower current and expected revenues for our business, which led the Company to accelerate its annual testing for asset impairment into the third quarter. While the Company has not yet completed this analysis, we expect to report a non-cash asset impairment charge in the range of approximately $45 million to $60 million. The Company is in the process of finalizing the actual amount of the impairment charge, which will be completed prior to reporting its third quarter financial results."06:00CEO CNOOC Ltd names President Xu Keqiang as CEO (152.50 )06:00TRP TC Energy to provide financial update and review strategic plans at Investor Day, reaffirms expectation to grow common share dividend at an annual rate of 8-10% through 2021 (51.44 )"Our $100 billion portfolio of high-quality, long-life energy infrastructure assets are expected to generate record financial results again in 2019 underpinned by strong market fundamentals," said Russ Girling, TC Energy's president and chief executive officer. "Looking forward, we continue to advance $30 billion of commercially secured projects that will expand and extend our asset footprint across North America."As those projects enter service, TC Energy expects comparable earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to exceed $10 billion in 2022. This represents an increase of more than 16 per cent when compared to comparable EBITDA of $8.6 billion in 2018 despite significant asset sales that have accelerated the strengthening of the company's balance sheet. Notably, approximately 95 per cent of comparable EBITDA is expected to come from regulated assets or long-term contracts. At the same time, the company continues to methodically advance more than $20 billion of projects under development including Keystone XL and the Bruce Power life extension program. Success in advancing these and other organic growth opportunities that are expected to emanate from TC Energy's five operating businesses across North America would add to the company's growth outlook."Based on the confidence we have in our business plans, we are reaffirming that we expect to grow our common share dividend at an annual rate of eight to 10 per cent through 2021," added Girling. "Our dividend outlook is supported by expected growth in earnings and cash flow and in line with our historically strong dividend coverage ratios."06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- World markets continue climb higher; US Futures in record territoryThe global equity markets are mostly higher once again with US Futures venturing into all-time high territory for a second straight night.

The Russell 2000 (-0.3%) closed in negative territory.The day began with the market digesting a tweet from a China-based CNBC reporter, who said she was informed by a Chinese government source that Beijing is pessimistic about a trade deal because President Trump hasn't supported a tariff rollback. Based on the modest losses and ensuing price action, the market presumably remained optimistic about a Phase One agreement.The large-cap indices eased their way into positive territory thanks to the turnarounds in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (+0.3%), information technology (+0.3%), and communication services (+0.3%) sectors. Consistent leaders included the consumer staples (+0.5%) and real estate (+0.5%) sectors, as the negative-sounding trade headline likely fostered some conservative-minded interest.The trade-sensitive industrials (-0.3%) and materials (-0.2%) sectors were among today's laggards, but their losses were small compared to the 1.3% drop in the energy sector, which was pressured by the decline in oil prices ($57.04, -0.71, -1.2%).Generally, there wasn't any concerted effort to sell a market trading at all-time highs, but investors weren't eager to embrace risk, either. The trend has been positive, which has likely drawn in some reluctant investors into the market, and today simply may have been a natural breather for a market breaking out to new highs.Notable corporate news included HP Inc. (HPQ 20.01, -0.17, -0.8%) turning down the takeover bid from Xerox (XRX 39.30, +0.36, +0.9%). HP remained open to a deal, though. Netflix (NFLX 302.57, +7.54, +2.6%) shares outperformed on speculation that either Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman built a large stake in the company.U.S. Treasuries extended last week's advance, pushing yields slightly lower across the curve.

Prior to the transaction, SPE owned a 58% stake in Game Show Network, and AT&T owned the remaining 42%. In connection with the transaction, AT&T received approx. $500 mln, including proceeds for its equity stake valued at $380 mln (before transaction-related adjustments) and dividends of approx. $130 mln.

The retail industry was under pressure following disappointing quarterly results and guidance from Home Depot (HD 225.86, -12.99, -5.4%) and Kohl's (KSS 47.02, -11.38, -19.5%).The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.4%) also finished lower, while the Nasdaq Composite (+0.2%) and Russell 2000 (+0.4%) finished higher. The Nasdaq closed at another record high.The session began with each of the large-cap indices setting intraday highs despite the negative sentiment in the retail space. The early advance quickly faltered but overall losses were modest, and transient, as the S&P 500 only dipped 0.3% below its flat line before buyers quickly stepped in to buy the dip.The retail space didn't benefit from an opportunistic mindset, though, as the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.95, -0.87, -1.9%) finished near its lows like the S&P 500 energy (-1.5%) and consumer discretionary (-1.0%) sectors. Home Depot dragged on the consumer discretionary sector while a 3% drop in WTI crude ($55.21, -1.84, -3.2%) weighed on the energy space.Gains were mainly found in the heavily-weighted S&P 500 health care (+0.7%), information technology (+0.2%), and financials (+0.2%) sectors. The real estate sector (+0.2%) also finished in positive territory.TJX Companies (TJX 60.64, +1.09, +1.8%) was a bright spot among the retailers after it beat top and bottom-line estimates and raised its full-year guidance. TJX likely tempered some concerns about U.S. consumer spending for the holiday shopping season that may have been engendered by Home Depot and Kohl's.Separately, shares of AT&T (T 38.00, -1.63, -4.1%) pulled back 4% after the stock was downgraded to Sell from Neutral at MoffettNathanson. Shares of Slack (WORK 21.18, -1.93, -8.4%) sold off on news that Microsoft's (MSFT 150.39, +0.05, unch) competitive product, Teams, increased daily active users by nearly 50% since July.The U.S. Treasury market was relatively quiet, but demand for longer-dated bonds contributed to some curve-flattening activity. The 2-yr yield was unchanged at 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.79%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 97.85.Tuesday's economic calendar was limited to Housing Starts and Building Permits for October:Total housing starts increased 3.8% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.314 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.300 million) while total building permits increased 5.0% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.461 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.365 million).There was a sizable jump in starts (+8.6%) and permits (+8.2%) for multi-unit dwellings, yet the key takeaway from the report is that starts (+2.0%) and permits (+3.2%) increased for single-family units in an inventory-constrained environment for single-family homes.Looking ahead, the FOMC Minutes from the October 30-31 meeting and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index will be released on Wednesday.Nasdaq Composite +29.2% YTDS&P 500 +24.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +19.8% YTDRussell 2000 +18.5% YTD16:24MGP MGM Growth Properties commences public offering of 24.0 mln Class A shares (32.49 -0.37)The company expects that it will issue and sell 12,000,000 shares directly to the underwriters at closing and that the underwriters will purchase, at the request of the company, 12,000,000 shares from forward purchasers under forward sale agreements.The company plans to use proceeds primarily to repay a portion of the borrowings outstanding under its senior secured term loan A facility and senior secured term loan B facility, which the company believes will well-position it to be able to agree to and consummate a potential JV transaction under discussion with MGM Resorts International and honor any potential redemption of units representing limited partnership units in MGM Growth Properties Operating Partnership LP held by MGM for cash, should MGM elect to exercise any redemption right, if the company decides to pursue such a transaction, or, alternatively, for general corporate purposes.16:24PAGS PagSeguro Digital misses by BRL0.02, misses on revs (36.76 -1.01)Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of BRL 1.18 per share, excluding non-recurring items, BRL 0.02 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of BRL 1.20; revenues rose 30.3% year/year to BRL 1.46 bln vs the BRL 1.5 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Active merchants of 5.0 million, growth of 1.2 million active merchants in the last twelve months; R$29.4 billion in total payment volume, up 45.0% compared with 3Q18;16:20FLNT Fluent authorizes the repurchase of up to $5 mln shares of common stock (1.42 +0.11)16:18MTB M&T Bank increases quarterly cash dividend to $1.10/share from $1.00/share (162.88 -0.09)16:17FIX Comfort Systems increases stock repurchase program (50.40 -0.11)Board of Directors has approved an amendment to the stock repurchase program to increase the shares authorized and remaining as available to purchase back up to 1,000,000 shares by authorizing the Company to acquire up to 764,760 additional shares of its outstanding common stock.16:17AVID Avid Tech at Investor Day guided FY20 adj.

Macy's has guided its fiscal 2020 EPS down 29% at the midpoint to $2.85-3.05, including $0.25 in asset sale gains, with revenue flat yr/yr, comp sales flat to up 1%, and gross margins down slightly. Macy's expects comp sales to improve meaningfully in the fourth quarter, citing a difficult compare in the month of October.The market remains skeptical that the nation's largest department store can generate long-term profit growth given secular challenges.The company's comparable store sales growth has been muted despite the relative strength of consumer spending, which has been supporting the domestic economy.Department stores continue to struggle with lower mall traffic. Last week, the Census Bureau reported core retail sales up 4.2% yr/yr for the three months ending in October, but Department store sales fell 6.1%.With a $4.7 bln market cap, Macy's trades ~6x EPS and ~6x EV/EBITDA, including $3.9 bln in net debt. That represents a slight discount to department store peers. Fortunately, Macy's does have a strong balance sheet, so it can afford to pay its dividend, which yields a robust 9% payout annually.15:15BONDX Treasury Market SummaryLonger Tenors Pad Recent GainsU.S. Treasuries recorded another round of gains on Tuesday, pressuring yields on the 10-yr note and the 30-yr bond into the neighborhood of their respective 50-day moving averages. The Tuesday session bore some resemblance to Monday's affair, as Treasuries started the day with modest losses, recovering them in short order. The early weakness took place after an upbeat start to the European session, which saw the release of strong vehicle registration figures for October. The 10-yr note and the 30-yr bond made it back to their flat lines just minutes after the cash start while shorter tenors also rebounded but took a bit longer before reaching positive territory. Treasuries overtook their morning highs in the early afternoon, remaining near their best levels of the day until the close. The U.S. Dollar Index rose 0.1% to 97.86, snapping a four-day skid. Yield Check: 2-yr: UNCH at 1.59% 3-yr: UNCH at 1.59% 5-yr: UNCH at 1.62% 10-yr: -2 bps to 1.79% 30-yr: -4 bps to 2.26%News: The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow forecast for Q4 GDP was increased to 0.4% from 0.3% following today's housing data.

Italy's September Industrial New Orders increased 1.0% m/m (expected -1.5%; last 0.8%), rising 0.3% yr/yr (expected -3.9%; last -10.4%). September Industrial Sales ticked up 0.2% m/m (expected -0.4%; last -0.3%) but fell 1.6% yr/yr (expected -1.0%; last -2.2%). New car registrations in the eurozone increased 8.7% yr/yr, representing the strongest growth rate in a decade. Car registrations through the first ten months of 2019 are down 0.7% yr/yr. Today's Data: Total housing starts increased 3.8% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.314 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.300 million) while total building permits increased 5.0% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.461 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.365 million). There was a sizable jump in starts (+8.6%) and permits (+8.2%) for multi-unit dwellings, yet the key takeaway from the report is that starts (+2.0%) and permits (+3.2%) increased for single-family units in an inventory-constrained environment for single-family homes.

Co characterized the August back-to-school season as "successful" and noted that it "ended strong in October"; during the call, co acknowledged that it "experienced softness during the middle of the quarter, as [it] saw an increasingly competitive promotional environment" and saw modest disruption from the launch of new brands and warm weather. Its Women's business performed below the company average.

LOW has reported EPS upside in four of the past five quarters.The CapitalIQ consensus estimate for Q3 EPS is $1.35. The revenue consensus estimate is $17.69 bln. Note: LOW typically guides for revenue, EPS and comps in the press release for the full year. Its current full year guidance is for adjusted EPS of $5.45-5.65 while sales are expected to increase +2%. It'll be important to see if the company reaffirms or changes this guidance. Same store comps are always a key metric for Lowe's. In Q2 (Jul), comps came in at +2.3% and +3.2% for the US home improvement business. Home Depot (HD) is always a key barometer as to what to expect from Lowe's. HD was not super impressive as comps underwhelmed and HD lowered full year guidance. It's not all doom and gloom for Lowe's because HD cited some internal initiatives that are taking longer to materialize, so much of it may be company-specific and not industry-wide problems. Specifically, HD was emphatic on the call that it "sees a strong and engaged customer" and that "housing is healthy and stable." Another area to watch is tariffs. HD said that tariffs are having an impact but are manageable as its merchants have done a good job at mitigating the impact. Aside from the Home Depot angle, another aspect to this earnings report will be progress on Lowe's turnaround. Despite having a similar number of stores, Lowe's is dwarfed by Home Depot (HD) in terms of annual revenue ($72 bln vs $111 bln for HD) and HD holds a sizeable profitability gap. Lowe's wants to improve merchandising availability, to improve its digital presence/app, to increase the use of self-check-out lanes and cut worker hours to boost productivity. It'll be interesting to get an update on its progress. Overall, our sense is that the weak comps/guidance from Home Depot has lowered expectations for Lowe's this quarter. However, with Lowe's, we think investors are more focused on the bigger picture, namely how is the turnaround going.13:42TPX Tempur Sealy Int'l: US ITC determines mattresses from China injure US industry; Department of Commerce will issue antidumping duty order on imports of this product from China (85.44 -1.05)The United States International Trade Commission (USITC) today determined that a U.S. industry is materially injured by reason of imports of mattresses from China that the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) has determined are sold in the United States at less than fair value.

ITC Release13:15ABMD Abiomed says Abiomed medical office is issuing publication review of observational analysis of Impella that was presented by Amin et al. at the American Heart Association Conference on November 17 (186.19 +8.10)According to the company, the AHA analysis is flawed because:The data source has significant limitations, containing just a fraction of Impella patients and unable to delineate between common adverse events.The Impella patients were much sicker and had greater baseline and procedural risks.The analysis excluded the costliest IABP patients who were escalated to other therapies.Additionally, the conclusion is aggressive because administrative coding data cannot delineate between adverse events common to high-risk patients and device related events.13:08SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: ACB (37.93 mln +2.94%), TEVA (22.61 mln +0.97%), BMY (19.42 mln -1.7%), CELG (13.89 mln -0.93%), CLVS (13.81 mln +6.23%)Industrials: GE (17.95 mln -0.6%)Consumer Discretionary: M (32.83 mln -10.04%), ROKU (21.57 mln -1.82%), KSS (19.77 mln -18.61%), NIO (18.01 mln +3.06%), F (17.54 mln -0.28%)Information Technology: AMD (54.78 mln +2.61%), NOK (20.12 mln -0.72%)Financials: BAC (17.88 mln -0.27%)Energy: CHK (55.18 mln -8.31%), ET (13.13 mln -1.99%), ECA (12.04 mln -4.56%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: MDCO (6.75x +19.55%), CRSP (5.7x +16.03%), EDIT (3.67x +11.4%), ATNX (3.12x +34.53%), CELG (2.97x -0.93%), NTLA (2.83x +12.13%)Materials: ASH (3.23x -4.14%)Industrials: WWD (3.27x -0.37%)Consumer Discretionary: KSS (6.3x -18.61%), HD (3.61x -5.23%)Information Technology: JKS (4.05x +12.71%)Financials: EFC (18.2x -3.03%), GBDC (3.31x +1.91%)Consumer Staples: CHEF (3.43x -8.38%)Utilities: DUK (3.42x -1.97%), ELP (3.22x +2.42%)13:06SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: ATNX (15.39 +34.53%), MDCO (70.12 +19.55%), BCRX (2 +17.35%), CRSP (67.92 +16.03%), NTLA (15.25 +12.13%), DRNA (23.87 +11.59%), EDIT (25.79 +11.4%), ARQL (8.4 +10.67%), APHA (4.21 +10.08%), TCDA (37.66 +9.92%), BOLD (28.08 +9.9%), WVE (31.02 +8.58%), TBIO (10.45 +8.52%), ASND (115.61 +8.07%), GLYC (6.18 +8.04%), AMRX (3.05 +7.6%), PRQR (6.71 +7.36%), PRTA (10.99 +7.28%)Information Technology: JKS (16.76 +12.71%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: VAPO (10.77 -7.08%)Industrials: BLDP (6.52 -10.19%)Consumer Discretionary: KSS (47.53 -18.61%), M (15.19 -10.04%), SIG (15.7 -8.61%)Financials: PPDF (2.5 -12.89%), JT (1.86 -10.39%), YRD (5.51 -9.97%)Energy: KLXE (5.44 -26.19%), UNT (0.72 -11.3%), CRC (7.58 -10.67%), ESV (3.82 -8.95%), SPN (0.33 -8.45%), CHK (0.59 -8.31%), EXTN (6.31 -7.82%), TUSK (1.38 -7.38%), PVAC (24.25 -7.35%)Consumer Staples: CHEF (32.57 -8.38%), DF (0.07 -7.5%)12:57WRAPX Midday Market Summary: Stock market trades mixed; Home Depot, Kohl's weigh on retail spaceThe S&P 500 is currently down 0.1% in midday action, with weakness concentrated in the retail space following disappointing quarterly results and guidance from Home Depot (HD 226.39, -12.46, -5.2%) and Kohl's (KSS 47.58, -10.82, -18.5%).The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.4%, but the Nasdaq Composite (+0.2%) and Russell 2000 (+0.4%) trade higher.The underperformance of the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 44.12, -0.71, -1.6%) best displays the negative sentiment that has subsumed the retail industry today. Both the Dow and S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (-0.8%), meanwhile, can attribute their underperformance to Home Depot.The S&P 500 energy sector (-1.1%) is down even more amid a sharp decline in oil prices ($55.69, -1.45, -2.5%), but the market isn't getting concerned about the U.S. consumer based on a couple of reports. Instead, the market is hanging in there amid gains in the heavily-weighted health care (+0.3%), information technology (+0.1%), and financials (+0.1%) sectors.The consensus among many investors is that the market is due for a pullback, but the absence of one has created a sort of pain trade for investors fearful of missing out on further gains. The S&P 500 was down just 0.3% at its low earlier today before a buy-the-dip effort briefly brought it back above its flat line.Separately, shares of AT&T (T 37.65, -1.99) are down 5.0% after the stock was downgraded to Sell from Neutral at MoffettNathanson with a price target of $30. Shares of Slack (WORK 20.88, -2.24, -9.7%) are down 10% on news that Microsoft's (MSFT 150.99, +0.65, +0.4%) competitive product, Teams, has increased daily active users by nearly 50% since July.In the Treasury market, demand for longer-dated bonds has caused some minor curve-flattening activity. The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.79%. The U.S. Dollar Index is flat at 97.79.Today's economic calendar was limited to Housing Starts and Building Permits for October:Total housing starts increased 3.8% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.314 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.300 million) while total building permits increased 5.0% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.461 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.365 million).There was a sizable jump in starts (+8.6%) and permits (+8.2%) for multi-unit dwellings, yet the key takeaway from the report is that starts (+2.0%) and permits (+3.2%) increased for single-family units in an inventory-constrained environment for single-family homes.12:45MRK Merck increases quarterly dividend to $0.61 from $0.55/share (84.21 +0.08)12:25SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Myovant Sciences (MYOV) gains on Phase 3 relugolix data -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersMYOV (10.86 +79.21%): Announced results from the Phase 3 HERO study of once-daily, oral relugolix in men with advanced prostate cancer; the trial met its primary efficacy endpoint and all six key secondary endpoints -- in the primary endpoint responder analysis, 96.7% of men receiving the relugolix regimen achieved sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels through 48 weeks. These results, noted co, support NDA submission to the FDA in Q2 of 2020 and future regulatory submissions in Europe and Japan. Jumps to six-month highs. ATNX (15.12 +32.12%): Moves to its highest levels since August after previewing its presentation at the 2019 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium; co's abstract for the Phase 3 study of oral paclitaxel and encequidar in metastatic breast cancer has been selected for the conference's press program. DRNA (23.72 +10.89%): Price target raised to $30 from $22 at H.C. Wainwright, citing a positive view of co's new strategic alliance with Novo Nordisk (NVO), which was announced yesterday; the firm views the deal as underscoring a "Burgeoning RNAi Powerhouse." Continued strength sees the stock touch up to new four-year highs.Small Cap LosersI (6.19 -22.91%): Continued weakness following FCC Chairman Ajit Pai's announcement midday yesterday of support for a public auction of 280 megahertz of the C-band spectrum; the C-Band Alliance, a satellite operator group of which co is a member, issued a statement yesterday following the Chairman's communication, noting, among other comments, that the announcement "does not address the critical involvement of the incumbent satellite operators in executing the complex task of reconfiguring and transitioning their networks." Following yesterday's developments, the stock was downgraded to In-Line from Outperform at Evercore ISI, which also cut co's price target to $11 from $38; JPMorgan lowered co's target to $9 from $22. Wells Fargo noted that embrace of a public auction "does not seem to offer much potential capital to the satellite players" and also noted the impact that the public approach will have on timing, saying, "Getting this spectrum auctioned off in 1H 2020 (as the C-Band Alliance plan had outlined) seems naively optimistic at this point." The stock again records new 52-week lows, now down circa 76% month-to-date. PPDF (2.53 -11.85%): Missed estimates for Q3 EPS and revs (+35.0% yr/yr to RMB1.51 bln). Cumulative registered users increased to approx. 102.8 mln while cumulative number of borrowers reached 17.4 mln as of September 30; number of unique borrowers increased +28.6% yr/yr.

Their weakness has acted as a weight on the broader market, yet the movement of the S&P 500 index has been largely a function of technical price action.Briefing.com's Technical Take page identified 3127 as a secondary resistance level for the S&P 500. That level was tested with the opening move (3127.64) but quickly failed as steady selling eventually dropped the S&P 500 back to 3113.46 at this morning's low, which was reached just before 11:00 a.m. ET. That level fell within a secondary support level (3115/3112) that was also identified on the Technical Take Page.Traders, therefore, appear to be respecting these technical boundaries for now on a day that is devoid of any major macro news drivers, particularly as they relate to trade, and as it is suggested that the market is short-term overextended and due for a pullback.The Russell 2000 is up 0.4%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.3%; the S&P 500 is unchanged; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.4%.11:51QCOM Qualcomm issues 3 year targets at Analyst Day (88.73 -1.78)From CFO's presentation at Analyst Day:3 year targets as earnings mix shift to QCT from QTLRevenue: QCT segment SAM: 10% CAGR, grow faster than SAM and Apple product revenues QTL: current run rate + Huawei resolution Operating margin: QCT grows to >20%; QTL: ~70%Summarizing Qualcomm opportunities: Mature handset industry and current macroeconomic environment; Accelerated 5G migration compared to 4G; Mobile handset platform: 4G->5G transition, RF Front-End growth; Growth beyond mobile: Auto, IoT, Compute, ADAS, Cloud/Edge AI 75+ 5G licenses including key anchor agreements.Grow earnings faster than revenues.

The ACHIEVE II trial evaluated ubrogepant 50 mg and 25 mg, compared with placebo, across a wide range of clinical endpoints, including the co-primary endpoints of pain freedom (no pain) and freedom from the most bothersome migraine-associated symptom at two hours post-initial dose. For the two co-primary endpoints, ubrogepant 50 mg and 25 mg showed statistically significant higher response rates for pain freedom at two hours (21.8% for 50 mg, 20.7% for 25 mg and 14.3% for placebo), and the 50 mg dose demonstrated statistically significant higher response rates for the freedom from the most bothersome migraine-associated symptom at two hours (38.9% for 50 mg and 27.4% for placebo). Additionally, ubrogepant 50 mg was statistically superior to placebo in the absence of light sensitivity (43.8% for 50 mg and 35.5% for placebo) and sound sensitivity (54.1% for 50 mg and 46.3% for placebo).FDA action on the NDA for ubrogepant is expected in December 2019, potentially making it the first oral CGRP to address unmet patient needs in acute treatment of migraine and the first FDA-approved gepant.11:21XLE Sector Briefing: Energy (58.71 -0.65)The energy sector (-1.1%) sits at the bottom of today's sector standings after showing relative weakness yesterday. The growth-sensitive sector is now down 2.4% since Friday versus a much more modest 0.1% week-to-date downtick in the S&P 500. Factors contributing to the underperformance:Notable pressure on crude oil. The energy component is down more than $1.00 today (-2.3%) and down $2.01 (-3.5%) since Friday's settlement. This has sent the price of oil beneath its 200-day moving average (57.37) with the 50-day average (55.65) looming just below. Tax-loss related selling. The energy sector has been the weakest performer of 2019, meaning the group contains a fair share of names that have underperformed since the end of 2018. These names are more likely to be sold before the end of 2019 as investors look to reduce some of the tax impact of taking capital gains this year.Notable movers:HollyFrontier (HFC 51.56, -2.35, -4.4%): falling to its lowest level since early October. The company announced a new project and a new buyback authorization yesterday morning.

That corner is the retail industry, which has been broadsided today by disappointing earnings/sales results and guidance from Home Depot (HD 226.60, -12.25, -5.1%) and Kohl's (KSS 48.09, -10.31, -17.7%).The weakness in HD is having an outsized impact on the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (-0.9%); meanwhile, the combined impact of the disappointments from these well-known retailers is creating some angst about consumer spending activity entering the all-important holiday selling season.That angst is showing up in a sympathy trade that has knocked down the prices of many other retail stocks today, like Macy's (M 15.36, -1.51, -9.0%), Best Buy (BBY 75.61, -1.68, -2.2%), and Gap (GPS 16.62, -0.68, -3.9%) to name a few. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.97, -0.85, -1.9%) reflects the broader trend of underperformance for the retailers in today's market action.Those issues notwithstanding, the broader market is still holding up just fine as it is drawing influential support from the information technology (+0.3%), healthcare (+0.3%), and financial (+0.2%) sectors, which continue to attract interest from value and growth-minded investors alike.Separately, the market's overall resilience to selling pressure remains a tying factor for a number of participants who are fearful of missing out on further gains. That fear, ostensibly, is lending some buying support that has kept downside pressure in check.The Russell 2000 is up 0.2%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.1%; the S&P 500 is down 0.1%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%.10:00XLY Sector Briefing: Consumer Discretionary (120.74 -1.05)The consumer discretionary sector (-0.8%) represents an early pocket of relative weakness in a flat market. This makes for a continuation of this month's underperformance, which has the sector trading down 0.3% since the end of October versus a 2.8% gain in the S&P 500. Factors contributing to today's underperformance:Home Depot's (HD 227.72, -11.13, -4.7%) Q3 earnings report, which showed lower than expected revenue and lowered comparable sales guidance for FY20. Granted, Home Depot met Q3 EPS expectations, but the revenue shortfall and lowered comparable sales guidance have pressured the stock from a record high. Furthermore, the outlook is leading to some questions about the overall strength of consumer spending. Disappointing Q3 results and lowered FY20 guidance from Kohl's (KSS 48.86, -9.54, -16.4%), fueling worries that other apparel retailers could also report underwhelming results.Notable movers:Home Depot (HD 227.72, -11.13, -4.7%): falling back below its 50-day moving average (232.37) after setting a fresh record high on Monday. Kohl's (KSS 48.86, -9.54, -16.4%): falling to its lowest level in more than a month in response to weaker than expected quarterly results. Macy's (M 15.35, -1.53, -9.0%): sliding back below its 50-day moving average (15.76) after weak results from Kohl's. Nordstrom (JWN 35.10, -2.78, -7.3%): falling below its 200-day moving average (36.33) and toward its 50-day moving average (34.94) in sympathy with Kohl's. Gap (GPS 16.70, -0.60, -3.4%): approaching its October low after Kohl's disappointing results. TJX (TJX 60.68, +1.13, +1.9%): touched a fresh record after better than expected Q3 results overshadowed below-consensus Q4 EPS guidance. Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL 119.72, +1.32, +1.1%): bucking the overall trend in the sector.09:46SCANX Earnings mvoersJKS +13.79% WUBA +7.04% NJR +3.91% CRMT +3.57% TJX +2.82% DAVA +2.24% ASND +2.07% ESE +1.57%KSS -15.96% PPDF -7.14% HD -5.30% ASH -4.63% MMS -2.59% BILI -2.32% WWD -2.00% ZTO -1.29% KRNT -1.30% TDG -0.78% ALV -0.56% MDT -0.36%09:41WRAPX Opening Market Summary: Stock market opens slightly higher, retail dragsThe major indices open slightly higher at new all-time highs. The S&P 500 is up 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.3%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows financials (+0.4%) and information technology (+0.3%) leading the early advance. Conversely, the utilities (-0.6%) and consumer discretionary (-0.4%) sectors underperform, with the latter pressured by Home Depot (HD 228.90, -9.94, -4.2%) following its earnings results and guidance.The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 44.37, -0.45, -1.0%) is being dragged lower by shares of Kohl's (KSS 49.48, -8.86, -15.1%) after the company missed earnings estimates and lowered its FY20 EPS below consensus.U.S. Treasuries are little changed. The 2-yr yield is up one basis point to 1.60%, and the 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.80%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 97.79.

In the primary endpoint responder analysis, 96.7% (95% CI: 94.9%, 97.9%) of men receiving once-daily, oral relugolix achieved sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels. A responder was defined as achieving and maintaining testosterone suppression to less than or equal to 50 ng/dL from Week 5 through Week 48. For the study to be successful, the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of the response rate had to be at least 90%.The study achieved all six key secondary endpoints, including superiority to leuprolide acetate on rapid suppression of testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA), all with p-values <0.0001.Five key secondary endpoints demonstrated superiority to leuprolide acetate, including rapid suppression of testosterone at Day 4 and Day 15, profound suppression of testosterone at Day 15, rapid suppression of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at Day 15, and suppression of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) at Week 24 (all p-values <0.0001). In addition, relugolix demonstrated non-inferiority to leuprolide acetate on sustained testosterone suppression through 48 weeks (96.7% vs. 88.8%, respectively) with a between-group difference of 7.9% (95% CI: 4.1%,11.8%), the primary endpoint required for regulatory submissions outside of the U.S. In addition, the pharmacodynamic results showed no testosterone flare after initiation of relugolix and mean testosterone levels returned to normal levels within 90 days after treatment discontinuation.A New Drug Application (NDA) submission is expected in the second quarter of 2020.A conference call and webcast are to be held today at 8:30 a.m. EST / 5:30 a.m. PST.07:32SRRK Scholar Rock announces preliminary pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic results from the TOPAZ Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial of SRK-015 for the treatment of patients with spinal muscular atrophy (7.20 )The planned preliminary PK/PD analysis, which includes data from 29 patients with SMA across all three cohorts, showed dose-proportional drug exposure and demonstrated target engagement, as evidenced by dose-dependent increases of up to 100-fold in the serum levels of latent myostatin following SRK-015 treatment (2 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg doses).

Khoury, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of KLX Energy Services commented, "Contemporaneously with the abrupt decline in activity, we took steps to align our business with current customer demand. Specifically, we implemented an approximate 17 percent reduction in force, as compared with the Company's July 31, 2019 staffing levels, consistent with the approximate 18 percent sequential quarterly decline in our third quarter revenues. We aggressively cut costs in every area of our business, and we warm stacked the vast majority of our Permian based wireline assets. As a result of these and other measures, we expect to take a third quarter charge of approximately $13 million. Notwithstanding the precipitous decline in industry conditions, we generated approximately $44 million in cash flow from operations and approximately $31 million in free cash flow, bringing our cash balance to approximately $121 million for the quarter ended October 31, 2019. In addition, our $100 million credit facility remains undrawn.""The abrupt deterioration in industry conditions, which accelerated through the end of our third quarter, was driven by a sharp sequential quarterly decline in U.S. land rig count and an unprecedented decline in active frac spreads from the second quarter to the third quarter. In fact, there was a significant sequential decline in hydraulic fracturing activity during each month of the third quarter. The decline in Exploration & Production activity resulted in lower demand levels and lower current and expected revenues for our business, which led the Company to accelerate its annual testing for asset impairment into the third quarter. While the Company has not yet completed this analysis, we expect to report a non-cash asset impairment charge in the range of approximately $45 million to $60 million. The Company is in the process of finalizing the actual amount of the impairment charge, which will be completed prior to reporting its third quarter financial results."06:00CEO CNOOC Ltd names President Xu Keqiang as CEO (152.50 )06:00TRP TC Energy to provide financial update and review strategic plans at Investor Day, reaffirms expectation to grow common share dividend at an annual rate of 8-10% through 2021 (51.44 )"Our $100 billion portfolio of high-quality, long-life energy infrastructure assets are expected to generate record financial results again in 2019 underpinned by strong market fundamentals," said Russ Girling, TC Energy's president and chief executive officer. "Looking forward, we continue to advance $30 billion of commercially secured projects that will expand and extend our asset footprint across North America."As those projects enter service, TC Energy expects comparable earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to exceed $10 billion in 2022. This represents an increase of more than 16 per cent when compared to comparable EBITDA of $8.6 billion in 2018 despite significant asset sales that have accelerated the strengthening of the company's balance sheet. Notably, approximately 95 per cent of comparable EBITDA is expected to come from regulated assets or long-term contracts. At the same time, the company continues to methodically advance more than $20 billion of projects under development including Keystone XL and the Bruce Power life extension program. Success in advancing these and other organic growth opportunities that are expected to emanate from TC Energy's five operating businesses across North America would add to the company's growth outlook."Based on the confidence we have in our business plans, we are reaffirming that we expect to grow our common share dividend at an annual rate of eight to 10 per cent through 2021," added Girling. "Our dividend outlook is supported by expected growth in earnings and cash flow and in line with our historically strong dividend coverage ratios."06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- World markets continue climb higher; US Futures in record territoryThe global equity markets are mostly higher once again with US Futures venturing into all-time high territory for a second straight night.

This includes the Demicks Lake Expansion project under construction in North Dakota, which is expected to be in service in the first quarter of 2020 and as designed will increase capacity by 175 mln cubic feet per day.

The Russell 2000 (-0.3%) closed in negative territory.The day began with the market digesting a tweet from a China-based CNBC reporter, who said she was informed by a Chinese government source that Beijing is pessimistic about a trade deal because President Trump hasn't supported a tariff rollback. Based on the modest losses and ensuing price action, the market presumably remained optimistic about a Phase One agreement.The large-cap indices eased their way into positive territory thanks to the turnarounds in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (+0.3%), information technology (+0.3%), and communication services (+0.3%) sectors. Consistent leaders included the consumer staples (+0.5%) and real estate (+0.5%) sectors, as the negative-sounding trade headline likely fostered some conservative-minded interest.The trade-sensitive industrials (-0.3%) and materials (-0.2%) sectors were among today's laggards, but their losses were small compared to the 1.3% drop in the energy sector, which was pressured by the decline in oil prices ($57.04, -0.71, -1.2%).Generally, there wasn't any concerted effort to sell a market trading at all-time highs, but investors weren't eager to embrace risk, either. The trend has been positive, which has likely drawn in some reluctant investors into the market, and today simply may have been a natural breather for a market breaking out to new highs.Notable corporate news included HP Inc. (HPQ 20.01, -0.17, -0.8%) turning down the takeover bid from Xerox (XRX 39.30, +0.36, +0.9%). HP remained open to a deal, though. Netflix (NFLX 302.57, +7.54, +2.6%) shares outperformed on speculation that either Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman built a large stake in the company.U.S. Treasuries extended last week's advance, pushing yields slightly lower across the curve.

The retail industry was under pressure following disappointing quarterly results and guidance from Home Depot (HD 225.86, -12.99, -5.4%) and Kohl's (KSS 47.02, -11.38, -19.5%).The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.4%) also finished lower, while the Nasdaq Composite (+0.2%) and Russell 2000 (+0.4%) finished higher. The Nasdaq closed at another record high.The session began with each of the large-cap indices setting intraday highs despite the negative sentiment in the retail space. The early advance quickly faltered but overall losses were modest, and transient, as the S&P 500 only dipped 0.3% below its flat line before buyers quickly stepped in to buy the dip.The retail space didn't benefit from an opportunistic mindset, though, as the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.95, -0.87, -1.9%) finished near its lows like the S&P 500 energy (-1.5%) and consumer discretionary (-1.0%) sectors. Home Depot dragged on the consumer discretionary sector while a 3% drop in WTI crude ($55.21, -1.84, -3.2%) weighed on the energy space.Gains were mainly found in the heavily-weighted S&P 500 health care (+0.7%), information technology (+0.2%), and financials (+0.2%) sectors. The real estate sector (+0.2%) also finished in positive territory.TJX Companies (TJX 60.64, +1.09, +1.8%) was a bright spot among the retailers after it beat top and bottom-line estimates and raised its full-year guidance. TJX likely tempered some concerns about U.S. consumer spending for the holiday shopping season that may have been engendered by Home Depot and Kohl's.Separately, shares of AT&T (T 38.00, -1.63, -4.1%) pulled back 4% after the stock was downgraded to Sell from Neutral at MoffettNathanson. Shares of Slack (WORK 21.18, -1.93, -8.4%) sold off on news that Microsoft's (MSFT 150.39, +0.05, unch) competitive product, Teams, increased daily active users by nearly 50% since July.The U.S. Treasury market was relatively quiet, but demand for longer-dated bonds contributed to some curve-flattening activity. The 2-yr yield was unchanged at 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.79%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 97.85.Tuesday's economic calendar was limited to Housing Starts and Building Permits for October:Total housing starts increased 3.8% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.314 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.300 million) while total building permits increased 5.0% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.461 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.365 million).There was a sizable jump in starts (+8.6%) and permits (+8.2%) for multi-unit dwellings, yet the key takeaway from the report is that starts (+2.0%) and permits (+3.2%) increased for single-family units in an inventory-constrained environment for single-family homes.Looking ahead, the FOMC Minutes from the October 30-31 meeting and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index will be released on Wednesday.Nasdaq Composite +29.2% YTDS&P 500 +24.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +19.8% YTDRussell 2000 +18.5% YTD16:24MGP MGM Growth Properties commences public offering of 24.0 mln Class A shares (32.49 -0.37)The company expects that it will issue and sell 12,000,000 shares directly to the underwriters at closing and that the underwriters will purchase, at the request of the company, 12,000,000 shares from forward purchasers under forward sale agreements.The company plans to use proceeds primarily to repay a portion of the borrowings outstanding under its senior secured term loan A facility and senior secured term loan B facility, which the company believes will well-position it to be able to agree to and consummate a potential JV transaction under discussion with MGM Resorts International and honor any potential redemption of units representing limited partnership units in MGM Growth Properties Operating Partnership LP held by MGM for cash, should MGM elect to exercise any redemption right, if the company decides to pursue such a transaction, or, alternatively, for general corporate purposes.16:24PAGS PagSeguro Digital misses by BRL0.02, misses on revs (36.76 -1.01)Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of BRL 1.18 per share, excluding non-recurring items, BRL 0.02 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of BRL 1.20; revenues rose 30.3% year/year to BRL 1.46 bln vs the BRL 1.5 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Active merchants of 5.0 million, growth of 1.2 million active merchants in the last twelve months; R$29.4 billion in total payment volume, up 45.0% compared with 3Q18;16:20FLNT Fluent authorizes the repurchase of up to $5 mln shares of common stock (1.42 +0.11)16:18MTB M&T Bank increases quarterly cash dividend to $1.10/share from $1.00/share (162.88 -0.09)16:17FIX Comfort Systems increases stock repurchase program (50.40 -0.11)Board of Directors has approved an amendment to the stock repurchase program to increase the shares authorized and remaining as available to purchase back up to 1,000,000 shares by authorizing the Company to acquire up to 764,760 additional shares of its outstanding common stock.16:17AVID Avid Tech at Investor Day guided FY20 adj.

In recent items, The Medicines Co (MDCO) makes continued gains today following yesterday's inclisiran data and on rumors of takeover interest; The Medicines Co obtained global rights to develop, manufacture, and commercialize inclisiran under a license and collaboration agreement with co. OKTA (127.29 +5.07%): Upgraded to Buy from Neutral and assigned a $135 price target at DA Davidson, which views pullback in the stock since July as having presented an attractive entry point into the stock, which the firm names as "one of the top SaaS growth stocks."NOW (278.53 +4.59%): Jumped to three-month highs after being appointed to join the S&P 500, effective prior to the open on November 21; co replaces Celgene (CELG) in the index upon that company's acquisition by Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY).Large Cap LosersWORK (21 -9.15%): Reports today indicate that rival Microsoft (MSFT) said that its workplace messaging app, Teams, has now accrued 20 mln daily active users, representing significant growth from its July user count of 13 mln DAUs.

Macy's has guided its fiscal 2020 EPS down 29% at the midpoint to $2.85-3.05, including $0.25 in asset sale gains, with revenue flat yr/yr, comp sales flat to up 1%, and gross margins down slightly. Macy's expects comp sales to improve meaningfully in the fourth quarter, citing a difficult compare in the month of October.The market remains skeptical that the nation's largest department store can generate long-term profit growth given secular challenges.The company's comparable store sales growth has been muted despite the relative strength of consumer spending, which has been supporting the domestic economy.Department stores continue to struggle with lower mall traffic. Last week, the Census Bureau reported core retail sales up 4.2% yr/yr for the three months ending in October, but Department store sales fell 6.1%.With a $4.7 bln market cap, Macy's trades ~6x EPS and ~6x EV/EBITDA, including $3.9 bln in net debt. That represents a slight discount to department store peers. Fortunately, Macy's does have a strong balance sheet, so it can afford to pay its dividend, which yields a robust 9% payout annually.15:15BONDX Treasury Market SummaryLonger Tenors Pad Recent GainsU.S. Treasuries recorded another round of gains on Tuesday, pressuring yields on the 10-yr note and the 30-yr bond into the neighborhood of their respective 50-day moving averages. The Tuesday session bore some resemblance to Monday's affair, as Treasuries started the day with modest losses, recovering them in short order. The early weakness took place after an upbeat start to the European session, which saw the release of strong vehicle registration figures for October. The 10-yr note and the 30-yr bond made it back to their flat lines just minutes after the cash start while shorter tenors also rebounded but took a bit longer before reaching positive territory. Treasuries overtook their morning highs in the early afternoon, remaining near their best levels of the day until the close. The U.S. Dollar Index rose 0.1% to 97.86, snapping a four-day skid. Yield Check: 2-yr: UNCH at 1.59% 3-yr: UNCH at 1.59% 5-yr: UNCH at 1.62% 10-yr: -2 bps to 1.79% 30-yr: -4 bps to 2.26%News: The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow forecast for Q4 GDP was increased to 0.4% from 0.3% following today's housing data.

New car registrations in the eurozone increased 8.7% yr/yr, representing the strongest growth rate in a decade. Car registrations through the first ten months of 2019 are down 0.7% yr/yr.

There was a sizable jump in starts (+8.6%) and permits (+8.2%) for multi-unit dwellings, yet the key takeaway from the report is that starts (+2.0%) and permits (+3.2%) increased for single-family units in an inventory-constrained environment for single-family homes.

Same store comps are always a key metric for Lowe's. In Q2 (Jul), comps came in at +2.3% and +3.2% for the US home improvement business. Home Depot (HD) is always a key barometer as to what to expect from Lowe's. HD was not super impressive as comps underwhelmed and HD lowered full year guidance. It's not all doom and gloom for Lowe's because HD cited some internal initiatives that are taking longer to materialize, so much of it may be company-specific and not industry-wide problems. Specifically, HD was emphatic on the call that it "sees a strong and engaged customer" and that "housing is healthy and stable." Another area to watch is tariffs. HD said that tariffs are having an impact but are manageable as its merchants have done a good job at mitigating the impact. Aside from the Home Depot angle, another aspect to this earnings report will be progress on Lowe's turnaround. Despite having a similar number of stores, Lowe's is dwarfed by Home Depot (HD) in terms of annual revenue ($72 bln vs $111 bln for HD) and HD holds a sizeable profitability gap. Lowe's wants to improve merchandising availability, to improve its digital presence/app, to increase the use of self-check-out lanes and cut worker hours to boost productivity. It'll be interesting to get an update on its progress. Overall, our sense is that the weak comps/guidance from Home Depot has lowered expectations for Lowe's this quarter. However, with Lowe's, we think investors are more focused on the bigger picture, namely how is the turnaround going.13:42TPX Tempur Sealy Int'l: US ITC determines mattresses from China injure US industry; Department of Commerce will issue antidumping duty order on imports of this product from China (85.44 -1.05)The United States International Trade Commission (USITC) today determined that a U.S. industry is materially injured by reason of imports of mattresses from China that the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) has determined are sold in the United States at less than fair value. As a result of the USITC's affirmative determination, Commerce will issue an antidumping duty order on imports of this product from China.

Both the Dow and S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (-0.8%), meanwhile, can attribute their underperformance to Home Depot.The S&P 500 energy sector (-1.1%) is down even more amid a sharp decline in oil prices ($55.69, -1.45, -2.5%), but the market isn't getting concerned about the U.S. consumer based on a couple of reports. Instead, the market is hanging in there amid gains in the heavily-weighted health care (+0.3%), information technology (+0.1%), and financials (+0.1%) sectors.The consensus among many investors is that the market is due for a pullback, but the absence of one has created a sort of pain trade for investors fearful of missing out on further gains. The S&P 500 was down just 0.3% at its low earlier today before a buy-the-dip effort briefly brought it back above its flat line.Separately, shares of AT&T (T 37.65, -1.99) are down 5.0% after the stock was downgraded to Sell from Neutral at MoffettNathanson with a price target of $30. Shares of Slack (WORK 20.88, -2.24, -9.7%) are down 10% on news that Microsoft's (MSFT 150.99, +0.65, +0.4%) competitive product, Teams, has increased daily active users by nearly 50% since July.In the Treasury market, demand for longer-dated bonds has caused some minor curve-flattening activity. The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.79%. The U.S. Dollar Index is flat at 97.79.Today's economic calendar was limited to Housing Starts and Building Permits for October:Total housing starts increased 3.8% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.314 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.300 million) while total building permits increased 5.0% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.461 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.365 million).There was a sizable jump in starts (+8.6%) and permits (+8.2%) for multi-unit dwellings, yet the key takeaway from the report is that starts (+2.0%) and permits (+3.2%) increased for single-family units in an inventory-constrained environment for single-family homes.12:45MRK Merck increases quarterly dividend to $0.61 from $0.55/share (84.21 +0.08)12:25SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Myovant Sciences (MYOV) gains on Phase 3 relugolix data -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersMYOV (10.86 +79.21%): Announced results from the Phase 3 HERO study of once-daily, oral relugolix in men with advanced prostate cancer; the trial met its primary efficacy endpoint and all six key secondary endpoints -- in the primary endpoint responder analysis, 96.7% of men receiving the relugolix regimen achieved sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels through 48 weeks. These results, noted co, support NDA submission to the FDA in Q2 of 2020 and future regulatory submissions in Europe and Japan. Jumps to six-month highs. ATNX (15.12 +32.12%): Moves to its highest levels since August after previewing its presentation at the 2019 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium; co's abstract for the Phase 3 study of oral paclitaxel and encequidar in metastatic breast cancer has been selected for the conference's press program. DRNA (23.72 +10.89%): Price target raised to $30 from $22 at H.C. Wainwright, citing a positive view of co's new strategic alliance with Novo Nordisk (NVO), which was announced yesterday; the firm views the deal as underscoring a "Burgeoning RNAi Powerhouse." Continued strength sees the stock touch up to new four-year highs.Small Cap LosersI (6.19 -22.91%): Continued weakness following FCC Chairman Ajit Pai's announcement midday yesterday of support for a public auction of 280 megahertz of the C-band spectrum; the C-Band Alliance, a satellite operator group of which co is a member, issued a statement yesterday following the Chairman's communication, noting, among other comments, that the announcement "does not address the critical involvement of the incumbent satellite operators in executing the complex task of reconfiguring and transitioning their networks." Following yesterday's developments, the stock was downgraded to In-Line from Outperform at Evercore ISI, which also cut co's price target to $11 from $38; JPMorgan lowered co's target to $9 from $22. Wells Fargo noted that embrace of a public auction "does not seem to offer much potential capital to the satellite players" and also noted the impact that the public approach will have on timing, saying, "Getting this spectrum auctioned off in 1H 2020 (as the C-Band Alliance plan had outlined) seems naively optimistic at this point." The stock again records new 52-week lows, now down circa 76% month-to-date. PPDF (2.53 -11.85%): Missed estimates for Q3 EPS and revs (+35.0% yr/yr to RMB1.51 bln). Cumulative registered users increased to approx. 102.8 mln while cumulative number of borrowers reached 17.4 mln as of September 30; number of unique borrowers increased +28.6% yr/yr. Co expects total loan origination volume between RMB16-19 bln for Q4. Co also noted that it plans to discontinue its online information intermediary business between individual borrowers and individual investors. At all-time lows.

Their weakness has acted as a weight on the broader market, yet the movement of the S&P 500 index has been largely a function of technical price action.Briefing.com's Technical Take page identified 3127 as a secondary resistance level for the S&P 500. That level was tested with the opening move (3127.64) but quickly failed as steady selling eventually dropped the S&P 500 back to 3113.46 at this morning's low, which was reached just before 11:00 a.m. ET. That level fell within a secondary support level (3115/3112) that was also identified on the Technical Take Page.Traders, therefore, appear to be respecting these technical boundaries for now on a day that is devoid of any major macro news drivers, particularly as they relate to trade, and as it is suggested that the market is short-term overextended and due for a pullback.The Russell 2000 is up 0.4%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.3%; the S&P 500 is unchanged; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.4%.11:51QCOM Qualcomm issues 3 year targets at Analyst Day (88.73 -1.78)From CFO's presentation at Analyst Day:3 year targets as earnings mix shift to QCT from QTLRevenue: QCT segment SAM: 10% CAGR, grow faster than SAM and Apple product revenues QTL: current run rate + Huawei resolution Operating margin: QCT grows to >20%; QTL: ~70%Summarizing Qualcomm opportunities: Mature handset industry and current macroeconomic environment; Accelerated 5G migration compared to 4G; Mobile handset platform: 4G->5G transition, RF Front-End growth; Growth beyond mobile: Auto, IoT, Compute, ADAS, Cloud/Edge AI 75+ 5G licenses including key anchor agreements.Grow earnings faster than revenues.

The ACHIEVE II trial evaluated ubrogepant 50 mg and 25 mg, compared with placebo, across a wide range of clinical endpoints, including the co-primary endpoints of pain freedom (no pain) and freedom from the most bothersome migraine-associated symptom at two hours post-initial dose. For the two co-primary endpoints, ubrogepant 50 mg and 25 mg showed statistically significant higher response rates for pain freedom at two hours (21.8% for 50 mg, 20.7% for 25 mg and 14.3% for placebo), and the 50 mg dose demonstrated statistically significant higher response rates for the freedom from the most bothersome migraine-associated symptom at two hours (38.9% for 50 mg and 27.4% for placebo). Additionally, ubrogepant 50 mg was statistically superior to placebo in the absence of light sensitivity (43.8% for 50 mg and 35.5% for placebo) and sound sensitivity (54.1% for 50 mg and 46.3% for placebo).FDA action on the NDA for ubrogepant is expected in December 2019, potentially making it the first oral CGRP to address unmet patient needs in acute treatment of migraine and the first FDA-approved gepant.11:21XLE Sector Briefing: Energy (58.71 -0.65)The energy sector (-1.1%) sits at the bottom of today's sector standings after showing relative weakness yesterday. The growth-sensitive sector is now down 2.4% since Friday versus a much more modest 0.1% week-to-date downtick in the S&P 500. Factors contributing to the underperformance:Notable pressure on crude oil. The energy component is down more than $1.00 today (-2.3%) and down $2.01 (-3.5%) since Friday's settlement. This has sent the price of oil beneath its 200-day moving average (57.37) with the 50-day average (55.65) looming just below. Tax-loss related selling. The energy sector has been the weakest performer of 2019, meaning the group contains a fair share of names that have underperformed since the end of 2018. These names are more likely to be sold before the end of 2019 as investors look to reduce some of the tax impact of taking capital gains this year.Notable movers:HollyFrontier (HFC 51.56, -2.35, -4.4%): falling to its lowest level since early October. The company announced a new project and a new buyback authorization yesterday morning.

ConocoPhillips (COP 57.26, +0.56, +1.0%): best performing sector component, reclaiming its 50-day moving average (57.03).

That corner is the retail industry, which has been broadsided today by disappointing earnings/sales results and guidance from Home Depot (HD 226.60, -12.25, -5.1%) and Kohl's (KSS 48.09, -10.31, -17.7%).The weakness in HD is having an outsized impact on the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (-0.9%); meanwhile, the combined impact of the disappointments from these well-known retailers is creating some angst about consumer spending activity entering the all-important holiday selling season.That angst is showing up in a sympathy trade that has knocked down the prices of many other retail stocks today, like Macy's (M 15.36, -1.51, -9.0%), Best Buy (BBY 75.61, -1.68, -2.2%), and Gap (GPS 16.62, -0.68, -3.9%) to name a few. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.97, -0.85, -1.9%) reflects the broader trend of underperformance for the retailers in today's market action.Those issues notwithstanding, the broader market is still holding up just fine as it is drawing influential support from the information technology (+0.3%), healthcare (+0.3%), and financial (+0.2%) sectors, which continue to attract interest from value and growth-minded investors alike.Separately, the market's overall resilience to selling pressure remains a tying factor for a number of participants who are fearful of missing out on further gains. That fear, ostensibly, is lending some buying support that has kept downside pressure in check.The Russell 2000 is up 0.2%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.1%; the S&P 500 is down 0.1%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%.10:00XLY Sector Briefing: Consumer Discretionary (120.74 -1.05)The consumer discretionary sector (-0.8%) represents an early pocket of relative weakness in a flat market. This makes for a continuation of this month's underperformance, which has the sector trading down 0.3% since the end of October versus a 2.8% gain in the S&P 500. Factors contributing to today's underperformance:Home Depot's (HD 227.72, -11.13, -4.7%) Q3 earnings report, which showed lower than expected revenue and lowered comparable sales guidance for FY20. Granted, Home Depot met Q3 EPS expectations, but the revenue shortfall and lowered comparable sales guidance have pressured the stock from a record high. Furthermore, the outlook is leading to some questions about the overall strength of consumer spending. Disappointing Q3 results and lowered FY20 guidance from Kohl's (KSS 48.86, -9.54, -16.4%), fueling worries that other apparel retailers could also report underwhelming results.Notable movers:Home Depot (HD 227.72, -11.13, -4.7%): falling back below its 50-day moving average (232.37) after setting a fresh record high on Monday. Kohl's (KSS 48.86, -9.54, -16.4%): falling to its lowest level in more than a month in response to weaker than expected quarterly results. Macy's (M 15.35, -1.53, -9.0%): sliding back below its 50-day moving average (15.76) after weak results from Kohl's. Nordstrom (JWN 35.10, -2.78, -7.3%): falling below its 200-day moving average (36.33) and toward its 50-day moving average (34.94) in sympathy with Kohl's. Gap (GPS 16.70, -0.60, -3.4%): approaching its October low after Kohl's disappointing results. TJX (TJX 60.68, +1.13, +1.9%): touched a fresh record after better than expected Q3 results overshadowed below-consensus Q4 EPS guidance.

Conversely, the utilities (-0.6%) and consumer discretionary (-0.4%) sectors underperform, with the latter pressured by Home Depot (HD 228.90, -9.94, -4.2%) following its earnings results and guidance.The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 44.37, -0.45, -1.0%) is being dragged lower by shares of Kohl's (KSS 49.48, -8.86, -15.1%) after the company missed earnings estimates and lowered its FY20 EPS below consensus.U.S. Treasuries are little changed.

In the primary endpoint responder analysis, 96.7% (95% CI: 94.9%, 97.9%) of men receiving once-daily, oral relugolix achieved sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels. A responder was defined as achieving and maintaining testosterone suppression to less than or equal to 50 ng/dL from Week 5 through Week 48. For the study to be successful, the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of the response rate had to be at least 90%.The study achieved all six key secondary endpoints, including superiority to leuprolide acetate on rapid suppression of testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA), all with p-values <0.0001.Five key secondary endpoints demonstrated superiority to leuprolide acetate, including rapid suppression of testosterone at Day 4 and Day 15, profound suppression of testosterone at Day 15, rapid suppression of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at Day 15, and suppression of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) at Week 24 (all p-values <0.0001). In addition, relugolix demonstrated non-inferiority to leuprolide acetate on sustained testosterone suppression through 48 weeks (96.7% vs. 88.8%, respectively) with a between-group difference of 7.9% (95% CI: 4.1%,11.8%), the primary endpoint required for regulatory submissions outside of the U.S. In addition, the pharmacodynamic results showed no testosterone flare after initiation of relugolix and mean testosterone levels returned to normal levels within 90 days after treatment discontinuation.A New Drug Application (NDA) submission is expected in the second quarter of 2020.A conference call and webcast are to be held today at 8:30 a.m. EST / 5:30 a.m. PST.07:32SRRK Scholar Rock announces preliminary pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic results from the TOPAZ Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial of SRK-015 for the treatment of patients with spinal muscular atrophy (7.20 )The planned preliminary PK/PD analysis, which includes data from 29 patients with SMA across all three cohorts, showed dose-proportional drug exposure and demonstrated target engagement, as evidenced by dose-dependent increases of up to 100-fold in the serum levels of latent myostatin following SRK-015 treatment (2 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg doses).

Khoury, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of KLX Energy Services commented, "Contemporaneously with the abrupt decline in activity, we took steps to align our business with current customer demand. Specifically, we implemented an approximate 17 percent reduction in force, as compared with the Company's July 31, 2019 staffing levels, consistent with the approximate 18 percent sequential quarterly decline in our third quarter revenues. We aggressively cut costs in every area of our business, and we warm stacked the vast majority of our Permian based wireline assets. As a result of these and other measures, we expect to take a third quarter charge of approximately $13 million. Notwithstanding the precipitous decline in industry conditions, we generated approximately $44 million in cash flow from operations and approximately $31 million in free cash flow, bringing our cash balance to approximately $121 million for the quarter ended October 31, 2019. In addition, our $100 million credit facility remains undrawn.""The abrupt deterioration in industry conditions, which accelerated through the end of our third quarter, was driven by a sharp sequential quarterly decline in U.S. land rig count and an unprecedented decline in active frac spreads from the second quarter to the third quarter. In fact, there was a significant sequential decline in hydraulic fracturing activity during each month of the third quarter. The decline in Exploration & Production activity resulted in lower demand levels and lower current and expected revenues for our business, which led the Company to accelerate its annual testing for asset impairment into the third quarter. While the Company has not yet completed this analysis, we expect to report a non-cash asset impairment charge in the range of approximately $45 million to $60 million. The Company is in the process of finalizing the actual amount of the impairment charge, which will be completed prior to reporting its third quarter financial results."06:00CEO CNOOC Ltd names President Xu Keqiang as CEO (152.50 )06:00TRP TC Energy to provide financial update and review strategic plans at Investor Day, reaffirms expectation to grow common share dividend at an annual rate of 8-10% through 2021 (51.44 )"Our $100 billion portfolio of high-quality, long-life energy infrastructure assets are expected to generate record financial results again in 2019 underpinned by strong market fundamentals," said Russ Girling, TC Energy's president and chief executive officer. "Looking forward, we continue to advance $30 billion of commercially secured projects that will expand and extend our asset footprint across North America."As those projects enter service, TC Energy expects comparable earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to exceed $10 billion in 2022. This represents an increase of more than 16 per cent when compared to comparable EBITDA of $8.6 billion in 2018 despite significant asset sales that have accelerated the strengthening of the company's balance sheet. Notably, approximately 95 per cent of comparable EBITDA is expected to come from regulated assets or long-term contracts. At the same time, the company continues to methodically advance more than $20 billion of projects under development including Keystone XL and the Bruce Power life extension program. Success in advancing these and other organic growth opportunities that are expected to emanate from TC Energy's five operating businesses across North America would add to the company's growth outlook."Based on the confidence we have in our business plans, we are reaffirming that we expect to grow our common share dividend at an annual rate of eight to 10 per cent through 2021," added Girling. "Our dividend outlook is supported by expected growth in earnings and cash flow and in line with our historically strong dividend coverage ratios."06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- World markets continue climb higher; US Futures in record territoryThe global equity markets are mostly higher once again with US Futures venturing into all-time high territory for a second straight night.

These utility operations have customers in eight states and expect customer growth to continue at a rate of 1-2% annually. The anticipated investment reflects opportunities to improve the safety and reliability of the company's systems. Also included in the utility's five-year program is the construction of an 88-megawatt simple-cycle, natural gas-fired combustion turbine near Mandan, North Dakota.The capital investment plan at the pipeline and midstream business reflects a focus on organic growth. This includes the Demicks Lake Expansion project under construction in North Dakota, which is expected to be in service in the first quarter of 2020 and as designed will increase capacity by 175 mln cubic feet per day. The North Bakken Expansion project is also included in the capital forecast. As designed, this project in the heart of the Bakken will increase capacity by an estimated 350 mln cubic feet per day and is expected to be in service in late 2021. This business is exploring additional organic growth projects that, if executed, would be incremental to the capital investment plan. Natural gas production continues at record levels in the Bakken, driving the need for additional infrastructure.At the company's construction materials and services businesses, the capital expenditures forecast is focused primarily on organic expansion opportunities, normal equipment and plant replacements and upgrades. Included in the outlined forecast is the development of Knife River's Honey Creek Quarry in Texas, which includes the construction of a rock-crushing plant and the purchase of aggregate railcars. The company expects public sector workload growth as new state and local infrastructure spending initiatives are introduced.16:44ZG Zillow announced that Greg Schwartz, president of media and marketplaces, is stepping down to take a professional break (39.74 +0.23)The businesses that currently report to Schwartz in the Mortgages and Internet, Media and Technology (IMT) segments are being transitioned to other senior executives.

The Russell 2000 (-0.3%) closed in negative territory.The day began with the market digesting a tweet from a China-based CNBC reporter, who said she was informed by a Chinese government source that Beijing is pessimistic about a trade deal because President Trump hasn't supported a tariff rollback. Based on the modest losses and ensuing price action, the market presumably remained optimistic about a Phase One agreement.The large-cap indices eased their way into positive territory thanks to the turnarounds in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (+0.3%), information technology (+0.3%), and communication services (+0.3%) sectors. Consistent leaders included the consumer staples (+0.5%) and real estate (+0.5%) sectors, as the negative-sounding trade headline likely fostered some conservative-minded interest.The trade-sensitive industrials (-0.3%) and materials (-0.2%) sectors were among today's laggards, but their losses were small compared to the 1.3% drop in the energy sector, which was pressured by the decline in oil prices ($57.04, -0.71, -1.2%).Generally, there wasn't any concerted effort to sell a market trading at all-time highs, but investors weren't eager to embrace risk, either. The trend has been positive, which has likely drawn in some reluctant investors into the market, and today simply may have been a natural breather for a market breaking out to new highs.Notable corporate news included HP Inc. (HPQ 20.01, -0.17, -0.8%) turning down the takeover bid from Xerox (XRX 39.30, +0.36, +0.9%). HP remained open to a deal, though. Netflix (NFLX 302.57, +7.54, +2.6%) shares outperformed on speculation that either Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman built a large stake in the company.U.S. Treasuries extended last week's advance, pushing yields slightly lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points to 1.81%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 97.80.Separately, the NAHB Housing Market Index for November declined to 70 from 71 in October.

SPE now owns 100% of the multimedia entertainment company. Following the transaction, the Game Show Network channel will continue to be carried on DIRECTV.The sale is consistent with AT&T's strategy to monetize non-strategic assets as it de-levers its balance sheet and begins to retire shares. Prior to the transaction, SPE owned a 58% stake in Game Show Network, and AT&T owned the remaining 42%. In connection with the transaction, AT&T received approx. $500 mln, including proceeds for its equity stake valued at $380 mln (before transaction-related adjustments) and dividends of approx. $130 mln.

We have had a long relationship with Letko and most certainly appreciate their investment in our Company. Our establishment of domicile in the U.S. was carefully considered.... rationale for the move is crystal clear-we want to expose our Company and all its stockholders to increasingly larger pools of investment in U.S. index funds and passively managed accounts. The change in corporate domicile will not change how we run our day-to-day business, nor diminish the important role our Canadian assets play in our portfolio today. We do not believe that our Canadian investors will be forced to sell beyond the Canadian indices, and we will remain listed on both the TSX and the NYSE. Furthermore, we know that most of our large investors in Canada also own many of our U.S.-domiciled peers today. We deeply believe this move ultimately will be positive for ALL shareholders as exposure to the significantly larger U.S. market and funds is estimated to create more than $1 billion of additional demand for our shares."The change in corporate domicile, the rebrand to Ovintiv, and a previously announced 1 -- for -- 5 consolidation and share exchange require two-thirds of votes cast for shareholder approval. A special meeting of Encana shareholders will be held in early 2020.

The retail industry was under pressure following disappointing quarterly results and guidance from Home Depot (HD 225.86, -12.99, -5.4%) and Kohl's (KSS 47.02, -11.38, -19.5%).The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.4%) also finished lower, while the Nasdaq Composite (+0.2%) and Russell 2000 (+0.4%) finished higher. The Nasdaq closed at another record high.The session began with each of the large-cap indices setting intraday highs despite the negative sentiment in the retail space. The early advance quickly faltered but overall losses were modest, and transient, as the S&P 500 only dipped 0.3% below its flat line before buyers quickly stepped in to buy the dip.The retail space didn't benefit from an opportunistic mindset, though, as the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.95, -0.87, -1.9%) finished near its lows like the S&P 500 energy (-1.5%) and consumer discretionary (-1.0%) sectors. Home Depot dragged on the consumer discretionary sector while a 3% drop in WTI crude ($55.21, -1.84, -3.2%) weighed on the energy space.Gains were mainly found in the heavily-weighted S&P 500 health care (+0.7%), information technology (+0.2%), and financials (+0.2%) sectors. The real estate sector (+0.2%) also finished in positive territory.TJX Companies (TJX 60.64, +1.09, +1.8%) was a bright spot among the retailers after it beat top and bottom-line estimates and raised its full-year guidance. TJX likely tempered some concerns about U.S. consumer spending for the holiday shopping season that may have been engendered by Home Depot and Kohl's.Separately, shares of AT&T (T 38.00, -1.63, -4.1%) pulled back 4% after the stock was downgraded to Sell from Neutral at MoffettNathanson. Shares of Slack (WORK 21.18, -1.93, -8.4%) sold off on news that Microsoft's (MSFT 150.39, +0.05, unch) competitive product, Teams, increased daily active users by nearly 50% since July.The U.S. Treasury market was relatively quiet, but demand for longer-dated bonds contributed to some curve-flattening activity. The 2-yr yield was unchanged at 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.79%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 97.85.Tuesday's economic calendar was limited to Housing Starts and Building Permits for October:Total housing starts increased 3.8% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.314 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.300 million) while total building permits increased 5.0% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.461 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.365 million).There was a sizable jump in starts (+8.6%) and permits (+8.2%) for multi-unit dwellings, yet the key takeaway from the report is that starts (+2.0%) and permits (+3.2%) increased for single-family units in an inventory-constrained environment for single-family homes.Looking ahead, the FOMC Minutes from the October 30-31 meeting and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index will be released on Wednesday.Nasdaq Composite +29.2% YTDS&P 500 +24.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +19.8% YTDRussell 2000 +18.5% YTD16:24MGP MGM Growth Properties commences public offering of 24.0 mln Class A shares (32.49 -0.37)The company expects that it will issue and sell 12,000,000 shares directly to the underwriters at closing and that the underwriters will purchase, at the request of the company, 12,000,000 shares from forward purchasers under forward sale agreements.The company plans to use proceeds primarily to repay a portion of the borrowings outstanding under its senior secured term loan A facility and senior secured term loan B facility, which the company believes will well-position it to be able to agree to and consummate a potential JV transaction under discussion with MGM Resorts International and honor any potential redemption of units representing limited partnership units in MGM Growth Properties Operating Partnership LP held by MGM for cash, should MGM elect to exercise any redemption right, if the company decides to pursue such a transaction, or, alternatively, for general corporate purposes.16:24PAGS PagSeguro Digital misses by BRL0.02, misses on revs (36.76 -1.01)Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of BRL 1.18 per share, excluding non-recurring items, BRL 0.02 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of BRL 1.20; revenues rose 30.3% year/year to BRL 1.46 bln vs the BRL 1.5 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Active merchants of 5.0 million, growth of 1.2 million active merchants in the last twelve months; R$29.4 billion in total payment volume, up 45.0% compared with 3Q18;16:20FLNT Fluent authorizes the repurchase of up to $5 mln shares of common stock (1.42 +0.11)16:18MTB M&T Bank increases quarterly cash dividend to $1.10/share from $1.00/share (162.88 -0.09)16:17FIX Comfort Systems increases stock repurchase program (50.40 -0.11)Board of Directors has approved an amendment to the stock repurchase program to increase the shares authorized and remaining as available to purchase back up to 1,000,000 shares by authorizing the Company to acquire up to 764,760 additional shares of its outstanding common stock.16:17AVID Avid Tech at Investor Day guided FY20 adj.

Macy's has guided its fiscal 2020 EPS down 29% at the midpoint to $2.85-3.05, including $0.25 in asset sale gains, with revenue flat yr/yr, comp sales flat to up 1%, and gross margins down slightly. Macy's expects comp sales to improve meaningfully in the fourth quarter, citing a difficult compare in the month of October.The market remains skeptical that the nation's largest department store can generate long-term profit growth given secular challenges.The company's comparable store sales growth has been muted despite the relative strength of consumer spending, which has been supporting the domestic economy.Department stores continue to struggle with lower mall traffic. Last week, the Census Bureau reported core retail sales up 4.2% yr/yr for the three months ending in October, but Department store sales fell 6.1%.With a $4.7 bln market cap, Macy's trades ~6x EPS and ~6x EV/EBITDA, including $3.9 bln in net debt. That represents a slight discount to department store peers. Fortunately, Macy's does have a strong balance sheet, so it can afford to pay its dividend, which yields a robust 9% payout annually.15:15BONDX Treasury Market SummaryLonger Tenors Pad Recent GainsU.S. Treasuries recorded another round of gains on Tuesday, pressuring yields on the 10-yr note and the 30-yr bond into the neighborhood of their respective 50-day moving averages. The Tuesday session bore some resemblance to Monday's affair, as Treasuries started the day with modest losses, recovering them in short order. The early weakness took place after an upbeat start to the European session, which saw the release of strong vehicle registration figures for October. The 10-yr note and the 30-yr bond made it back to their flat lines just minutes after the cash start while shorter tenors also rebounded but took a bit longer before reaching positive territory. Treasuries overtook their morning highs in the early afternoon, remaining near their best levels of the day until the close. The U.S. Dollar Index rose 0.1% to 97.86, snapping a four-day skid. Yield Check: 2-yr: UNCH at 1.59% 3-yr: UNCH at 1.59% 5-yr: UNCH at 1.62% 10-yr: -2 bps to 1.79% 30-yr: -4 bps to 2.26%News: The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow forecast for Q4 GDP was increased to 0.4% from 0.3% following today's housing data.

Italy's September Industrial New Orders increased 1.0% m/m (expected -1.5%; last 0.8%), rising 0.3% yr/yr (expected -3.9%; last -10.4%). September Industrial Sales ticked up 0.2% m/m (expected -0.4%; last -0.3%) but fell 1.6% yr/yr (expected -1.0%; last -2.2%). New car registrations in the eurozone increased 8.7% yr/yr, representing the strongest growth rate in a decade. Car registrations through the first ten months of 2019 are down 0.7% yr/yr. Today's Data: Total housing starts increased 3.8% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.314 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.300 million) while total building permits increased 5.0% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.461 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.365 million). There was a sizable jump in starts (+8.6%) and permits (+8.2%) for multi-unit dwellings, yet the key takeaway from the report is that starts (+2.0%) and permits (+3.2%) increased for single-family units in an inventory-constrained environment for single-family homes.

Several additional patients have been enrolled. Upgraded to Outperform at William Blair.

Co characterized the August back-to-school season as "successful" and noted that it "ended strong in October"; during the call, co acknowledged that it "experienced softness during the middle of the quarter, as [it] saw an increasingly competitive promotional environment" and saw modest disruption from the launch of new brands and warm weather. Its Women's business performed below the company average. Lowered its FY EPS guidance to $4.75-4.95 vs prior guidance for EPS of $5.15-5.45; co expects the heightened promotional environment to continue through the balance of the year.

LOW has reported EPS upside in four of the past five quarters.The CapitalIQ consensus estimate for Q3 EPS is $1.35. The revenue consensus estimate is $17.69 bln. Note: LOW typically guides for revenue, EPS and comps in the press release for the full year. Its current full year guidance is for adjusted EPS of $5.45-5.65 while sales are expected to increase +2%. It'll be important to see if the company reaffirms or changes this guidance. Same store comps are always a key metric for Lowe's. In Q2 (Jul), comps came in at +2.3% and +3.2% for the US home improvement business. Home Depot (HD) is always a key barometer as to what to expect from Lowe's. HD was not super impressive as comps underwhelmed and HD lowered full year guidance. It's not all doom and gloom for Lowe's because HD cited some internal initiatives that are taking longer to materialize, so much of it may be company-specific and not industry-wide problems. Specifically, HD was emphatic on the call that it "sees a strong and engaged customer" and that "housing is healthy and stable." Another area to watch is tariffs. HD said that tariffs are having an impact but are manageable as its merchants have done a good job at mitigating the impact. Aside from the Home Depot angle, another aspect to this earnings report will be progress on Lowe's turnaround. Despite having a similar number of stores, Lowe's is dwarfed by Home Depot (HD) in terms of annual revenue ($72 bln vs $111 bln for HD) and HD holds a sizeable profitability gap. Lowe's wants to improve merchandising availability, to improve its digital presence/app, to increase the use of self-check-out lanes and cut worker hours to boost productivity. It'll be interesting to get an update on its progress. Overall, our sense is that the weak comps/guidance from Home Depot has lowered expectations for Lowe's this quarter. However, with Lowe's, we think investors are more focused on the bigger picture, namely how is the turnaround going.13:42TPX Tempur Sealy Int'l: US ITC determines mattresses from China injure US industry; Department of Commerce will issue antidumping duty order on imports of this product from China (85.44 -1.05)The United States International Trade Commission (USITC) today determined that a U.S. industry is materially injured by reason of imports of mattresses from China that the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) has determined are sold in the United States at less than fair value. As a result of the USITC's affirmative determination, Commerce will issue an antidumping duty order on imports of this product from China. ITC Release13:15ABMD Abiomed says Abiomed medical office is issuing publication review of observational analysis of Impella that was presented by Amin et al. at the American Heart Association Conference on November 17 (186.19 +8.10)According to the company, the AHA analysis is flawed because:The data source has significant limitations, containing just a fraction of Impella patients and unable to delineate between common adverse events.The Impella patients were much sicker and had greater baseline and procedural risks.The analysis excluded the costliest IABP patients who were escalated to other therapies.Additionally, the conclusion is aggressive because administrative coding data cannot delineate between adverse events common to high-risk patients and device related events.13:08SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: ACB (37.93 mln +2.94%), TEVA (22.61 mln +0.97%), BMY (19.42 mln -1.7%), CELG (13.89 mln -0.93%), CLVS (13.81 mln +6.23%)Industrials: GE (17.95 mln -0.6%)Consumer Discretionary: M (32.83 mln -10.04%), ROKU (21.57 mln -1.82%), KSS (19.77 mln -18.61%), NIO (18.01 mln +3.06%), F (17.54 mln -0.28%)Information Technology: AMD (54.78 mln +2.61%), NOK (20.12 mln -0.72%)Financials: BAC (17.88 mln -0.27%)Energy: CHK (55.18 mln -8.31%), ET (13.13 mln -1.99%), ECA (12.04 mln -4.56%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: MDCO (6.75x +19.55%), CRSP (5.7x +16.03%), EDIT (3.67x +11.4%), ATNX (3.12x +34.53%), CELG (2.97x -0.93%), NTLA (2.83x +12.13%)Materials: ASH (3.23x -4.14%)Industrials: WWD (3.27x -0.37%)Consumer Discretionary: KSS (6.3x -18.61%), HD (3.61x -5.23%)Information Technology: JKS (4.05x +12.71%)Financials: EFC (18.2x -3.03%), GBDC (3.31x +1.91%)Consumer Staples: CHEF (3.43x -8.38%)Utilities: DUK (3.42x -1.97%), ELP (3.22x +2.42%)13:06SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: ATNX (15.39 +34.53%), MDCO (70.12 +19.55%), BCRX (2 +17.35%), CRSP (67.92 +16.03%), NTLA (15.25 +12.13%), DRNA (23.87 +11.59%), EDIT (25.79 +11.4%), ARQL (8.4 +10.67%), APHA (4.21 +10.08%), TCDA (37.66 +9.92%), BOLD (28.08 +9.9%), WVE (31.02 +8.58%), TBIO (10.45 +8.52%), ASND (115.61 +8.07%), GLYC (6.18 +8.04%), AMRX (3.05 +7.6%), PRQR (6.71 +7.36%), PRTA (10.99 +7.28%)Information Technology: JKS (16.76 +12.71%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: VAPO (10.77 -7.08%)Industrials: BLDP (6.52 -10.19%)Consumer Discretionary: KSS (47.53 -18.61%), M (15.19 -10.04%), SIG (15.7 -8.61%)Financials: PPDF (2.5 -12.89%), JT (1.86 -10.39%), YRD (5.51 -9.97%)Energy: KLXE (5.44 -26.19%), UNT (0.72 -11.3%), CRC (7.58 -10.67%), ESV (3.82 -8.95%), SPN (0.33 -8.45%), CHK (0.59 -8.31%), EXTN (6.31 -7.82%), TUSK (1.38 -7.38%), PVAC (24.25 -7.35%)Consumer Staples: CHEF (32.57 -8.38%), DF (0.07 -7.5%)12:57WRAPX Midday Market Summary: Stock market trades mixed; Home Depot, Kohl's weigh on retail spaceThe S&P 500 is currently down 0.1% in midday action, with weakness concentrated in the retail space following disappointing quarterly results and guidance from Home Depot (HD 226.39, -12.46, -5.2%) and Kohl's (KSS 47.58, -10.82, -18.5%).The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.4%, but the Nasdaq Composite (+0.2%) and Russell 2000 (+0.4%) trade higher.The underperformance of the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 44.12, -0.71, -1.6%) best displays the negative sentiment that has subsumed the retail industry today. Both the Dow and S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (-0.8%), meanwhile, can attribute their underperformance to Home Depot.The S&P 500 energy sector (-1.1%) is down even more amid a sharp decline in oil prices ($55.69, -1.45, -2.5%), but the market isn't getting concerned about the U.S. consumer based on a couple of reports. Instead, the market is hanging in there amid gains in the heavily-weighted health care (+0.3%), information technology (+0.1%), and financials (+0.1%) sectors.The consensus among many investors is that the market is due for a pullback, but the absence of one has created a sort of pain trade for investors fearful of missing out on further gains. The S&P 500 was down just 0.3% at its low earlier today before a buy-the-dip effort briefly brought it back above its flat line.Separately, shares of AT&T (T 37.65, -1.99) are down 5.0% after the stock was downgraded to Sell from Neutral at MoffettNathanson with a price target of $30. Shares of Slack (WORK 20.88, -2.24, -9.7%) are down 10% on news that Microsoft's (MSFT 150.99, +0.65, +0.4%) competitive product, Teams, has increased daily active users by nearly 50% since July.In the Treasury market, demand for longer-dated bonds has caused some minor curve-flattening activity. The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.79%. The U.S. Dollar Index is flat at 97.79.Today's economic calendar was limited to Housing Starts and Building Permits for October:Total housing starts increased 3.8% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.314 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.300 million) while total building permits increased 5.0% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.461 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.365 million).There was a sizable jump in starts (+8.6%) and permits (+8.2%) for multi-unit dwellings, yet the key takeaway from the report is that starts (+2.0%) and permits (+3.2%) increased for single-family units in an inventory-constrained environment for single-family homes.12:45MRK Merck increases quarterly dividend to $0.61 from $0.55/share (84.21 +0.08)12:25SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Myovant Sciences (MYOV) gains on Phase 3 relugolix data -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersMYOV (10.86 +79.21%): Announced results from the Phase 3 HERO study of once-daily, oral relugolix in men with advanced prostate cancer; the trial met its primary efficacy endpoint and all six key secondary endpoints -- in the primary endpoint responder analysis, 96.7% of men receiving the relugolix regimen achieved sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels through 48 weeks. These results, noted co, support NDA submission to the FDA in Q2 of 2020 and future regulatory submissions in Europe and Japan. Jumps to six-month highs. ATNX (15.12 +32.12%): Moves to its highest levels since August after previewing its presentation at the 2019 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium; co's abstract for the Phase 3 study of oral paclitaxel and encequidar in metastatic breast cancer has been selected for the conference's press program. DRNA (23.72 +10.89%): Price target raised to $30 from $22 at H.C. Wainwright, citing a positive view of co's new strategic alliance with Novo Nordisk (NVO), which was announced yesterday; the firm views the deal as underscoring a "Burgeoning RNAi Powerhouse." Continued strength sees the stock touch up to new four-year highs.Small Cap LosersI (6.19 -22.91%): Continued weakness following FCC Chairman Ajit Pai's announcement midday yesterday of support for a public auction of 280 megahertz of the C-band spectrum; the C-Band Alliance, a satellite operator group of which co is a member, issued a statement yesterday following the Chairman's communication, noting, among other comments, that the announcement "does not address the critical involvement of the incumbent satellite operators in executing the complex task of reconfiguring and transitioning their networks." Following yesterday's developments, the stock was downgraded to In-Line from Outperform at Evercore ISI, which also cut co's price target to $11 from $38; JPMorgan lowered co's target to $9 from $22. Wells Fargo noted that embrace of a public auction "does not seem to offer much potential capital to the satellite players" and also noted the impact that the public approach will have on timing, saying, "Getting this spectrum auctioned off in 1H 2020 (as the C-Band Alliance plan had outlined) seems naively optimistic at this point." The stock again records new 52-week lows, now down circa 76% month-to-date. PPDF (2.53 -11.85%): Missed estimates for Q3 EPS and revs (+35.0% yr/yr to RMB1.51 bln). Cumulative registered users increased to approx. 102.8 mln while cumulative number of borrowers reached 17.4 mln as of September 30; number of unique borrowers increased +28.6% yr/yr.

Their weakness has acted as a weight on the broader market, yet the movement of the S&P 500 index has been largely a function of technical price action.Briefing.com's Technical Take page identified 3127 as a secondary resistance level for the S&P 500. That level was tested with the opening move (3127.64) but quickly failed as steady selling eventually dropped the S&P 500 back to 3113.46 at this morning's low, which was reached just before 11:00 a.m. ET. That level fell within a secondary support level (3115/3112) that was also identified on the Technical Take Page.Traders, therefore, appear to be respecting these technical boundaries for now on a day that is devoid of any major macro news drivers, particularly as they relate to trade, and as it is suggested that the market is short-term overextended and due for a pullback.The Russell 2000 is up 0.4%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.3%; the S&P 500 is unchanged; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.4%.11:51QCOM Qualcomm issues 3 year targets at Analyst Day (88.73 -1.78)From CFO's presentation at Analyst Day:3 year targets as earnings mix shift to QCT from QTLRevenue: QCT segment SAM: 10% CAGR, grow faster than SAM and Apple product revenues QTL: current run rate + Huawei resolution Operating margin: QCT grows to >20%; QTL: ~70%Summarizing Qualcomm opportunities: Mature handset industry and current macroeconomic environment; Accelerated 5G migration compared to 4G; Mobile handset platform: 4G->5G transition, RF Front-End growth; Growth beyond mobile: Auto, IoT, Compute, ADAS, Cloud/Edge AI 75+ 5G licenses including key anchor agreements.Grow earnings faster than revenues.

The ACHIEVE II trial evaluated ubrogepant 50 mg and 25 mg, compared with placebo, across a wide range of clinical endpoints, including the co-primary endpoints of pain freedom (no pain) and freedom from the most bothersome migraine-associated symptom at two hours post-initial dose. For the two co-primary endpoints, ubrogepant 50 mg and 25 mg showed statistically significant higher response rates for pain freedom at two hours (21.8% for 50 mg, 20.7% for 25 mg and 14.3% for placebo), and the 50 mg dose demonstrated statistically significant higher response rates for the freedom from the most bothersome migraine-associated symptom at two hours (38.9% for 50 mg and 27.4% for placebo). Additionally, ubrogepant 50 mg was statistically superior to placebo in the absence of light sensitivity (43.8% for 50 mg and 35.5% for placebo) and sound sensitivity (54.1% for 50 mg and 46.3% for placebo).FDA action on the NDA for ubrogepant is expected in December 2019, potentially making it the first oral CGRP to address unmet patient needs in acute treatment of migraine and the first FDA-approved gepant.11:21XLE Sector Briefing: Energy (58.71 -0.65)The energy sector (-1.1%) sits at the bottom of today's sector standings after showing relative weakness yesterday. The growth-sensitive sector is now down 2.4% since Friday versus a much more modest 0.1% week-to-date downtick in the S&P 500. Factors contributing to the underperformance:Notable pressure on crude oil. The energy component is down more than $1.00 today (-2.3%) and down $2.01 (-3.5%) since Friday's settlement. This has sent the price of oil beneath its 200-day moving average (57.37) with the 50-day average (55.65) looming just below. Tax-loss related selling. The energy sector has been the weakest performer of 2019, meaning the group contains a fair share of names that have underperformed since the end of 2018. These names are more likely to be sold before the end of 2019 as investors look to reduce some of the tax impact of taking capital gains this year.Notable movers:HollyFrontier (HFC 51.56, -2.35, -4.4%): falling to its lowest level since early October. The company announced a new project and a new buyback authorization yesterday morning.

That corner is the retail industry, which has been broadsided today by disappointing earnings/sales results and guidance from Home Depot (HD 226.60, -12.25, -5.1%) and Kohl's (KSS 48.09, -10.31, -17.7%).The weakness in HD is having an outsized impact on the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (-0.9%); meanwhile, the combined impact of the disappointments from these well-known retailers is creating some angst about consumer spending activity entering the all-important holiday selling season.That angst is showing up in a sympathy trade that has knocked down the prices of many other retail stocks today, like Macy's (M 15.36, -1.51, -9.0%), Best Buy (BBY 75.61, -1.68, -2.2%), and Gap (GPS 16.62, -0.68, -3.9%) to name a few. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.97, -0.85, -1.9%) reflects the broader trend of underperformance for the retailers in today's market action.Those issues notwithstanding, the broader market is still holding up just fine as it is drawing influential support from the information technology (+0.3%), healthcare (+0.3%), and financial (+0.2%) sectors, which continue to attract interest from value and growth-minded investors alike.Separately, the market's overall resilience to selling pressure remains a tying factor for a number of participants who are fearful of missing out on further gains. That fear, ostensibly, is lending some buying support that has kept downside pressure in check.The Russell 2000 is up 0.2%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.1%; the S&P 500 is down 0.1%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%.10:00XLY Sector Briefing: Consumer Discretionary (120.74 -1.05)The consumer discretionary sector (-0.8%) represents an early pocket of relative weakness in a flat market. This makes for a continuation of this month's underperformance, which has the sector trading down 0.3% since the end of October versus a 2.8% gain in the S&P 500. Factors contributing to today's underperformance:Home Depot's (HD 227.72, -11.13, -4.7%) Q3 earnings report, which showed lower than expected revenue and lowered comparable sales guidance for FY20. Granted, Home Depot met Q3 EPS expectations, but the revenue shortfall and lowered comparable sales guidance have pressured the stock from a record high. Furthermore, the outlook is leading to some questions about the overall strength of consumer spending. Disappointing Q3 results and lowered FY20 guidance from Kohl's (KSS 48.86, -9.54, -16.4%), fueling worries that other apparel retailers could also report underwhelming results.Notable movers:Home Depot (HD 227.72, -11.13, -4.7%): falling back below its 50-day moving average (232.37) after setting a fresh record high on Monday. Kohl's (KSS 48.86, -9.54, -16.4%): falling to its lowest level in more than a month in response to weaker than expected quarterly results. Macy's (M 15.35, -1.53, -9.0%): sliding back below its 50-day moving average (15.76) after weak results from Kohl's. Nordstrom (JWN 35.10, -2.78, -7.3%): falling below its 200-day moving average (36.33) and toward its 50-day moving average (34.94) in sympathy with Kohl's. Gap (GPS 16.70, -0.60, -3.4%): approaching its October low after Kohl's disappointing results. TJX (TJX 60.68, +1.13, +1.9%): touched a fresh record after better than expected Q3 results overshadowed below-consensus Q4 EPS guidance. Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL 119.72, +1.32, +1.1%): bucking the overall trend in the sector.09:46SCANX Earnings mvoersJKS +13.79% WUBA +7.04% NJR +3.91% CRMT +3.57% TJX +2.82% DAVA +2.24% ASND +2.07% ESE +1.57%KSS -15.96% PPDF -7.14% HD -5.30% ASH -4.63% MMS -2.59% BILI -2.32% WWD -2.00% ZTO -1.29% KRNT -1.30% TDG -0.78% ALV -0.56% MDT -0.36%09:41WRAPX Opening Market Summary: Stock market opens slightly higher, retail dragsThe major indices open slightly higher at new all-time highs. The S&P 500 is up 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.3%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows financials (+0.4%) and information technology (+0.3%) leading the early advance. Conversely, the utilities (-0.6%) and consumer discretionary (-0.4%) sectors underperform, with the latter pressured by Home Depot (HD 228.90, -9.94, -4.2%) following its earnings results and guidance.The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 44.37, -0.45, -1.0%) is being dragged lower by shares of Kohl's (KSS 49.48, -8.86, -15.1%) after the company missed earnings estimates and lowered its FY20 EPS below consensus.U.S. Treasuries are little changed. The 2-yr yield is up one basis point to 1.60%, and the 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.80%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 97.79.

In the primary endpoint responder analysis, 96.7% (95% CI: 94.9%, 97.9%) of men receiving once-daily, oral relugolix achieved sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels. A responder was defined as achieving and maintaining testosterone suppression to less than or equal to 50 ng/dL from Week 5 through Week 48. For the study to be successful, the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of the response rate had to be at least 90%.The study achieved all six key secondary endpoints, including superiority to leuprolide acetate on rapid suppression of testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA), all with p-values <0.0001.Five key secondary endpoints demonstrated superiority to leuprolide acetate, including rapid suppression of testosterone at Day 4 and Day 15, profound suppression of testosterone at Day 15, rapid suppression of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at Day 15, and suppression of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) at Week 24 (all p-values <0.0001). In addition, relugolix demonstrated non-inferiority to leuprolide acetate on sustained testosterone suppression through 48 weeks (96.7% vs. 88.8%, respectively) with a between-group difference of 7.9% (95% CI: 4.1%,11.8%), the primary endpoint required for regulatory submissions outside of the U.S. In addition, the pharmacodynamic results showed no testosterone flare after initiation of relugolix and mean testosterone levels returned to normal levels within 90 days after treatment discontinuation.A New Drug Application (NDA) submission is expected in the second quarter of 2020.A conference call and webcast are to be held today at 8:30 a.m. EST / 5:30 a.m. PST.07:32SRRK Scholar Rock announces preliminary pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic results from the TOPAZ Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial of SRK-015 for the treatment of patients with spinal muscular atrophy (7.20 )The planned preliminary PK/PD analysis, which includes data from 29 patients with SMA across all three cohorts, showed dose-proportional drug exposure and demonstrated target engagement, as evidenced by dose-dependent increases of up to 100-fold in the serum levels of latent myostatin following SRK-015 treatment (2 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg doses).

Khoury, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of KLX Energy Services commented, "Contemporaneously with the abrupt decline in activity, we took steps to align our business with current customer demand. Specifically, we implemented an approximate 17 percent reduction in force, as compared with the Company's July 31, 2019 staffing levels, consistent with the approximate 18 percent sequential quarterly decline in our third quarter revenues. We aggressively cut costs in every area of our business, and we warm stacked the vast majority of our Permian based wireline assets. As a result of these and other measures, we expect to take a third quarter charge of approximately $13 million. Notwithstanding the precipitous decline in industry conditions, we generated approximately $44 million in cash flow from operations and approximately $31 million in free cash flow, bringing our cash balance to approximately $121 million for the quarter ended October 31, 2019. In addition, our $100 million credit facility remains undrawn.""The abrupt deterioration in industry conditions, which accelerated through the end of our third quarter, was driven by a sharp sequential quarterly decline in U.S. land rig count and an unprecedented decline in active frac spreads from the second quarter to the third quarter. In fact, there was a significant sequential decline in hydraulic fracturing activity during each month of the third quarter. The decline in Exploration & Production activity resulted in lower demand levels and lower current and expected revenues for our business, which led the Company to accelerate its annual testing for asset impairment into the third quarter. While the Company has not yet completed this analysis, we expect to report a non-cash asset impairment charge in the range of approximately $45 million to $60 million. The Company is in the process of finalizing the actual amount of the impairment charge, which will be completed prior to reporting its third quarter financial results."06:00CEO CNOOC Ltd names President Xu Keqiang as CEO (152.50 )06:00TRP TC Energy to provide financial update and review strategic plans at Investor Day, reaffirms expectation to grow common share dividend at an annual rate of 8-10% through 2021 (51.44 )"Our $100 billion portfolio of high-quality, long-life energy infrastructure assets are expected to generate record financial results again in 2019 underpinned by strong market fundamentals," said Russ Girling, TC Energy's president and chief executive officer. "Looking forward, we continue to advance $30 billion of commercially secured projects that will expand and extend our asset footprint across North America."As those projects enter service, TC Energy expects comparable earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to exceed $10 billion in 2022. This represents an increase of more than 16 per cent when compared to comparable EBITDA of $8.6 billion in 2018 despite significant asset sales that have accelerated the strengthening of the company's balance sheet. Notably, approximately 95 per cent of comparable EBITDA is expected to come from regulated assets or long-term contracts. At the same time, the company continues to methodically advance more than $20 billion of projects under development including Keystone XL and the Bruce Power life extension program. Success in advancing these and other organic growth opportunities that are expected to emanate from TC Energy's five operating businesses across North America would add to the company's growth outlook."Based on the confidence we have in our business plans, we are reaffirming that we expect to grow our common share dividend at an annual rate of eight to 10 per cent through 2021," added Girling. "Our dividend outlook is supported by expected growth in earnings and cash flow and in line with our historically strong dividend coverage ratios."06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- World markets continue climb higher; US Futures in record territoryThe global equity markets are mostly higher once again with US Futures venturing into all-time high territory for a second straight night.

This includes the Demicks Lake Expansion project under construction in North Dakota, which is expected to be in service in the first quarter of 2020 and as designed will increase capacity by 175 mln cubic feet per day.

The Russell 2000 (-0.3%) closed in negative territory.The day began with the market digesting a tweet from a China-based CNBC reporter, who said she was informed by a Chinese government source that Beijing is pessimistic about a trade deal because President Trump hasn't supported a tariff rollback. Based on the modest losses and ensuing price action, the market presumably remained optimistic about a Phase One agreement.The large-cap indices eased their way into positive territory thanks to the turnarounds in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (+0.3%), information technology (+0.3%), and communication services (+0.3%) sectors. Consistent leaders included the consumer staples (+0.5%) and real estate (+0.5%) sectors, as the negative-sounding trade headline likely fostered some conservative-minded interest.The trade-sensitive industrials (-0.3%) and materials (-0.2%) sectors were among today's laggards, but their losses were small compared to the 1.3% drop in the energy sector, which was pressured by the decline in oil prices ($57.04, -0.71, -1.2%).Generally, there wasn't any concerted effort to sell a market trading at all-time highs, but investors weren't eager to embrace risk, either. The trend has been positive, which has likely drawn in some reluctant investors into the market, and today simply may have been a natural breather for a market breaking out to new highs.Notable corporate news included HP Inc. (HPQ 20.01, -0.17, -0.8%) turning down the takeover bid from Xerox (XRX 39.30, +0.36, +0.9%). HP remained open to a deal, though. Netflix (NFLX 302.57, +7.54, +2.6%) shares outperformed on speculation that either Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman built a large stake in the company.U.S. Treasuries extended last week's advance, pushing yields slightly lower across the curve.

We have had a long relationship with Letko and most certainly appreciate their investment in our Company. Our establishment of domicile in the U.S. was carefully considered.... rationale for the move is crystal clear-we want to expose our Company and all its stockholders to increasingly larger pools of investment in U.S. index funds and passively managed accounts. The change in corporate domicile will not change how we run our day-to-day business, nor diminish the important role our Canadian assets play in our portfolio today. We do not believe that our Canadian investors will be forced to sell beyond the Canadian indices, and we will remain listed on both the TSX and the NYSE. Furthermore, we know that most of our large investors in Canada also own many of our U.S.-domiciled peers today. We deeply believe this move ultimately will be positive for ALL shareholders as exposure to the significantly larger U.S. market and funds is estimated to create more than $1 billion of additional demand for our shares."The change in corporate domicile, the rebrand to Ovintiv, and a previously announced 1 -- for -- 5 consolidation and share exchange require two-thirds of votes cast for shareholder approval. A special meeting of Encana shareholders will be held in early 2020.

The retail industry was under pressure following disappointing quarterly results and guidance from Home Depot (HD 225.86, -12.99, -5.4%) and Kohl's (KSS 47.02, -11.38, -19.5%).The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.4%) also finished lower, while the Nasdaq Composite (+0.2%) and Russell 2000 (+0.4%) finished higher. The Nasdaq closed at another record high.The session began with each of the large-cap indices setting intraday highs despite the negative sentiment in the retail space. The early advance quickly faltered but overall losses were modest, and transient, as the S&P 500 only dipped 0.3% below its flat line before buyers quickly stepped in to buy the dip.The retail space didn't benefit from an opportunistic mindset, though, as the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.95, -0.87, -1.9%) finished near its lows like the S&P 500 energy (-1.5%) and consumer discretionary (-1.0%) sectors. Home Depot dragged on the consumer discretionary sector while a 3% drop in WTI crude ($55.21, -1.84, -3.2%) weighed on the energy space.Gains were mainly found in the heavily-weighted S&P 500 health care (+0.7%), information technology (+0.2%), and financials (+0.2%) sectors. The real estate sector (+0.2%) also finished in positive territory.TJX Companies (TJX 60.64, +1.09, +1.8%) was a bright spot among the retailers after it beat top and bottom-line estimates and raised its full-year guidance. TJX likely tempered some concerns about U.S. consumer spending for the holiday shopping season that may have been engendered by Home Depot and Kohl's.Separately, shares of AT&T (T 38.00, -1.63, -4.1%) pulled back 4% after the stock was downgraded to Sell from Neutral at MoffettNathanson. Shares of Slack (WORK 21.18, -1.93, -8.4%) sold off on news that Microsoft's (MSFT 150.39, +0.05, unch) competitive product, Teams, increased daily active users by nearly 50% since July.The U.S. Treasury market was relatively quiet, but demand for longer-dated bonds contributed to some curve-flattening activity. The 2-yr yield was unchanged at 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.79%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 97.85.Tuesday's economic calendar was limited to Housing Starts and Building Permits for October:Total housing starts increased 3.8% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.314 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.300 million) while total building permits increased 5.0% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.461 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.365 million).There was a sizable jump in starts (+8.6%) and permits (+8.2%) for multi-unit dwellings, yet the key takeaway from the report is that starts (+2.0%) and permits (+3.2%) increased for single-family units in an inventory-constrained environment for single-family homes.Looking ahead, the FOMC Minutes from the October 30-31 meeting and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index will be released on Wednesday.Nasdaq Composite +29.2% YTDS&P 500 +24.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +19.8% YTDRussell 2000 +18.5% YTD16:24MGP MGM Growth Properties commences public offering of 24.0 mln Class A shares (32.49 -0.37)The company expects that it will issue and sell 12,000,000 shares directly to the underwriters at closing and that the underwriters will purchase, at the request of the company, 12,000,000 shares from forward purchasers under forward sale agreements.The company plans to use proceeds primarily to repay a portion of the borrowings outstanding under its senior secured term loan A facility and senior secured term loan B facility, which the company believes will well-position it to be able to agree to and consummate a potential JV transaction under discussion with MGM Resorts International and honor any potential redemption of units representing limited partnership units in MGM Growth Properties Operating Partnership LP held by MGM for cash, should MGM elect to exercise any redemption right, if the company decides to pursue such a transaction, or, alternatively, for general corporate purposes.16:24PAGS PagSeguro Digital misses by BRL0.02, misses on revs (36.76 -1.01)Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of BRL 1.18 per share, excluding non-recurring items, BRL 0.02 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of BRL 1.20; revenues rose 30.3% year/year to BRL 1.46 bln vs the BRL 1.5 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Active merchants of 5.0 million, growth of 1.2 million active merchants in the last twelve months; R$29.4 billion in total payment volume, up 45.0% compared with 3Q18;16:20FLNT Fluent authorizes the repurchase of up to $5 mln shares of common stock (1.42 +0.11)16:18MTB M&T Bank increases quarterly cash dividend to $1.10/share from $1.00/share (162.88 -0.09)16:17FIX Comfort Systems increases stock repurchase program (50.40 -0.11)Board of Directors has approved an amendment to the stock repurchase program to increase the shares authorized and remaining as available to purchase back up to 1,000,000 shares by authorizing the Company to acquire up to 764,760 additional shares of its outstanding common stock.16:17AVID Avid Tech at Investor Day guided FY20 adj.

Macy's has guided its fiscal 2020 EPS down 29% at the midpoint to $2.85-3.05, including $0.25 in asset sale gains, with revenue flat yr/yr, comp sales flat to up 1%, and gross margins down slightly. Macy's expects comp sales to improve meaningfully in the fourth quarter, citing a difficult compare in the month of October.The market remains skeptical that the nation's largest department store can generate long-term profit growth given secular challenges.The company's comparable store sales growth has been muted despite the relative strength of consumer spending, which has been supporting the domestic economy.Department stores continue to struggle with lower mall traffic. Last week, the Census Bureau reported core retail sales up 4.2% yr/yr for the three months ending in October, but Department store sales fell 6.1%.With a $4.7 bln market cap, Macy's trades ~6x EPS and ~6x EV/EBITDA, including $3.9 bln in net debt. That represents a slight discount to department store peers. Fortunately, Macy's does have a strong balance sheet, so it can afford to pay its dividend, which yields a robust 9% payout annually.15:15BONDX Treasury Market SummaryLonger Tenors Pad Recent GainsU.S. Treasuries recorded another round of gains on Tuesday, pressuring yields on the 10-yr note and the 30-yr bond into the neighborhood of their respective 50-day moving averages. The Tuesday session bore some resemblance to Monday's affair, as Treasuries started the day with modest losses, recovering them in short order. The early weakness took place after an upbeat start to the European session, which saw the release of strong vehicle registration figures for October. The 10-yr note and the 30-yr bond made it back to their flat lines just minutes after the cash start while shorter tenors also rebounded but took a bit longer before reaching positive territory. Treasuries overtook their morning highs in the early afternoon, remaining near their best levels of the day until the close. The U.S. Dollar Index rose 0.1% to 97.86, snapping a four-day skid. Yield Check: 2-yr: UNCH at 1.59% 3-yr: UNCH at 1.59% 5-yr: UNCH at 1.62% 10-yr: -2 bps to 1.79% 30-yr: -4 bps to 2.26%News: The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow forecast for Q4 GDP was increased to 0.4% from 0.3% following today's housing data.

There was a sizable jump in starts (+8.6%) and permits (+8.2%) for multi-unit dwellings, yet the key takeaway from the report is that starts (+2.0%) and permits (+3.2%) increased for single-family units in an inventory-constrained environment for single-family homes.

LOW has reported EPS upside in four of the past five quarters.The CapitalIQ consensus estimate for Q3 EPS is $1.35. The revenue consensus estimate is $17.69 bln. Note: LOW typically guides for revenue, EPS and comps in the press release for the full year. Its current full year guidance is for adjusted EPS of $5.45-5.65 while sales are expected to increase +2%. It'll be important to see if the company reaffirms or changes this guidance. Same store comps are always a key metric for Lowe's. In Q2 (Jul), comps came in at +2.3% and +3.2% for the US home improvement business. Home Depot (HD) is always a key barometer as to what to expect from Lowe's. HD was not super impressive as comps underwhelmed and HD lowered full year guidance. It's not all doom and gloom for Lowe's because HD cited some internal initiatives that are taking longer to materialize, so much of it may be company-specific and not industry-wide problems. Specifically, HD was emphatic on the call that it "sees a strong and engaged customer" and that "housing is healthy and stable." Another area to watch is tariffs. HD said that tariffs are having an impact but are manageable as its merchants have done a good job at mitigating the impact. Aside from the Home Depot angle, another aspect to this earnings report will be progress on Lowe's turnaround. Despite having a similar number of stores, Lowe's is dwarfed by Home Depot (HD) in terms of annual revenue ($72 bln vs $111 bln for HD) and HD holds a sizeable profitability gap. Lowe's wants to improve merchandising availability, to improve its digital presence/app, to increase the use of self-check-out lanes and cut worker hours to boost productivity. It'll be interesting to get an update on its progress. Overall, our sense is that the weak comps/guidance from Home Depot has lowered expectations for Lowe's this quarter. However, with Lowe's, we think investors are more focused on the bigger picture, namely how is the turnaround going.13:42TPX Tempur Sealy Int'l: US ITC determines mattresses from China injure US industry; Department of Commerce will issue antidumping duty order on imports of this product from China (85.44 -1.05)The United States International Trade Commission (USITC) today determined that a U.S. industry is materially injured by reason of imports of mattresses from China that the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) has determined are sold in the United States at less than fair value. As a result of the USITC's affirmative determination, Commerce will issue an antidumping duty order on imports of this product from China. ITC Release13:15ABMD Abiomed says Abiomed medical office is issuing publication review of observational analysis of Impella that was presented by Amin et al. at the American Heart Association Conference on November 17 (186.19 +8.10)According to the company, the AHA analysis is flawed because:The data source has significant limitations, containing just a fraction of Impella patients and unable to delineate between common adverse events.The Impella patients were much sicker and had greater baseline and procedural risks.The analysis excluded the costliest IABP patients who were escalated to other therapies.Additionally, the conclusion is aggressive because administrative coding data cannot delineate between adverse events common to high-risk patients and device related events.13:08SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: ACB (37.93 mln +2.94%), TEVA (22.61 mln +0.97%), BMY (19.42 mln -1.7%), CELG (13.89 mln -0.93%), CLVS (13.81 mln +6.23%)Industrials: GE (17.95 mln -0.6%)Consumer Discretionary: M (32.83 mln -10.04%), ROKU (21.57 mln -1.82%), KSS (19.77 mln -18.61%), NIO (18.01 mln +3.06%), F (17.54 mln -0.28%)Information Technology: AMD (54.78 mln +2.61%), NOK (20.12 mln -0.72%)Financials: BAC (17.88 mln -0.27%)Energy: CHK (55.18 mln -8.31%), ET (13.13 mln -1.99%), ECA (12.04 mln -4.56%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: MDCO (6.75x +19.55%), CRSP (5.7x +16.03%), EDIT (3.67x +11.4%), ATNX (3.12x +34.53%), CELG (2.97x -0.93%), NTLA (2.83x +12.13%)Materials: ASH (3.23x -4.14%)Industrials: WWD (3.27x -0.37%)Consumer Discretionary: KSS (6.3x -18.61%), HD (3.61x -5.23%)Information Technology: JKS (4.05x +12.71%)Financials: EFC (18.2x -3.03%), GBDC (3.31x +1.91%)Consumer Staples: CHEF (3.43x -8.38%)Utilities: DUK (3.42x -1.97%), ELP (3.22x +2.42%)13:06SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: ATNX (15.39 +34.53%), MDCO (70.12 +19.55%), BCRX (2 +17.35%), CRSP (67.92 +16.03%), NTLA (15.25 +12.13%), DRNA (23.87 +11.59%), EDIT (25.79 +11.4%), ARQL (8.4 +10.67%), APHA (4.21 +10.08%), TCDA (37.66 +9.92%), BOLD (28.08 +9.9%), WVE (31.02 +8.58%), TBIO (10.45 +8.52%), ASND (115.61 +8.07%), GLYC (6.18 +8.04%), AMRX (3.05 +7.6%), PRQR (6.71 +7.36%), PRTA (10.99 +7.28%)Information Technology: JKS (16.76 +12.71%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: VAPO (10.77 -7.08%)Industrials: BLDP (6.52 -10.19%)Consumer Discretionary: KSS (47.53 -18.61%), M (15.19 -10.04%), SIG (15.7 -8.61%)Financials: PPDF (2.5 -12.89%), JT (1.86 -10.39%), YRD (5.51 -9.97%)Energy: KLXE (5.44 -26.19%), UNT (0.72 -11.3%), CRC (7.58 -10.67%), ESV (3.82 -8.95%), SPN (0.33 -8.45%), CHK (0.59 -8.31%), EXTN (6.31 -7.82%), TUSK (1.38 -7.38%), PVAC (24.25 -7.35%)Consumer Staples: CHEF (32.57 -8.38%), DF (0.07 -7.5%)12:57WRAPX Midday Market Summary: Stock market trades mixed; Home Depot, Kohl's weigh on retail spaceThe S&P 500 is currently down 0.1% in midday action, with weakness concentrated in the retail space following disappointing quarterly results and guidance from Home Depot (HD 226.39, -12.46, -5.2%) and Kohl's (KSS 47.58, -10.82, -18.5%).The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.4%, but the Nasdaq Composite (+0.2%) and Russell 2000 (+0.4%) trade higher.The underperformance of the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 44.12, -0.71, -1.6%) best displays the negative sentiment that has subsumed the retail industry today. Both the Dow and S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (-0.8%), meanwhile, can attribute their underperformance to Home Depot.The S&P 500 energy sector (-1.1%) is down even more amid a sharp decline in oil prices ($55.69, -1.45, -2.5%), but the market isn't getting concerned about the U.S. consumer based on a couple of reports. Instead, the market is hanging in there amid gains in the heavily-weighted health care (+0.3%), information technology (+0.1%), and financials (+0.1%) sectors.The consensus among many investors is that the market is due for a pullback, but the absence of one has created a sort of pain trade for investors fearful of missing out on further gains. The S&P 500 was down just 0.3% at its low earlier today before a buy-the-dip effort briefly brought it back above its flat line.Separately, shares of AT&T (T 37.65, -1.99) are down 5.0% after the stock was downgraded to Sell from Neutral at MoffettNathanson with a price target of $30. Shares of Slack (WORK 20.88, -2.24, -9.7%) are down 10% on news that Microsoft's (MSFT 150.99, +0.65, +0.4%) competitive product, Teams, has increased daily active users by nearly 50% since July.In the Treasury market, demand for longer-dated bonds has caused some minor curve-flattening activity. The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.79%. The U.S. Dollar Index is flat at 97.79.Today's economic calendar was limited to Housing Starts and Building Permits for October:Total housing starts increased 3.8% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.314 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.300 million) while total building permits increased 5.0% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.461 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.365 million).There was a sizable jump in starts (+8.6%) and permits (+8.2%) for multi-unit dwellings, yet the key takeaway from the report is that starts (+2.0%) and permits (+3.2%) increased for single-family units in an inventory-constrained environment for single-family homes.12:45MRK Merck increases quarterly dividend to $0.61 from $0.55/share (84.21 +0.08)12:25SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Myovant Sciences (MYOV) gains on Phase 3 relugolix data -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersMYOV (10.86 +79.21%): Announced results from the Phase 3 HERO study of once-daily, oral relugolix in men with advanced prostate cancer; the trial met its primary efficacy endpoint and all six key secondary endpoints -- in the primary endpoint responder analysis, 96.7% of men receiving the relugolix regimen achieved sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels through 48 weeks. These results, noted co, support NDA submission to the FDA in Q2 of 2020 and future regulatory submissions in Europe and Japan. Jumps to six-month highs. ATNX (15.12 +32.12%): Moves to its highest levels since August after previewing its presentation at the 2019 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium; co's abstract for the Phase 3 study of oral paclitaxel and encequidar in metastatic breast cancer has been selected for the conference's press program. DRNA (23.72 +10.89%): Price target raised to $30 from $22 at H.C. Wainwright, citing a positive view of co's new strategic alliance with Novo Nordisk (NVO), which was announced yesterday; the firm views the deal as underscoring a "Burgeoning RNAi Powerhouse." Continued strength sees the stock touch up to new four-year highs.Small Cap LosersI (6.19 -22.91%): Continued weakness following FCC Chairman Ajit Pai's announcement midday yesterday of support for a public auction of 280 megahertz of the C-band spectrum; the C-Band Alliance, a satellite operator group of which co is a member, issued a statement yesterday following the Chairman's communication, noting, among other comments, that the announcement "does not address the critical involvement of the incumbent satellite operators in executing the complex task of reconfiguring and transitioning their networks." Following yesterday's developments, the stock was downgraded to In-Line from Outperform at Evercore ISI, which also cut co's price target to $11 from $38; JPMorgan lowered co's target to $9 from $22. Wells Fargo noted that embrace of a public auction "does not seem to offer much potential capital to the satellite players" and also noted the impact that the public approach will have on timing, saying, "Getting this spectrum auctioned off in 1H 2020 (as the C-Band Alliance plan had outlined) seems naively optimistic at this point." The stock again records new 52-week lows, now down circa 76% month-to-date. PPDF (2.53 -11.85%): Missed estimates for Q3 EPS and revs (+35.0% yr/yr to RMB1.51 bln). Cumulative registered users increased to approx. 102.8 mln while cumulative number of borrowers reached 17.4 mln as of September 30; number of unique borrowers increased +28.6% yr/yr. Co expects total loan origination volume between RMB16-19 bln for Q4. Co also noted that it plans to discontinue its online information intermediary business between individual borrowers and individual investors. At all-time lows. PLUG (3.33 -11.12%): Pulls back from yesterday's four-year highs with above average volume; factoring in today's move, the stock continues to trade higher by circa +26% month-to-date.11:59SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (95) outpacing new lows (63) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: AAPL, AES, AGEN, AIZ, ALL, AMD, AME, AMED, ANSS, AON, APD, ARDX, ARMK, ARVN, ARWR, ATEC, ATRS, AVGO, AZO, BIO, BIP, BLDR, BLK, BLMN, BRO, CACI, CATM, CDE, CDW, CLH, CPRT, CRSP, CSGS, CSL, CVNA, CZR, DEA, DEI, DKS, DOX, DRNA, DXCM, EIDX, EPAM, ESE, EVRI, EW, FISV, FNF, FTNT, GLIBA, GPN, HALO, HIG, INFO, INOV, INST, KMX, KRG, KRTX, LDOS, LIN, LPT, LULU, LXP, LZB, MCO, MDCO, MGM, MMC, MSCI, MSFT, NSIT, OC, PFSI, PLMR, PRFT, RDN, RLI, SEM, SHOO, SPGI, TDY, TJX, TMO, TROW, TRU, UI, USB, VAC, VRTX, XBIT, XPEL, XRX, ZYMEStocks that traded to 52 week lows: AM, AR, ASIX, BCEI, BIG, BTU, BXC, CDEV, CEIX, CHK, CNP, CPS, CRZO, CTRA, CVEO, DCP, ENBL, ENLC, EQM, ETRN, EXPE, EXTN, EZPW, FLNT, FOSL, FPRX, FTSI, GLOG, GLOP, GSM, GTE, GTLS, I, IIVI, KLXE, LBRT, MDR, MPLX, NEWM, NVEE, OAS, PAA, PAGP, PBT, PNNT, PRMW, QUAD, RBBN, RVLV, SDRL, SINA, SMLP, SNH, TCO, TCS, TDW, TH, TRIP, UPWK, VG, VNOM, WES, WLLThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: CABO, FWONA, IHC, LACQ, NWPX, PLOW, WDFCETFs that traded to 52 week highs: CUT, DIA, EWC, EWG, EWQ, EZU, FAN, GREK, IAI, IOO, ITA, IWF, IYF, IYG, IYH, IYJ, KCE, OEF, QQQ, SPY, UYG, VGK, VTI, XLKETFs that traded to 52 week lows: AMJ, VXX, XES11:53TALKX Market Briefing: Price action getting technicalThere hasn't been a lot of conviction in the morning session, evidenced by an S&P 500 that is basically unchanged through the first two hours of trading.Retail stocks have been a notable pocket of weakness following the disappointments from Home Depot (HD 226.88, -11.98, -5.0%) and Kohl's (KSS 48.21, -10.19, -17.5%). Their weakness has acted as a weight on the broader market, yet the movement of the S&P 500 index has been largely a function of technical price action.Briefing.com's Technical Take page identified 3127 as a secondary resistance level for the S&P 500. That level was tested with the opening move (3127.64) but quickly failed as steady selling eventually dropped the S&P 500 back to 3113.46 at this morning's low, which was reached just before 11:00 a.m. ET. That level fell within a secondary support level (3115/3112) that was also identified on the Technical Take Page.Traders, therefore, appear to be respecting these technical boundaries for now on a day that is devoid of any major macro news drivers, particularly as they relate to trade, and as it is suggested that the market is short-term overextended and due for a pullback.The Russell 2000 is up 0.4%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.3%; the S&P 500 is unchanged; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.4%.11:51QCOM Qualcomm issues 3 year targets at Analyst Day (88.73 -1.78)From CFO's presentation at Analyst Day:3 year targets as earnings mix shift to QCT from QTLRevenue: QCT segment SAM: 10% CAGR, grow faster than SAM and Apple product revenues QTL: current run rate + Huawei resolution Operating margin: QCT grows to >20%; QTL: ~70%Summarizing Qualcomm opportunities: Mature handset industry and current macroeconomic environment; Accelerated 5G migration compared to 4G; Mobile handset platform: 4G->5G transition, RF Front-End growth; Growth beyond mobile: Auto, IoT, Compute, ADAS, Cloud/Edge AI 75+ 5G licenses including key anchor agreements.Grow earnings faster than revenues.

The ACHIEVE II trial evaluated ubrogepant 50 mg and 25 mg, compared with placebo, across a wide range of clinical endpoints, including the co-primary endpoints of pain freedom (no pain) and freedom from the most bothersome migraine-associated symptom at two hours post-initial dose. For the two co-primary endpoints, ubrogepant 50 mg and 25 mg showed statistically significant higher response rates for pain freedom at two hours (21.8% for 50 mg, 20.7% for 25 mg and 14.3% for placebo), and the 50 mg dose demonstrated statistically significant higher response rates for the freedom from the most bothersome migraine-associated symptom at two hours (38.9% for 50 mg and 27.4% for placebo). Additionally, ubrogepant 50 mg was statistically superior to placebo in the absence of light sensitivity (43.8% for 50 mg and 35.5% for placebo) and sound sensitivity (54.1% for 50 mg and 46.3% for placebo).FDA action on the NDA for ubrogepant is expected in December 2019, potentially making it the first oral CGRP to address unmet patient needs in acute treatment of migraine and the first FDA-approved gepant.11:21XLE Sector Briefing: Energy (58.71 -0.65)The energy sector (-1.1%) sits at the bottom of today's sector standings after showing relative weakness yesterday. The growth-sensitive sector is now down 2.4% since Friday versus a much more modest 0.1% week-to-date downtick in the S&P 500. Factors contributing to the underperformance:Notable pressure on crude oil. The energy component is down more than $1.00 today (-2.3%) and down $2.01 (-3.5%) since Friday's settlement. This has sent the price of oil beneath its 200-day moving average (57.37) with the 50-day average (55.65) looming just below. Tax-loss related selling. The energy sector has been the weakest performer of 2019, meaning the group contains a fair share of names that have underperformed since the end of 2018. These names are more likely to be sold before the end of 2019 as investors look to reduce some of the tax impact of taking capital gains this year.Notable movers:HollyFrontier (HFC 51.56, -2.35, -4.4%): falling to its lowest level since early October. The company announced a new project and a new buyback authorization yesterday morning.

That corner is the retail industry, which has been broadsided today by disappointing earnings/sales results and guidance from Home Depot (HD 226.60, -12.25, -5.1%) and Kohl's (KSS 48.09, -10.31, -17.7%).The weakness in HD is having an outsized impact on the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (-0.9%); meanwhile, the combined impact of the disappointments from these well-known retailers is creating some angst about consumer spending activity entering the all-important holiday selling season.That angst is showing up in a sympathy trade that has knocked down the prices of many other retail stocks today, like Macy's (M 15.36, -1.51, -9.0%), Best Buy (BBY 75.61, -1.68, -2.2%), and Gap (GPS 16.62, -0.68, -3.9%) to name a few. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.97, -0.85, -1.9%) reflects the broader trend of underperformance for the retailers in today's market action.Those issues notwithstanding, the broader market is still holding up just fine as it is drawing influential support from the information technology (+0.3%), healthcare (+0.3%), and financial (+0.2%) sectors, which continue to attract interest from value and growth-minded investors alike.Separately, the market's overall resilience to selling pressure remains a tying factor for a number of participants who are fearful of missing out on further gains. That fear, ostensibly, is lending some buying support that has kept downside pressure in check.The Russell 2000 is up 0.2%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.1%; the S&P 500 is down 0.1%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%.10:00XLY Sector Briefing: Consumer Discretionary (120.74 -1.05)The consumer discretionary sector (-0.8%) represents an early pocket of relative weakness in a flat market. This makes for a continuation of this month's underperformance, which has the sector trading down 0.3% since the end of October versus a 2.8% gain in the S&P 500. Factors contributing to today's underperformance:Home Depot's (HD 227.72, -11.13, -4.7%) Q3 earnings report, which showed lower than expected revenue and lowered comparable sales guidance for FY20. Granted, Home Depot met Q3 EPS expectations, but the revenue shortfall and lowered comparable sales guidance have pressured the stock from a record high. Furthermore, the outlook is leading to some questions about the overall strength of consumer spending. Disappointing Q3 results and lowered FY20 guidance from Kohl's (KSS 48.86, -9.54, -16.4%), fueling worries that other apparel retailers could also report underwhelming results.Notable movers:Home Depot (HD 227.72, -11.13, -4.7%): falling back below its 50-day moving average (232.37) after setting a fresh record high on Monday. Kohl's (KSS 48.86, -9.54, -16.4%): falling to its lowest level in more than a month in response to weaker than expected quarterly results. Macy's (M 15.35, -1.53, -9.0%): sliding back below its 50-day moving average (15.76) after weak results from Kohl's. Nordstrom (JWN 35.10, -2.78, -7.3%): falling below its 200-day moving average (36.33) and toward its 50-day moving average (34.94) in sympathy with Kohl's.

For the study to be successful, the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of the response rate had to be at least 90%.The study achieved all six key secondary endpoints, including superiority to leuprolide acetate on rapid suppression of testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA), all with p-values <0.0001.Five key secondary endpoints demonstrated superiority to leuprolide acetate, including rapid suppression of testosterone at Day 4 and Day 15, profound suppression of testosterone at Day 15, rapid suppression of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at Day 15, and suppression of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) at Week 24 (all p-values <0.0001). In addition, relugolix demonstrated non-inferiority to leuprolide acetate on sustained testosterone suppression through 48 weeks (96.7% vs. 88.8%, respectively) with a between-group difference of 7.9% (95% CI: 4.1%,11.8%), the primary endpoint required for regulatory submissions outside of the U.S. In addition, the pharmacodynamic results showed no testosterone flare after initiation of relugolix and mean testosterone levels returned to normal levels within 90 days after treatment discontinuation.A New Drug Application (NDA) submission is expected in the second quarter of 2020.A conference call and webcast are to be held today at 8:30 a.m. EST / 5:30 a.m. PST.07:32SRRK Scholar Rock announces preliminary pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic results from the TOPAZ Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial of SRK-015 for the treatment of patients with spinal muscular atrophy (7.20 )The planned preliminary PK/PD analysis, which includes data from 29 patients with SMA across all three cohorts, showed dose-proportional drug exposure and demonstrated target engagement, as evidenced by dose-dependent increases of up to 100-fold in the serum levels of latent myostatin following SRK-015 treatment (2 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg doses).

Khoury, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of KLX Energy Services commented, "Contemporaneously with the abrupt decline in activity, we took steps to align our business with current customer demand. Specifically, we implemented an approximate 17 percent reduction in force, as compared with the Company's July 31, 2019 staffing levels, consistent with the approximate 18 percent sequential quarterly decline in our third quarter revenues. We aggressively cut costs in every area of our business, and we warm stacked the vast majority of our Permian based wireline assets. As a result of these and other measures, we expect to take a third quarter charge of approximately $13 million. Notwithstanding the precipitous decline in industry conditions, we generated approximately $44 million in cash flow from operations and approximately $31 million in free cash flow, bringing our cash balance to approximately $121 million for the quarter ended October 31, 2019. In addition, our $100 million credit facility remains undrawn.""The abrupt deterioration in industry conditions, which accelerated through the end of our third quarter, was driven by a sharp sequential quarterly decline in U.S. land rig count and an unprecedented decline in active frac spreads from the second quarter to the third quarter. In fact, there was a significant sequential decline in hydraulic fracturing activity during each month of the third quarter. The decline in Exploration & Production activity resulted in lower demand levels and lower current and expected revenues for our business, which led the Company to accelerate its annual testing for asset impairment into the third quarter. While the Company has not yet completed this analysis, we expect to report a non-cash asset impairment charge in the range of approximately $45 million to $60 million. The Company is in the process of finalizing the actual amount of the impairment charge, which will be completed prior to reporting its third quarter financial results."06:00CEO CNOOC Ltd names President Xu Keqiang as CEO (152.50 )06:00TRP TC Energy to provide financial update and review strategic plans at Investor Day, reaffirms expectation to grow common share dividend at an annual rate of 8-10% through 2021 (51.44 )"Our $100 billion portfolio of high-quality, long-life energy infrastructure assets are expected to generate record financial results again in 2019 underpinned by strong market fundamentals," said Russ Girling, TC Energy's president and chief executive officer. "Looking forward, we continue to advance $30 billion of commercially secured projects that will expand and extend our asset footprint across North America."As those projects enter service, TC Energy expects comparable earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to exceed $10 billion in 2022. This represents an increase of more than 16 per cent when compared to comparable EBITDA of $8.6 billion in 2018 despite significant asset sales that have accelerated the strengthening of the company's balance sheet. Notably, approximately 95 per cent of comparable EBITDA is expected to come from regulated assets or long-term contracts. At the same time, the company continues to methodically advance more than $20 billion of projects under development including Keystone XL and the Bruce Power life extension program. Success in advancing these and other organic growth opportunities that are expected to emanate from TC Energy's five operating businesses across North America would add to the company's growth outlook."Based on the confidence we have in our business plans, we are reaffirming that we expect to grow our common share dividend at an annual rate of eight to 10 per cent through 2021," added Girling. "Our dividend outlook is supported by expected growth in earnings and cash flow and in line with our historically strong dividend coverage ratios."06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- World markets continue climb higher; US Futures in record territoryThe global equity markets are mostly higher once again with US Futures venturing into all-time high territory for a second straight night.

These utility operations have customers in eight states and expect customer growth to continue at a rate of 1-2% annually. The anticipated investment reflects opportunities to improve the safety and reliability of the company's systems. Also included in the utility's five-year program is the construction of an 88-megawatt simple-cycle, natural gas-fired combustion turbine near Mandan, North Dakota.The capital investment plan at the pipeline and midstream business reflects a focus on organic growth. This includes the Demicks Lake Expansion project under construction in North Dakota, which is expected to be in service in the first quarter of 2020 and as designed will increase capacity by 175 mln cubic feet per day. The North Bakken Expansion project is also included in the capital forecast. As designed, this project in the heart of the Bakken will increase capacity by an estimated 350 mln cubic feet per day and is expected to be in service in late 2021. This business is exploring additional organic growth projects that, if executed, would be incremental to the capital investment plan. Natural gas production continues at record levels in the Bakken, driving the need for additional infrastructure.At the company's construction materials and services businesses, the capital expenditures forecast is focused primarily on organic expansion opportunities, normal equipment and plant replacements and upgrades. Included in the outlined forecast is the development of Knife River's Honey Creek Quarry in Texas, which includes the construction of a rock-crushing plant and the purchase of aggregate railcars. The company expects public sector workload growth as new state and local infrastructure spending initiatives are introduced.16:44ZG Zillow announced that Greg Schwartz, president of media and marketplaces, is stepping down to take a professional break (39.74 +0.23)The businesses that currently report to Schwartz in the Mortgages and Internet, Media and Technology (IMT) segments are being transitioned to other senior executives.

The Russell 2000 (-0.3%) closed in negative territory.The day began with the market digesting a tweet from a China-based CNBC reporter, who said she was informed by a Chinese government source that Beijing is pessimistic about a trade deal because President Trump hasn't supported a tariff rollback. Based on the modest losses and ensuing price action, the market presumably remained optimistic about a Phase One agreement.The large-cap indices eased their way into positive territory thanks to the turnarounds in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (+0.3%), information technology (+0.3%), and communication services (+0.3%) sectors. Consistent leaders included the consumer staples (+0.5%) and real estate (+0.5%) sectors, as the negative-sounding trade headline likely fostered some conservative-minded interest.The trade-sensitive industrials (-0.3%) and materials (-0.2%) sectors were among today's laggards, but their losses were small compared to the 1.3% drop in the energy sector, which was pressured by the decline in oil prices ($57.04, -0.71, -1.2%).Generally, there wasn't any concerted effort to sell a market trading at all-time highs, but investors weren't eager to embrace risk, either. The trend has been positive, which has likely drawn in some reluctant investors into the market, and today simply may have been a natural breather for a market breaking out to new highs.Notable corporate news included HP Inc. (HPQ 20.01, -0.17, -0.8%) turning down the takeover bid from Xerox (XRX 39.30, +0.36, +0.9%). HP remained open to a deal, though. Netflix (NFLX 302.57, +7.54, +2.6%) shares outperformed on speculation that either Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman built a large stake in the company.U.S. Treasuries extended last week's advance, pushing yields slightly lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points to 1.81%.

SPE now owns 100% of the multimedia entertainment company.

Prior to the transaction, SPE owned a 58% stake in Game Show Network, and AT&T owned the remaining 42%. In connection with the transaction, AT&T received approx. $500 mln, including proceeds for its equity stake valued at $380 mln (before transaction-related adjustments) and dividends of approx. $130 mln.

We have had a long relationship with Letko and most certainly appreciate their investment in our Company. Our establishment of domicile in the U.S. was carefully considered.... rationale for the move is crystal clear-we want to expose our Company and all its stockholders to increasingly larger pools of investment in U.S. index funds and passively managed accounts. The change in corporate domicile will not change how we run our day-to-day business, nor diminish the important role our Canadian assets play in our portfolio today. We do not believe that our Canadian investors will be forced to sell beyond the Canadian indices, and we will remain listed on both the TSX and the NYSE. Furthermore, we know that most of our large investors in Canada also own many of our U.S.-domiciled peers today. We deeply believe this move ultimately will be positive for ALL shareholders as exposure to the significantly larger U.S. market and funds is estimated to create more than $1 billion of additional demand for our shares."The change in corporate domicile, the rebrand to Ovintiv, and a previously announced 1 -- for -- 5 consolidation and share exchange require two-thirds of votes cast for shareholder approval. A special meeting of Encana shareholders will be held in early 2020.

The retail industry was under pressure following disappointing quarterly results and guidance from Home Depot (HD 225.86, -12.99, -5.4%) and Kohl's (KSS 47.02, -11.38, -19.5%).The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.4%) also finished lower, while the Nasdaq Composite (+0.2%) and Russell 2000 (+0.4%) finished higher. The Nasdaq closed at another record high.The session began with each of the large-cap indices setting intraday highs despite the negative sentiment in the retail space. The early advance quickly faltered but overall losses were modest, and transient, as the S&P 500 only dipped 0.3% below its flat line before buyers quickly stepped in to buy the dip.The retail space didn't benefit from an opportunistic mindset, though, as the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.95, -0.87, -1.9%) finished near its lows like the S&P 500 energy (-1.5%) and consumer discretionary (-1.0%) sectors. Home Depot dragged on the consumer discretionary sector while a 3% drop in WTI crude ($55.21, -1.84, -3.2%) weighed on the energy space.Gains were mainly found in the heavily-weighted S&P 500 health care (+0.7%), information technology (+0.2%), and financials (+0.2%) sectors. The real estate sector (+0.2%) also finished in positive territory.TJX Companies (TJX 60.64, +1.09, +1.8%) was a bright spot among the retailers after it beat top and bottom-line estimates and raised its full-year guidance. TJX likely tempered some concerns about U.S. consumer spending for the holiday shopping season that may have been engendered by Home Depot and Kohl's.Separately, shares of AT&T (T 38.00, -1.63, -4.1%) pulled back 4% after the stock was downgraded to Sell from Neutral at MoffettNathanson. Shares of Slack (WORK 21.18, -1.93, -8.4%) sold off on news that Microsoft's (MSFT 150.39, +0.05, unch) competitive product, Teams, increased daily active users by nearly 50% since July.The U.S. Treasury market was relatively quiet, but demand for longer-dated bonds contributed to some curve-flattening activity. The 2-yr yield was unchanged at 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.79%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 97.85.Tuesday's economic calendar was limited to Housing Starts and Building Permits for October:Total housing starts increased 3.8% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.314 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.300 million) while total building permits increased 5.0% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.461 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.365 million).There was a sizable jump in starts (+8.6%) and permits (+8.2%) for multi-unit dwellings, yet the key takeaway from the report is that starts (+2.0%) and permits (+3.2%) increased for single-family units in an inventory-constrained environment for single-family homes.Looking ahead, the FOMC Minutes from the October 30-31 meeting and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index will be released on Wednesday.Nasdaq Composite +29.2% YTDS&P 500 +24.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +19.8% YTDRussell 2000 +18.5% YTD16:24MGP MGM Growth Properties commences public offering of 24.0 mln Class A shares (32.49 -0.37)The company expects that it will issue and sell 12,000,000 shares directly to the underwriters at closing and that the underwriters will purchase, at the request of the company, 12,000,000 shares from forward purchasers under forward sale agreements.The company plans to use proceeds primarily to repay a portion of the borrowings outstanding under its senior secured term loan A facility and senior secured term loan B facility, which the company believes will well-position it to be able to agree to and consummate a potential JV transaction under discussion with MGM Resorts International and honor any potential redemption of units representing limited partnership units in MGM Growth Properties Operating Partnership LP held by MGM for cash, should MGM elect to exercise any redemption right, if the company decides to pursue such a transaction, or, alternatively, for general corporate purposes.16:24PAGS PagSeguro Digital misses by BRL0.02, misses on revs (36.76 -1.01)Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of BRL 1.18 per share, excluding non-recurring items, BRL 0.02 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of BRL 1.20; revenues rose 30.3% year/year to BRL 1.46 bln vs the BRL 1.5 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Active merchants of 5.0 million, growth of 1.2 million active merchants in the last twelve months; R$29.4 billion in total payment volume, up 45.0% compared with 3Q18;16:20FLNT Fluent authorizes the repurchase of up to $5 mln shares of common stock (1.42 +0.11)16:18MTB M&T Bank increases quarterly cash dividend to $1.10/share from $1.00/share (162.88 -0.09)16:17FIX Comfort Systems increases stock repurchase program (50.40 -0.11)Board of Directors has approved an amendment to the stock repurchase program to increase the shares authorized and remaining as available to purchase back up to 1,000,000 shares by authorizing the Company to acquire up to 764,760 additional shares of its outstanding common stock.16:17AVID Avid Tech at Investor Day guided FY20 adj.

Macy's has guided its fiscal 2020 EPS down 29% at the midpoint to $2.85-3.05, including $0.25 in asset sale gains, with revenue flat yr/yr, comp sales flat to up 1%, and gross margins down slightly. Macy's expects comp sales to improve meaningfully in the fourth quarter, citing a difficult compare in the month of October.The market remains skeptical that the nation's largest department store can generate long-term profit growth given secular challenges.The company's comparable store sales growth has been muted despite the relative strength of consumer spending, which has been supporting the domestic economy.Department stores continue to struggle with lower mall traffic. Last week, the Census Bureau reported core retail sales up 4.2% yr/yr for the three months ending in October, but Department store sales fell 6.1%.With a $4.7 bln market cap, Macy's trades ~6x EPS and ~6x EV/EBITDA, including $3.9 bln in net debt. That represents a slight discount to department store peers. Fortunately, Macy's does have a strong balance sheet, so it can afford to pay its dividend, which yields a robust 9% payout annually.15:15BONDX Treasury Market SummaryLonger Tenors Pad Recent GainsU.S. Treasuries recorded another round of gains on Tuesday, pressuring yields on the 10-yr note and the 30-yr bond into the neighborhood of their respective 50-day moving averages. The Tuesday session bore some resemblance to Monday's affair, as Treasuries started the day with modest losses, recovering them in short order. The early weakness took place after an upbeat start to the European session, which saw the release of strong vehicle registration figures for October. The 10-yr note and the 30-yr bond made it back to their flat lines just minutes after the cash start while shorter tenors also rebounded but took a bit longer before reaching positive territory. Treasuries overtook their morning highs in the early afternoon, remaining near their best levels of the day until the close. The U.S. Dollar Index rose 0.1% to 97.86, snapping a four-day skid. Yield Check: 2-yr: UNCH at 1.59% 3-yr: UNCH at 1.59% 5-yr: UNCH at 1.62% 10-yr: -2 bps to 1.79% 30-yr: -4 bps to 2.26%News: The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow forecast for Q4 GDP was increased to 0.4% from 0.3% following today's housing data.

Italy's September Industrial New Orders increased 1.0% m/m (expected -1.5%; last 0.8%), rising 0.3% yr/yr (expected -3.9%; last -10.4%). September Industrial Sales ticked up 0.2% m/m (expected -0.4%; last -0.3%) but fell 1.6% yr/yr (expected -1.0%; last -2.2%). New car registrations in the eurozone increased 8.7% yr/yr, representing the strongest growth rate in a decade. Car registrations through the first ten months of 2019 are down 0.7% yr/yr. Today's Data: Total housing starts increased 3.8% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.314 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.300 million) while total building permits increased 5.0% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.461 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.365 million). There was a sizable jump in starts (+8.6%) and permits (+8.2%) for multi-unit dwellings, yet the key takeaway from the report is that starts (+2.0%) and permits (+3.2%) increased for single-family units in an inventory-constrained environment for single-family homes.

LOW has reported EPS upside in four of the past five quarters.The CapitalIQ consensus estimate for Q3 EPS is $1.35. The revenue consensus estimate is $17.69 bln. Note: LOW typically guides for revenue, EPS and comps in the press release for the full year. Its current full year guidance is for adjusted EPS of $5.45-5.65 while sales are expected to increase +2%. It'll be important to see if the company reaffirms or changes this guidance. Same store comps are always a key metric for Lowe's. In Q2 (Jul), comps came in at +2.3% and +3.2% for the US home improvement business. Home Depot (HD) is always a key barometer as to what to expect from Lowe's. HD was not super impressive as comps underwhelmed and HD lowered full year guidance. It's not all doom and gloom for Lowe's because HD cited some internal initiatives that are taking longer to materialize, so much of it may be company-specific and not industry-wide problems. Specifically, HD was emphatic on the call that it "sees a strong and engaged customer" and that "housing is healthy and stable." Another area to watch is tariffs. HD said that tariffs are having an impact but are manageable as its merchants have done a good job at mitigating the impact. Aside from the Home Depot angle, another aspect to this earnings report will be progress on Lowe's turnaround. Despite having a similar number of stores, Lowe's is dwarfed by Home Depot (HD) in terms of annual revenue ($72 bln vs $111 bln for HD) and HD holds a sizeable profitability gap. Lowe's wants to improve merchandising availability, to improve its digital presence/app, to increase the use of self-check-out lanes and cut worker hours to boost productivity. It'll be interesting to get an update on its progress. Overall, our sense is that the weak comps/guidance from Home Depot has lowered expectations for Lowe's this quarter. However, with Lowe's, we think investors are more focused on the bigger picture, namely how is the turnaround going.13:42TPX Tempur Sealy Int'l: US ITC determines mattresses from China injure US industry; Department of Commerce will issue antidumping duty order on imports of this product from China (85.44 -1.05)The United States International Trade Commission (USITC) today determined that a U.S. industry is materially injured by reason of imports of mattresses from China that the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) has determined are sold in the United States at less than fair value.

ITC Release13:15ABMD Abiomed says Abiomed medical office is issuing publication review of observational analysis of Impella that was presented by Amin et al. at the American Heart Association Conference on November 17 (186.19 +8.10)According to the company, the AHA analysis is flawed because:The data source has significant limitations, containing just a fraction of Impella patients and unable to delineate between common adverse events.The Impella patients were much sicker and had greater baseline and procedural risks.The analysis excluded the costliest IABP patients who were escalated to other therapies.Additionally, the conclusion is aggressive because administrative coding data cannot delineate between adverse events common to high-risk patients and device related events.13:08SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: ACB (37.93 mln +2.94%), TEVA (22.61 mln +0.97%), BMY (19.42 mln -1.7%), CELG (13.89 mln -0.93%), CLVS (13.81 mln +6.23%)Industrials: GE (17.95 mln -0.6%)Consumer Discretionary: M (32.83 mln -10.04%), ROKU (21.57 mln -1.82%), KSS (19.77 mln -18.61%), NIO (18.01 mln +3.06%), F (17.54 mln -0.28%)Information Technology: AMD (54.78 mln +2.61%), NOK (20.12 mln -0.72%)Financials: BAC (17.88 mln -0.27%)Energy: CHK (55.18 mln -8.31%), ET (13.13 mln -1.99%), ECA (12.04 mln -4.56%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: MDCO (6.75x +19.55%), CRSP (5.7x +16.03%), EDIT (3.67x +11.4%), ATNX (3.12x +34.53%), CELG (2.97x -0.93%), NTLA (2.83x +12.13%)Materials: ASH (3.23x -4.14%)Industrials: WWD (3.27x -0.37%)Consumer Discretionary: KSS (6.3x -18.61%), HD (3.61x -5.23%)Information Technology: JKS (4.05x +12.71%)Financials: EFC (18.2x -3.03%), GBDC (3.31x +1.91%)Consumer Staples: CHEF (3.43x -8.38%)Utilities: DUK (3.42x -1.97%), ELP (3.22x +2.42%)13:06SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: ATNX (15.39 +34.53%), MDCO (70.12 +19.55%), BCRX (2 +17.35%), CRSP (67.92 +16.03%), NTLA (15.25 +12.13%), DRNA (23.87 +11.59%), EDIT (25.79 +11.4%), ARQL (8.4 +10.67%), APHA (4.21 +10.08%), TCDA (37.66 +9.92%), BOLD (28.08 +9.9%), WVE (31.02 +8.58%), TBIO (10.45 +8.52%), ASND (115.61 +8.07%), GLYC (6.18 +8.04%), AMRX (3.05 +7.6%), PRQR (6.71 +7.36%), PRTA (10.99 +7.28%)Information Technology: JKS (16.76 +12.71%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: VAPO (10.77 -7.08%)Industrials: BLDP (6.52 -10.19%)Consumer Discretionary: KSS (47.53 -18.61%), M (15.19 -10.04%), SIG (15.7 -8.61%)Financials: PPDF (2.5 -12.89%), JT (1.86 -10.39%), YRD (5.51 -9.97%)Energy: KLXE (5.44 -26.19%), UNT (0.72 -11.3%), CRC (7.58 -10.67%), ESV (3.82 -8.95%), SPN (0.33 -8.45%), CHK (0.59 -8.31%), EXTN (6.31 -7.82%), TUSK (1.38 -7.38%), PVAC (24.25 -7.35%)Consumer Staples: CHEF (32.57 -8.38%), DF (0.07 -7.5%)12:57WRAPX Midday Market Summary: Stock market trades mixed; Home Depot, Kohl's weigh on retail spaceThe S&P 500 is currently down 0.1% in midday action, with weakness concentrated in the retail space following disappointing quarterly results and guidance from Home Depot (HD 226.39, -12.46, -5.2%) and Kohl's (KSS 47.58, -10.82, -18.5%).The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.4%, but the Nasdaq Composite (+0.2%) and Russell 2000 (+0.4%) trade higher.The underperformance of the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 44.12, -0.71, -1.6%) best displays the negative sentiment that has subsumed the retail industry today. Both the Dow and S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (-0.8%), meanwhile, can attribute their underperformance to Home Depot.The S&P 500 energy sector (-1.1%) is down even more amid a sharp decline in oil prices ($55.69, -1.45, -2.5%), but the market isn't getting concerned about the U.S. consumer based on a couple of reports. Instead, the market is hanging in there amid gains in the heavily-weighted health care (+0.3%), information technology (+0.1%), and financials (+0.1%) sectors.The consensus among many investors is that the market is due for a pullback, but the absence of one has created a sort of pain trade for investors fearful of missing out on further gains. The S&P 500 was down just 0.3% at its low earlier today before a buy-the-dip effort briefly brought it back above its flat line.Separately, shares of AT&T (T 37.65, -1.99) are down 5.0% after the stock was downgraded to Sell from Neutral at MoffettNathanson with a price target of $30. Shares of Slack (WORK 20.88, -2.24, -9.7%) are down 10% on news that Microsoft's (MSFT 150.99, +0.65, +0.4%) competitive product, Teams, has increased daily active users by nearly 50% since July.In the Treasury market, demand for longer-dated bonds has caused some minor curve-flattening activity. The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.79%. The U.S. Dollar Index is flat at 97.79.Today's economic calendar was limited to Housing Starts and Building Permits for October:Total housing starts increased 3.8% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.314 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.300 million) while total building permits increased 5.0% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.461 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.365 million).There was a sizable jump in starts (+8.6%) and permits (+8.2%) for multi-unit dwellings, yet the key takeaway from the report is that starts (+2.0%) and permits (+3.2%) increased for single-family units in an inventory-constrained environment for single-family homes.12:45MRK Merck increases quarterly dividend to $0.61 from $0.55/share (84.21 +0.08)12:25SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Myovant Sciences (MYOV) gains on Phase 3 relugolix data -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersMYOV (10.86 +79.21%): Announced results from the Phase 3 HERO study of once-daily, oral relugolix in men with advanced prostate cancer; the trial met its primary efficacy endpoint and all six key secondary endpoints -- in the primary endpoint responder analysis, 96.7% of men receiving the relugolix regimen achieved sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels through 48 weeks.

Wainwright, citing a positive view of co's new strategic alliance with Novo Nordisk (NVO), which was announced yesterday; the firm views the deal as underscoring a "Burgeoning RNAi Powerhouse." Continued strength sees the stock touch up to new four-year highs.Small Cap LosersI (6.19 -22.91%): Continued weakness following FCC Chairman Ajit Pai's announcement midday yesterday of support for a public auction of 280 megahertz of the C-band spectrum; the C-Band Alliance, a satellite operator group of which co is a member, issued a statement yesterday following the Chairman's communication, noting, among other comments, that the announcement "does not address the critical involvement of the incumbent satellite operators in executing the complex task of reconfiguring and transitioning their networks." Following yesterday's developments, the stock was downgraded to In-Line from Outperform at Evercore ISI, which also cut co's price target to $11 from $38; JPMorgan lowered co's target to $9 from $22. Wells Fargo noted that embrace of a public auction "does not seem to offer much potential capital to the satellite players" and also noted the impact that the public approach will have on timing, saying, "Getting this spectrum auctioned off in 1H 2020 (as the C-Band Alliance plan had outlined) seems naively optimistic at this point." The stock again records new 52-week lows, now down circa 76% month-to-date. PPDF (2.53 -11.85%): Missed estimates for Q3 EPS and revs (+35.0% yr/yr to RMB1.51 bln).

Their weakness has acted as a weight on the broader market, yet the movement of the S&P 500 index has been largely a function of technical price action.Briefing.com's Technical Take page identified 3127 as a secondary resistance level for the S&P 500. That level was tested with the opening move (3127.64) but quickly failed as steady selling eventually dropped the S&P 500 back to 3113.46 at this morning's low, which was reached just before 11:00 a.m. ET. That level fell within a secondary support level (3115/3112) that was also identified on the Technical Take Page.Traders, therefore, appear to be respecting these technical boundaries for now on a day that is devoid of any major macro news drivers, particularly as they relate to trade, and as it is suggested that the market is short-term overextended and due for a pullback.The Russell 2000 is up 0.4%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.3%; the S&P 500 is unchanged; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.4%.11:51QCOM Qualcomm issues 3 year targets at Analyst Day (88.73 -1.78)From CFO's presentation at Analyst Day:3 year targets as earnings mix shift to QCT from QTLRevenue: QCT segment SAM: 10% CAGR, grow faster than SAM and Apple product revenues QTL: current run rate + Huawei resolution Operating margin: QCT grows to >20%; QTL: ~70%Summarizing Qualcomm opportunities: Mature handset industry and current macroeconomic environment; Accelerated 5G migration compared to 4G; Mobile handset platform: 4G->5G transition, RF Front-End growth; Growth beyond mobile: Auto, IoT, Compute, ADAS, Cloud/Edge AI 75+ 5G licenses including key anchor agreements.Grow earnings faster than revenues.

The ACHIEVE II trial evaluated ubrogepant 50 mg and 25 mg, compared with placebo, across a wide range of clinical endpoints, including the co-primary endpoints of pain freedom (no pain) and freedom from the most bothersome migraine-associated symptom at two hours post-initial dose. For the two co-primary endpoints, ubrogepant 50 mg and 25 mg showed statistically significant higher response rates for pain freedom at two hours (21.8% for 50 mg, 20.7% for 25 mg and 14.3% for placebo), and the 50 mg dose demonstrated statistically significant higher response rates for the freedom from the most bothersome migraine-associated symptom at two hours (38.9% for 50 mg and 27.4% for placebo). Additionally, ubrogepant 50 mg was statistically superior to placebo in the absence of light sensitivity (43.8% for 50 mg and 35.5% for placebo) and sound sensitivity (54.1% for 50 mg and 46.3% for placebo).FDA action on the NDA for ubrogepant is expected in December 2019, potentially making it the first oral CGRP to address unmet patient needs in acute treatment of migraine and the first FDA-approved gepant.11:21XLE Sector Briefing: Energy (58.71 -0.65)The energy sector (-1.1%) sits at the bottom of today's sector standings after showing relative weakness yesterday. The growth-sensitive sector is now down 2.4% since Friday versus a much more modest 0.1% week-to-date downtick in the S&P 500. Factors contributing to the underperformance:Notable pressure on crude oil. The energy component is down more than $1.00 today (-2.3%) and down $2.01 (-3.5%) since Friday's settlement. This has sent the price of oil beneath its 200-day moving average (57.37) with the 50-day average (55.65) looming just below. Tax-loss related selling. The energy sector has been the weakest performer of 2019, meaning the group contains a fair share of names that have underperformed since the end of 2018. These names are more likely to be sold before the end of 2019 as investors look to reduce some of the tax impact of taking capital gains this year.Notable movers:HollyFrontier (HFC 51.56, -2.35, -4.4%): falling to its lowest level since early October. The company announced a new project and a new buyback authorization yesterday morning. Noble Energy (NBL 19.41, -0.51, -2.6%): nearing its 2019 low after finding resistance at its 50-day moving average (21.34) at the end of last week.

ConocoPhillips (COP 57.26, +0.56, +1.0%): best performing sector component, reclaiming its 50-day moving average (57.03). The company is hosting its analyst & investor meeting today, where it is expected to reaffirm its commitment to a strategy unveiled in 2016.10:35OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:DO Jan20 5 calls are seeing interest with 4230 contracts trading vs. open int of 0, pushing implied vol up around 10 points to ~87%.

That corner is the retail industry, which has been broadsided today by disappointing earnings/sales results and guidance from Home Depot (HD 226.60, -12.25, -5.1%) and Kohl's (KSS 48.09, -10.31, -17.7%).The weakness in HD is having an outsized impact on the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (-0.9%); meanwhile, the combined impact of the disappointments from these well-known retailers is creating some angst about consumer spending activity entering the all-important holiday selling season.That angst is showing up in a sympathy trade that has knocked down the prices of many other retail stocks today, like Macy's (M 15.36, -1.51, -9.0%), Best Buy (BBY 75.61, -1.68, -2.2%), and Gap (GPS 16.62, -0.68, -3.9%) to name a few. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.97, -0.85, -1.9%) reflects the broader trend of underperformance for the retailers in today's market action.Those issues notwithstanding, the broader market is still holding up just fine as it is drawing influential support from the information technology (+0.3%), healthcare (+0.3%), and financial (+0.2%) sectors, which continue to attract interest from value and growth-minded investors alike.Separately, the market's overall resilience to selling pressure remains a tying factor for a number of participants who are fearful of missing out on further gains. That fear, ostensibly, is lending some buying support that has kept downside pressure in check.The Russell 2000 is up 0.2%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.1%; the S&P 500 is down 0.1%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%.10:00XLY Sector Briefing: Consumer Discretionary (120.74 -1.05)The consumer discretionary sector (-0.8%) represents an early pocket of relative weakness in a flat market. This makes for a continuation of this month's underperformance, which has the sector trading down 0.3% since the end of October versus a 2.8% gain in the S&P 500. Factors contributing to today's underperformance:Home Depot's (HD 227.72, -11.13, -4.7%) Q3 earnings report, which showed lower than expected revenue and lowered comparable sales guidance for FY20. Granted, Home Depot met Q3 EPS expectations, but the revenue shortfall and lowered comparable sales guidance have pressured the stock from a record high. Furthermore, the outlook is leading to some questions about the overall strength of consumer spending. Disappointing Q3 results and lowered FY20 guidance from Kohl's (KSS 48.86, -9.54, -16.4%), fueling worries that other apparel retailers could also report underwhelming results.Notable movers:Home Depot (HD 227.72, -11.13, -4.7%): falling back below its 50-day moving average (232.37) after setting a fresh record high on Monday. Kohl's (KSS 48.86, -9.54, -16.4%): falling to its lowest level in more than a month in response to weaker than expected quarterly results. Macy's (M 15.35, -1.53, -9.0%): sliding back below its 50-day moving average (15.76) after weak results from Kohl's. Nordstrom (JWN 35.10, -2.78, -7.3%): falling below its 200-day moving average (36.33) and toward its 50-day moving average (34.94) in sympathy with Kohl's. Gap (GPS 16.70, -0.60, -3.4%): approaching its October low after Kohl's disappointing results. TJX (TJX 60.68, +1.13, +1.9%): touched a fresh record after better than expected Q3 results overshadowed below-consensus Q4 EPS guidance. Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL 119.72, +1.32, +1.1%): bucking the overall trend in the sector.09:46SCANX Earnings mvoersJKS +13.79% WUBA +7.04% NJR +3.91% CRMT +3.57% TJX +2.82% DAVA +2.24% ASND +2.07% ESE +1.57%KSS -15.96% PPDF -7.14% HD -5.30% ASH -4.63% MMS -2.59% BILI -2.32% WWD -2.00% ZTO -1.29% KRNT -1.30% TDG -0.78% ALV -0.56% MDT -0.36%09:41WRAPX Opening Market Summary: Stock market opens slightly higher, retail dragsThe major indices open slightly higher at new all-time highs. The S&P 500 is up 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.3%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows financials (+0.4%) and information technology (+0.3%) leading the early advance. Conversely, the utilities (-0.6%) and consumer discretionary (-0.4%) sectors underperform, with the latter pressured by Home Depot (HD 228.90, -9.94, -4.2%) following its earnings results and guidance.The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 44.37, -0.45, -1.0%) is being dragged lower by shares of Kohl's (KSS 49.48, -8.86, -15.1%) after the company missed earnings estimates and lowered its FY20 EPS below consensus.U.S. Treasuries are little changed.

In the primary endpoint responder analysis, 96.7% (95% CI: 94.9%, 97.9%) of men receiving once-daily, oral relugolix achieved sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels. A responder was defined as achieving and maintaining testosterone suppression to less than or equal to 50 ng/dL from Week 5 through Week 48. For the study to be successful, the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of the response rate had to be at least 90%.The study achieved all six key secondary endpoints, including superiority to leuprolide acetate on rapid suppression of testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA), all with p-values <0.0001.Five key secondary endpoints demonstrated superiority to leuprolide acetate, including rapid suppression of testosterone at Day 4 and Day 15, profound suppression of testosterone at Day 15, rapid suppression of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at Day 15, and suppression of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) at Week 24 (all p-values <0.0001). In addition, relugolix demonstrated non-inferiority to leuprolide acetate on sustained testosterone suppression through 48 weeks (96.7% vs. 88.8%, respectively) with a between-group difference of 7.9% (95% CI: 4.1%,11.8%), the primary endpoint required for regulatory submissions outside of the U.S. In addition, the pharmacodynamic results showed no testosterone flare after initiation of relugolix and mean testosterone levels returned to normal levels within 90 days after treatment discontinuation.A New Drug Application (NDA) submission is expected in the second quarter of 2020.A conference call and webcast are to be held today at 8:30 a.m. EST / 5:30 a.m. PST.07:32SRRK Scholar Rock announces preliminary pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic results from the TOPAZ Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial of SRK-015 for the treatment of patients with spinal muscular atrophy (7.20 )The planned preliminary PK/PD analysis, which includes data from 29 patients with SMA across all three cohorts, showed dose-proportional drug exposure and demonstrated target engagement, as evidenced by dose-dependent increases of up to 100-fold in the serum levels of latent myostatin following SRK-015 treatment (2 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg doses).

Khoury, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of KLX Energy Services commented, "Contemporaneously with the abrupt decline in activity, we took steps to align our business with current customer demand. Specifically, we implemented an approximate 17 percent reduction in force, as compared with the Company's July 31, 2019 staffing levels, consistent with the approximate 18 percent sequential quarterly decline in our third quarter revenues. We aggressively cut costs in every area of our business, and we warm stacked the vast majority of our Permian based wireline assets. As a result of these and other measures, we expect to take a third quarter charge of approximately $13 million. Notwithstanding the precipitous decline in industry conditions, we generated approximately $44 million in cash flow from operations and approximately $31 million in free cash flow, bringing our cash balance to approximately $121 million for the quarter ended October 31, 2019. In addition, our $100 million credit facility remains undrawn.""The abrupt deterioration in industry conditions, which accelerated through the end of our third quarter, was driven by a sharp sequential quarterly decline in U.S. land rig count and an unprecedented decline in active frac spreads from the second quarter to the third quarter. In fact, there was a significant sequential decline in hydraulic fracturing activity during each month of the third quarter. The decline in Exploration & Production activity resulted in lower demand levels and lower current and expected revenues for our business, which led the Company to accelerate its annual testing for asset impairment into the third quarter. While the Company has not yet completed this analysis, we expect to report a non-cash asset impairment charge in the range of approximately $45 million to $60 million. The Company is in the process of finalizing the actual amount of the impairment charge, which will be completed prior to reporting its third quarter financial results."06:00CEO CNOOC Ltd names President Xu Keqiang as CEO (152.50 )06:00TRP TC Energy to provide financial update and review strategic plans at Investor Day, reaffirms expectation to grow common share dividend at an annual rate of 8-10% through 2021 (51.44 )"Our $100 billion portfolio of high-quality, long-life energy infrastructure assets are expected to generate record financial results again in 2019 underpinned by strong market fundamentals," said Russ Girling, TC Energy's president and chief executive officer. "Looking forward, we continue to advance $30 billion of commercially secured projects that will expand and extend our asset footprint across North America."As those projects enter service, TC Energy expects comparable earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to exceed $10 billion in 2022. This represents an increase of more than 16 per cent when compared to comparable EBITDA of $8.6 billion in 2018 despite significant asset sales that have accelerated the strengthening of the company's balance sheet. Notably, approximately 95 per cent of comparable EBITDA is expected to come from regulated assets or long-term contracts. At the same time, the company continues to methodically advance more than $20 billion of projects under development including Keystone XL and the Bruce Power life extension program. Success in advancing these and other organic growth opportunities that are expected to emanate from TC Energy's five operating businesses across North America would add to the company's growth outlook."Based on the confidence we have in our business plans, we are reaffirming that we expect to grow our common share dividend at an annual rate of eight to 10 per cent through 2021," added Girling. "Our dividend outlook is supported by expected growth in earnings and cash flow and in line with our historically strong dividend coverage ratios."06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- World markets continue climb higher; US Futures in record territoryThe global equity markets are mostly higher once again with US Futures venturing into all-time high territory for a second straight night.

The Russell 2000 (-0.3%) closed in negative territory.The day began with the market digesting a tweet from a China-based CNBC reporter, who said she was informed by a Chinese government source that Beijing is pessimistic about a trade deal because President Trump hasn't supported a tariff rollback. Based on the modest losses and ensuing price action, the market presumably remained optimistic about a Phase One agreement.The large-cap indices eased their way into positive territory thanks to the turnarounds in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (+0.3%), information technology (+0.3%), and communication services (+0.3%) sectors. Consistent leaders included the consumer staples (+0.5%) and real estate (+0.5%) sectors, as the negative-sounding trade headline likely fostered some conservative-minded interest.The trade-sensitive industrials (-0.3%) and materials (-0.2%) sectors were among today's laggards, but their losses were small compared to the 1.3% drop in the energy sector, which was pressured by the decline in oil prices ($57.04, -0.71, -1.2%).Generally, there wasn't any concerted effort to sell a market trading at all-time highs, but investors weren't eager to embrace risk, either. The trend has been positive, which has likely drawn in some reluctant investors into the market, and today simply may have been a natural breather for a market breaking out to new highs.Notable corporate news included HP Inc. (HPQ 20.01, -0.17, -0.8%) turning down the takeover bid from Xerox (XRX 39.30, +0.36, +0.9%). HP remained open to a deal, though. Netflix (NFLX 302.57, +7.54, +2.6%) shares outperformed on speculation that either Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman built a large stake in the company.U.S. Treasuries extended last week's advance, pushing yields slightly lower across the curve.

We have had a long relationship with Letko and most certainly appreciate their investment in our Company. Our establishment of domicile in the U.S. was carefully considered.... rationale for the move is crystal clear-we want to expose our Company and all its stockholders to increasingly larger pools of investment in U.S. index funds and passively managed accounts. The change in corporate domicile will not change how we run our day-to-day business, nor diminish the important role our Canadian assets play in our portfolio today. We do not believe that our Canadian investors will be forced to sell beyond the Canadian indices, and we will remain listed on both the TSX and the NYSE. Furthermore, we know that most of our large investors in Canada also own many of our U.S.-domiciled peers today. We deeply believe this move ultimately will be positive for ALL shareholders as exposure to the significantly larger U.S. market and funds is estimated to create more than $1 billion of additional demand for our shares."The change in corporate domicile, the rebrand to Ovintiv, and a previously announced 1 -- for -- 5 consolidation and share exchange require two-thirds of votes cast for shareholder approval. A special meeting of Encana shareholders will be held in early 2020.

The retail industry was under pressure following disappointing quarterly results and guidance from Home Depot (HD 225.86, -12.99, -5.4%) and Kohl's (KSS 47.02, -11.38, -19.5%).The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.4%) also finished lower, while the Nasdaq Composite (+0.2%) and Russell 2000 (+0.4%) finished higher. The Nasdaq closed at another record high.The session began with each of the large-cap indices setting intraday highs despite the negative sentiment in the retail space. The early advance quickly faltered but overall losses were modest, and transient, as the S&P 500 only dipped 0.3% below its flat line before buyers quickly stepped in to buy the dip.The retail space didn't benefit from an opportunistic mindset, though, as the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.95, -0.87, -1.9%) finished near its lows like the S&P 500 energy (-1.5%) and consumer discretionary (-1.0%) sectors. Home Depot dragged on the consumer discretionary sector while a 3% drop in WTI crude ($55.21, -1.84, -3.2%) weighed on the energy space.Gains were mainly found in the heavily-weighted S&P 500 health care (+0.7%), information technology (+0.2%), and financials (+0.2%) sectors. The real estate sector (+0.2%) also finished in positive territory.TJX Companies (TJX 60.64, +1.09, +1.8%) was a bright spot among the retailers after it beat top and bottom-line estimates and raised its full-year guidance. TJX likely tempered some concerns about U.S. consumer spending for the holiday shopping season that may have been engendered by Home Depot and Kohl's.Separately, shares of AT&T (T 38.00, -1.63, -4.1%) pulled back 4% after the stock was downgraded to Sell from Neutral at MoffettNathanson. Shares of Slack (WORK 21.18, -1.93, -8.4%) sold off on news that Microsoft's (MSFT 150.39, +0.05, unch) competitive product, Teams, increased daily active users by nearly 50% since July.The U.S. Treasury market was relatively quiet, but demand for longer-dated bonds contributed to some curve-flattening activity. The 2-yr yield was unchanged at 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.79%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 97.85.Tuesday's economic calendar was limited to Housing Starts and Building Permits for October:Total housing starts increased 3.8% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.314 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.300 million) while total building permits increased 5.0% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.461 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.365 million).There was a sizable jump in starts (+8.6%) and permits (+8.2%) for multi-unit dwellings, yet the key takeaway from the report is that starts (+2.0%) and permits (+3.2%) increased for single-family units in an inventory-constrained environment for single-family homes.Looking ahead, the FOMC Minutes from the October 30-31 meeting and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index will be released on Wednesday.Nasdaq Composite +29.2% YTDS&P 500 +24.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +19.8% YTDRussell 2000 +18.5% YTD16:24MGP MGM Growth Properties commences public offering of 24.0 mln Class A shares (32.49 -0.37)The company expects that it will issue and sell 12,000,000 shares directly to the underwriters at closing and that the underwriters will purchase, at the request of the company, 12,000,000 shares from forward purchasers under forward sale agreements.The company plans to use proceeds primarily to repay a portion of the borrowings outstanding under its senior secured term loan A facility and senior secured term loan B facility, which the company believes will well-position it to be able to agree to and consummate a potential JV transaction under discussion with MGM Resorts International and honor any potential redemption of units representing limited partnership units in MGM Growth Properties Operating Partnership LP held by MGM for cash, should MGM elect to exercise any redemption right, if the company decides to pursue such a transaction, or, alternatively, for general corporate purposes.16:24PAGS PagSeguro Digital misses by BRL0.02, misses on revs (36.76 -1.01)Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of BRL 1.18 per share, excluding non-recurring items, BRL 0.02 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of BRL 1.20; revenues rose 30.3% year/year to BRL 1.46 bln vs the BRL 1.5 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Active merchants of 5.0 million, growth of 1.2 million active merchants in the last twelve months; R$29.4 billion in total payment volume, up 45.0% compared with 3Q18;16:20FLNT Fluent authorizes the repurchase of up to $5 mln shares of common stock (1.42 +0.11)16:18MTB M&T Bank increases quarterly cash dividend to $1.10/share from $1.00/share (162.88 -0.09)16:17FIX Comfort Systems increases stock repurchase program (50.40 -0.11)Board of Directors has approved an amendment to the stock repurchase program to increase the shares authorized and remaining as available to purchase back up to 1,000,000 shares by authorizing the Company to acquire up to 764,760 additional shares of its outstanding common stock.16:17AVID Avid Tech at Investor Day guided FY20 adj.

Macy's has guided its fiscal 2020 EPS down 29% at the midpoint to $2.85-3.05, including $0.25 in asset sale gains, with revenue flat yr/yr, comp sales flat to up 1%, and gross margins down slightly. Macy's expects comp sales to improve meaningfully in the fourth quarter, citing a difficult compare in the month of October.The market remains skeptical that the nation's largest department store can generate long-term profit growth given secular challenges.The company's comparable store sales growth has been muted despite the relative strength of consumer spending, which has been supporting the domestic economy.Department stores continue to struggle with lower mall traffic. Last week, the Census Bureau reported core retail sales up 4.2% yr/yr for the three months ending in October, but Department store sales fell 6.1%.With a $4.7 bln market cap, Macy's trades ~6x EPS and ~6x EV/EBITDA, including $3.9 bln in net debt. That represents a slight discount to department store peers. Fortunately, Macy's does have a strong balance sheet, so it can afford to pay its dividend, which yields a robust 9% payout annually.15:15BONDX Treasury Market SummaryLonger Tenors Pad Recent GainsU.S. Treasuries recorded another round of gains on Tuesday, pressuring yields on the 10-yr note and the 30-yr bond into the neighborhood of their respective 50-day moving averages. The Tuesday session bore some resemblance to Monday's affair, as Treasuries started the day with modest losses, recovering them in short order. The early weakness took place after an upbeat start to the European session, which saw the release of strong vehicle registration figures for October. The 10-yr note and the 30-yr bond made it back to their flat lines just minutes after the cash start while shorter tenors also rebounded but took a bit longer before reaching positive territory. Treasuries overtook their morning highs in the early afternoon, remaining near their best levels of the day until the close. The U.S. Dollar Index rose 0.1% to 97.86, snapping a four-day skid. Yield Check: 2-yr: UNCH at 1.59% 3-yr: UNCH at 1.59% 5-yr: UNCH at 1.62% 10-yr: -2 bps to 1.79% 30-yr: -4 bps to 2.26%News: The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow forecast for Q4 GDP was increased to 0.4% from 0.3% following today's housing data.

There was a sizable jump in starts (+8.6%) and permits (+8.2%) for multi-unit dwellings, yet the key takeaway from the report is that starts (+2.0%) and permits (+3.2%) increased for single-family units in an inventory-constrained environment for single-family homes.

LOW has reported EPS upside in four of the past five quarters.The CapitalIQ consensus estimate for Q3 EPS is $1.35. The revenue consensus estimate is $17.69 bln. Note: LOW typically guides for revenue, EPS and comps in the press release for the full year. Its current full year guidance is for adjusted EPS of $5.45-5.65 while sales are expected to increase +2%. It'll be important to see if the company reaffirms or changes this guidance. Same store comps are always a key metric for Lowe's. In Q2 (Jul), comps came in at +2.3% and +3.2% for the US home improvement business. Home Depot (HD) is always a key barometer as to what to expect from Lowe's. HD was not super impressive as comps underwhelmed and HD lowered full year guidance. It's not all doom and gloom for Lowe's because HD cited some internal initiatives that are taking longer to materialize, so much of it may be company-specific and not industry-wide problems. Specifically, HD was emphatic on the call that it "sees a strong and engaged customer" and that "housing is healthy and stable." Another area to watch is tariffs. HD said that tariffs are having an impact but are manageable as its merchants have done a good job at mitigating the impact. Aside from the Home Depot angle, another aspect to this earnings report will be progress on Lowe's turnaround. Despite having a similar number of stores, Lowe's is dwarfed by Home Depot (HD) in terms of annual revenue ($72 bln vs $111 bln for HD) and HD holds a sizeable profitability gap. Lowe's wants to improve merchandising availability, to improve its digital presence/app, to increase the use of self-check-out lanes and cut worker hours to boost productivity. It'll be interesting to get an update on its progress. Overall, our sense is that the weak comps/guidance from Home Depot has lowered expectations for Lowe's this quarter. However, with Lowe's, we think investors are more focused on the bigger picture, namely how is the turnaround going.13:42TPX Tempur Sealy Int'l: US ITC determines mattresses from China injure US industry; Department of Commerce will issue antidumping duty order on imports of this product from China (85.44 -1.05)The United States International Trade Commission (USITC) today determined that a U.S. industry is materially injured by reason of imports of mattresses from China that the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) has determined are sold in the United States at less than fair value. As a result of the USITC's affirmative determination, Commerce will issue an antidumping duty order on imports of this product from China. ITC Release13:15ABMD Abiomed says Abiomed medical office is issuing publication review of observational analysis of Impella that was presented by Amin et al. at the American Heart Association Conference on November 17 (186.19 +8.10)According to the company, the AHA analysis is flawed because:The data source has significant limitations, containing just a fraction of Impella patients and unable to delineate between common adverse events.The Impella patients were much sicker and had greater baseline and procedural risks.The analysis excluded the costliest IABP patients who were escalated to other therapies.Additionally, the conclusion is aggressive because administrative coding data cannot delineate between adverse events common to high-risk patients and device related events.13:08SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: ACB (37.93 mln +2.94%), TEVA (22.61 mln +0.97%), BMY (19.42 mln -1.7%), CELG (13.89 mln -0.93%), CLVS (13.81 mln +6.23%)Industrials: GE (17.95 mln -0.6%)Consumer Discretionary: M (32.83 mln -10.04%), ROKU (21.57 mln -1.82%), KSS (19.77 mln -18.61%), NIO (18.01 mln +3.06%), F (17.54 mln -0.28%)Information Technology: AMD (54.78 mln +2.61%), NOK (20.12 mln -0.72%)Financials: BAC (17.88 mln -0.27%)Energy: CHK (55.18 mln -8.31%), ET (13.13 mln -1.99%), ECA (12.04 mln -4.56%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: MDCO (6.75x +19.55%), CRSP (5.7x +16.03%), EDIT (3.67x +11.4%), ATNX (3.12x +34.53%), CELG (2.97x -0.93%), NTLA (2.83x +12.13%)Materials: ASH (3.23x -4.14%)Industrials: WWD (3.27x -0.37%)Consumer Discretionary: KSS (6.3x -18.61%), HD (3.61x -5.23%)Information Technology: JKS (4.05x +12.71%)Financials: EFC (18.2x -3.03%), GBDC (3.31x +1.91%)Consumer Staples: CHEF (3.43x -8.38%)Utilities: DUK (3.42x -1.97%), ELP (3.22x +2.42%)13:06SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: ATNX (15.39 +34.53%), MDCO (70.12 +19.55%), BCRX (2 +17.35%), CRSP (67.92 +16.03%), NTLA (15.25 +12.13%), DRNA (23.87 +11.59%), EDIT (25.79 +11.4%), ARQL (8.4 +10.67%), APHA (4.21 +10.08%), TCDA (37.66 +9.92%), BOLD (28.08 +9.9%), WVE (31.02 +8.58%), TBIO (10.45 +8.52%), ASND (115.61 +8.07%), GLYC (6.18 +8.04%), AMRX (3.05 +7.6%), PRQR (6.71 +7.36%), PRTA (10.99 +7.28%)Information Technology: JKS (16.76 +12.71%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: VAPO (10.77 -7.08%)Industrials: BLDP (6.52 -10.19%)Consumer Discretionary: KSS (47.53 -18.61%), M (15.19 -10.04%), SIG (15.7 -8.61%)Financials: PPDF (2.5 -12.89%), JT (1.86 -10.39%), YRD (5.51 -9.97%)Energy: KLXE (5.44 -26.19%), UNT (0.72 -11.3%), CRC (7.58 -10.67%), ESV (3.82 -8.95%), SPN (0.33 -8.45%), CHK (0.59 -8.31%), EXTN (6.31 -7.82%), TUSK (1.38 -7.38%), PVAC (24.25 -7.35%)Consumer Staples: CHEF (32.57 -8.38%), DF (0.07 -7.5%)12:57WRAPX Midday Market Summary: Stock market trades mixed; Home Depot, Kohl's weigh on retail spaceThe S&P 500 is currently down 0.1% in midday action, with weakness concentrated in the retail space following disappointing quarterly results and guidance from Home Depot (HD 226.39, -12.46, -5.2%) and Kohl's (KSS 47.58, -10.82, -18.5%).The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.4%, but the Nasdaq Composite (+0.2%) and Russell 2000 (+0.4%) trade higher.The underperformance of the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 44.12, -0.71, -1.6%) best displays the negative sentiment that has subsumed the retail industry today. Both the Dow and S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (-0.8%), meanwhile, can attribute their underperformance to Home Depot.The S&P 500 energy sector (-1.1%) is down even more amid a sharp decline in oil prices ($55.69, -1.45, -2.5%), but the market isn't getting concerned about the U.S. consumer based on a couple of reports. Instead, the market is hanging in there amid gains in the heavily-weighted health care (+0.3%), information technology (+0.1%), and financials (+0.1%) sectors.The consensus among many investors is that the market is due for a pullback, but the absence of one has created a sort of pain trade for investors fearful of missing out on further gains. The S&P 500 was down just 0.3% at its low earlier today before a buy-the-dip effort briefly brought it back above its flat line.Separately, shares of AT&T (T 37.65, -1.99) are down 5.0% after the stock was downgraded to Sell from Neutral at MoffettNathanson with a price target of $30. Shares of Slack (WORK 20.88, -2.24, -9.7%) are down 10% on news that Microsoft's (MSFT 150.99, +0.65, +0.4%) competitive product, Teams, has increased daily active users by nearly 50% since July.In the Treasury market, demand for longer-dated bonds has caused some minor curve-flattening activity. The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.79%. The U.S. Dollar Index is flat at 97.79.Today's economic calendar was limited to Housing Starts and Building Permits for October:Total housing starts increased 3.8% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.314 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.300 million) while total building permits increased 5.0% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.461 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.365 million).There was a sizable jump in starts (+8.6%) and permits (+8.2%) for multi-unit dwellings, yet the key takeaway from the report is that starts (+2.0%) and permits (+3.2%) increased for single-family units in an inventory-constrained environment for single-family homes.12:45MRK Merck increases quarterly dividend to $0.61 from $0.55/share (84.21 +0.08)12:25SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Myovant Sciences (MYOV) gains on Phase 3 relugolix data -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersMYOV (10.86 +79.21%): Announced results from the Phase 3 HERO study of once-daily, oral relugolix in men with advanced prostate cancer; the trial met its primary efficacy endpoint and all six key secondary endpoints -- in the primary endpoint responder analysis, 96.7% of men receiving the relugolix regimen achieved sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels through 48 weeks. These results, noted co, support NDA submission to the FDA in Q2 of 2020 and future regulatory submissions in Europe and Japan. Jumps to six-month highs. ATNX (15.12 +32.12%): Moves to its highest levels since August after previewing its presentation at the 2019 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium; co's abstract for the Phase 3 study of oral paclitaxel and encequidar in metastatic breast cancer has been selected for the conference's press program. DRNA (23.72 +10.89%): Price target raised to $30 from $22 at H.C. Wainwright, citing a positive view of co's new strategic alliance with Novo Nordisk (NVO), which was announced yesterday; the firm views the deal as underscoring a "Burgeoning RNAi Powerhouse." Continued strength sees the stock touch up to new four-year highs.Small Cap LosersI (6.19 -22.91%): Continued weakness following FCC Chairman Ajit Pai's announcement midday yesterday of support for a public auction of 280 megahertz of the C-band spectrum; the C-Band Alliance, a satellite operator group of which co is a member, issued a statement yesterday following the Chairman's communication, noting, among other comments, that the announcement "does not address the critical involvement of the incumbent satellite operators in executing the complex task of reconfiguring and transitioning their networks." Following yesterday's developments, the stock was downgraded to In-Line from Outperform at Evercore ISI, which also cut co's price target to $11 from $38; JPMorgan lowered co's target to $9 from $22. Wells Fargo noted that embrace of a public auction "does not seem to offer much potential capital to the satellite players" and also noted the impact that the public approach will have on timing, saying, "Getting this spectrum auctioned off in 1H 2020 (as the C-Band Alliance plan had outlined) seems naively optimistic at this point." The stock again records new 52-week lows, now down circa 76% month-to-date. PPDF (2.53 -11.85%): Missed estimates for Q3 EPS and revs (+35.0% yr/yr to RMB1.51 bln). Cumulative registered users increased to approx. 102.8 mln while cumulative number of borrowers reached 17.4 mln as of September 30; number of unique borrowers increased +28.6% yr/yr. Co expects total loan origination volume between RMB16-19 bln for Q4. Co also noted that it plans to discontinue its online information intermediary business between individual borrowers and individual investors. At all-time lows. PLUG (3.33 -11.12%): Pulls back from yesterday's four-year highs with above average volume; factoring in today's move, the stock continues to trade higher by circa +26% month-to-date.11:59SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (95) outpacing new lows (63) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: AAPL, AES, AGEN, AIZ, ALL, AMD, AME, AMED, ANSS, AON, APD, ARDX, ARMK, ARVN, ARWR, ATEC, ATRS, AVGO, AZO, BIO, BIP, BLDR, BLK, BLMN, BRO, CACI, CATM, CDE, CDW, CLH, CPRT, CRSP, CSGS, CSL, CVNA, CZR, DEA, DEI, DKS, DOX, DRNA, DXCM, EIDX, EPAM, ESE, EVRI, EW, FISV, FNF, FTNT, GLIBA, GPN, HALO, HIG, INFO, INOV, INST, KMX, KRG, KRTX, LDOS, LIN, LPT, LULU, LXP, LZB, MCO, MDCO, MGM, MMC, MSCI, MSFT, NSIT, OC, PFSI, PLMR, PRFT, RDN, RLI, SEM, SHOO, SPGI, TDY, TJX, TMO, TROW, TRU, UI, USB, VAC, VRTX, XBIT, XPEL, XRX, ZYMEStocks that traded to 52 week lows: AM, AR, ASIX, BCEI, BIG, BTU, BXC, CDEV, CEIX, CHK, CNP, CPS, CRZO, CTRA, CVEO, DCP, ENBL, ENLC, EQM, ETRN, EXPE, EXTN, EZPW, FLNT, FOSL, FPRX, FTSI, GLOG, GLOP, GSM, GTE, GTLS, I, IIVI, KLXE, LBRT, MDR, MPLX, NEWM, NVEE, OAS, PAA, PAGP, PBT, PNNT, PRMW, QUAD, RBBN, RVLV, SDRL, SINA, SMLP, SNH, TCO, TCS, TDW, TH, TRIP, UPWK, VG, VNOM, WES, WLLThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: CABO, FWONA, IHC, LACQ, NWPX, PLOW, WDFCETFs that traded to 52 week highs: CUT, DIA, EWC, EWG, EWQ, EZU, FAN, GREK, IAI, IOO, ITA, IWF, IYF, IYG, IYH, IYJ, KCE, OEF, QQQ, SPY, UYG, VGK, VTI, XLKETFs that traded to 52 week lows: AMJ, VXX, XES11:53TALKX Market Briefing: Price action getting technicalThere hasn't been a lot of conviction in the morning session, evidenced by an S&P 500 that is basically unchanged through the first two hours of trading.Retail stocks have been a notable pocket of weakness following the disappointments from Home Depot (HD 226.88, -11.98, -5.0%) and Kohl's (KSS 48.21, -10.19, -17.5%). Their weakness has acted as a weight on the broader market, yet the movement of the S&P 500 index has been largely a function of technical price action.Briefing.com's Technical Take page identified 3127 as a secondary resistance level for the S&P 500. That level was tested with the opening move (3127.64) but quickly failed as steady selling eventually dropped the S&P 500 back to 3113.46 at this morning's low, which was reached just before 11:00 a.m. ET. That level fell within a secondary support level (3115/3112) that was also identified on the Technical Take Page.Traders, therefore, appear to be respecting these technical boundaries for now on a day that is devoid of any major macro news drivers, particularly as they relate to trade, and as it is suggested that the market is short-term overextended and due for a pullback.The Russell 2000 is up 0.4%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.3%; the S&P 500 is unchanged; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.4%.11:51QCOM Qualcomm issues 3 year targets at Analyst Day (88.73 -1.78)From CFO's presentation at Analyst Day:3 year targets as earnings mix shift to QCT from QTLRevenue: QCT segment SAM: 10% CAGR, grow faster than SAM and Apple product revenues QTL: current run rate + Huawei resolution Operating margin: QCT grows to >20%; QTL: ~70%Summarizing Qualcomm opportunities: Mature handset industry and current macroeconomic environment; Accelerated 5G migration compared to 4G; Mobile handset platform: 4G->5G transition, RF Front-End growth; Growth beyond mobile: Auto, IoT, Compute, ADAS, Cloud/Edge AI 75+ 5G licenses including key anchor agreements.Grow earnings faster than revenues.

The ACHIEVE II trial evaluated ubrogepant 50 mg and 25 mg, compared with placebo, across a wide range of clinical endpoints, including the co-primary endpoints of pain freedom (no pain) and freedom from the most bothersome migraine-associated symptom at two hours post-initial dose. For the two co-primary endpoints, ubrogepant 50 mg and 25 mg showed statistically significant higher response rates for pain freedom at two hours (21.8% for 50 mg, 20.7% for 25 mg and 14.3% for placebo), and the 50 mg dose demonstrated statistically significant higher response rates for the freedom from the most bothersome migraine-associated symptom at two hours (38.9% for 50 mg and 27.4% for placebo). Additionally, ubrogepant 50 mg was statistically superior to placebo in the absence of light sensitivity (43.8% for 50 mg and 35.5% for placebo) and sound sensitivity (54.1% for 50 mg and 46.3% for placebo).FDA action on the NDA for ubrogepant is expected in December 2019, potentially making it the first oral CGRP to address unmet patient needs in acute treatment of migraine and the first FDA-approved gepant.11:21XLE Sector Briefing: Energy (58.71 -0.65)The energy sector (-1.1%) sits at the bottom of today's sector standings after showing relative weakness yesterday. The growth-sensitive sector is now down 2.4% since Friday versus a much more modest 0.1% week-to-date downtick in the S&P 500. Factors contributing to the underperformance:Notable pressure on crude oil. The energy component is down more than $1.00 today (-2.3%) and down $2.01 (-3.5%) since Friday's settlement. This has sent the price of oil beneath its 200-day moving average (57.37) with the 50-day average (55.65) looming just below. Tax-loss related selling. The energy sector has been the weakest performer of 2019, meaning the group contains a fair share of names that have underperformed since the end of 2018. These names are more likely to be sold before the end of 2019 as investors look to reduce some of the tax impact of taking capital gains this year.Notable movers:HollyFrontier (HFC 51.56, -2.35, -4.4%): falling to its lowest level since early October. The company announced a new project and a new buyback authorization yesterday morning.

That corner is the retail industry, which has been broadsided today by disappointing earnings/sales results and guidance from Home Depot (HD 226.60, -12.25, -5.1%) and Kohl's (KSS 48.09, -10.31, -17.7%).The weakness in HD is having an outsized impact on the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (-0.9%); meanwhile, the combined impact of the disappointments from these well-known retailers is creating some angst about consumer spending activity entering the all-important holiday selling season.That angst is showing up in a sympathy trade that has knocked down the prices of many other retail stocks today, like Macy's (M 15.36, -1.51, -9.0%), Best Buy (BBY 75.61, -1.68, -2.2%), and Gap (GPS 16.62, -0.68, -3.9%) to name a few. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.97, -0.85, -1.9%) reflects the broader trend of underperformance for the retailers in today's market action.Those issues notwithstanding, the broader market is still holding up just fine as it is drawing influential support from the information technology (+0.3%), healthcare (+0.3%), and financial (+0.2%) sectors, which continue to attract interest from value and growth-minded investors alike.Separately, the market's overall resilience to selling pressure remains a tying factor for a number of participants who are fearful of missing out on further gains. That fear, ostensibly, is lending some buying support that has kept downside pressure in check.The Russell 2000 is up 0.2%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.1%; the S&P 500 is down 0.1%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%.10:00XLY Sector Briefing: Consumer Discretionary (120.74 -1.05)The consumer discretionary sector (-0.8%) represents an early pocket of relative weakness in a flat market. This makes for a continuation of this month's underperformance, which has the sector trading down 0.3% since the end of October versus a 2.8% gain in the S&P 500. Factors contributing to today's underperformance:Home Depot's (HD 227.72, -11.13, -4.7%) Q3 earnings report, which showed lower than expected revenue and lowered comparable sales guidance for FY20. Granted, Home Depot met Q3 EPS expectations, but the revenue shortfall and lowered comparable sales guidance have pressured the stock from a record high. Furthermore, the outlook is leading to some questions about the overall strength of consumer spending. Disappointing Q3 results and lowered FY20 guidance from Kohl's (KSS 48.86, -9.54, -16.4%), fueling worries that other apparel retailers could also report underwhelming results.Notable movers:Home Depot (HD 227.72, -11.13, -4.7%): falling back below its 50-day moving average (232.37) after setting a fresh record high on Monday. Kohl's (KSS 48.86, -9.54, -16.4%): falling to its lowest level in more than a month in response to weaker than expected quarterly results. Macy's (M 15.35, -1.53, -9.0%): sliding back below its 50-day moving average (15.76) after weak results from Kohl's. Nordstrom (JWN 35.10, -2.78, -7.3%): falling below its 200-day moving average (36.33) and toward its 50-day moving average (34.94) in sympathy with Kohl's.

For the study to be successful, the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of the response rate had to be at least 90%.The study achieved all six key secondary endpoints, including superiority to leuprolide acetate on rapid suppression of testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA), all with p-values <0.0001.Five key secondary endpoints demonstrated superiority to leuprolide acetate, including rapid suppression of testosterone at Day 4 and Day 15, profound suppression of testosterone at Day 15, rapid suppression of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at Day 15, and suppression of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) at Week 24 (all p-values <0.0001). In addition, relugolix demonstrated non-inferiority to leuprolide acetate on sustained testosterone suppression through 48 weeks (96.7% vs. 88.8%, respectively) with a between-group difference of 7.9% (95% CI: 4.1%,11.8%), the primary endpoint required for regulatory submissions outside of the U.S. In addition, the pharmacodynamic results showed no testosterone flare after initiation of relugolix and mean testosterone levels returned to normal levels within 90 days after treatment discontinuation.A New Drug Application (NDA) submission is expected in the second quarter of 2020.A conference call and webcast are to be held today at 8:30 a.m. EST / 5:30 a.m. PST.07:32SRRK Scholar Rock announces preliminary pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic results from the TOPAZ Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial of SRK-015 for the treatment of patients with spinal muscular atrophy (7.20 )The planned preliminary PK/PD analysis, which includes data from 29 patients with SMA across all three cohorts, showed dose-proportional drug exposure and demonstrated target engagement, as evidenced by dose-dependent increases of up to 100-fold in the serum levels of latent myostatin following SRK-015 treatment (2 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg doses).

Khoury, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of KLX Energy Services commented, "Contemporaneously with the abrupt decline in activity, we took steps to align our business with current customer demand. Specifically, we implemented an approximate 17 percent reduction in force, as compared with the Company's July 31, 2019 staffing levels, consistent with the approximate 18 percent sequential quarterly decline in our third quarter revenues. We aggressively cut costs in every area of our business, and we warm stacked the vast majority of our Permian based wireline assets. As a result of these and other measures, we expect to take a third quarter charge of approximately $13 million. Notwithstanding the precipitous decline in industry conditions, we generated approximately $44 million in cash flow from operations and approximately $31 million in free cash flow, bringing our cash balance to approximately $121 million for the quarter ended October 31, 2019. In addition, our $100 million credit facility remains undrawn.""The abrupt deterioration in industry conditions, which accelerated through the end of our third quarter, was driven by a sharp sequential quarterly decline in U.S. land rig count and an unprecedented decline in active frac spreads from the second quarter to the third quarter. In fact, there was a significant sequential decline in hydraulic fracturing activity during each month of the third quarter. The decline in Exploration & Production activity resulted in lower demand levels and lower current and expected revenues for our business, which led the Company to accelerate its annual testing for asset impairment into the third quarter. While the Company has not yet completed this analysis, we expect to report a non-cash asset impairment charge in the range of approximately $45 million to $60 million. The Company is in the process of finalizing the actual amount of the impairment charge, which will be completed prior to reporting its third quarter financial results."06:00CEO CNOOC Ltd names President Xu Keqiang as CEO (152.50 )06:00TRP TC Energy to provide financial update and review strategic plans at Investor Day, reaffirms expectation to grow common share dividend at an annual rate of 8-10% through 2021 (51.44 )"Our $100 billion portfolio of high-quality, long-life energy infrastructure assets are expected to generate record financial results again in 2019 underpinned by strong market fundamentals," said Russ Girling, TC Energy's president and chief executive officer. "Looking forward, we continue to advance $30 billion of commercially secured projects that will expand and extend our asset footprint across North America."As those projects enter service, TC Energy expects comparable earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to exceed $10 billion in 2022. This represents an increase of more than 16 per cent when compared to comparable EBITDA of $8.6 billion in 2018 despite significant asset sales that have accelerated the strengthening of the company's balance sheet. Notably, approximately 95 per cent of comparable EBITDA is expected to come from regulated assets or long-term contracts. At the same time, the company continues to methodically advance more than $20 billion of projects under development including Keystone XL and the Bruce Power life extension program. Success in advancing these and other organic growth opportunities that are expected to emanate from TC Energy's five operating businesses across North America would add to the company's growth outlook."Based on the confidence we have in our business plans, we are reaffirming that we expect to grow our common share dividend at an annual rate of eight to 10 per cent through 2021," added Girling. "Our dividend outlook is supported by expected growth in earnings and cash flow and in line with our historically strong dividend coverage ratios."06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- World markets continue climb higher; US Futures in record territoryThe global equity markets are mostly higher once again with US Futures venturing into all-time high territory for a second straight night.

These utility operations have customers in eight states and expect customer growth to continue at a rate of 1-2% annually. The anticipated investment reflects opportunities to improve the safety and reliability of the company's systems. Also included in the utility's five-year program is the construction of an 88-megawatt simple-cycle, natural gas-fired combustion turbine near Mandan, North Dakota.The capital investment plan at the pipeline and midstream business reflects a focus on organic growth. This includes the Demicks Lake Expansion project under construction in North Dakota, which is expected to be in service in the first quarter of 2020 and as designed will increase capacity by 175 mln cubic feet per day. The North Bakken Expansion project is also included in the capital forecast. As designed, this project in the heart of the Bakken will increase capacity by an estimated 350 mln cubic feet per day and is expected to be in service in late 2021. This business is exploring additional organic growth projects that, if executed, would be incremental to the capital investment plan. Natural gas production continues at record levels in the Bakken, driving the need for additional infrastructure.At the company's construction materials and services businesses, the capital expenditures forecast is focused primarily on organic expansion opportunities, normal equipment and plant replacements and upgrades. Included in the outlined forecast is the development of Knife River's Honey Creek Quarry in Texas, which includes the construction of a rock-crushing plant and the purchase of aggregate railcars. The company expects public sector workload growth as new state and local infrastructure spending initiatives are introduced.16:44ZG Zillow announced that Greg Schwartz, president of media and marketplaces, is stepping down to take a professional break (39.74 +0.23)The businesses that currently report to Schwartz in the Mortgages and Internet, Media and Technology (IMT) segments are being transitioned to other senior executives.

The Russell 2000 (-0.3%) closed in negative territory.The day began with the market digesting a tweet from a China-based CNBC reporter, who said she was informed by a Chinese government source that Beijing is pessimistic about a trade deal because President Trump hasn't supported a tariff rollback. Based on the modest losses and ensuing price action, the market presumably remained optimistic about a Phase One agreement.The large-cap indices eased their way into positive territory thanks to the turnarounds in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (+0.3%), information technology (+0.3%), and communication services (+0.3%) sectors. Consistent leaders included the consumer staples (+0.5%) and real estate (+0.5%) sectors, as the negative-sounding trade headline likely fostered some conservative-minded interest.The trade-sensitive industrials (-0.3%) and materials (-0.2%) sectors were among today's laggards, but their losses were small compared to the 1.3% drop in the energy sector, which was pressured by the decline in oil prices ($57.04, -0.71, -1.2%).Generally, there wasn't any concerted effort to sell a market trading at all-time highs, but investors weren't eager to embrace risk, either. The trend has been positive, which has likely drawn in some reluctant investors into the market, and today simply may have been a natural breather for a market breaking out to new highs.Notable corporate news included HP Inc. (HPQ 20.01, -0.17, -0.8%) turning down the takeover bid from Xerox (XRX 39.30, +0.36, +0.9%). HP remained open to a deal, though. Netflix (NFLX 302.57, +7.54, +2.6%) shares outperformed on speculation that either Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman built a large stake in the company.U.S. Treasuries extended last week's advance, pushing yields slightly lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points to 1.81%.

SPE now owns 100% of the multimedia entertainment company.

Prior to the transaction, SPE owned a 58% stake in Game Show Network, and AT&T owned the remaining 42%. In connection with the transaction, AT&T received approx. $500 mln, including proceeds for its equity stake valued at $380 mln (before transaction-related adjustments) and dividends of approx. $130 mln.

We have had a long relationship with Letko and most certainly appreciate their investment in our Company. Our establishment of domicile in the U.S. was carefully considered.... rationale for the move is crystal clear-we want to expose our Company and all its stockholders to increasingly larger pools of investment in U.S. index funds and passively managed accounts. The change in corporate domicile will not change how we run our day-to-day business, nor diminish the important role our Canadian assets play in our portfolio today. We do not believe that our Canadian investors will be forced to sell beyond the Canadian indices, and we will remain listed on both the TSX and the NYSE. Furthermore, we know that most of our large investors in Canada also own many of our U.S.-domiciled peers today. We deeply believe this move ultimately will be positive for ALL shareholders as exposure to the significantly larger U.S. market and funds is estimated to create more than $1 billion of additional demand for our shares."The change in corporate domicile, the rebrand to Ovintiv, and a previously announced 1 -- for -- 5 consolidation and share exchange require two-thirds of votes cast for shareholder approval.

The retail industry was under pressure following disappointing quarterly results and guidance from Home Depot (HD 225.86, -12.99, -5.4%) and Kohl's (KSS 47.02, -11.38, -19.5%).The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.4%) also finished lower, while the Nasdaq Composite (+0.2%) and Russell 2000 (+0.4%) finished higher. The Nasdaq closed at another record high.The session began with each of the large-cap indices setting intraday highs despite the negative sentiment in the retail space. The early advance quickly faltered but overall losses were modest, and transient, as the S&P 500 only dipped 0.3% below its flat line before buyers quickly stepped in to buy the dip.The retail space didn't benefit from an opportunistic mindset, though, as the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.95, -0.87, -1.9%) finished near its lows like the S&P 500 energy (-1.5%) and consumer discretionary (-1.0%) sectors. Home Depot dragged on the consumer discretionary sector while a 3% drop in WTI crude ($55.21, -1.84, -3.2%) weighed on the energy space.Gains were mainly found in the heavily-weighted S&P 500 health care (+0.7%), information technology (+0.2%), and financials (+0.2%) sectors. The real estate sector (+0.2%) also finished in positive territory.TJX Companies (TJX 60.64, +1.09, +1.8%) was a bright spot among the retailers after it beat top and bottom-line estimates and raised its full-year guidance. TJX likely tempered some concerns about U.S. consumer spending for the holiday shopping season that may have been engendered by Home Depot and Kohl's.Separately, shares of AT&T (T 38.00, -1.63, -4.1%) pulled back 4% after the stock was downgraded to Sell from Neutral at MoffettNathanson. Shares of Slack (WORK 21.18, -1.93, -8.4%) sold off on news that Microsoft's (MSFT 150.39, +0.05, unch) competitive product, Teams, increased daily active users by nearly 50% since July.The U.S. Treasury market was relatively quiet, but demand for longer-dated bonds contributed to some curve-flattening activity. The 2-yr yield was unchanged at 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.79%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 97.85.Tuesday's economic calendar was limited to Housing Starts and Building Permits for October:Total housing starts increased 3.8% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.314 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.300 million) while total building permits increased 5.0% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.461 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.365 million).There was a sizable jump in starts (+8.6%) and permits (+8.2%) for multi-unit dwellings, yet the key takeaway from the report is that starts (+2.0%) and permits (+3.2%) increased for single-family units in an inventory-constrained environment for single-family homes.Looking ahead, the FOMC Minutes from the October 30-31 meeting and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index will be released on Wednesday.Nasdaq Composite +29.2% YTDS&P 500 +24.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +19.8% YTDRussell 2000 +18.5% YTD16:24MGP MGM Growth Properties commences public offering of 24.0 mln Class A shares (32.49 -0.37)The company expects that it will issue and sell 12,000,000 shares directly to the underwriters at closing and that the underwriters will purchase, at the request of the company, 12,000,000 shares from forward purchasers under forward sale agreements.The company plans to use proceeds primarily to repay a portion of the borrowings outstanding under its senior secured term loan A facility and senior secured term loan B facility, which the company believes will well-position it to be able to agree to and consummate a potential JV transaction under discussion with MGM Resorts International and honor any potential redemption of units representing limited partnership units in MGM Growth Properties Operating Partnership LP held by MGM for cash, should MGM elect to exercise any redemption right, if the company decides to pursue such a transaction, or, alternatively, for general corporate purposes.16:24PAGS PagSeguro Digital misses by BRL0.02, misses on revs (36.76 -1.01)Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of BRL 1.18 per share, excluding non-recurring items, BRL 0.02 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of BRL 1.20; revenues rose 30.3% year/year to BRL 1.46 bln vs the BRL 1.5 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Active merchants of 5.0 million, growth of 1.2 million active merchants in the last twelve months; R$29.4 billion in total payment volume, up 45.0% compared with 3Q18;16:20FLNT Fluent authorizes the repurchase of up to $5 mln shares of common stock (1.42 +0.11)16:18MTB M&T Bank increases quarterly cash dividend to $1.10/share from $1.00/share (162.88 -0.09)16:17FIX Comfort Systems increases stock repurchase program (50.40 -0.11)Board of Directors has approved an amendment to the stock repurchase program to increase the shares authorized and remaining as available to purchase back up to 1,000,000 shares by authorizing the Company to acquire up to 764,760 additional shares of its outstanding common stock.16:17AVID Avid Tech at Investor Day guided FY20 adj.

Macy's has guided its fiscal 2020 EPS down 29% at the midpoint to $2.85-3.05, including $0.25 in asset sale gains, with revenue flat yr/yr, comp sales flat to up 1%, and gross margins down slightly. Macy's expects comp sales to improve meaningfully in the fourth quarter, citing a difficult compare in the month of October.The market remains skeptical that the nation's largest department store can generate long-term profit growth given secular challenges.The company's comparable store sales growth has been muted despite the relative strength of consumer spending, which has been supporting the domestic economy.Department stores continue to struggle with lower mall traffic. Last week, the Census Bureau reported core retail sales up 4.2% yr/yr for the three months ending in October, but Department store sales fell 6.1%.With a $4.7 bln market cap, Macy's trades ~6x EPS and ~6x EV/EBITDA, including $3.9 bln in net debt. That represents a slight discount to department store peers. Fortunately, Macy's does have a strong balance sheet, so it can afford to pay its dividend, which yields a robust 9% payout annually.15:15BONDX Treasury Market SummaryLonger Tenors Pad Recent GainsU.S. Treasuries recorded another round of gains on Tuesday, pressuring yields on the 10-yr note and the 30-yr bond into the neighborhood of their respective 50-day moving averages. The Tuesday session bore some resemblance to Monday's affair, as Treasuries started the day with modest losses, recovering them in short order. The early weakness took place after an upbeat start to the European session, which saw the release of strong vehicle registration figures for October. The 10-yr note and the 30-yr bond made it back to their flat lines just minutes after the cash start while shorter tenors also rebounded but took a bit longer before reaching positive territory. Treasuries overtook their morning highs in the early afternoon, remaining near their best levels of the day until the close. The U.S. Dollar Index rose 0.1% to 97.86, snapping a four-day skid. Yield Check: 2-yr: UNCH at 1.59% 3-yr: UNCH at 1.59% 5-yr: UNCH at 1.62% 10-yr: -2 bps to 1.79% 30-yr: -4 bps to 2.26%News: The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow forecast for Q4 GDP was increased to 0.4% from 0.3% following today's housing data.

Italy's September Industrial New Orders increased 1.0% m/m (expected -1.5%; last 0.8%), rising 0.3% yr/yr (expected -3.9%; last -10.4%). September Industrial Sales ticked up 0.2% m/m (expected -0.4%; last -0.3%) but fell 1.6% yr/yr (expected -1.0%; last -2.2%). New car registrations in the eurozone increased 8.7% yr/yr, representing the strongest growth rate in a decade. Car registrations through the first ten months of 2019 are down 0.7% yr/yr. Today's Data: Total housing starts increased 3.8% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.314 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.300 million) while total building permits increased 5.0% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.461 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.365 million). There was a sizable jump in starts (+8.6%) and permits (+8.2%) for multi-unit dwellings, yet the key takeaway from the report is that starts (+2.0%) and permits (+3.2%) increased for single-family units in an inventory-constrained environment for single-family homes.

LOW has reported EPS upside in four of the past five quarters.The CapitalIQ consensus estimate for Q3 EPS is $1.35. The revenue consensus estimate is $17.69 bln. Note: LOW typically guides for revenue, EPS and comps in the press release for the full year. Its current full year guidance is for adjusted EPS of $5.45-5.65 while sales are expected to increase +2%. It'll be important to see if the company reaffirms or changes this guidance. Same store comps are always a key metric for Lowe's. In Q2 (Jul), comps came in at +2.3% and +3.2% for the US home improvement business. Home Depot (HD) is always a key barometer as to what to expect from Lowe's. HD was not super impressive as comps underwhelmed and HD lowered full year guidance. It's not all doom and gloom for Lowe's because HD cited some internal initiatives that are taking longer to materialize, so much of it may be company-specific and not industry-wide problems. Specifically, HD was emphatic on the call that it "sees a strong and engaged customer" and that "housing is healthy and stable." Another area to watch is tariffs. HD said that tariffs are having an impact but are manageable as its merchants have done a good job at mitigating the impact. Aside from the Home Depot angle, another aspect to this earnings report will be progress on Lowe's turnaround. Despite having a similar number of stores, Lowe's is dwarfed by Home Depot (HD) in terms of annual revenue ($72 bln vs $111 bln for HD) and HD holds a sizeable profitability gap. Lowe's wants to improve merchandising availability, to improve its digital presence/app, to increase the use of self-check-out lanes and cut worker hours to boost productivity. It'll be interesting to get an update on its progress. Overall, our sense is that the weak comps/guidance from Home Depot has lowered expectations for Lowe's this quarter. However, with Lowe's, we think investors are more focused on the bigger picture, namely how is the turnaround going.13:42TPX Tempur Sealy Int'l: US ITC determines mattresses from China injure US industry; Department of Commerce will issue antidumping duty order on imports of this product from China (85.44 -1.05)The United States International Trade Commission (USITC) today determined that a U.S. industry is materially injured by reason of imports of mattresses from China that the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) has determined are sold in the United States at less than fair value.

ITC Release13:15ABMD Abiomed says Abiomed medical office is issuing publication review of observational analysis of Impella that was presented by Amin et al. at the American Heart Association Conference on November 17 (186.19 +8.10)According to the company, the AHA analysis is flawed because:The data source has significant limitations, containing just a fraction of Impella patients and unable to delineate between common adverse events.The Impella patients were much sicker and had greater baseline and procedural risks.The analysis excluded the costliest IABP patients who were escalated to other therapies.Additionally, the conclusion is aggressive because administrative coding data cannot delineate between adverse events common to high-risk patients and device related events.13:08SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: ACB (37.93 mln +2.94%), TEVA (22.61 mln +0.97%), BMY (19.42 mln -1.7%), CELG (13.89 mln -0.93%), CLVS (13.81 mln +6.23%)Industrials: GE (17.95 mln -0.6%)Consumer Discretionary: M (32.83 mln -10.04%), ROKU (21.57 mln -1.82%), KSS (19.77 mln -18.61%), NIO (18.01 mln +3.06%), F (17.54 mln -0.28%)Information Technology: AMD (54.78 mln +2.61%), NOK (20.12 mln -0.72%)Financials: BAC (17.88 mln -0.27%)Energy: CHK (55.18 mln -8.31%), ET (13.13 mln -1.99%), ECA (12.04 mln -4.56%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: MDCO (6.75x +19.55%), CRSP (5.7x +16.03%), EDIT (3.67x +11.4%), ATNX (3.12x +34.53%), CELG (2.97x -0.93%), NTLA (2.83x +12.13%)Materials: ASH (3.23x -4.14%)Industrials: WWD (3.27x -0.37%)Consumer Discretionary: KSS (6.3x -18.61%), HD (3.61x -5.23%)Information Technology: JKS (4.05x +12.71%)Financials: EFC (18.2x -3.03%), GBDC (3.31x +1.91%)Consumer Staples: CHEF (3.43x -8.38%)Utilities: DUK (3.42x -1.97%), ELP (3.22x +2.42%)13:06SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: ATNX (15.39 +34.53%), MDCO (70.12 +19.55%), BCRX (2 +17.35%), CRSP (67.92 +16.03%), NTLA (15.25 +12.13%), DRNA (23.87 +11.59%), EDIT (25.79 +11.4%), ARQL (8.4 +10.67%), APHA (4.21 +10.08%), TCDA (37.66 +9.92%), BOLD (28.08 +9.9%), WVE (31.02 +8.58%), TBIO (10.45 +8.52%), ASND (115.61 +8.07%), GLYC (6.18 +8.04%), AMRX (3.05 +7.6%), PRQR (6.71 +7.36%), PRTA (10.99 +7.28%)Information Technology: JKS (16.76 +12.71%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: VAPO (10.77 -7.08%)Industrials: BLDP (6.52 -10.19%)Consumer Discretionary: KSS (47.53 -18.61%), M (15.19 -10.04%), SIG (15.7 -8.61%)Financials: PPDF (2.5 -12.89%), JT (1.86 -10.39%), YRD (5.51 -9.97%)Energy: KLXE (5.44 -26.19%), UNT (0.72 -11.3%), CRC (7.58 -10.67%), ESV (3.82 -8.95%), SPN (0.33 -8.45%), CHK (0.59 -8.31%), EXTN (6.31 -7.82%), TUSK (1.38 -7.38%), PVAC (24.25 -7.35%)Consumer Staples: CHEF (32.57 -8.38%), DF (0.07 -7.5%)12:57WRAPX Midday Market Summary: Stock market trades mixed; Home Depot, Kohl's weigh on retail spaceThe S&P 500 is currently down 0.1% in midday action, with weakness concentrated in the retail space following disappointing quarterly results and guidance from Home Depot (HD 226.39, -12.46, -5.2%) and Kohl's (KSS 47.58, -10.82, -18.5%).The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.4%, but the Nasdaq Composite (+0.2%) and Russell 2000 (+0.4%) trade higher.The underperformance of the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 44.12, -0.71, -1.6%) best displays the negative sentiment that has subsumed the retail industry today. Both the Dow and S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (-0.8%), meanwhile, can attribute their underperformance to Home Depot.The S&P 500 energy sector (-1.1%) is down even more amid a sharp decline in oil prices ($55.69, -1.45, -2.5%), but the market isn't getting concerned about the U.S. consumer based on a couple of reports. Instead, the market is hanging in there amid gains in the heavily-weighted health care (+0.3%), information technology (+0.1%), and financials (+0.1%) sectors.The consensus among many investors is that the market is due for a pullback, but the absence of one has created a sort of pain trade for investors fearful of missing out on further gains. The S&P 500 was down just 0.3% at its low earlier today before a buy-the-dip effort briefly brought it back above its flat line.Separately, shares of AT&T (T 37.65, -1.99) are down 5.0% after the stock was downgraded to Sell from Neutral at MoffettNathanson with a price target of $30. Shares of Slack (WORK 20.88, -2.24, -9.7%) are down 10% on news that Microsoft's (MSFT 150.99, +0.65, +0.4%) competitive product, Teams, has increased daily active users by nearly 50% since July.In the Treasury market, demand for longer-dated bonds has caused some minor curve-flattening activity. The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.79%. The U.S. Dollar Index is flat at 97.79.Today's economic calendar was limited to Housing Starts and Building Permits for October:Total housing starts increased 3.8% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.314 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.300 million) while total building permits increased 5.0% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.461 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.365 million).There was a sizable jump in starts (+8.6%) and permits (+8.2%) for multi-unit dwellings, yet the key takeaway from the report is that starts (+2.0%) and permits (+3.2%) increased for single-family units in an inventory-constrained environment for single-family homes.12:45MRK Merck increases quarterly dividend to $0.61 from $0.55/share (84.21 +0.08)12:25SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Myovant Sciences (MYOV) gains on Phase 3 relugolix data -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersMYOV (10.86 +79.21%): Announced results from the Phase 3 HERO study of once-daily, oral relugolix in men with advanced prostate cancer; the trial met its primary efficacy endpoint and all six key secondary endpoints -- in the primary endpoint responder analysis, 96.7% of men receiving the relugolix regimen achieved sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels through 48 weeks.

Wainwright, citing a positive view of co's new strategic alliance with Novo Nordisk (NVO), which was announced yesterday; the firm views the deal as underscoring a "Burgeoning RNAi Powerhouse." Continued strength sees the stock touch up to new four-year highs.Small Cap LosersI (6.19 -22.91%): Continued weakness following FCC Chairman Ajit Pai's announcement midday yesterday of support for a public auction of 280 megahertz of the C-band spectrum; the C-Band Alliance, a satellite operator group of which co is a member, issued a statement yesterday following the Chairman's communication, noting, among other comments, that the announcement "does not address the critical involvement of the incumbent satellite operators in executing the complex task of reconfiguring and transitioning their networks." Following yesterday's developments, the stock was downgraded to In-Line from Outperform at Evercore ISI, which also cut co's price target to $11 from $38; JPMorgan lowered co's target to $9 from $22. Wells Fargo noted that embrace of a public auction "does not seem to offer much potential capital to the satellite players" and also noted the impact that the public approach will have on timing, saying, "Getting this spectrum auctioned off in 1H 2020 (as the C-Band Alliance plan had outlined) seems naively optimistic at this point." The stock again records new 52-week lows, now down circa 76% month-to-date. PPDF (2.53 -11.85%): Missed estimates for Q3 EPS and revs (+35.0% yr/yr to RMB1.51 bln).

Their weakness has acted as a weight on the broader market, yet the movement of the S&P 500 index has been largely a function of technical price action.Briefing.com's Technical Take page identified 3127 as a secondary resistance level for the S&P 500. That level was tested with the opening move (3127.64) but quickly failed as steady selling eventually dropped the S&P 500 back to 3113.46 at this morning's low, which was reached just before 11:00 a.m. ET. That level fell within a secondary support level (3115/3112) that was also identified on the Technical Take Page.Traders, therefore, appear to be respecting these technical boundaries for now on a day that is devoid of any major macro news drivers, particularly as they relate to trade, and as it is suggested that the market is short-term overextended and due for a pullback.The Russell 2000 is up 0.4%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.3%; the S&P 500 is unchanged; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.4%.11:51QCOM Qualcomm issues 3 year targets at Analyst Day (88.73 -1.78)From CFO's presentation at Analyst Day:3 year targets as earnings mix shift to QCT from QTLRevenue: QCT segment SAM: 10% CAGR, grow faster than SAM and Apple product revenues QTL: current run rate + Huawei resolution Operating margin: QCT grows to >20%; QTL: ~70%Summarizing Qualcomm opportunities: Mature handset industry and current macroeconomic environment; Accelerated 5G migration compared to 4G; Mobile handset platform: 4G->5G transition, RF Front-End growth; Growth beyond mobile: Auto, IoT, Compute, ADAS, Cloud/Edge AI 75+ 5G licenses including key anchor agreements.Grow earnings faster than revenues.

The ACHIEVE II trial evaluated ubrogepant 50 mg and 25 mg, compared with placebo, across a wide range of clinical endpoints, including the co-primary endpoints of pain freedom (no pain) and freedom from the most bothersome migraine-associated symptom at two hours post-initial dose. For the two co-primary endpoints, ubrogepant 50 mg and 25 mg showed statistically significant higher response rates for pain freedom at two hours (21.8% for 50 mg, 20.7% for 25 mg and 14.3% for placebo), and the 50 mg dose demonstrated statistically significant higher response rates for the freedom from the most bothersome migraine-associated symptom at two hours (38.9% for 50 mg and 27.4% for placebo). Additionally, ubrogepant 50 mg was statistically superior to placebo in the absence of light sensitivity (43.8% for 50 mg and 35.5% for placebo) and sound sensitivity (54.1% for 50 mg and 46.3% for placebo).FDA action on the NDA for ubrogepant is expected in December 2019, potentially making it the first oral CGRP to address unmet patient needs in acute treatment of migraine and the first FDA-approved gepant.11:21XLE Sector Briefing: Energy (58.71 -0.65)The energy sector (-1.1%) sits at the bottom of today's sector standings after showing relative weakness yesterday. The growth-sensitive sector is now down 2.4% since Friday versus a much more modest 0.1% week-to-date downtick in the S&P 500. Factors contributing to the underperformance:Notable pressure on crude oil. The energy component is down more than $1.00 today (-2.3%) and down $2.01 (-3.5%) since Friday's settlement. This has sent the price of oil beneath its 200-day moving average (57.37) with the 50-day average (55.65) looming just below. Tax-loss related selling. The energy sector has been the weakest performer of 2019, meaning the group contains a fair share of names that have underperformed since the end of 2018. These names are more likely to be sold before the end of 2019 as investors look to reduce some of the tax impact of taking capital gains this year.Notable movers:HollyFrontier (HFC 51.56, -2.35, -4.4%): falling to its lowest level since early October. The company announced a new project and a new buyback authorization yesterday morning. Noble Energy (NBL 19.41, -0.51, -2.6%): nearing its 2019 low after finding resistance at its 50-day moving average (21.34) at the end of last week.

ConocoPhillips (COP 57.26, +0.56, +1.0%): best performing sector component, reclaiming its 50-day moving average (57.03). The company is hosting its analyst & investor meeting today, where it is expected to reaffirm its commitment to a strategy unveiled in 2016.10:35OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:DO Jan20 5 calls are seeing interest with 4230 contracts trading vs. open int of 0, pushing implied vol up around 10 points to ~87%.

That corner is the retail industry, which has been broadsided today by disappointing earnings/sales results and guidance from Home Depot (HD 226.60, -12.25, -5.1%) and Kohl's (KSS 48.09, -10.31, -17.7%).The weakness in HD is having an outsized impact on the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (-0.9%); meanwhile, the combined impact of the disappointments from these well-known retailers is creating some angst about consumer spending activity entering the all-important holiday selling season.That angst is showing up in a sympathy trade that has knocked down the prices of many other retail stocks today, like Macy's (M 15.36, -1.51, -9.0%), Best Buy (BBY 75.61, -1.68, -2.2%), and Gap (GPS 16.62, -0.68, -3.9%) to name a few. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.97, -0.85, -1.9%) reflects the broader trend of underperformance for the retailers in today's market action.Those issues notwithstanding, the broader market is still holding up just fine as it is drawing influential support from the information technology (+0.3%), healthcare (+0.3%), and financial (+0.2%) sectors, which continue to attract interest from value and growth-minded investors alike.Separately, the market's overall resilience to selling pressure remains a tying factor for a number of participants who are fearful of missing out on further gains. That fear, ostensibly, is lending some buying support that has kept downside pressure in check.The Russell 2000 is up 0.2%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.1%; the S&P 500 is down 0.1%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%.10:00XLY Sector Briefing: Consumer Discretionary (120.74 -1.05)The consumer discretionary sector (-0.8%) represents an early pocket of relative weakness in a flat market. This makes for a continuation of this month's underperformance, which has the sector trading down 0.3% since the end of October versus a 2.8% gain in the S&P 500. Factors contributing to today's underperformance:Home Depot's (HD 227.72, -11.13, -4.7%) Q3 earnings report, which showed lower than expected revenue and lowered comparable sales guidance for FY20. Granted, Home Depot met Q3 EPS expectations, but the revenue shortfall and lowered comparable sales guidance have pressured the stock from a record high. Furthermore, the outlook is leading to some questions about the overall strength of consumer spending. Disappointing Q3 results and lowered FY20 guidance from Kohl's (KSS 48.86, -9.54, -16.4%), fueling worries that other apparel retailers could also report underwhelming results.Notable movers:Home Depot (HD 227.72, -11.13, -4.7%): falling back below its 50-day moving average (232.37) after setting a fresh record high on Monday. Kohl's (KSS 48.86, -9.54, -16.4%): falling to its lowest level in more than a month in response to weaker than expected quarterly results. Macy's (M 15.35, -1.53, -9.0%): sliding back below its 50-day moving average (15.76) after weak results from Kohl's. Nordstrom (JWN 35.10, -2.78, -7.3%): falling below its 200-day moving average (36.33) and toward its 50-day moving average (34.94) in sympathy with Kohl's. Gap (GPS 16.70, -0.60, -3.4%): approaching its October low after Kohl's disappointing results. TJX (TJX 60.68, +1.13, +1.9%): touched a fresh record after better than expected Q3 results overshadowed below-consensus Q4 EPS guidance. Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL 119.72, +1.32, +1.1%): bucking the overall trend in the sector.09:46SCANX Earnings mvoersJKS +13.79% WUBA +7.04% NJR +3.91% CRMT +3.57% TJX +2.82% DAVA +2.24% ASND +2.07% ESE +1.57%KSS -15.96% PPDF -7.14% HD -5.30% ASH -4.63% MMS -2.59% BILI -2.32% WWD -2.00% ZTO -1.29% KRNT -1.30% TDG -0.78% ALV -0.56% MDT -0.36%09:41WRAPX Opening Market Summary: Stock market opens slightly higher, retail dragsThe major indices open slightly higher at new all-time highs. The S&P 500 is up 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.3%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows financials (+0.4%) and information technology (+0.3%) leading the early advance. Conversely, the utilities (-0.6%) and consumer discretionary (-0.4%) sectors underperform, with the latter pressured by Home Depot (HD 228.90, -9.94, -4.2%) following its earnings results and guidance.The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 44.37, -0.45, -1.0%) is being dragged lower by shares of Kohl's (KSS 49.48, -8.86, -15.1%) after the company missed earnings estimates and lowered its FY20 EPS below consensus.U.S. Treasuries are little changed.

In the primary endpoint responder analysis, 96.7% (95% CI: 94.9%, 97.9%) of men receiving once-daily, oral relugolix achieved sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels. A responder was defined as achieving and maintaining testosterone suppression to less than or equal to 50 ng/dL from Week 5 through Week 48. For the study to be successful, the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of the response rate had to be at least 90%.The study achieved all six key secondary endpoints, including superiority to leuprolide acetate on rapid suppression of testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA), all with p-values <0.0001.Five key secondary endpoints demonstrated superiority to leuprolide acetate, including rapid suppression of testosterone at Day 4 and Day 15, profound suppression of testosterone at Day 15, rapid suppression of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at Day 15, and suppression of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) at Week 24 (all p-values <0.0001). In addition, relugolix demonstrated non-inferiority to leuprolide acetate on sustained testosterone suppression through 48 weeks (96.7% vs. 88.8%, respectively) with a between-group difference of 7.9% (95% CI: 4.1%,11.8%), the primary endpoint required for regulatory submissions outside of the U.S. In addition, the pharmacodynamic results showed no testosterone flare after initiation of relugolix and mean testosterone levels returned to normal levels within 90 days after treatment discontinuation.A New Drug Application (NDA) submission is expected in the second quarter of 2020.A conference call and webcast are to be held today at 8:30 a.m. EST / 5:30 a.m. PST.07:32SRRK Scholar Rock announces preliminary pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic results from the TOPAZ Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial of SRK-015 for the treatment of patients with spinal muscular atrophy (7.20 )The planned preliminary PK/PD analysis, which includes data from 29 patients with SMA across all three cohorts, showed dose-proportional drug exposure and demonstrated target engagement, as evidenced by dose-dependent increases of up to 100-fold in the serum levels of latent myostatin following SRK-015 treatment (2 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg doses).

Khoury, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of KLX Energy Services commented, "Contemporaneously with the abrupt decline in activity, we took steps to align our business with current customer demand. Specifically, we implemented an approximate 17 percent reduction in force, as compared with the Company's July 31, 2019 staffing levels, consistent with the approximate 18 percent sequential quarterly decline in our third quarter revenues. We aggressively cut costs in every area of our business, and we warm stacked the vast majority of our Permian based wireline assets. As a result of these and other measures, we expect to take a third quarter charge of approximately $13 million. Notwithstanding the precipitous decline in industry conditions, we generated approximately $44 million in cash flow from operations and approximately $31 million in free cash flow, bringing our cash balance to approximately $121 million for the quarter ended October 31, 2019. In addition, our $100 million credit facility remains undrawn.""The abrupt deterioration in industry conditions, which accelerated through the end of our third quarter, was driven by a sharp sequential quarterly decline in U.S. land rig count and an unprecedented decline in active frac spreads from the second quarter to the third quarter. In fact, there was a significant sequential decline in hydraulic fracturing activity during each month of the third quarter. The decline in Exploration & Production activity resulted in lower demand levels and lower current and expected revenues for our business, which led the Company to accelerate its annual testing for asset impairment into the third quarter. While the Company has not yet completed this analysis, we expect to report a non-cash asset impairment charge in the range of approximately $45 million to $60 million. The Company is in the process of finalizing the actual amount of the impairment charge, which will be completed prior to reporting its third quarter financial results."06:00CEO CNOOC Ltd names President Xu Keqiang as CEO (152.50 )06:00TRP TC Energy to provide financial update and review strategic plans at Investor Day, reaffirms expectation to grow common share dividend at an annual rate of 8-10% through 2021 (51.44 )"Our $100 billion portfolio of high-quality, long-life energy infrastructure assets are expected to generate record financial results again in 2019 underpinned by strong market fundamentals," said Russ Girling, TC Energy's president and chief executive officer. "Looking forward, we continue to advance $30 billion of commercially secured projects that will expand and extend our asset footprint across North America."As those projects enter service, TC Energy expects comparable earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to exceed $10 billion in 2022. This represents an increase of more than 16 per cent when compared to comparable EBITDA of $8.6 billion in 2018 despite significant asset sales that have accelerated the strengthening of the company's balance sheet. Notably, approximately 95 per cent of comparable EBITDA is expected to come from regulated assets or long-term contracts. At the same time, the company continues to methodically advance more than $20 billion of projects under development including Keystone XL and the Bruce Power life extension program. Success in advancing these and other organic growth opportunities that are expected to emanate from TC Energy's five operating businesses across North America would add to the company's growth outlook."Based on the confidence we have in our business plans, we are reaffirming that we expect to grow our common share dividend at an annual rate of eight to 10 per cent through 2021," added Girling. "Our dividend outlook is supported by expected growth in earnings and cash flow and in line with our historically strong dividend coverage ratios."06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- World markets continue climb higher; US Futures in record territoryThe global equity markets are mostly higher once again with US Futures venturing into all-time high territory for a second straight night.

The Russell 2000 (-0.3%) closed in negative territory.The day began with the market digesting a tweet from a China-based CNBC reporter, who said she was informed by a Chinese government source that Beijing is pessimistic about a trade deal because President Trump hasn't supported a tariff rollback. Based on the modest losses and ensuing price action, the market presumably remained optimistic about a Phase One agreement.The large-cap indices eased their way into positive territory thanks to the turnarounds in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (+0.3%), information technology (+0.3%), and communication services (+0.3%) sectors. Consistent leaders included the consumer staples (+0.5%) and real estate (+0.5%) sectors, as the negative-sounding trade headline likely fostered some conservative-minded interest.The trade-sensitive industrials (-0.3%) and materials (-0.2%) sectors were among today's laggards, but their losses were small compared to the 1.3% drop in the energy sector, which was pressured by the decline in oil prices ($57.04, -0.71, -1.2%).Generally, there wasn't any concerted effort to sell a market trading at all-time highs, but investors weren't eager to embrace risk, either. The trend has been positive, which has likely drawn in some reluctant investors into the market, and today simply may have been a natural breather for a market breaking out to new highs.Notable corporate news included HP Inc. (HPQ 20.01, -0.17, -0.8%) turning down the takeover bid from Xerox (XRX 39.30, +0.36, +0.9%). HP remained open to a deal, though. Netflix (NFLX 302.57, +7.54, +2.6%) shares outperformed on speculation that either Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman built a large stake in the company.U.S. Treasuries extended last week's advance, pushing yields slightly lower across the curve.

We have had a long relationship with Letko and most certainly appreciate their investment in our Company. Our establishment of domicile in the U.S. was carefully considered.... rationale for the move is crystal clear-we want to expose our Company and all its stockholders to increasingly larger pools of investment in U.S. index funds and passively managed accounts. The change in corporate domicile will not change how we run our day-to-day business, nor diminish the important role our Canadian assets play in our portfolio today. We do not believe that our Canadian investors will be forced to sell beyond the Canadian indices, and we will remain listed on both the TSX and the NYSE. Furthermore, we know that most of our large investors in Canada also own many of our U.S.-domiciled peers today. We deeply believe this move ultimately will be positive for ALL shareholders as exposure to the significantly larger U.S. market and funds is estimated to create more than $1 billion of additional demand for our shares."The change in corporate domicile, the rebrand to Ovintiv, and a previously announced 1 -- for -- 5 consolidation and share exchange require two-thirds of votes cast for shareholder approval. A special meeting of Encana shareholders will be held in early 2020.

The retail industry was under pressure following disappointing quarterly results and guidance from Home Depot (HD 225.86, -12.99, -5.4%) and Kohl's (KSS 47.02, -11.38, -19.5%).The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.4%) also finished lower, while the Nasdaq Composite (+0.2%) and Russell 2000 (+0.4%) finished higher. The Nasdaq closed at another record high.The session began with each of the large-cap indices setting intraday highs despite the negative sentiment in the retail space. The early advance quickly faltered but overall losses were modest, and transient, as the S&P 500 only dipped 0.3% below its flat line before buyers quickly stepped in to buy the dip.The retail space didn't benefit from an opportunistic mindset, though, as the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.95, -0.87, -1.9%) finished near its lows like the S&P 500 energy (-1.5%) and consumer discretionary (-1.0%) sectors. Home Depot dragged on the consumer discretionary sector while a 3% drop in WTI crude ($55.21, -1.84, -3.2%) weighed on the energy space.Gains were mainly found in the heavily-weighted S&P 500 health care (+0.7%), information technology (+0.2%), and financials (+0.2%) sectors. The real estate sector (+0.2%) also finished in positive territory.TJX Companies (TJX 60.64, +1.09, +1.8%) was a bright spot among the retailers after it beat top and bottom-line estimates and raised its full-year guidance. TJX likely tempered some concerns about U.S. consumer spending for the holiday shopping season that may have been engendered by Home Depot and Kohl's.Separately, shares of AT&T (T 38.00, -1.63, -4.1%) pulled back 4% after the stock was downgraded to Sell from Neutral at MoffettNathanson. Shares of Slack (WORK 21.18, -1.93, -8.4%) sold off on news that Microsoft's (MSFT 150.39, +0.05, unch) competitive product, Teams, increased daily active users by nearly 50% since July.The U.S. Treasury market was relatively quiet, but demand for longer-dated bonds contributed to some curve-flattening activity. The 2-yr yield was unchanged at 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.79%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 97.85.Tuesday's economic calendar was limited to Housing Starts and Building Permits for October:Total housing starts increased 3.8% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.314 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.300 million) while total building permits increased 5.0% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.461 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.365 million).There was a sizable jump in starts (+8.6%) and permits (+8.2%) for multi-unit dwellings, yet the key takeaway from the report is that starts (+2.0%) and permits (+3.2%) increased for single-family units in an inventory-constrained environment for single-family homes.Looking ahead, the FOMC Minutes from the October 30-31 meeting and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index will be released on Wednesday.Nasdaq Composite +29.2% YTDS&P 500 +24.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +19.8% YTDRussell 2000 +18.5% YTD16:24MGP MGM Growth Properties commences public offering of 24.0 mln Class A shares (32.49 -0.37)The company expects that it will issue and sell 12,000,000 shares directly to the underwriters at closing and that the underwriters will purchase, at the request of the company, 12,000,000 shares from forward purchasers under forward sale agreements.The company plans to use proceeds primarily to repay a portion of the borrowings outstanding under its senior secured term loan A facility and senior secured term loan B facility, which the company believes will well-position it to be able to agree to and consummate a potential JV transaction under discussion with MGM Resorts International and honor any potential redemption of units representing limited partnership units in MGM Growth Properties Operating Partnership LP held by MGM for cash, should MGM elect to exercise any redemption right, if the company decides to pursue such a transaction, or, alternatively, for general corporate purposes.16:24PAGS PagSeguro Digital misses by BRL0.02, misses on revs (36.76 -1.01)Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of BRL 1.18 per share, excluding non-recurring items, BRL 0.02 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of BRL 1.20; revenues rose 30.3% year/year to BRL 1.46 bln vs the BRL 1.5 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Active merchants of 5.0 million, growth of 1.2 million active merchants in the last twelve months; R$29.4 billion in total payment volume, up 45.0% compared with 3Q18;16:20FLNT Fluent authorizes the repurchase of up to $5 mln shares of common stock (1.42 +0.11)16:18MTB M&T Bank increases quarterly cash dividend to $1.10/share from $1.00/share (162.88 -0.09)16:17FIX Comfort Systems increases stock repurchase program (50.40 -0.11)Board of Directors has approved an amendment to the stock repurchase program to increase the shares authorized and remaining as available to purchase back up to 1,000,000 shares by authorizing the Company to acquire up to 764,760 additional shares of its outstanding common stock.16:17AVID Avid Tech at Investor Day guided FY20 adj.

Macy's has guided its fiscal 2020 EPS down 29% at the midpoint to $2.85-3.05, including $0.25 in asset sale gains, with revenue flat yr/yr, comp sales flat to up 1%, and gross margins down slightly. Macy's expects comp sales to improve meaningfully in the fourth quarter, citing a difficult compare in the month of October.The market remains skeptical that the nation's largest department store can generate long-term profit growth given secular challenges.The company's comparable store sales growth has been muted despite the relative strength of consumer spending, which has been supporting the domestic economy.Department stores continue to struggle with lower mall traffic. Last week, the Census Bureau reported core retail sales up 4.2% yr/yr for the three months ending in October, but Department store sales fell 6.1%.With a $4.7 bln market cap, Macy's trades ~6x EPS and ~6x EV/EBITDA, including $3.9 bln in net debt. That represents a slight discount to department store peers. Fortunately, Macy's does have a strong balance sheet, so it can afford to pay its dividend, which yields a robust 9% payout annually.15:15BONDX Treasury Market SummaryLonger Tenors Pad Recent GainsU.S. Treasuries recorded another round of gains on Tuesday, pressuring yields on the 10-yr note and the 30-yr bond into the neighborhood of their respective 50-day moving averages. The Tuesday session bore some resemblance to Monday's affair, as Treasuries started the day with modest losses, recovering them in short order. The early weakness took place after an upbeat start to the European session, which saw the release of strong vehicle registration figures for October. The 10-yr note and the 30-yr bond made it back to their flat lines just minutes after the cash start while shorter tenors also rebounded but took a bit longer before reaching positive territory. Treasuries overtook their morning highs in the early afternoon, remaining near their best levels of the day until the close. The U.S. Dollar Index rose 0.1% to 97.86, snapping a four-day skid. Yield Check: 2-yr: UNCH at 1.59% 3-yr: UNCH at 1.59% 5-yr: UNCH at 1.62% 10-yr: -2 bps to 1.79% 30-yr: -4 bps to 2.26%News: The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow forecast for Q4 GDP was increased to 0.4% from 0.3% following today's housing data.

There was a sizable jump in starts (+8.6%) and permits (+8.2%) for multi-unit dwellings, yet the key takeaway from the report is that starts (+2.0%) and permits (+3.2%) increased for single-family units in an inventory-constrained environment for single-family homes.

LOW has reported EPS upside in four of the past five quarters.The CapitalIQ consensus estimate for Q3 EPS is $1.35. The revenue consensus estimate is $17.69 bln. Note: LOW typically guides for revenue, EPS and comps in the press release for the full year. Its current full year guidance is for adjusted EPS of $5.45-5.65 while sales are expected to increase +2%. It'll be important to see if the company reaffirms or changes this guidance. Same store comps are always a key metric for Lowe's. In Q2 (Jul), comps came in at +2.3% and +3.2% for the US home improvement business. Home Depot (HD) is always a key barometer as to what to expect from Lowe's. HD was not super impressive as comps underwhelmed and HD lowered full year guidance. It's not all doom and gloom for Lowe's because HD cited some internal initiatives that are taking longer to materialize, so much of it may be company-specific and not industry-wide problems. Specifically, HD was emphatic on the call that it "sees a strong and engaged customer" and that "housing is healthy and stable." Another area to watch is tariffs. HD said that tariffs are having an impact but are manageable as its merchants have done a good job at mitigating the impact. Aside from the Home Depot angle, another aspect to this earnings report will be progress on Lowe's turnaround. Despite having a similar number of stores, Lowe's is dwarfed by Home Depot (HD) in terms of annual revenue ($72 bln vs $111 bln for HD) and HD holds a sizeable profitability gap. Lowe's wants to improve merchandising availability, to improve its digital presence/app, to increase the use of self-check-out lanes and cut worker hours to boost productivity. It'll be interesting to get an update on its progress. Overall, our sense is that the weak comps/guidance from Home Depot has lowered expectations for Lowe's this quarter. However, with Lowe's, we think investors are more focused on the bigger picture, namely how is the turnaround going.13:42TPX Tempur Sealy Int'l: US ITC determines mattresses from China injure US industry; Department of Commerce will issue antidumping duty order on imports of this product from China (85.44 -1.05)The United States International Trade Commission (USITC) today determined that a U.S. industry is materially injured by reason of imports of mattresses from China that the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) has determined are sold in the United States at less than fair value. As a result of the USITC's affirmative determination, Commerce will issue an antidumping duty order on imports of this product from China. ITC Release13:15ABMD Abiomed says Abiomed medical office is issuing publication review of observational analysis of Impella that was presented by Amin et al. at the American Heart Association Conference on November 17 (186.19 +8.10)According to the company, the AHA analysis is flawed because:The data source has significant limitations, containing just a fraction of Impella patients and unable to delineate between common adverse events.The Impella patients were much sicker and had greater baseline and procedural risks.The analysis excluded the costliest IABP patients who were escalated to other therapies.Additionally, the conclusion is aggressive because administrative coding data cannot delineate between adverse events common to high-risk patients and device related events.13:08SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: ACB (37.93 mln +2.94%), TEVA (22.61 mln +0.97%), BMY (19.42 mln -1.7%), CELG (13.89 mln -0.93%), CLVS (13.81 mln +6.23%)Industrials: GE (17.95 mln -0.6%)Consumer Discretionary: M (32.83 mln -10.04%), ROKU (21.57 mln -1.82%), KSS (19.77 mln -18.61%), NIO (18.01 mln +3.06%), F (17.54 mln -0.28%)Information Technology: AMD (54.78 mln +2.61%), NOK (20.12 mln -0.72%)Financials: BAC (17.88 mln -0.27%)Energy: CHK (55.18 mln -8.31%), ET (13.13 mln -1.99%), ECA (12.04 mln -4.56%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: MDCO (6.75x +19.55%), CRSP (5.7x +16.03%), EDIT (3.67x +11.4%), ATNX (3.12x +34.53%), CELG (2.97x -0.93%), NTLA (2.83x +12.13%)Materials: ASH (3.23x -4.14%)Industrials: WWD (3.27x -0.37%)Consumer Discretionary: KSS (6.3x -18.61%), HD (3.61x -5.23%)Information Technology: JKS (4.05x +12.71%)Financials: EFC (18.2x -3.03%), GBDC (3.31x +1.91%)Consumer Staples: CHEF (3.43x -8.38%)Utilities: DUK (3.42x -1.97%), ELP (3.22x +2.42%)13:06SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: ATNX (15.39 +34.53%), MDCO (70.12 +19.55%), BCRX (2 +17.35%), CRSP (67.92 +16.03%), NTLA (15.25 +12.13%), DRNA (23.87 +11.59%), EDIT (25.79 +11.4%), ARQL (8.4 +10.67%), APHA (4.21 +10.08%), TCDA (37.66 +9.92%), BOLD (28.08 +9.9%), WVE (31.02 +8.58%), TBIO (10.45 +8.52%), ASND (115.61 +8.07%), GLYC (6.18 +8.04%), AMRX (3.05 +7.6%), PRQR (6.71 +7.36%), PRTA (10.99 +7.28%)Information Technology: JKS (16.76 +12.71%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: VAPO (10.77 -7.08%)Industrials: BLDP (6.52 -10.19%)Consumer Discretionary: KSS (47.53 -18.61%), M (15.19 -10.04%), SIG (15.7 -8.61%)Financials: PPDF (2.5 -12.89%), JT (1.86 -10.39%), YRD (5.51 -9.97%)Energy: KLXE (5.44 -26.19%), UNT (0.72 -11.3%), CRC (7.58 -10.67%), ESV (3.82 -8.95%), SPN (0.33 -8.45%), CHK (0.59 -8.31%), EXTN (6.31 -7.82%), TUSK (1.38 -7.38%), PVAC (24.25 -7.35%)Consumer Staples: CHEF (32.57 -8.38%), DF (0.07 -7.5%)12:57WRAPX Midday Market Summary: Stock market trades mixed; Home Depot, Kohl's weigh on retail spaceThe S&P 500 is currently down 0.1% in midday action, with weakness concentrated in the retail space following disappointing quarterly results and guidance from Home Depot (HD 226.39, -12.46, -5.2%) and Kohl's (KSS 47.58, -10.82, -18.5%).The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.4%, but the Nasdaq Composite (+0.2%) and Russell 2000 (+0.4%) trade higher.The underperformance of the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 44.12, -0.71, -1.6%) best displays the negative sentiment that has subsumed the retail industry today. Both the Dow and S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (-0.8%), meanwhile, can attribute their underperformance to Home Depot.The S&P 500 energy sector (-1.1%) is down even more amid a sharp decline in oil prices ($55.69, -1.45, -2.5%), but the market isn't getting concerned about the U.S. consumer based on a couple of reports. Instead, the market is hanging in there amid gains in the heavily-weighted health care (+0.3%), information technology (+0.1%), and financials (+0.1%) sectors.The consensus among many investors is that the market is due for a pullback, but the absence of one has created a sort of pain trade for investors fearful of missing out on further gains. The S&P 500 was down just 0.3% at its low earlier today before a buy-the-dip effort briefly brought it back above its flat line.Separately, shares of AT&T (T 37.65, -1.99) are down 5.0% after the stock was downgraded to Sell from Neutral at MoffettNathanson with a price target of $30. Shares of Slack (WORK 20.88, -2.24, -9.7%) are down 10% on news that Microsoft's (MSFT 150.99, +0.65, +0.4%) competitive product, Teams, has increased daily active users by nearly 50% since July.In the Treasury market, demand for longer-dated bonds has caused some minor curve-flattening activity. The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.79%. The U.S. Dollar Index is flat at 97.79.Today's economic calendar was limited to Housing Starts and Building Permits for October:Total housing starts increased 3.8% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.314 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.300 million) while total building permits increased 5.0% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.461 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.365 million).There was a sizable jump in starts (+8.6%) and permits (+8.2%) for multi-unit dwellings, yet the key takeaway from the report is that starts (+2.0%) and permits (+3.2%) increased for single-family units in an inventory-constrained environment for single-family homes.12:45MRK Merck increases quarterly dividend to $0.61 from $0.55/share (84.21 +0.08)12:25SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Myovant Sciences (MYOV) gains on Phase 3 relugolix data -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersMYOV (10.86 +79.21%): Announced results from the Phase 3 HERO study of once-daily, oral relugolix in men with advanced prostate cancer; the trial met its primary efficacy endpoint and all six key secondary endpoints -- in the primary endpoint responder analysis, 96.7% of men receiving the relugolix regimen achieved sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels through 48 weeks. These results, noted co, support NDA submission to the FDA in Q2 of 2020 and future regulatory submissions in Europe and Japan. Jumps to six-month highs. ATNX (15.12 +32.12%): Moves to its highest levels since August after previewing its presentation at the 2019 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium; co's abstract for the Phase 3 study of oral paclitaxel and encequidar in metastatic breast cancer has been selected for the conference's press program. DRNA (23.72 +10.89%): Price target raised to $30 from $22 at H.C. Wainwright, citing a positive view of co's new strategic alliance with Novo Nordisk (NVO), which was announced yesterday; the firm views the deal as underscoring a "Burgeoning RNAi Powerhouse." Continued strength sees the stock touch up to new four-year highs.Small Cap LosersI (6.19 -22.91%): Continued weakness following FCC Chairman Ajit Pai's announcement midday yesterday of support for a public auction of 280 megahertz of the C-band spectrum; the C-Band Alliance, a satellite operator group of which co is a member, issued a statement yesterday following the Chairman's communication, noting, among other comments, that the announcement "does not address the critical involvement of the incumbent satellite operators in executing the complex task of reconfiguring and transitioning their networks." Following yesterday's developments, the stock was downgraded to In-Line from Outperform at Evercore ISI, which also cut co's price target to $11 from $38; JPMorgan lowered co's target to $9 from $22. Wells Fargo noted that embrace of a public auction "does not seem to offer much potential capital to the satellite players" and also noted the impact that the public approach will have on timing, saying, "Getting this spectrum auctioned off in 1H 2020 (as the C-Band Alliance plan had outlined) seems naively optimistic at this point." The stock again records new 52-week lows, now down circa 76% month-to-date. PPDF (2.53 -11.85%): Missed estimates for Q3 EPS and revs (+35.0% yr/yr to RMB1.51 bln). Cumulative registered users increased to approx. 102.8 mln while cumulative number of borrowers reached 17.4 mln as of September 30; number of unique borrowers increased +28.6% yr/yr. Co expects total loan origination volume between RMB16-19 bln for Q4. Co also noted that it plans to discontinue its online information intermediary business between individual borrowers and individual investors. At all-time lows. PLUG (3.33 -11.12%): Pulls back from yesterday's four-year highs with above average volume; factoring in today's move, the stock continues to trade higher by circa +26% month-to-date.11:59SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (95) outpacing new lows (63) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: AAPL, AES, AGEN, AIZ, ALL, AMD, AME, AMED, ANSS, AON, APD, ARDX, ARMK, ARVN, ARWR, ATEC, ATRS, AVGO, AZO, BIO, BIP, BLDR, BLK, BLMN, BRO, CACI, CATM, CDE, CDW, CLH, CPRT, CRSP, CSGS, CSL, CVNA, CZR, DEA, DEI, DKS, DOX, DRNA, DXCM, EIDX, EPAM, ESE, EVRI, EW, FISV, FNF, FTNT, GLIBA, GPN, HALO, HIG, INFO, INOV, INST, KMX, KRG, KRTX, LDOS, LIN, LPT, LULU, LXP, LZB, MCO, MDCO, MGM, MMC, MSCI, MSFT, NSIT, OC, PFSI, PLMR, PRFT, RDN, RLI, SEM, SHOO, SPGI, TDY, TJX, TMO, TROW, TRU, UI, USB, VAC, VRTX, XBIT, XPEL, XRX, ZYMEStocks that traded to 52 week lows: AM, AR, ASIX, BCEI, BIG, BTU, BXC, CDEV, CEIX, CHK, CNP, CPS, CRZO, CTRA, CVEO, DCP, ENBL, ENLC, EQM, ETRN, EXPE, EXTN, EZPW, FLNT, FOSL, FPRX, FTSI, GLOG, GLOP, GSM, GTE, GTLS, I, IIVI, KLXE, LBRT, MDR, MPLX, NEWM, NVEE, OAS, PAA, PAGP, PBT, PNNT, PRMW, QUAD, RBBN, RVLV, SDRL, SINA, SMLP, SNH, TCO, TCS, TDW, TH, TRIP, UPWK, VG, VNOM, WES, WLLThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: CABO, FWONA, IHC, LACQ, NWPX, PLOW, WDFCETFs that traded to 52 week highs: CUT, DIA, EWC, EWG, EWQ, EZU, FAN, GREK, IAI, IOO, ITA, IWF, IYF, IYG, IYH, IYJ, KCE, OEF, QQQ, SPY, UYG, VGK, VTI, XLKETFs that traded to 52 week lows: AMJ, VXX, XES11:53TALKX Market Briefing: Price action getting technicalThere hasn't been a lot of conviction in the morning session, evidenced by an S&P 500 that is basically unchanged through the first two hours of trading.Retail stocks have been a notable pocket of weakness following the disappointments from Home Depot (HD 226.88, -11.98, -5.0%) and Kohl's (KSS 48.21, -10.19, -17.5%). Their weakness has acted as a weight on the broader market, yet the movement of the S&P 500 index has been largely a function of technical price action.Briefing.com's Technical Take page identified 3127 as a secondary resistance level for the S&P 500. That level was tested with the opening move (3127.64) but quickly failed as steady selling eventually dropped the S&P 500 back to 3113.46 at this morning's low, which was reached just before 11:00 a.m. ET. That level fell within a secondary support level (3115/3112) that was also identified on the Technical Take Page.Traders, therefore, appear to be respecting these technical boundaries for now on a day that is devoid of any major macro news drivers, particularly as they relate to trade, and as it is suggested that the market is short-term overextended and due for a pullback.The Russell 2000 is up 0.4%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.3%; the S&P 500 is unchanged; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.4%.11:51QCOM Qualcomm issues 3 year targets at Analyst Day (88.73 -1.78)From CFO's presentation at Analyst Day:3 year targets as earnings mix shift to QCT from QTLRevenue: QCT segment SAM: 10% CAGR, grow faster than SAM and Apple product revenues QTL: current run rate + Huawei resolution Operating margin: QCT grows to >20%; QTL: ~70%Summarizing Qualcomm opportunities: Mature handset industry and current macroeconomic environment; Accelerated 5G migration compared to 4G; Mobile handset platform: 4G->5G transition, RF Front-End growth; Growth beyond mobile: Auto, IoT, Compute, ADAS, Cloud/Edge AI 75+ 5G licenses including key anchor agreements.Grow earnings faster than revenues.

The ACHIEVE II trial evaluated ubrogepant 50 mg and 25 mg, compared with placebo, across a wide range of clinical endpoints, including the co-primary endpoints of pain freedom (no pain) and freedom from the most bothersome migraine-associated symptom at two hours post-initial dose. For the two co-primary endpoints, ubrogepant 50 mg and 25 mg showed statistically significant higher response rates for pain freedom at two hours (21.8% for 50 mg, 20.7% for 25 mg and 14.3% for placebo), and the 50 mg dose demonstrated statistically significant higher response rates for the freedom from the most bothersome migraine-associated symptom at two hours (38.9% for 50 mg and 27.4% for placebo). Additionally, ubrogepant 50 mg was statistically superior to placebo in the absence of light sensitivity (43.8% for 50 mg and 35.5% for placebo) and sound sensitivity (54.1% for 50 mg and 46.3% for placebo).FDA action on the NDA for ubrogepant is expected in December 2019, potentially making it the first oral CGRP to address unmet patient needs in acute treatment of migraine and the first FDA-approved gepant.11:21XLE Sector Briefing: Energy (58.71 -0.65)The energy sector (-1.1%) sits at the bottom of today's sector standings after showing relative weakness yesterday. The growth-sensitive sector is now down 2.4% since Friday versus a much more modest 0.1% week-to-date downtick in the S&P 500. Factors contributing to the underperformance:Notable pressure on crude oil. The energy component is down more than $1.00 today (-2.3%) and down $2.01 (-3.5%) since Friday's settlement. This has sent the price of oil beneath its 200-day moving average (57.37) with the 50-day average (55.65) looming just below. Tax-loss related selling. The energy sector has been the weakest performer of 2019, meaning the group contains a fair share of names that have underperformed since the end of 2018. These names are more likely to be sold before the end of 2019 as investors look to reduce some of the tax impact of taking capital gains this year.Notable movers:HollyFrontier (HFC 51.56, -2.35, -4.4%): falling to its lowest level since early October. The company announced a new project and a new buyback authorization yesterday morning.

That corner is the retail industry, which has been broadsided today by disappointing earnings/sales results and guidance from Home Depot (HD 226.60, -12.25, -5.1%) and Kohl's (KSS 48.09, -10.31, -17.7%).The weakness in HD is having an outsized impact on the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (-0.9%); meanwhile, the combined impact of the disappointments from these well-known retailers is creating some angst about consumer spending activity entering the all-important holiday selling season.That angst is showing up in a sympathy trade that has knocked down the prices of many other retail stocks today, like Macy's (M 15.36, -1.51, -9.0%), Best Buy (BBY 75.61, -1.68, -2.2%), and Gap (GPS 16.62, -0.68, -3.9%) to name a few. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.97, -0.85, -1.9%) reflects the broader trend of underperformance for the retailers in today's market action.Those issues notwithstanding, the broader market is still holding up just fine as it is drawing influential support from the information technology (+0.3%), healthcare (+0.3%), and financial (+0.2%) sectors, which continue to attract interest from value and growth-minded investors alike.Separately, the market's overall resilience to selling pressure remains a tying factor for a number of participants who are fearful of missing out on further gains. That fear, ostensibly, is lending some buying support that has kept downside pressure in check.The Russell 2000 is up 0.2%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.1%; the S&P 500 is down 0.1%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%.10:00XLY Sector Briefing: Consumer Discretionary (120.74 -1.05)The consumer discretionary sector (-0.8%) represents an early pocket of relative weakness in a flat market. This makes for a continuation of this month's underperformance, which has the sector trading down 0.3% since the end of October versus a 2.8% gain in the S&P 500. Factors contributing to today's underperformance:Home Depot's (HD 227.72, -11.13, -4.7%) Q3 earnings report, which showed lower than expected revenue and lowered comparable sales guidance for FY20. Granted, Home Depot met Q3 EPS expectations, but the revenue shortfall and lowered comparable sales guidance have pressured the stock from a record high. Furthermore, the outlook is leading to some questions about the overall strength of consumer spending. Disappointing Q3 results and lowered FY20 guidance from Kohl's (KSS 48.86, -9.54, -16.4%), fueling worries that other apparel retailers could also report underwhelming results.Notable movers:Home Depot (HD 227.72, -11.13, -4.7%): falling back below its 50-day moving average (232.37) after setting a fresh record high on Monday. Kohl's (KSS 48.86, -9.54, -16.4%): falling to its lowest level in more than a month in response to weaker than expected quarterly results. Macy's (M 15.35, -1.53, -9.0%): sliding back below its 50-day moving average (15.76) after weak results from Kohl's. Nordstrom (JWN 35.10, -2.78, -7.3%): falling below its 200-day moving average (36.33) and toward its 50-day moving average (34.94) in sympathy with Kohl's.

For the study to be successful, the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of the response rate had to be at least 90%.The study achieved all six key secondary endpoints, including superiority to leuprolide acetate on rapid suppression of testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA), all with p-values <0.0001.Five key secondary endpoints demonstrated superiority to leuprolide acetate, including rapid suppression of testosterone at Day 4 and Day 15, profound suppression of testosterone at Day 15, rapid suppression of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at Day 15, and suppression of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) at Week 24 (all p-values <0.0001). In addition, relugolix demonstrated non-inferiority to leuprolide acetate on sustained testosterone suppression through 48 weeks (96.7% vs. 88.8%, respectively) with a between-group difference of 7.9% (95% CI: 4.1%,11.8%), the primary endpoint required for regulatory submissions outside of the U.S. In addition, the pharmacodynamic results showed no testosterone flare after initiation of relugolix and mean testosterone levels returned to normal levels within 90 days after treatment discontinuation.A New Drug Application (NDA) submission is expected in the second quarter of 2020.A conference call and webcast are to be held today at 8:30 a.m. EST / 5:30 a.m. PST.07:32SRRK Scholar Rock announces preliminary pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic results from the TOPAZ Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial of SRK-015 for the treatment of patients with spinal muscular atrophy (7.20 )The planned preliminary PK/PD analysis, which includes data from 29 patients with SMA across all three cohorts, showed dose-proportional drug exposure and demonstrated target engagement, as evidenced by dose-dependent increases of up to 100-fold in the serum levels of latent myostatin following SRK-015 treatment (2 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg doses).

Khoury, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of KLX Energy Services commented, "Contemporaneously with the abrupt decline in activity, we took steps to align our business with current customer demand. Specifically, we implemented an approximate 17 percent reduction in force, as compared with the Company's July 31, 2019 staffing levels, consistent with the approximate 18 percent sequential quarterly decline in our third quarter revenues. We aggressively cut costs in every area of our business, and we warm stacked the vast majority of our Permian based wireline assets. As a result of these and other measures, we expect to take a third quarter charge of approximately $13 million. Notwithstanding the precipitous decline in industry conditions, we generated approximately $44 million in cash flow from operations and approximately $31 million in free cash flow, bringing our cash balance to approximately $121 million for the quarter ended October 31, 2019. In addition, our $100 million credit facility remains undrawn.""The abrupt deterioration in industry conditions, which accelerated through the end of our third quarter, was driven by a sharp sequential quarterly decline in U.S. land rig count and an unprecedented decline in active frac spreads from the second quarter to the third quarter. In fact, there was a significant sequential decline in hydraulic fracturing activity during each month of the third quarter. The decline in Exploration & Production activity resulted in lower demand levels and lower current and expected revenues for our business, which led the Company to accelerate its annual testing for asset impairment into the third quarter. While the Company has not yet completed this analysis, we expect to report a non-cash asset impairment charge in the range of approximately $45 million to $60 million. The Company is in the process of finalizing the actual amount of the impairment charge, which will be completed prior to reporting its third quarter financial results."06:00CEO CNOOC Ltd names President Xu Keqiang as CEO (152.50 )06:00TRP TC Energy to provide financial update and review strategic plans at Investor Day, reaffirms expectation to grow common share dividend at an annual rate of 8-10% through 2021 (51.44 )"Our $100 billion portfolio of high-quality, long-life energy infrastructure assets are expected to generate record financial results again in 2019 underpinned by strong market fundamentals," said Russ Girling, TC Energy's president and chief executive officer. "Looking forward, we continue to advance $30 billion of commercially secured projects that will expand and extend our asset footprint across North America."As those projects enter service, TC Energy expects comparable earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to exceed $10 billion in 2022. This represents an increase of more than 16 per cent when compared to comparable EBITDA of $8.6 billion in 2018 despite significant asset sales that have accelerated the strengthening of the company's balance sheet. Notably, approximately 95 per cent of comparable EBITDA is expected to come from regulated assets or long-term contracts. At the same time, the company continues to methodically advance more than $20 billion of projects under development including Keystone XL and the Bruce Power life extension program. Success in advancing these and other organic growth opportunities that are expected to emanate from TC Energy's five operating businesses across North America would add to the company's growth outlook."Based on the confidence we have in our business plans, we are reaffirming that we expect to grow our common share dividend at an annual rate of eight to 10 per cent through 2021," added Girling. "Our dividend outlook is supported by expected growth in earnings and cash flow and in line with our historically strong dividend coverage ratios."06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- World markets continue climb higher; US Futures in record territoryThe global equity markets are mostly higher once again with US Futures venturing into all-time high territory for a second straight night.

These utility operations have customers in eight states and expect customer growth to continue at a rate of 1-2% annually. The anticipated investment reflects opportunities to improve the safety and reliability of the company's systems. Also included in the utility's five-year program is the construction of an 88-megawatt simple-cycle, natural gas-fired combustion turbine near Mandan, North Dakota.The capital investment plan at the pipeline and midstream business reflects a focus on organic growth. This includes the Demicks Lake Expansion project under construction in North Dakota, which is expected to be in service in the first quarter of 2020 and as designed will increase capacity by 175 mln cubic feet per day. The North Bakken Expansion project is also included in the capital forecast. As designed, this project in the heart of the Bakken will increase capacity by an estimated 350 mln cubic feet per day and is expected to be in service in late 2021. This business is exploring additional organic growth projects that, if executed, would be incremental to the capital investment plan. Natural gas production continues at record levels in the Bakken, driving the need for additional infrastructure.At the company's construction materials and services businesses, the capital expenditures forecast is focused primarily on organic expansion opportunities, normal equipment and plant replacements and upgrades. Included in the outlined forecast is the development of Knife River's Honey Creek Quarry in Texas, which includes the construction of a rock-crushing plant and the purchase of aggregate railcars. The company expects public sector workload growth as new state and local infrastructure spending initiatives are introduced.16:44ZG Zillow announced that Greg Schwartz, president of media and marketplaces, is stepping down to take a professional break (39.74 +0.23)The businesses that currently report to Schwartz in the Mortgages and Internet, Media and Technology (IMT) segments are being transitioned to other senior executives.

The Russell 2000 (-0.3%) closed in negative territory.The day began with the market digesting a tweet from a China-based CNBC reporter, who said she was informed by a Chinese government source that Beijing is pessimistic about a trade deal because President Trump hasn't supported a tariff rollback. Based on the modest losses and ensuing price action, the market presumably remained optimistic about a Phase One agreement.The large-cap indices eased their way into positive territory thanks to the turnarounds in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (+0.3%), information technology (+0.3%), and communication services (+0.3%) sectors. Consistent leaders included the consumer staples (+0.5%) and real estate (+0.5%) sectors, as the negative-sounding trade headline likely fostered some conservative-minded interest.The trade-sensitive industrials (-0.3%) and materials (-0.2%) sectors were among today's laggards, but their losses were small compared to the 1.3% drop in the energy sector, which was pressured by the decline in oil prices ($57.04, -0.71, -1.2%).Generally, there wasn't any concerted effort to sell a market trading at all-time highs, but investors weren't eager to embrace risk, either. The trend has been positive, which has likely drawn in some reluctant investors into the market, and today simply may have been a natural breather for a market breaking out to new highs.Notable corporate news included HP Inc. (HPQ 20.01, -0.17, -0.8%) turning down the takeover bid from Xerox (XRX 39.30, +0.36, +0.9%). HP remained open to a deal, though. Netflix (NFLX 302.57, +7.54, +2.6%) shares outperformed on speculation that either Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman built a large stake in the company.U.S. Treasuries extended last week's advance, pushing yields slightly lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points to 1.81%.

SPE now owns 100% of the multimedia entertainment company. Following the transaction, the Game Show Network channel will continue to be carried on DIRECTV.The sale is consistent with AT&T's strategy to monetize non-strategic assets as it de-levers its balance sheet and begins to retire shares. Prior to the transaction, SPE owned a 58% stake in Game Show Network, and AT&T owned the remaining 42%. In connection with the transaction, AT&T received approx. $500 mln, including proceeds for its equity stake valued at $380 mln (before transaction-related adjustments) and dividends of approx. $130 mln.

We have had a long relationship with Letko and most certainly appreciate their investment in our Company. Our establishment of domicile in the U.S. was carefully considered.... rationale for the move is crystal clear-we want to expose our Company and all its stockholders to increasingly larger pools of investment in U.S. index funds and passively managed accounts. The change in corporate domicile will not change how we run our day-to-day business, nor diminish the important role our Canadian assets play in our portfolio today. We do not believe that our Canadian investors will be forced to sell beyond the Canadian indices, and we will remain listed on both the TSX and the NYSE. Furthermore, we know that most of our large investors in Canada also own many of our U.S.-domiciled peers today. We deeply believe this move ultimately will be positive for ALL shareholders as exposure to the significantly larger U.S. market and funds is estimated to create more than $1 billion of additional demand for our shares."The change in corporate domicile, the rebrand to Ovintiv, and a previously announced 1 -- for -- 5 consolidation and share exchange require two-thirds of votes cast for shareholder approval.

The retail industry was under pressure following disappointing quarterly results and guidance from Home Depot (HD 225.86, -12.99, -5.4%) and Kohl's (KSS 47.02, -11.38, -19.5%).The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.4%) also finished lower, while the Nasdaq Composite (+0.2%) and Russell 2000 (+0.4%) finished higher. The Nasdaq closed at another record high.The session began with each of the large-cap indices setting intraday highs despite the negative sentiment in the retail space. The early advance quickly faltered but overall losses were modest, and transient, as the S&P 500 only dipped 0.3% below its flat line before buyers quickly stepped in to buy the dip.The retail space didn't benefit from an opportunistic mindset, though, as the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.95, -0.87, -1.9%) finished near its lows like the S&P 500 energy (-1.5%) and consumer discretionary (-1.0%) sectors. Home Depot dragged on the consumer discretionary sector while a 3% drop in WTI crude ($55.21, -1.84, -3.2%) weighed on the energy space.Gains were mainly found in the heavily-weighted S&P 500 health care (+0.7%), information technology (+0.2%), and financials (+0.2%) sectors. The real estate sector (+0.2%) also finished in positive territory.TJX Companies (TJX 60.64, +1.09, +1.8%) was a bright spot among the retailers after it beat top and bottom-line estimates and raised its full-year guidance. TJX likely tempered some concerns about U.S. consumer spending for the holiday shopping season that may have been engendered by Home Depot and Kohl's.Separately, shares of AT&T (T 38.00, -1.63, -4.1%) pulled back 4% after the stock was downgraded to Sell from Neutral at MoffettNathanson. Shares of Slack (WORK 21.18, -1.93, -8.4%) sold off on news that Microsoft's (MSFT 150.39, +0.05, unch) competitive product, Teams, increased daily active users by nearly 50% since July.The U.S. Treasury market was relatively quiet, but demand for longer-dated bonds contributed to some curve-flattening activity. The 2-yr yield was unchanged at 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.79%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 97.85.Tuesday's economic calendar was limited to Housing Starts and Building Permits for October:Total housing starts increased 3.8% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.314 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.300 million) while total building permits increased 5.0% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.461 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.365 million).There was a sizable jump in starts (+8.6%) and permits (+8.2%) for multi-unit dwellings, yet the key takeaway from the report is that starts (+2.0%) and permits (+3.2%) increased for single-family units in an inventory-constrained environment for single-family homes.Looking ahead, the FOMC Minutes from the October 30-31 meeting and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index will be released on Wednesday.Nasdaq Composite +29.2% YTDS&P 500 +24.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +19.8% YTDRussell 2000 +18.5% YTD16:24MGP MGM Growth Properties commences public offering of 24.0 mln Class A shares (32.49 -0.37)The company expects that it will issue and sell 12,000,000 shares directly to the underwriters at closing and that the underwriters will purchase, at the request of the company, 12,000,000 shares from forward purchasers under forward sale agreements.The company plans to use proceeds primarily to repay a portion of the borrowings outstanding under its senior secured term loan A facility and senior secured term loan B facility, which the company believes will well-position it to be able to agree to and consummate a potential JV transaction under discussion with MGM Resorts International and honor any potential redemption of units representing limited partnership units in MGM Growth Properties Operating Partnership LP held by MGM for cash, should MGM elect to exercise any redemption right, if the company decides to pursue such a transaction, or, alternatively, for general corporate purposes.16:24PAGS PagSeguro Digital misses by BRL0.02, misses on revs (36.76 -1.01)Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of BRL 1.18 per share, excluding non-recurring items, BRL 0.02 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of BRL 1.20; revenues rose 30.3% year/year to BRL 1.46 bln vs the BRL 1.5 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Active merchants of 5.0 million, growth of 1.2 million active merchants in the last twelve months; R$29.4 billion in total payment volume, up 45.0% compared with 3Q18;16:20FLNT Fluent authorizes the repurchase of up to $5 mln shares of common stock (1.42 +0.11)16:18MTB M&T Bank increases quarterly cash dividend to $1.10/share from $1.00/share (162.88 -0.09)16:17FIX Comfort Systems increases stock repurchase program (50.40 -0.11)Board of Directors has approved an amendment to the stock repurchase program to increase the shares authorized and remaining as available to purchase back up to 1,000,000 shares by authorizing the Company to acquire up to 764,760 additional shares of its outstanding common stock.16:17AVID Avid Tech at Investor Day guided FY20 adj.

Macy's has guided its fiscal 2020 EPS down 29% at the midpoint to $2.85-3.05, including $0.25 in asset sale gains, with revenue flat yr/yr, comp sales flat to up 1%, and gross margins down slightly. Macy's expects comp sales to improve meaningfully in the fourth quarter, citing a difficult compare in the month of October.The market remains skeptical that the nation's largest department store can generate long-term profit growth given secular challenges.The company's comparable store sales growth has been muted despite the relative strength of consumer spending, which has been supporting the domestic economy.Department stores continue to struggle with lower mall traffic. Last week, the Census Bureau reported core retail sales up 4.2% yr/yr for the three months ending in October, but Department store sales fell 6.1%.With a $4.7 bln market cap, Macy's trades ~6x EPS and ~6x EV/EBITDA, including $3.9 bln in net debt. That represents a slight discount to department store peers. Fortunately, Macy's does have a strong balance sheet, so it can afford to pay its dividend, which yields a robust 9% payout annually.15:15BONDX Treasury Market SummaryLonger Tenors Pad Recent GainsU.S. Treasuries recorded another round of gains on Tuesday, pressuring yields on the 10-yr note and the 30-yr bond into the neighborhood of their respective 50-day moving averages. The Tuesday session bore some resemblance to Monday's affair, as Treasuries started the day with modest losses, recovering them in short order. The early weakness took place after an upbeat start to the European session, which saw the release of strong vehicle registration figures for October. The 10-yr note and the 30-yr bond made it back to their flat lines just minutes after the cash start while shorter tenors also rebounded but took a bit longer before reaching positive territory. Treasuries overtook their morning highs in the early afternoon, remaining near their best levels of the day until the close. The U.S. Dollar Index rose 0.1% to 97.86, snapping a four-day skid. Yield Check: 2-yr: UNCH at 1.59% 3-yr: UNCH at 1.59% 5-yr: UNCH at 1.62% 10-yr: -2 bps to 1.79% 30-yr: -4 bps to 2.26%News: The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow forecast for Q4 GDP was increased to 0.4% from 0.3% following today's housing data.

Italy's September Industrial New Orders increased 1.0% m/m (expected -1.5%; last 0.8%), rising 0.3% yr/yr (expected -3.9%; last -10.4%). September Industrial Sales ticked up 0.2% m/m (expected -0.4%; last -0.3%) but fell 1.6% yr/yr (expected -1.0%; last -2.2%). New car registrations in the eurozone increased 8.7% yr/yr, representing the strongest growth rate in a decade. Car registrations through the first ten months of 2019 are down 0.7% yr/yr. Today's Data: Total housing starts increased 3.8% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.314 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.300 million) while total building permits increased 5.0% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.461 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.365 million). There was a sizable jump in starts (+8.6%) and permits (+8.2%) for multi-unit dwellings, yet the key takeaway from the report is that starts (+2.0%) and permits (+3.2%) increased for single-family units in an inventory-constrained environment for single-family homes.

LOW has reported EPS upside in four of the past five quarters.The CapitalIQ consensus estimate for Q3 EPS is $1.35. The revenue consensus estimate is $17.69 bln. Note: LOW typically guides for revenue, EPS and comps in the press release for the full year. Its current full year guidance is for adjusted EPS of $5.45-5.65 while sales are expected to increase +2%. It'll be important to see if the company reaffirms or changes this guidance. Same store comps are always a key metric for Lowe's. In Q2 (Jul), comps came in at +2.3% and +3.2% for the US home improvement business. Home Depot (HD) is always a key barometer as to what to expect from Lowe's. HD was not super impressive as comps underwhelmed and HD lowered full year guidance. It's not all doom and gloom for Lowe's because HD cited some internal initiatives that are taking longer to materialize, so much of it may be company-specific and not industry-wide problems. Specifically, HD was emphatic on the call that it "sees a strong and engaged customer" and that "housing is healthy and stable." Another area to watch is tariffs. HD said that tariffs are having an impact but are manageable as its merchants have done a good job at mitigating the impact. Aside from the Home Depot angle, another aspect to this earnings report will be progress on Lowe's turnaround. Despite having a similar number of stores, Lowe's is dwarfed by Home Depot (HD) in terms of annual revenue ($72 bln vs $111 bln for HD) and HD holds a sizeable profitability gap. Lowe's wants to improve merchandising availability, to improve its digital presence/app, to increase the use of self-check-out lanes and cut worker hours to boost productivity. It'll be interesting to get an update on its progress. Overall, our sense is that the weak comps/guidance from Home Depot has lowered expectations for Lowe's this quarter. However, with Lowe's, we think investors are more focused on the bigger picture, namely how is the turnaround going.13:42TPX Tempur Sealy Int'l: US ITC determines mattresses from China injure US industry; Department of Commerce will issue antidumping duty order on imports of this product from China (85.44 -1.05)The United States International Trade Commission (USITC) today determined that a U.S. industry is materially injured by reason of imports of mattresses from China that the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) has determined are sold in the United States at less than fair value.

ITC Release13:15ABMD Abiomed says Abiomed medical office is issuing publication review of observational analysis of Impella that was presented by Amin et al. at the American Heart Association Conference on November 17 (186.19 +8.10)According to the company, the AHA analysis is flawed because:The data source has significant limitations, containing just a fraction of Impella patients and unable to delineate between common adverse events.The Impella patients were much sicker and had greater baseline and procedural risks.The analysis excluded the costliest IABP patients who were escalated to other therapies.Additionally, the conclusion is aggressive because administrative coding data cannot delineate between adverse events common to high-risk patients and device related events.13:08SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: ACB (37.93 mln +2.94%), TEVA (22.61 mln +0.97%), BMY (19.42 mln -1.7%), CELG (13.89 mln -0.93%), CLVS (13.81 mln +6.23%)Industrials: GE (17.95 mln -0.6%)Consumer Discretionary: M (32.83 mln -10.04%), ROKU (21.57 mln -1.82%), KSS (19.77 mln -18.61%), NIO (18.01 mln +3.06%), F (17.54 mln -0.28%)Information Technology: AMD (54.78 mln +2.61%), NOK (20.12 mln -0.72%)Financials: BAC (17.88 mln -0.27%)Energy: CHK (55.18 mln -8.31%), ET (13.13 mln -1.99%), ECA (12.04 mln -4.56%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: MDCO (6.75x +19.55%), CRSP (5.7x +16.03%), EDIT (3.67x +11.4%), ATNX (3.12x +34.53%), CELG (2.97x -0.93%), NTLA (2.83x +12.13%)Materials: ASH (3.23x -4.14%)Industrials: WWD (3.27x -0.37%)Consumer Discretionary: KSS (6.3x -18.61%), HD (3.61x -5.23%)Information Technology: JKS (4.05x +12.71%)Financials: EFC (18.2x -3.03%), GBDC (3.31x +1.91%)Consumer Staples: CHEF (3.43x -8.38%)Utilities: DUK (3.42x -1.97%), ELP (3.22x +2.42%)13:06SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: ATNX (15.39 +34.53%), MDCO (70.12 +19.55%), BCRX (2 +17.35%), CRSP (67.92 +16.03%), NTLA (15.25 +12.13%), DRNA (23.87 +11.59%), EDIT (25.79 +11.4%), ARQL (8.4 +10.67%), APHA (4.21 +10.08%), TCDA (37.66 +9.92%), BOLD (28.08 +9.9%), WVE (31.02 +8.58%), TBIO (10.45 +8.52%), ASND (115.61 +8.07%), GLYC (6.18 +8.04%), AMRX (3.05 +7.6%), PRQR (6.71 +7.36%), PRTA (10.99 +7.28%)Information Technology: JKS (16.76 +12.71%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: VAPO (10.77 -7.08%)Industrials: BLDP (6.52 -10.19%)Consumer Discretionary: KSS (47.53 -18.61%), M (15.19 -10.04%), SIG (15.7 -8.61%)Financials: PPDF (2.5 -12.89%), JT (1.86 -10.39%), YRD (5.51 -9.97%)Energy: KLXE (5.44 -26.19%), UNT (0.72 -11.3%), CRC (7.58 -10.67%), ESV (3.82 -8.95%), SPN (0.33 -8.45%), CHK (0.59 -8.31%), EXTN (6.31 -7.82%), TUSK (1.38 -7.38%), PVAC (24.25 -7.35%)Consumer Staples: CHEF (32.57 -8.38%), DF (0.07 -7.5%)12:57WRAPX Midday Market Summary: Stock market trades mixed; Home Depot, Kohl's weigh on retail spaceThe S&P 500 is currently down 0.1% in midday action, with weakness concentrated in the retail space following disappointing quarterly results and guidance from Home Depot (HD 226.39, -12.46, -5.2%) and Kohl's (KSS 47.58, -10.82, -18.5%).The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.4%, but the Nasdaq Composite (+0.2%) and Russell 2000 (+0.4%) trade higher.The underperformance of the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 44.12, -0.71, -1.6%) best displays the negative sentiment that has subsumed the retail industry today. Both the Dow and S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (-0.8%), meanwhile, can attribute their underperformance to Home Depot.The S&P 500 energy sector (-1.1%) is down even more amid a sharp decline in oil prices ($55.69, -1.45, -2.5%), but the market isn't getting concerned about the U.S. consumer based on a couple of reports. Instead, the market is hanging in there amid gains in the heavily-weighted health care (+0.3%), information technology (+0.1%), and financials (+0.1%) sectors.The consensus among many investors is that the market is due for a pullback, but the absence of one has created a sort of pain trade for investors fearful of missing out on further gains. The S&P 500 was down just 0.3% at its low earlier today before a buy-the-dip effort briefly brought it back above its flat line.Separately, shares of AT&T (T 37.65, -1.99) are down 5.0% after the stock was downgraded to Sell from Neutral at MoffettNathanson with a price target of $30. Shares of Slack (WORK 20.88, -2.24, -9.7%) are down 10% on news that Microsoft's (MSFT 150.99, +0.65, +0.4%) competitive product, Teams, has increased daily active users by nearly 50% since July.In the Treasury market, demand for longer-dated bonds has caused some minor curve-flattening activity. The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.79%. The U.S. Dollar Index is flat at 97.79.Today's economic calendar was limited to Housing Starts and Building Permits for October:Total housing starts increased 3.8% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.314 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.300 million) while total building permits increased 5.0% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.461 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.365 million).There was a sizable jump in starts (+8.6%) and permits (+8.2%) for multi-unit dwellings, yet the key takeaway from the report is that starts (+2.0%) and permits (+3.2%) increased for single-family units in an inventory-constrained environment for single-family homes.12:45MRK Merck increases quarterly dividend to $0.61 from $0.55/share (84.21 +0.08)12:25SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Myovant Sciences (MYOV) gains on Phase 3 relugolix data -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersMYOV (10.86 +79.21%): Announced results from the Phase 3 HERO study of once-daily, oral relugolix in men with advanced prostate cancer; the trial met its primary efficacy endpoint and all six key secondary endpoints -- in the primary endpoint responder analysis, 96.7% of men receiving the relugolix regimen achieved sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels through 48 weeks.

Wainwright, citing a positive view of co's new strategic alliance with Novo Nordisk (NVO), which was announced yesterday; the firm views the deal as underscoring a "Burgeoning RNAi Powerhouse." Continued strength sees the stock touch up to new four-year highs.Small Cap LosersI (6.19 -22.91%): Continued weakness following FCC Chairman Ajit Pai's announcement midday yesterday of support for a public auction of 280 megahertz of the C-band spectrum; the C-Band Alliance, a satellite operator group of which co is a member, issued a statement yesterday following the Chairman's communication, noting, among other comments, that the announcement "does not address the critical involvement of the incumbent satellite operators in executing the complex task of reconfiguring and transitioning their networks." Following yesterday's developments, the stock was downgraded to In-Line from Outperform at Evercore ISI, which also cut co's price target to $11 from $38; JPMorgan lowered co's target to $9 from $22. Wells Fargo noted that embrace of a public auction "does not seem to offer much potential capital to the satellite players" and also noted the impact that the public approach will have on timing, saying, "Getting this spectrum auctioned off in 1H 2020 (as the C-Band Alliance plan had outlined) seems naively optimistic at this point." The stock again records new 52-week lows, now down circa 76% month-to-date. PPDF (2.53 -11.85%): Missed estimates for Q3 EPS and revs (+35.0% yr/yr to RMB1.51 bln).

Their weakness has acted as a weight on the broader market, yet the movement of the S&P 500 index has been largely a function of technical price action.Briefing.com's Technical Take page identified 3127 as a secondary resistance level for the S&P 500. That level was tested with the opening move (3127.64) but quickly failed as steady selling eventually dropped the S&P 500 back to 3113.46 at this morning's low, which was reached just before 11:00 a.m. ET. That level fell within a secondary support level (3115/3112) that was also identified on the Technical Take Page.Traders, therefore, appear to be respecting these technical boundaries for now on a day that is devoid of any major macro news drivers, particularly as they relate to trade, and as it is suggested that the market is short-term overextended and due for a pullback.The Russell 2000 is up 0.4%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.3%; the S&P 500 is unchanged; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.4%.11:51QCOM Qualcomm issues 3 year targets at Analyst Day (88.73 -1.78)From CFO's presentation at Analyst Day:3 year targets as earnings mix shift to QCT from QTLRevenue: QCT segment SAM: 10% CAGR, grow faster than SAM and Apple product revenues QTL: current run rate + Huawei resolution Operating margin: QCT grows to >20%; QTL: ~70%Summarizing Qualcomm opportunities: Mature handset industry and current macroeconomic environment; Accelerated 5G migration compared to 4G; Mobile handset platform: 4G->5G transition, RF Front-End growth; Growth beyond mobile: Auto, IoT, Compute, ADAS, Cloud/Edge AI 75+ 5G licenses including key anchor agreements.Grow earnings faster than revenues.

The ACHIEVE II trial evaluated ubrogepant 50 mg and 25 mg, compared with placebo, across a wide range of clinical endpoints, including the co-primary endpoints of pain freedom (no pain) and freedom from the most bothersome migraine-associated symptom at two hours post-initial dose. For the two co-primary endpoints, ubrogepant 50 mg and 25 mg showed statistically significant higher response rates for pain freedom at two hours (21.8% for 50 mg, 20.7% for 25 mg and 14.3% for placebo), and the 50 mg dose demonstrated statistically significant higher response rates for the freedom from the most bothersome migraine-associated symptom at two hours (38.9% for 50 mg and 27.4% for placebo). Additionally, ubrogepant 50 mg was statistically superior to placebo in the absence of light sensitivity (43.8% for 50 mg and 35.5% for placebo) and sound sensitivity (54.1% for 50 mg and 46.3% for placebo).FDA action on the NDA for ubrogepant is expected in December 2019, potentially making it the first oral CGRP to address unmet patient needs in acute treatment of migraine and the first FDA-approved gepant.11:21XLE Sector Briefing: Energy (58.71 -0.65)The energy sector (-1.1%) sits at the bottom of today's sector standings after showing relative weakness yesterday. The growth-sensitive sector is now down 2.4% since Friday versus a much more modest 0.1% week-to-date downtick in the S&P 500. Factors contributing to the underperformance:Notable pressure on crude oil. The energy component is down more than $1.00 today (-2.3%) and down $2.01 (-3.5%) since Friday's settlement. This has sent the price of oil beneath its 200-day moving average (57.37) with the 50-day average (55.65) looming just below. Tax-loss related selling. The energy sector has been the weakest performer of 2019, meaning the group contains a fair share of names that have underperformed since the end of 2018. These names are more likely to be sold before the end of 2019 as investors look to reduce some of the tax impact of taking capital gains this year.Notable movers:HollyFrontier (HFC 51.56, -2.35, -4.4%): falling to its lowest level since early October. The company announced a new project and a new buyback authorization yesterday morning. Noble Energy (NBL 19.41, -0.51, -2.6%): nearing its 2019 low after finding resistance at its 50-day moving average (21.34) at the end of last week.

ConocoPhillips (COP 57.26, +0.56, +1.0%): best performing sector component, reclaiming its 50-day moving average (57.03). The company is hosting its analyst & investor meeting today, where it is expected to reaffirm its commitment to a strategy unveiled in 2016.10:35OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:DO Jan20 5 calls are seeing interest with 4230 contracts trading vs. open int of 0, pushing implied vol up around 10 points to ~87%.

That corner is the retail industry, which has been broadsided today by disappointing earnings/sales results and guidance from Home Depot (HD 226.60, -12.25, -5.1%) and Kohl's (KSS 48.09, -10.31, -17.7%).The weakness in HD is having an outsized impact on the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (-0.9%); meanwhile, the combined impact of the disappointments from these well-known retailers is creating some angst about consumer spending activity entering the all-important holiday selling season.That angst is showing up in a sympathy trade that has knocked down the prices of many other retail stocks today, like Macy's (M 15.36, -1.51, -9.0%), Best Buy (BBY 75.61, -1.68, -2.2%), and Gap (GPS 16.62, -0.68, -3.9%) to name a few. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.97, -0.85, -1.9%) reflects the broader trend of underperformance for the retailers in today's market action.Those issues notwithstanding, the broader market is still holding up just fine as it is drawing influential support from the information technology (+0.3%), healthcare (+0.3%), and financial (+0.2%) sectors, which continue to attract interest from value and growth-minded investors alike.Separately, the market's overall resilience to selling pressure remains a tying factor for a number of participants who are fearful of missing out on further gains. That fear, ostensibly, is lending some buying support that has kept downside pressure in check.The Russell 2000 is up 0.2%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.1%; the S&P 500 is down 0.1%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%.10:00XLY Sector Briefing: Consumer Discretionary (120.74 -1.05)The consumer discretionary sector (-0.8%) represents an early pocket of relative weakness in a flat market. This makes for a continuation of this month's underperformance, which has the sector trading down 0.3% since the end of October versus a 2.8% gain in the S&P 500. Factors contributing to today's underperformance:Home Depot's (HD 227.72, -11.13, -4.7%) Q3 earnings report, which showed lower than expected revenue and lowered comparable sales guidance for FY20. Granted, Home Depot met Q3 EPS expectations, but the revenue shortfall and lowered comparable sales guidance have pressured the stock from a record high. Furthermore, the outlook is leading to some questions about the overall strength of consumer spending. Disappointing Q3 results and lowered FY20 guidance from Kohl's (KSS 48.86, -9.54, -16.4%), fueling worries that other apparel retailers could also report underwhelming results.Notable movers:Home Depot (HD 227.72, -11.13, -4.7%): falling back below its 50-day moving average (232.37) after setting a fresh record high on Monday. Kohl's (KSS 48.86, -9.54, -16.4%): falling to its lowest level in more than a month in response to weaker than expected quarterly results. Macy's (M 15.35, -1.53, -9.0%): sliding back below its 50-day moving average (15.76) after weak results from Kohl's. Nordstrom (JWN 35.10, -2.78, -7.3%): falling below its 200-day moving average (36.33) and toward its 50-day moving average (34.94) in sympathy with Kohl's. Gap (GPS 16.70, -0.60, -3.4%): approaching its October low after Kohl's disappointing results. TJX (TJX 60.68, +1.13, +1.9%): touched a fresh record after better than expected Q3 results overshadowed below-consensus Q4 EPS guidance. Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL 119.72, +1.32, +1.1%): bucking the overall trend in the sector.09:46SCANX Earnings mvoersJKS +13.79% WUBA +7.04% NJR +3.91% CRMT +3.57% TJX +2.82% DAVA +2.24% ASND +2.07% ESE +1.57%KSS -15.96% PPDF -7.14% HD -5.30% ASH -4.63% MMS -2.59% BILI -2.32% WWD -2.00% ZTO -1.29% KRNT -1.30% TDG -0.78% ALV -0.56% MDT -0.36%09:41WRAPX Opening Market Summary: Stock market opens slightly higher, retail dragsThe major indices open slightly higher at new all-time highs. The S&P 500 is up 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.3%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows financials (+0.4%) and information technology (+0.3%) leading the early advance. Conversely, the utilities (-0.6%) and consumer discretionary (-0.4%) sectors underperform, with the latter pressured by Home Depot (HD 228.90, -9.94, -4.2%) following its earnings results and guidance.The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 44.37, -0.45, -1.0%) is being dragged lower by shares of Kohl's (KSS 49.48, -8.86, -15.1%) after the company missed earnings estimates and lowered its FY20 EPS below consensus.U.S. Treasuries are little changed.

In the primary endpoint responder analysis, 96.7% (95% CI: 94.9%, 97.9%) of men receiving once-daily, oral relugolix achieved sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels. A responder was defined as achieving and maintaining testosterone suppression to less than or equal to 50 ng/dL from Week 5 through Week 48. For the study to be successful, the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of the response rate had to be at least 90%.The study achieved all six key secondary endpoints, including superiority to leuprolide acetate on rapid suppression of testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA), all with p-values <0.0001.Five key secondary endpoints demonstrated superiority to leuprolide acetate, including rapid suppression of testosterone at Day 4 and Day 15, profound suppression of testosterone at Day 15, rapid suppression of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at Day 15, and suppression of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) at Week 24 (all p-values <0.0001). In addition, relugolix demonstrated non-inferiority to leuprolide acetate on sustained testosterone suppression through 48 weeks (96.7% vs. 88.8%, respectively) with a between-group difference of 7.9% (95% CI: 4.1%,11.8%), the primary endpoint required for regulatory submissions outside of the U.S. In addition, the pharmacodynamic results showed no testosterone flare after initiation of relugolix and mean testosterone levels returned to normal levels within 90 days after treatment discontinuation.A New Drug Application (NDA) submission is expected in the second quarter of 2020.A conference call and webcast are to be held today at 8:30 a.m. EST / 5:30 a.m. PST.07:32SRRK Scholar Rock announces preliminary pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic results from the TOPAZ Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial of SRK-015 for the treatment of patients with spinal muscular atrophy (7.20 )The planned preliminary PK/PD analysis, which includes data from 29 patients with SMA across all three cohorts, showed dose-proportional drug exposure and demonstrated target engagement, as evidenced by dose-dependent increases of up to 100-fold in the serum levels of latent myostatin following SRK-015 treatment (2 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg doses).

Khoury, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of KLX Energy Services commented, "Contemporaneously with the abrupt decline in activity, we took steps to align our business with current customer demand. Specifically, we implemented an approximate 17 percent reduction in force, as compared with the Company's July 31, 2019 staffing levels, consistent with the approximate 18 percent sequential quarterly decline in our third quarter revenues. We aggressively cut costs in every area of our business, and we warm stacked the vast majority of our Permian based wireline assets. As a result of these and other measures, we expect to take a third quarter charge of approximately $13 million. Notwithstanding the precipitous decline in industry conditions, we generated approximately $44 million in cash flow from operations and approximately $31 million in free cash flow, bringing our cash balance to approximately $121 million for the quarter ended October 31, 2019. In addition, our $100 million credit facility remains undrawn.""The abrupt deterioration in industry conditions, which accelerated through the end of our third quarter, was driven by a sharp sequential quarterly decline in U.S. land rig count and an unprecedented decline in active frac spreads from the second quarter to the third quarter. In fact, there was a significant sequential decline in hydraulic fracturing activity during each month of the third quarter. The decline in Exploration & Production activity resulted in lower demand levels and lower current and expected revenues for our business, which led the Company to accelerate its annual testing for asset impairment into the third quarter. While the Company has not yet completed this analysis, we expect to report a non-cash asset impairment charge in the range of approximately $45 million to $60 million. The Company is in the process of finalizing the actual amount of the impairment charge, which will be completed prior to reporting its third quarter financial results."06:00CEO CNOOC Ltd names President Xu Keqiang as CEO (152.50 )06:00TRP TC Energy to provide financial update and review strategic plans at Investor Day, reaffirms expectation to grow common share dividend at an annual rate of 8-10% through 2021 (51.44 )"Our $100 billion portfolio of high-quality, long-life energy infrastructure assets are expected to generate record financial results again in 2019 underpinned by strong market fundamentals," said Russ Girling, TC Energy's president and chief executive officer. "Looking forward, we continue to advance $30 billion of commercially secured projects that will expand and extend our asset footprint across North America."As those projects enter service, TC Energy expects comparable earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to exceed $10 billion in 2022. This represents an increase of more than 16 per cent when compared to comparable EBITDA of $8.6 billion in 2018 despite significant asset sales that have accelerated the strengthening of the company's balance sheet. Notably, approximately 95 per cent of comparable EBITDA is expected to come from regulated assets or long-term contracts. At the same time, the company continues to methodically advance more than $20 billion of projects under development including Keystone XL and the Bruce Power life extension program. Success in advancing these and other organic growth opportunities that are expected to emanate from TC Energy's five operating businesses across North America would add to the company's growth outlook."Based on the confidence we have in our business plans, we are reaffirming that we expect to grow our common share dividend at an annual rate of eight to 10 per cent through 2021," added Girling. "Our dividend outlook is supported by expected growth in earnings and cash flow and in line with our historically strong dividend coverage ratios."06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- World markets continue climb higher; US Futures in record territoryThe global equity markets are mostly higher once again with US Futures venturing into all-time high territory for a second straight night.

The Russell 2000 (-0.3%) closed in negative territory.The day began with the market digesting a tweet from a China-based CNBC reporter, who said she was informed by a Chinese government source that Beijing is pessimistic about a trade deal because President Trump hasn't supported a tariff rollback. Based on the modest losses and ensuing price action, the market presumably remained optimistic about a Phase One agreement.The large-cap indices eased their way into positive territory thanks to the turnarounds in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (+0.3%), information technology (+0.3%), and communication services (+0.3%) sectors. Consistent leaders included the consumer staples (+0.5%) and real estate (+0.5%) sectors, as the negative-sounding trade headline likely fostered some conservative-minded interest.The trade-sensitive industrials (-0.3%) and materials (-0.2%) sectors were among today's laggards, but their losses were small compared to the 1.3% drop in the energy sector, which was pressured by the decline in oil prices ($57.04, -0.71, -1.2%).Generally, there wasn't any concerted effort to sell a market trading at all-time highs, but investors weren't eager to embrace risk, either. The trend has been positive, which has likely drawn in some reluctant investors into the market, and today simply may have been a natural breather for a market breaking out to new highs.Notable corporate news included HP Inc. (HPQ 20.01, -0.17, -0.8%) turning down the takeover bid from Xerox (XRX 39.30, +0.36, +0.9%). HP remained open to a deal, though. Netflix (NFLX 302.57, +7.54, +2.6%) shares outperformed on speculation that either Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman built a large stake in the company.U.S. Treasuries extended last week's advance, pushing yields slightly lower across the curve.

Hong Kong gears up for lunchtime rallies after weekend unrestStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeDecember 2, 2019 MondayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: WORLD NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 619 wordsByline: Steven ClarkeBody"In response to the unreasonable behavior of the USA side, the Chinese government has chose to suspend reviewing the applications for United States warships to go to Hong Kong for (rest and) recuperation as of today", foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a regular press briefing.In a statement, police said they deployed minimum necessary force, including tear gas to stop protesters' illegal acts."There are still five demands", he said, referring to protesters' calls that include an independent inquiry into police behavior and the implementation of universal suffrage.Major protests are rare in China, where the ruling Chinese Communist Party has little tolerance for dissent.Attention is focused on how theHong Kong government will deal with the situation."If we don't walk out, the government will say it's just a youth issue".Shops and businesses in Tsim Sha Tsui closed early as police sprayed volleys of tear gas at demonstrators, including some elderly residents and others with their pets, as they marched past the city's Kowloon waterfront, home to luxury hotels and shopping malls. Her government has accepted one demand - withdrawing extradition legislation that could have sent suspects to mainland China for trial - but not the others.China suspended U.S. warship visits and sanctioned American NGOs on Monday in retaliation for the passage of a bill backing pro-democracy protesters inHong Kong.Elaine Wong, an office worker, called the recent election an empty victory. "I came today because I want the government to know that we are not happy with what they have done to our generation", said Ponn, who attended with her daughter and son-in-law. It has been one of key demands of pro-democracy demonstrations that have roiled the territory since June.Black Friday kicks off with $4.2B Thanksgiving online shopping feastAttention in the USA shifted Friday to malls, where traffic has been on decline with the increasing popularity of online shopping. That's different from a year ago when Black Friday and Thanksgiving drew the majority of the crowds for the period.Some held banners reading "President Trump, please liberateHong Kong" and "Let's makeHong Kong great again" - a riff on his 2016 campaign pledge to make America great again.Earlier on Sunday, hundreds of protesters waved American flags, with some donning Donald Trump logo hats and t-shirts, as they unfurled a banner depicting the USA president standing astride a tank with a US flag behind him. One showed him standing atop a tank with "Trump" emblazoned on the front and side.As Breitbart News reported, some draped themselves in US flags and expressed gratitude for the Trump administration's support.A peaceful crowd of about 200 adults and young children marched to government headquarters in the morning and chanted "No more tear gas"."A lot of parents are anxious that their children are affected, because their children are coughing, breaking out in rashes and so forth", said social worker and march organizer Leo Kong."I appeal the government to take important confidence-building measures, including a proper independent and impartial judge-led investigation into reports of excessive use of force by the police", Bachelet wrote in an opinion piece in the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post newspaper on Saturday.She also said that Ms Lam's Government must prioritise "meaningful, inclusive" dialogue to resolve the crisis.On Saturday,Hong Kong's chief secretary said officials will not investigate police brutality, but they will develop a commission to restore the region's peace and order.It said Ms Bachelet made "inappropriate comments" and the Chinese side had lodged a strong protest in response.Load-Date: December 2, 2019End of Document

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.2%, while the Russell 2000 is down 0.1%.It's been a modest advance on this day after Christmas, with investors waking up to positive holiday sales figures. For the period Nov. 1 through Dec. 24, retail sales, excluding autos, increased 3.4% yr/yr while online sales rose 18.8%, according to MasterCard Spending Pulse.Amazon (AMZN 1846.30, +57.44, +3.2%) reportedly said it had another record-breaking holiday season, and the positive reaction to the news is contributing to the outperformance of the S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (+0.9%). UPS (UPS 118.96, +0.63, +0.5%), however, is expecting to process a record 1.9 million returns by Jan. 2.Mega-cap stocks like Apple (AAPL 288.21, +3.94, +1.4%), Facebook (FB 206.94, +1.81, +0.9%), and JPMorgan Chase (JPM 138.78, +1.20, +0.9%) provide further support for the broader market, while the S&P 500 health care (-0.2%), industrials (-0.2%), and materials (unch) sectors struggle to keep pace.Positive sentiment is carrying stocks higher in a lighter-volume day, but some profit-taking appeared to knock the broader market from session highs after the Nasdaq hit the 9000 level. In this context, "knock" translates to about four points in the S&P 500.U.S. Treasuries are holding steady, with the benchmark 10-yr yield unchanged at 97.53. WTI crude ($61.67/bbl, +0.56, +0.9%) and gold futures ($1514.00/ozt, +9.40, +0.6%) are both up, while the U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% to 97.54.Reviewing today's economic data, which included the weekly reports for jobless claims and mortgage applications.Initial claims for the week ending December 21 decreased by 13,000 to 222,000, as expected. Continuing claims for the week ending December 14 decreased by 6,000 to 1.719 million.The key takeaway from the report is that initial claims have picked up some from the cyclical bottom, but remain at a level that is still indicative of a tight labor market.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications declined 5.3% following a 5.0% decline in the prior week. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1600/1216. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1571/1459.12:25 ETDow +42.89 at 28558.25, Nasdaq +39.55 at 8992.45, S&P +8.08 at 3231.46[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.3%, but the broader market appears to have run into some profit-taking interest after the Nasdaq Composite hit 9000 earlier in the session.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows Amazon (AMZN 1842.24, +52.98, +3.0%) now up 3% after its record-breaking holiday season. Following suit are Apple (AAPL 288.09, +3.82, +1.3%), Facebook (FB 206.73, +1.61, +0.8%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1350.65, +7.09, +0.5%). Netflix (NFLX 332.68, -0.62) is down 0.2%.Separately, Netherlands-based company Qiagen (QGEN 32.24, -9.23, -22.3%) is down 22% after the company said it's not accepting any acquisition bids, squashing the speculative excitement over the last six weeks.11:55 ETDow +62.90 at 28578.26, Nasdaq +46.60 at 8999.5, S&P +10.25 at 3233.63[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade in record territory with a gain of 0.3%. The Nasdaq is also in record territory, having recently hit the 9000 level for the first time.WTI crude is up another 1.0% to $61.68/bbl today, climbing to its best level since September. The commodity has been supported by a positive economic growth outlook and OPEC+ efforts to keep supply in check. The S&P 500 energy sector is up 0.5%.Overseas, European markets remained closed for Christmas/Boxing Day.11:25 ETDow +74.19 at 28589.55, Nasdaq +46.25 at 8999.15, S&P +11.36 at 3234.74[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.4% amid gains in nine of its 11 sectors and gains in Apple (APPL 288.31, +4.05, +1.4%), Amazon (AMZN 1830.92, +41.71, +2.3%), and Facebook (FB 207.09, +1.97, +1.0%).In the semiconductor space, 13 of the 30 components in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (+0.2%) have set new 52-week, or all-time, highs today. Marvell (MRVL 26.83, +0.28, +1.0%) is a notable outperformer with a 1.0% gain.Interestingly, gold ($1514.90, +10.10, +0.7%) and silver ($18.06, +0.20, +1.1%) futures are outperforming the broader market today. The benchmark 10-yr yield is unchanged at 1.91%.

Other positive news include a U.S.-China trade agreement reportedly close to being signed and China increasing its U.S. soybean purchases in November.On a related note, UPS (UPS 118.81, +0.48, +0.4%) is expecting to process a record 1.9 million returns by Jan. 2, up from 26% from the prior year. This will mark a seventh consecutive record.10:25 ETDow +46.45 at 28561.81, Nasdaq +35.54 at 8988.44, S&P +8.92 at 3232.3[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades near session highs with a 0.3% gain. Today coincides with the start of a calendar event known as the Santa Claus Rally, which typically ends after the first two days of January.The average return for S&P 500 during this period is 1.3% since 1950, according to The Stock Traders Almanac. The positive sentiment in the market amid an absence of negative news is helping the market get off to a good start.Shares of Apple (AAPL 286.58, +2.31, +0.8%) remain undisturbed, with the stock now up 81.5% this year.09:55 ETDow +50.14 at 28565.5, Nasdaq +30.68 at 8983.58, S&P +7.65 at 3231.03[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.2%, and the Russell 2000 is up 0.1%.Shares of Amazon (AMZN 1812.88, +23.94) are up 1.3% after it said its holiday season was "record breaking," with billions of items ordered worldwide and tens of millions of Amazon Devices purchased. The consumer discretionary sector (+0.5%) can credit its outperformance to Amazon.On a related note, online sales were up 18.8% from Nov. 1 through Dec. 24, according to MasterCard Spending Pulse.09:40 ETDow +29.63 at 28544.99, Nasdaq +17.86 at 8970.76, S&P +5.95 at 3229.33[BRIEFING.COM] The major indices begin the session on a higher note. The S&P 500 is up 0.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.1%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows the energy (+0.5%) and consumer discretionary (+0.5%) sectors leading the modest advance. Conversely, the health care (-0.1%) and utilities (unch) sectors are today's early laggards.U.S. Treasuries trade near their unchanged marks. The 2-yr yield is down two basis point to 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.90%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 97.61.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +18.60.U.S. futures point to another flat start on Wall Street, with the S&P 500 futures trading four points, or 0.1%, above fair value.The muted price action in the futures trade could be attributed to it being the day after Christmas (some market participants may still be sleeping or away from their desks) and the lack of "new" news this morning.Regarding the holiday shopping season, MasterCard Spending Pulse confirmed a Wall Street Journal report indicating that retail sales, excluding autos, increased 3.4% from Nov. 1 through Dec. 24.

UPS (UPS 118.96, +0.63, +0.5%), however, is expecting to process a record 1.9 million returns by Jan. 2.Mega-cap stocks like Apple (AAPL 288.21, +3.94, +1.4%), Facebook (FB 206.94, +1.81, +0.9%), and JPMorgan Chase (JPM 138.78, +1.20, +0.9%) provide further support for the broader market, while the S&P 500 health care (-0.2%), industrials (-0.2%), and materials (unch) sectors struggle to keep pace.Positive sentiment is carrying stocks higher in a lighter-volume day, but some profit taking appeared to knock the broader market from session highs after the Nasdaq hit the 9000 level. In this context, "knock" translates to about four points in the S&P 500.U.S. Treasuries are holding steady, with the benchmark 10-yr yield unchanged at 1.91%.

Following suit are Apple (AAPL 288.09, +3.82, +1.3%), Facebook (FB 206.73, +1.61, +0.8%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1350.65, +7.09, +0.5%). Netflix (NFLX 332.68, -0.62) is down 0.2%.Separately, Netherlands-based company Qiagen (QGEN 32.24, -9.23, -22.3%) is down 22% after the company said it's not accepting any acquisition bids, squashing the speculative excitement over the last six weeks.11:55 ETDow +62.90 at 28578.26, Nasdaq +46.60 at 8999.5, S&P +10.25 at 3233.63[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade in record territory with a gain of 0.3%. The Nasdaq is also in record territory, having recently hit the 9000 level for the first time.WTI crude is up another 1.0% to $61.68/bbl today, climbing to its best level since September. The commodity has been supported by a positive economic growth outlook and OPEC+ efforts to keep supply in check.

Other positive news include a U.S.-China trade agreement reportedly close to being signed and China increasing its U.S. soybean purchases in November.On a related note, UPS (UPS 118.81, +0.48, +0.4%) is expecting to process a record 1.9 million returns by Jan. 2, up from 26% from the prior year. This will mark a seventh consecutive record.10:25 ETDow +46.45 at 28561.81, Nasdaq +35.54 at 8988.44, S&P +8.92 at 3232.3[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades near session highs with a 0.3% gain. Today coincides with the start of a calendar event known as the Santa Claus Rally, which typically ends after the first two days of January.The average return for S&P 500 during this period is 1.3% since 1950, according to The Stock Traders Almanac.

UPS (UPS 118.96, +0.63, +0.5%), however, is expecting to process a record 1.9 million returns by Jan. 2.Mega-cap stocks like Apple (AAPL 288.21, +3.94, +1.4%), Facebook (FB 206.94, +1.81, +0.9%), and JPMorgan Chase (JPM 138.78, +1.20, +0.9%) provide further support for the broader market, while the S&P 500 health care (-0.2%), industrials (-0.2%), and materials (unch) sectors struggle to keep pace.Positive sentiment is carrying stocks higher in a lighter-volume day, but some profit taking appeared to knock the broader market from session highs after the Nasdaq hit the 9000 level. In this context, "knock" translates to about four points in the S&P 500.U.S. Treasuries are holding steady, with the benchmark 10-yr yield unchanged at 1.91%.

Following suit are Apple (AAPL 288.09, +3.82, +1.3%), Facebook (FB 206.73, +1.61, +0.8%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1350.65, +7.09, +0.5%). Netflix (NFLX 332.68, -0.62) is down 0.2%.Separately, Netherlands-based company Qiagen (QGEN 32.24, -9.23, -22.3%) is down 22% after the company said it's not accepting any acquisition bids, squashing the speculative excitement over the last six weeks.11:55 ETDow +62.90 at 28578.26, Nasdaq +46.60 at 8999.5, S&P +10.25 at 3233.63[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade in record territory with a gain of 0.3%. The Nasdaq is also in record territory, having recently hit the 9000 level for the first time.WTI crude is up another 1.0% to $61.68/bbl today, climbing to its best level since September. The commodity has been supported by a positive economic growth outlook and OPEC+ efforts to keep supply in check.

Other positive news include a U.S.-China trade agreement reportedly close to being signed and China increasing its U.S. soybean purchases in November.On a related note, UPS (UPS 118.81, +0.48, +0.4%) is expecting to process a record 1.9 million returns by Jan. 2, up from 26% from the prior year. This will mark a seventh consecutive record.10:25 ETDow +46.45 at 28561.81, Nasdaq +35.54 at 8988.44, S&P +8.92 at 3232.3[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades near session highs with a 0.3% gain. Today coincides with the start of a calendar event known as the Santa Claus Rally, which typically ends after the first two days of January.The average return for S&P 500 during this period is 1.3% since 1950, according to The Stock Traders Almanac.

In this context, "knock" translates to about four points in the S&P 500.U.S. Treasuries are holding steady, with the benchmark 10-yr yield unchanged at 1.91%. WTI crude ($61.67/bbl, +0.56, +0.9%) and gold futures ($1514.00/ozt, +9.40, +0.6%) are both up, while the U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% to 97.54.Reviewing today's economic data, which included the weekly reports for jobless claims and mortgage applications.Initial claims for the week ending December 21 decreased by 13,000 to 222,000, as expected.

Other positive news include a U.S.-China trade agreement reportedly close to being signed and China increasing its U.S. soybean purchases in November.On a related note, UPS (UPS 118.81, +0.48, +0.4%) is expecting to process a record 1.9 million returns by Jan. 2, up from 26% from the prior year.

The S&P 500 is up 0.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.1%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows the energy (+0.5%) and consumer discretionary (+0.5%) sectors leading the modest advance.

The S&P 500 (+0.5%) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.4%) also closed at new highs, thanks to some mega-cap leadership and a strong finish into the close. The Russell 2000 finished flat.Amazon's (AMZN 1868.77, +79.56) 4.5% gain stood out after the company said it had another record-breaking holiday season. A separate report from MasterCard SpendingPulse indicated that total retail sales, excluding autos, increased 3.4% yr/yr from Nov. 1 through Dec. 24 while online sales rose 18.8%.It was no surprise, then, to see the S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (+1.4%) as today's sector leader. The communication services (+0.8%) and information technology (+0.7%) sectors followed suit amid solid gains in Apple (AAPL 289.91, +5.64, +2.0%), Alphabet (GOOG 1360.40, +16.84, +1.3%), and Facebook (FB 207.79, +2.67, +1.3%).Conversely, the health care (-0.1%), energy (unch), and consumer staples (+0.1%) sectors underperformed with little changes.Trading volume was relatively light on this day after Christmas, but that didn't detract from the positive sentiment in the market. The holiday sales results, after all, showcased the strength of the U.S. consumer, while reports that the U.S. and China are close to signing a Phase One trade deal kept investors at ease.A tight labor market, as indicated in the latest weekly jobless claims report, may also bode well for continued strength in the consumer.U.S. Treasuries held steady throughout the session. The 2-yr yield was unchanged at 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield declined one basis point to 1.91%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 97.56. WTI crude rose 0.9%, or $0.55, to $61.70/bbl.Reviewing Thursday's economic data, which included the weekly reports for jobless claims and mortgage applications.Initial claims for the week ending December 21 decreased by 13,000 to 222,000, as expected. Continuing claims for the week ending December 14 decreased by 6,000 to 1.719 million.The key takeaway from the report is that initial claims have picked up some from the cyclical bottom, but remain at a level that is still indicative of a tight labor market.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications declined 5.3% following a 5.0% decline in the prior week.Investors will not receive any notable economic data on Friday.Nasdaq Composite +36.0% YTDS&P 500 +29.2% YTDRussell 2000 +24.4% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +22.7% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1757/1092. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1705/1395.15:30 ETDow +47.51 at 28562.87, Nasdaq +52.89 at 9005.79, S&P +9.79 at 3233.17[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades higher by 0.3% and is on pace to close at another record high.One last look inside the S&P 500 shows the consumer discretionary (+1.4%) pulling out ahead as today's outright leader. The communication services sector is up 0.6%, while the health care sector struggles with a 0.3% decline.WTI crude rose $0.55 (+0.9%) to $61.70/bbl -- its best level since September.14:55 ETDow +52.31 at 28567.67, Nasdaq +56.79 at 9009.69, S&P +10.27 at 3233.65[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.3%, while the Russell 2000 is down 0.1%.The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 46.01, +0.29, +0.6%) has emerged as one of today's top-performing groups after a rough midday patch. The upbeat holiday sales reports have stirred buying interest within the retail space.Separately, shares of Peloton (PTON 27.10, -1.65, -5.7%) are down 6% today and are now down more than 25% from its recent all-time high.14:25 ETDow +55.48 at 28570.84, Nasdaq +56.59 at 9009.49, S&P +10.71 at 3234.09[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 still sits in the middle of the standings to this point on Thursday, up 0.33%.Some of the best-performing names in the S&P 500 today include Amazon (AMZN 1,861.32, +72.11, +4.03%), Macy's (M 16.42, +0.30, +1.86%), and Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG 837.19, +8.30, +1.00%).Conversely, Delaware-based biotech firm Incyte (INCY 89.35, -2.08, -2.27%) sits at the bottom of the index.14:00 ETDow +56.44 at 28571.8, Nasdaq +58.84 at 9011.74, S&P +11.28 at 3234.66[BRIEFING.COM] The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite leads the major averages higher into the final two hours of action, at session highs now, up 0.66%.Gold futures settled $9.60 higher (+0.6%) to $1,514.40/oz, adding to their early-week gains as the yellow metal attempts to prolong its advance above the $1500 level.The U.S. Dollar Index holds losses of about 0.1% to 97.52.13:30 ETDow +53.81 at 28569.17, Nasdaq +54.15 at 9007.05, S&P +10.65 at 3234.03[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages haven't shifted much in the last half hour; the Dow Jones Industrial Average is the softest gainer, up 0.19%.The best-performing names in the Dow Jones Industrial Average include financial names JPMorgan Chase (JPM 138.68, +1.10, +0.80%), Visa (V 188.86, +1.29, +0.69%), and Goldman Sachs (GS 230.70, +0.79, +0.34%).Conversely, Boeing (BA 330.54, -2.46, -0.74%) sits at the bottom of the index.The DJIA sits near all-time closing highs, up now about 1.85% on the month.Elsewhere, at the top of the hour, the Treasury's $32 bln 7-year note auction drew a high yield of 1.853% on a bid-to-cover of 2.47.12:55 ETDow +52.45 at 28567.81, Nasdaq +43.47 at 8996.37, S&P +9.12 at 3232.5[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 (+0.3%) and Nasdaq Composite (+0.5%) have set new intraday records today, with the Nasdaq even hitting the 9000 level for the first time. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.2%, while the Russell 2000 is down 0.1%.It's been a modest advance on this day after Christmas, with investors waking up to positive holiday sales figures. For the period Nov. 1 through Dec. 24, retail sales, excluding autos, increased 3.4% yr/yr while online sales rose 18.8%, according to MasterCard Spending Pulse.Amazon (AMZN 1846.30, +57.44, +3.2%) reportedly said it had another record-breaking holiday season, and the positive reaction to the news is contributing to the outperformance of the S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (+0.9%). UPS (UPS 118.96, +0.63, +0.5%), however, is expecting to process a record 1.9 million returns by Jan. 2.Mega-cap stocks like Apple (AAPL 288.21, +3.94, +1.4%), Facebook (FB 206.94, +1.81, +0.9%), and JPMorgan Chase (JPM 138.78, +1.20, +0.9%) provide further support for the broader market, while the S&P 500 health care (-0.2%), industrials (-0.2%), and materials (unch) sectors struggle to keep pace.Positive sentiment is carrying stocks higher in a lighter-volume day, but some profit taking appeared to knock the broader market from session highs after the Nasdaq hit the 9000 level. In this context, "knock" translates to about four points in the S&P 500.U.S. Treasuries are holding steady, with the benchmark 10-yr yield unchanged at 1.91%. WTI crude ($61.67/bbl, +0.56, +0.9%) and gold futures ($1514.00/ozt, +9.40, +0.6%) are both up, while the U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% to 97.54.Reviewing today's economic data, which included the weekly reports for jobless claims and mortgage applications.Initial claims for the week ending December 21 decreased by 13,000 to 222,000, as expected. Continuing claims for the week ending December 14 decreased by 6,000 to 1.719 million.The key takeaway from the report is that initial claims have picked up some from the cyclical bottom, but remain at a level that is still indicative of a tight labor market.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications declined 5.3% following a 5.0% decline in the prior week. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1600/1216. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1571/1459.12:25 ETDow +42.89 at 28558.25, Nasdaq +39.55 at 8992.45, S&P +8.08 at 3231.46[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.3%, but the broader market appears to have run into some profit-taking interest after the Nasdaq Composite hit 9000 earlier in the session.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows Amazon (AMZN 1842.24, +52.98, +3.0%) now up 3% after its record-breaking holiday season. Following suit are Apple (AAPL 288.09, +3.82, +1.3%), Facebook (FB 206.73, +1.61, +0.8%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1350.65, +7.09, +0.5%). Netflix (NFLX 332.68, -0.62) is down 0.2%.Separately, Netherlands-based company Qiagen (QGEN 32.24, -9.23, -22.3%) is down 22% after the company said it's not accepting any acquisition bids, squashing the speculative excitement over the last six weeks.11:55 ETDow +62.90 at 28578.26, Nasdaq +46.60 at 8999.5, S&P +10.25 at 3233.63[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade in record territory with a gain of 0.3%. The Nasdaq is also in record territory, having recently hit the 9000 level for the first time.WTI crude is up another 1.0% to $61.68/bbl today, climbing to its best level since September. The commodity has been supported by a positive economic growth outlook and OPEC+ efforts to keep supply in check. The S&P 500 energy sector is up 0.5%.Overseas, European markets remained closed for Christmas/Boxing Day.11:25 ETDow +74.19 at 28589.55, Nasdaq +46.25 at 8999.15, S&P +11.36 at 3234.74[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.4% amid gains in nine of its 11 sectors and gains in Apple (APPL 288.31, +4.05, +1.4%), Amazon (AMZN 1830.92, +41.71, +2.3%), and Facebook (FB 207.09, +1.97, +1.0%).In the semiconductor space, 13 of the 30 components in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (+0.2%) have set new 52-week, or all-time, highs today. Marvell (MRVL 26.83, +0.28, +1.0%) is a notable outperformer with a 1.0% gain.Interestingly, gold ($1514.90, +10.10, +0.7%) and silver ($18.06, +0.20, +1.1%) futures are outperforming the broader market today. The benchmark 10-yr yield is unchanged at 1.91%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% to 97.57.11:00 ETDow +58.94 at 28574.3, Nasdaq +40.30 at 8993.2, S&P +10.50 at 3233.88[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades higher by 0.3% in a quiet, record-setting advance.There really is no specific catalyst to account for today's gains, other than the continued bullish momentum and some statistical reassurance (holiday sales) that the U.S. consumer remains in good shape. Other positive news include a U.S.-China trade agreement reportedly close to being signed and China increasing its U.S. soybean purchases in November.On a related note, UPS (UPS 118.81, +0.48, +0.4%) is expecting to process a record 1.9 million returns by Jan. 2, up from 26% from the prior year. This will mark a seventh consecutive record.10:25 ETDow +46.45 at 28561.81, Nasdaq +35.54 at 8988.44, S&P +8.92 at 3232.3[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades near session highs with a 0.3% gain. Today coincides with the start of a calendar event known as the Santa Claus Rally, which typically ends after the first two days of January.The average return for S&P 500 during this period is 1.3% since 1950, according to The Stock Traders Almanac. The positive sentiment in the market amid an absence of negative news is helping the market get off to a good start.Shares of Apple (AAPL 286.58, +2.31, +0.8%) remain undisturbed, with the stock now up 81.5% this year.09:55 ETDow +50.14 at 28565.5, Nasdaq +30.68 at 8983.58, S&P +7.65 at 3231.03[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.2%, and the Russell 2000 is up 0.1%.Shares of Amazon (AMZN 1812.88, +23.94) are up 1.3% after it said its holiday season was "record breaking," with billions of items ordered worldwide and tens of millions of Amazon Devices purchased. The consumer discretionary sector (+0.5%) can credit its outperformance to Amazon.On a related note, online sales were up 18.8% from Nov. 1 through Dec. 24, according to MasterCard Spending Pulse.09:40 ETDow +29.63 at 28544.99, Nasdaq +17.86 at 8970.76, S&P +5.95 at 3229.33[BRIEFING.COM] The major indices begin the session on a higher note. The S&P 500 is up 0.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.1%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows the energy (+0.5%) and consumer discretionary (+0.5%) sectors leading the modest advance. Conversely, the health care (-0.1%) and utilities (unch) sectors are today's early laggards.U.S. Treasuries trade near their unchanged marks. The 2-yr yield is down two basis point to 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.90%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 97.61.

The S&P 500 (+0.5%) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.4%) also closed at new highs, thanks to some mega-cap leadership and a strong finish into the close. The Russell 2000 finished flat.Amazon's (AMZN 1868.77, +79.56) 4.5% gain stood out after the company said it had another record-breaking holiday season. A separate report from MasterCard SpendingPulse indicated that total retail sales, excluding autos, increased 3.4% yr/yr from Nov. 1 through Dec. 24 while online sales rose 18.8%.It was no surprise, then, to see the S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (+1.4%) as today's sector leader. The communication services (+0.8%) and information technology (+0.7%) sectors followed suit amid solid gains in Apple (AAPL 289.91, +5.64, +2.0%), Alphabet (GOOG 1360.40, +16.84, +1.3%), and Facebook (FB 207.79, +2.67, +1.3%).Conversely, the health care (-0.1%), energy (unch), and consumer staples (+0.1%) sectors underperformed with little changes.Trading volume was relatively light on this day after Christmas, but that didn't detract from the positive sentiment in the market. The holiday sales results, after all, showcased the strength of the U.S. consumer, while reports that the U.S. and China are close to signing a Phase One trade deal kept investors at ease.A tight labor market, as indicated in the latest weekly jobless claims report, may also bode well for continued strength in the consumer. Specifically, initial claims for the week ending Dec. 21 decreased by 13,000 to 222,000, as expected.U.S. Treasuries held steady throughout the session. The 2-yr yield was unchanged at 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield declined one basis point to 1.91%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 97.56. WTI crude rose 0.9%, or $0.55, to $61.70/bbl.Reviewing Thursday's economic data, which included the weekly reports for jobless claims and mortgage applications.Initial claims for the week ending December 21 decreased by 13,000 to 222,000, as expected. Continuing claims for the week ending December 14 decreased by 6,000 to 1.719 million.The key takeaway from the report is that initial claims have picked up some from the cyclical bottom, but remain at a level that is still indicative of a tight labor market.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications declined 5.3% following a 5.0% decline in the prior week.Investors will not receive any notable economic data on Friday.Nasdaq Composite +36.0% YTDS&P 500 +29.2% YTDRussell 2000 +24.4% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +22.7% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1757/1092. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1705/1395.15:30 ETDow +47.51 at 28562.87, Nasdaq +52.89 at 9005.79, S&P +9.79 at 3233.17[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades higher by 0.3% and is on pace to close at another record high.One last look inside the S&P 500 shows the consumer discretionary (+1.4%) pulling out ahead as today's outright leader. The communication services sector is up 0.6%, while the health care sector struggles with a 0.3% decline.WTI crude rose $0.55 (+0.9%) to $61.70/bbl -- its best level since September.14:55 ETDow +52.31 at 28567.67, Nasdaq +56.79 at 9009.69, S&P +10.27 at 3233.65[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.3%, while the Russell 2000 is down 0.1%.The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 46.01, +0.29, +0.6%) has emerged as one of today's top-performing groups after a rough midday patch. The upbeat holiday sales reports have stirred buying interest within the retail space.Separately, shares of Peloton (PTON 27.10, -1.65, -5.7%) are down 6% today and are now down more than 25% from its recent all-time high.14:25 ETDow +55.48 at 28570.84, Nasdaq +56.59 at 9009.49, S&P +10.71 at 3234.09[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 still sits in the middle of the standings to this point on Thursday, up 0.33%.Some of the best-performing names in the S&P 500 today include Amazon (AMZN 1,861.32, +72.11, +4.03%), Macy's (M 16.42, +0.30, +1.86%), and Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG 837.19, +8.30, +1.00%).Conversely, Delaware-based biotech firm Incyte (INCY 89.35, -2.08, -2.27%) sits at the bottom of the index.14:00 ETDow +56.44 at 28571.8, Nasdaq +58.84 at 9011.74, S&P +11.28 at 3234.66[BRIEFING.COM] The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite leads the major averages higher into the final two hours of action, at session highs now, up 0.66%.Gold futures settled $9.60 higher (+0.6%) to $1,514.40/oz, adding to their early-week gains as the yellow metal attempts to prolong its advance above the $1500 level.The U.S. Dollar Index holds losses of about 0.1% to 97.52.13:30 ETDow +53.81 at 28569.17, Nasdaq +54.15 at 9007.05, S&P +10.65 at 3234.03[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages haven't shifted much in the last half hour; the Dow Jones Industrial Average is the softest gainer, up 0.19%.The best-performing names in the Dow Jones Industrial Average include financial names JPMorgan Chase (JPM 138.68, +1.10, +0.80%), Visa (V 188.86, +1.29, +0.69%), and Goldman Sachs (GS 230.70, +0.79, +0.34%).Conversely, Boeing (BA 330.54, -2.46, -0.74%) sits at the bottom of the index.The DJIA sits near all-time closing highs, up now about 1.85% on the month.Elsewhere, at the top of the hour, the Treasury's $32 bln 7-year note auction drew a high yield of 1.853% on a bid-to-cover of 2.47.12:55 ETDow +52.45 at 28567.81, Nasdaq +43.47 at 8996.37, S&P +9.12 at 3232.5[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 (+0.3%) and Nasdaq Composite (+0.5%) have set new intraday records today, with the Nasdaq even hitting the 9000 level for the first time. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.2%, while the Russell 2000 is down 0.1%.It's been a modest advance on this day after Christmas, with investors waking up to positive holiday sales figures. For the period Nov. 1 through Dec. 24, retail sales, excluding autos, increased 3.4% yr/yr while online sales rose 18.8%, according to MasterCard Spending Pulse.Amazon (AMZN 1846.30, +57.44, +3.2%) reportedly said it had another record-breaking holiday season, and the positive reaction to the news is contributing to the outperformance of the S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (+0.9%). UPS (UPS 118.96, +0.63, +0.5%), however, is expecting to process a record 1.9 million returns by Jan. 2.Mega-cap stocks like Apple (AAPL 288.21, +3.94, +1.4%), Facebook (FB 206.94, +1.81, +0.9%), and JPMorgan Chase (JPM 138.78, +1.20, +0.9%) provide further support for the broader market, while the S&P 500 health care (-0.2%), industrials (-0.2%), and materials (unch) sectors struggle to keep pace.Positive sentiment is carrying stocks higher in a lighter-volume day, but some profit taking appeared to knock the broader market from session highs after the Nasdaq hit the 9000 level. In this context, "knock" translates to about four points in the S&P 500.U.S. Treasuries are holding steady, with the benchmark 10-yr yield unchanged at 1.91%. WTI crude ($61.67/bbl, +0.56, +0.9%) and gold futures ($1514.00/ozt, +9.40, +0.6%) are both up, while the U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% to 97.54.Reviewing today's economic data, which included the weekly reports for jobless claims and mortgage applications.Initial claims for the week ending December 21 decreased by 13,000 to 222,000, as expected.

Following suit are Apple (AAPL 288.09, +3.82, +1.3%), Facebook (FB 206.73, +1.61, +0.8%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1350.65, +7.09, +0.5%). Netflix (NFLX 332.68, -0.62) is down 0.2%.Separately, Netherlands-based company Qiagen (QGEN 32.24, -9.23, -22.3%) is down 22% after the company said it's not accepting any acquisition bids, squashing the speculative excitement over the last six weeks.11:55 ETDow +62.90 at 28578.26, Nasdaq +46.60 at 8999.5, S&P +10.25 at 3233.63[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade in record territory with a gain of 0.3%. The Nasdaq is also in record territory, having recently hit the 9000 level for the first time.WTI crude is up another 1.0% to $61.68/bbl today, climbing to its best level since September. The commodity has been supported by a positive economic growth outlook and OPEC+ efforts to keep supply in check. The S&P 500 energy sector is up 0.5%.Overseas, European markets remained closed for Christmas/Boxing Day.11:25 ETDow +74.19 at 28589.55, Nasdaq +46.25 at 8999.15, S&P +11.36 at 3234.74[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.4% amid gains in nine of its 11 sectors and gains in Apple (APPL 288.31, +4.05, +1.4%), Amazon (AMZN 1830.92, +41.71, +2.3%), and Facebook (FB 207.09, +1.97, +1.0%).In the semiconductor space, 13 of the 30 components in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (+0.2%) have set new 52-week, or all-time, highs today. Marvell (MRVL 26.83, +0.28, +1.0%) is a notable outperformer with a 1.0% gain.Interestingly, gold ($1514.90, +10.10, +0.7%) and silver ($18.06, +0.20, +1.1%) futures are outperforming the broader market today. The benchmark 10-yr yield is unchanged at 1.91%.

Other positive news include a U.S.-China trade agreement reportedly close to being signed and China increasing its U.S. soybean purchases in November.On a related note, UPS (UPS 118.81, +0.48, +0.4%) is expecting to process a record 1.9 million returns by Jan. 2, up from 26% from the prior year. This will mark a seventh consecutive record.10:25 ETDow +46.45 at 28561.81, Nasdaq +35.54 at 8988.44, S&P +8.92 at 3232.3[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades near session highs with a 0.3% gain. Today coincides with the start of a calendar event known as the Santa Claus Rally, which typically ends after the first two days of January.The average return for S&P 500 during this period is 1.3% since 1950, according to The Stock Traders Almanac. The positive sentiment in the market amid an absence of negative news is helping the market get off to a good start.Shares of Apple (AAPL 286.58, +2.31, +0.8%) remain undisturbed, with the stock now up 81.5% this year.09:55 ETDow +50.14 at 28565.5, Nasdaq +30.68 at 8983.58, S&P +7.65 at 3231.03[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.2%, and the Russell 2000 is up 0.1%.Shares of Amazon (AMZN 1812.88, +23.94) are up 1.3% after it said its holiday season was "record breaking," with billions of items ordered worldwide and tens of millions of Amazon Devices purchased. The consumer discretionary sector (+0.5%) can credit its outperformance to Amazon.On a related note, online sales were up 18.8% from Nov. 1 through Dec. 24, according to MasterCard Spending Pulse.09:40 ETDow +29.63 at 28544.99, Nasdaq +17.86 at 8970.76, S&P +5.95 at 3229.33[BRIEFING.COM] The major indices begin the session on a higher note. The S&P 500 is up 0.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.1%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows the energy (+0.5%) and consumer discretionary (+0.5%) sectors leading the modest advance. Conversely, the health care (-0.1%) and utilities (unch) sectors are today's early laggards.U.S. Treasuries trade near their unchanged marks. The 2-yr yield is down two basis point to 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.90%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 97.61.

The S&P 500 (+0.5%) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.4%) also closed at new highs, thanks to some mega-cap leadership and a strong finish into the close. The Russell 2000 finished flat.Amazon's (AMZN 1868.77, +79.56) 4.5% gain stood out after the company said it had another record-breaking holiday season. A separate report from MasterCard SpendingPulse indicated that total retail sales, excluding autos, increased 3.4% yr/yr from Nov. 1 through Dec. 24 while online sales rose 18.8%.It was no surprise, then, to see the S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (+1.4%) as today's sector leader. The communication services (+0.8%) and information technology (+0.7%) sectors followed suit amid solid gains in Apple (AAPL 289.91, +5.64, +2.0%), Alphabet (GOOG 1360.40, +16.84, +1.3%), and Facebook (FB 207.79, +2.67, +1.3%).Conversely, the health care (-0.1%), energy (unch), and consumer staples (+0.1%) sectors underperformed with little changes.Trading volume was relatively light on this day after Christmas, but that didn't detract from the positive sentiment in the market.

The S&P 500 (+0.5%) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.4%) also closed at new highs, thanks to some mega-cap leadership and a strong finish into the close. The Russell 2000 finished flat.Amazon's (AMZN 1868.77, +79.56) 4.5% gain stood out after the company said it had another record-breaking holiday season. A separate report from MasterCard SpendingPulse indicated that total retail sales, excluding autos, increased 3.4% yr/yr from Nov. 1 through Dec. 24 while online sales rose 18.8%.It was no surprise, then, to see the S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (+1.4%) as today's sector leader.

The holiday sales results, after all, showcased the strength of the U.S. consumer, while reports that the U.S. and China are close to signing a Phase One trade deal kept investors at ease.A tight labor market, as indicated in the latest weekly jobless claims report, may also bode well for continued strength in the consumer.U.S. Treasuries held steady throughout the session. The 2-yr yield was unchanged at 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield declined one basis point to 1.91%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 97.56.

The S&P 500 (+0.5%) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.4%) also closed at new highs, thanks to some mega-cap leadership and a strong finish into the close. The Russell 2000 finished flat. Amazon's (AMZN 1868.77, +79.56) 4.5% gain stood out after the company said it had another record-breaking holiday season. A separate report from MasterCard SpendingPulse indicated that total retail sales, excluding autos, increased 3.4% yr/yr from Nov. 1 through Dec. 24 while online sales rose 18.8%. It was no surprise, then, to see the S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (+1.4%) as today's sector leader. The communication services (+0.8%) and information technology (+0.7%) sectors followed suit amid solid gains in Apple (AAPL 289.91, +5.64, +2.0%), Alphabet (GOOG 1360.40, +16.84, +1.3%), and Facebook (FB 207.79, +2.67, +1.3%).Conversely, the health care (-0.1%), energy (unch), and consumer staples (+0.1%) sectors underperformed with little changes.Trading volume was relatively light on this day after Christmas, but that didn't detract from the positive sentiment in the market. The holiday sales results, after all, showcased the strength of the U.S. consumer, while reports that the U.S. and China are close to signing a Phase One trade deal kept investors at ease. A tight labor market, as indicated in the latest weekly jobless claims report, may also bode well for continued strength in the consumer. Specifically, initial claims for the week ending Dec. 21 decreased by 13,000 to 222,000, as expected.U.S. Treasuries held steady throughout the session. The 2-yr yield was unchanged at 1.63%, and the 10-yr yield declined one basis point to 1.91%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 97.56.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.2%, while the Russell 2000 is down 0.1%. It's been a modest advance on this day after Christmas, with investors waking up to positive holiday sales figures. For the period Nov. 1 through Dec. 24, retail sales, excluding autos, increased 3.4% yr/yr while online sales rose 18.8%, according to MasterCard Spending Pulse. Amazon (AMZN 1846.30, +57.44, +3.2%) reportedly said it had another record-breaking holiday season, and the positive reaction to the news is contributing to the outperformance of the S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (+0.9%).

Hong Kong Protesters Hold Tight to 'One Country, Two Systems'The Oberlin Review: Oberlin CollegeDecember 13, 2019 FridayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: OPINIONS; Pg. 1Length: 857 wordsByline: Leo HochbergBody The youngest generation of Hong Kong's citizens has never seen anything like the summer and fall of 2019. Protests that broke out in March of this year in response to a controversial criminal extradition bill have since morphed into a massive, complex, and well-organized civil uprising. Looming over Hong Kong's civilian protest movement is the specter of mainland China, to which Hong Kong was repatriated in 1997 after a century and a half of British colonial rule. Hong Kong has since received special status within China - commonly referred to as "one country, two systems" - allowing the city to maintain a liberal economy, protection from the Chinese Communist Party's influence, and limited participatory democracy.However, as mainland China has grown increasingly aggressive in its national and international policy, it has sought to strip away Hong Kong's special status and absorb the city back under the CCP's authority. In response, the protesters have since made their stance quite clear; Hong Kong is not the same as the rest of China, and protesters would rather ignite a risky revolution than give up the fundamental tenents of their unique political and legislative status.Since initial protests against the extradition bill, Hongkongers have sought to challenge China's growing dominance over the island by internalizing democratic values into most aspects of the movement. Tides of protesters ambulate the city like waves, transferring quickly by metro, springing up in new locations, and rarely collecting in order to maintain the movement's momentum and project a popular, ground-up political image.Hong Kong's citizens have also taken inspiration and critical lessons from the 2014 Hong Kong Occupy movement five years ago, which was largely unsuccessful in its attempts to curb Chinese influence over the disputed city's electoral system in part due to the arrest of prominent activists. The protests of 2019 instead have no publicly recognized leaders. To coordinate action, protesters share possible action plans on social media and the AirDrop function available through iPhones. They then vote on methods of disobedience in massive group polls on messaging apps such as Telegram. Because disobedience is coordinated through democratic votes and person-to-person contact, police are unable to undermine the movement by arresting or targeting specific individuals in order to blunt the movement's capacity to organize.Finally, recent gains in the polls have emboldened Hong Kong's protesters. Citizens voted in November for their local district council representatives, which have comparatively little power and control smaller resource pools for things such as bus stops and district-specific ordinance issues. Protesters arrived at the polls in droves, taking a landslide victory and winning over 90 percent of available district council seats for pro-democracy candidates. While district council members affect little change on the ground, the win provided a welcome symbol of victory for pro-democracy protesters and was regarded as a referendum on China's growing influence over the island.The vestiges of democracy that remain in Hong Kong are worth their weight in gold. If the protesters are to achieve their dream of prompting a politically distinct Hong Kong with a fully integrated one-person, one-vote political system, they will first have to overcome an aggressive and confident Chinese government which opposes participatory democracy at a fundamental level. Moreover, the Hong Kong protesters' political capital around the world will have to withstand the growing onslaught by CCP officials. The protesters have thus far been highly resourceful in sourcing global support through targeted advertising in publications such as The New York Times, but China continues its attempts to delegitimize the protests through claims that they threaten law and order.The CCP will soon be forced to make extremely difficult decisions regarding the fate of Hong Kong's unique democratic concessions. Its last resort would be to deploy the Chinese military garrison stationed in Hong Kong to crush the protests, although CCP leaders appear reluctant to take this course. At the end of the day, regardless of the CCP's ideological opposition to Hong Kong's exceptional status, China still needs Hong Kong, and would be loath to crack down too harshly. The coming months will likely show to what extent China values its complete political homogeneity, and to what extent it is willing to stifle dissent even at severe economic risk.Since their inception earlier this year, the Hong Kong protests have bloomed into one of the most sophisticated and well-organized protest movements of our time. But the movement faces off against a government which wields tactics of political repression unparalleled in the modern world. At stake is the fundamental principles of exceptionalism and democracy that make Hong Kong the city that it is. With the world's eye turned toward China's growing influence, the Hong Kong protest movement stands to test China's resolve in one of the growing global superpower's most crucial hours.Load-Date: December 13, 2019End of Document

Hong Kong protest tensions high among De Anza studentsLa Voz Weekly: De Anza CollegeDecember 4, 2019 WednesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: FEATURES; Pg. 1Length: 613 wordsBodyArmed campus police conducted bag checks at an event about the protests in Hong Kong presented by prominent Umbrella Movement member, Alex Chow Yong-kang.Alan Cheng, De Anza College alumnus who grew up in Hong Kong, believed the security was important."It is necessary." he said. "It is necessary."Students stood divided between those who sided with mainland China, and those who sided with the Hong Kong protesters.Emotions ran high as students crowded outside of the event before it began, with people from both sides of the argument discussing and holding posters with phrases such as "This is not democracy."Jennifer Huang, 19, math major, in tears, said no one is talking about the violence that the protestors are inflicting.Julia Kolman Statistics on Hong Kong Protest"No one knows about that," she said.The Hong Kong protests started in June, over the possible extradition of Hong Kong into mainland China.The latest round of protests still occurring in Hong Kong grew from a proposed amendment to an extradition law that protestors believed would lead to political dissenters facing trial for speaking against the Chinese government.Now, protestors have five demands that include a complete withdrawal of the extradition bill, dual universal suffrage, and withdrawal of criminal charges against protestors.The event included a lecture along with a question and answer period."Many mainland Chinese students have questions, very good questions. As you might know, people from Hong Kong, people from China, they receive information from very different channels and have very different perspectives about the ongoing movement in Hong Kong,"  Chow said.Some students disagreed with how the lecture was presented and the message it was giving."I see the flag and the picture in the lecture. It's very misleading," said Max Chen, a pro-mainlander, 21, economics and business major.But others respected how the presentation was displayed.Rose Zhou Xian Uang Li, 19, computer science major, asks, "Are there any external forces giving financial support to the protestors, and change the original idea of the protest?"Clara Chan, 20, music major, who was born in Hong Kong, said she appreciated that Chow provided a historical perspective."In Hong Kong, we are mainly focused on what is happening now," said Chan.Chow was part of a pro-democracy movement in 2014 that occupied various parts of Hong Kong for 79 days and whose members used umbrellas to defend themselves against police tear gas. Since then, Chow was imprisoned by the Chinese government for seven months.Chow said he is not demanding the independence of Hong Kong from China, but that protestors are trying to advance agreements that were made in the 1980s as Hong Kong transitioned from British rule back to China.It is important to go beyond one's own emotions and think about the emotions that others are feeling, Chow said.Protestors have had incidents of violence, Chow said, but the intention of the movement is a peaceful one. He believed the anger and distrust was a sad development referencing the third point of a new slogan, "Cheer up. Resist. Revenge.""I have students who are like 'I can't sleep, their getting shot and no one is reporting it,'" said Jesus Quintero, English professor.Though the event involved many strong opinions on both sides of the issue, there were no incidents of violence."The students here are the future leaders," Chow said. "You can see many young generation students, they are changing and shaping the world while they are students. No matter if it is an issue of gun control or the environmental crisis, you see many youngsters working for the future they hope to realize."Load-Date: December 4, 2019End of Document

The S&P 500 (+0.2%), Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.2%), and Nasdaq Composite (+0.3%) edge above their flat lines.Chief among today's news is a report that top trade negotiators from the U.S. and China reportedly reached a consensus on how to properly resolve core issues. Tucked behind the trade news are Treasury yields that remain persistently low, a CBOE Volatility Index (11.66, -0.21, -1.8%) that is trading at its lowest level since April, and a speech from Fed Chair Powell last evening that maintained the market's positive view on monetary policy.A flat start for the stock market has transitioned into marginal across the indices. From a sector standpoint, nine of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are up, with the real estate sector (+1.1%) rising above the rest amid another decline in Treasury yields. The benchmark 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.74%.The financials sector (-0.3%) and energy (-0.6%) sectors are the lone holdouts.Retailers remain in focus after Best Buy (BBY 82.74, +8.45, +11.4%), Burlington Stores (BURL 226.83, +18.55, +8.9%), and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS 47.11, +7.68, +19.4%) impressed investors with their results and/or guidance. Fellow retailer Dollar Tree (DLTR 94.07, -18.32, -16.3%), however, has disappointed investors with its results.Separately, shares of Walt Disney (DIS 153.29, +3.60, +2.4%) have climbed to a new all-time high after Consumer Edge Research initiated coverage on the stock with an Overweight rating. The firm sees the stock going to $175 next year, which represents about a 17% upside.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-0.3%) may be struggling after Analog Devices (ADI 114.71, +1.78, +1.6%) missed earnings estimates and provided downside Q1 guidance. Shares of Analog Devices, however, have erased early losses and now trade firmly higher. The broader semiconductor space could be taking a much-needed breather.Reviewing today's batch of economic data, which features the New Home Sales report for October:New home sales in October decreased 0.7% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 733,000 units (Briefing.com consensus 710,000) from an upwardly revised 738,000 (from 701,000) in September. On a yr/yr basis, new home sales were up 31.6%.The key takeaway from the report is that the October showing was better than what meets the eye at first blush given the large, upward revision to the prior month's number.The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for November eased to 125.5 (Briefing.com consensus 126.9) from 125.9 in October, marking the fourth straight monthly retreat.The key takeaway from the report is that consumers continue to remain relatively upbeat about the short-term outlook based in part on income prospects, which should be a support for holiday spending activity.The Advance International Trade in Goods report for October showed a narrowing in the deficit to $66.5 billion from $70.5 billion in September. Advance Retail Inventories were up 0.3% on top of a 0.2% increase in September and Advance Wholesale Inventories increased 0.2% after declining 0.7% in September.The FHFA Housing Price Index for September increased 0.6% following an unrevised 0.2% increase in August.

Sizable M&A activity across several sectors also supported risk sentiment.The Russell 2000 rose 2.1%, climbing past its large-cap peers to close at a 52-week high.Press reports indicated that Chinese government officials called to increase penalties on IP theft, which was interpreted as a move that could help strike a Phase One deal. It should be noted that a separate report from Reuters that suggested a Phase Two deal before the 2020 election is unlikely to be reached did not have a noticeable effect on the market.The S&P 500 information technology sector (+1.4%), which typically outperforms when the prevailing view on trade is positive, led all sectors in gains amid strength in the semiconductor stocks. NVIDIA (NVDA 221.21, +10.32, +4.9%) was a notable gainer after the stock was upgraded to Overweight from Equal Weight at Morgan Stanley. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose 2.4%.The health care (+1.1%) and consumer discretionary (+0.9%) sectors also rose more than the S&P 500, while the utilities sector (-0.4%) was today's lone sector to finish in negative territory.Two of today's M&A deals were ones that were already on the market's radar: Charles Schwab (SCHW 49.31, +1.11, +2.3%) agreed to acquire TD Ameritrade (AMTD 51.78, +3.65, +7.6%) for $26 billion in an all-stock transaction, and LVMH (LVMUY 89.37, +1.98, +2.3%) agreed to acquire Tiffany & Co.

The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield declined one basis point to 1.76%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 98.32.

Fall 2019 Green Fee projects announcedThe Virginia Gazette, WilliamsburgDecember 17, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 The Virginia GazetteDistributed by Tribune Content AgencySection: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWSLength: 1223 wordsByline: Sararose Martin, The Virginia Gazette, WilliamsburgBodyDec. 17--     Dec. 17--The Committee on Sustainability recently awarded fall Green Fee grants for sustainability-related projects at the college.Since its establishment in 2008, the William & Mary Green Fee has funded more than $1.6 million worth of sustainability projects, research, initiatives, events and infrastructure, led by students, faculty and staff, representing different aspects of sustainability on campus.W&M is exploring the sourcing of large scale green energy from local solar farms as an initial step toward carbon neutrality. Further progress will be made with the help of $85,000 of Green Fee funds, dedicated toward consultant services on addressing challenges such as natural gas use in campus buildings. The Climate Action Plan is still under construction with a tentative completion date of fall 2020.This semester's approved projects are:Educational Solar ArrayFarley Hunter, associate director of central utilities, will receive $24,305 to add another on-site solar project to those already under exploration through previous awards. Students will be able to interact with the system through a web portal and awareness campaigns.Sustainability Through ArtCaroline Schlutius, M.S. biology student and advisor Xin Conan-Wu, associate professor of art history will receive $3,000 for a project that aims to pair student artists with students of sustainability to create artwork that can convey concepts around sustainability to the public in a compelling way. The artwork created through this project will be showcased during Earth Week festivities.WMGIC Case CompetitionThe Global Innovation Challenge Team Thomas Liu '22, Nathan Liu '22, Macy Punzalan '20, Hannah Garfinkel '22 and advisor David Trichler, Global Research Institute director of programs and outreach will receive $2,000 to brand the team as the collegiate-level sustainable and international development case competition. The goal is to provide an opportunity for college students to problem solve and innovate sustainable solutions to ongoing global sustainability issues.China's public diplomacy spending in South and Central Asia quantified and evaluatedAidData, a research lab at William & Mary, released new data and analysis capturing the results of China's strategic public diplomacy efforts in 13 countries of South and Central Asia.Based on primary data collection -- through AidData's "TUFF" methodology -- and secondary data synthesis, the quantitative research includes new numbers on China's total investment in financial diplomacy in the region for the period 2000-2017, including all infrastructure investments, humanitarian aid, budget support and debt relief.For the 17 year period, AidData uncovered $126 billion in committed, implemented or completed projects in the SCA region by official Chinese agencies and banks. Of this, some $120 billion is in infrastructure investments."Beijing has ramped up the volume and sophistication of its public diplomacy overtures in the region over time," said Samantha Custer, AidData's director of policy analysis, who led the research team. "But infrastructure as a part of its financial diplomacy dwarfs Beijing's other public diplomacy tools in terms of sheer scale and visibility."Eighty-five percent of infrastructure investments go to new construction projects, and two countries in particular captured half of Beijing's financial diplomacy investments: Pakistan -- an early signatory to the Belt and Road Initiative -- and Kazakhstan. In fact Pakistan received almost six times as much of China's financial largesse over the period as did rival India.To assemble the new dataset, AidData researchers collected information on grants, concessional loans, non-concessional loans from Chinese government agencies, policy banks, state-owned commercial banks and investment funds.Complementing the quantitative data collection, the researchers also interviewed 216 individuals in 145 organizations in six SCA countries, in order to understand how Beijing's public diplomacy efforts are perceived."At the end of the day, citizens appear to be somewhat polarized regarding Beijing's financial diplomacy overtures in their countries," said Siddhartha Ghose, AidData associate director and a co-author of the report. "These activities are associated with both lower approval and disapproval of Chinese government leadership."Forgotten saint sparks professor's curiositySuzanne Hagedorn was poking around Rochester Cathedral in England looking for written information on the obscure Roman Catholic saint William of Perth when she realized something. She found hardly anything, even in the cathedral where William was venerated at a shrine for centuries during the Middle Ages.That was three years ago, and Hagedorn, associate professor of English and affiliated faculty with the Medieval and Renaissance Studies program, has been researching St. William ever since."The thing about England and pilgrimage is that a lot has been lost," Hagedorn said. "The destruction of many saints' shrines occurred as a direct result of the dissolution of the monasteries by Henry VIII at the Protestant Reformation."Hagedorn ran across the peculiar story by accident. In the summer of 2016, the Geoffrey Chaucer specialist took a trip to retrace the route of Chaucer's pilgrims in "The Canterbury Tales" from London to Canterbury as part of preparing for a proposed COLL 300 class that she hopes to offer in 2022.Hagedorn gave a paper on the topic of the "lost saint" William at the Institute for Pilgrimage Studies symposium in November, and she will give a poster presentation on this topic next summer at the New Chaucer Society's congress in Durham, England.VIMS scientist wins national Early Career Leadership AwardMolly Mitchell of the Virginia Institute of Marine Science has earned an Early Career Leadership Award from the US CLIVAR Program for her efforts to develop and share sea-level forecasts and other planning tools with coastal risk managers and emergency responders in Virginia and the mid-Atlantic region.CLIVAR -- for Climate Variability and Predictability -- is the U.S. component of the International CLIVAR Program, one of the four core projects of the United Nations' World Climate Research Programme. US CLIVAR research is supported by five federal agencies: NASA, NOAA, the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy and the Office of Naval Research.Mitchell is one of only nine scientists nationwide to receive the prestigious award, which was presented on Dec. 11 during a Town Hall hosted by US CLIVAR as part of the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco. The meeting is the largest gathering of Earth and space scientists in the world, with more than 28,000 attendees in 2018."It's nice to know that people at the highest levels of this field recognize the excellence that Molly brings to her work, and the promise she holds for future contributions," said Carl Hershner, Mitchell's supervisor as director of the Center for Coastal Resources Management. "It's an acknowledgment both of the work Molly has already done and is poised to do."Items were used from W&M news releases.___ (c)2019 The Virginia Gazette (Williamsburg, Va.)

Licenses for US companies to sell to Huawei expected 'shortly,' says Commerce Secretary Wilbur RossCNN WireNovember 4, 2019 Monday 3:31 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 549 wordsByline: By Clare Duffy, CNN BusinessDateline: NEW YORK (CNN Business) BodyNEW YORK (CNN Business) --  American companies who count Huawei as a customer may soon get a more permanent reprieve from US restrictions on selling to the Chinese tech giant. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told Bloomberg on Sunday that licenses allowing US companies to sell to Huawei "will be forthcoming very shortly." He said his office has received 260 requests for licenses.Huawei has become a pawn in the larger US-China trade war. Ross said on Monday that the United States is engaged in a "long overdue" overhaul of its trade relationship with China. Speaking at an economic summit in Bangkok, Thailand, he said that the two sides "are very far along with phase one," referring to a preliminary trade agreement.Huawei is the world's largest telecommunications company, second largest smartphone maker and a key customer for many US companies. The company says it purchased $11 billion in American products last year.The US Commerce Department in May added Huawei to its Entity List, citing national security concerns. The action barred American companies from selling to Huawei without a license, though some have found limited ways around the restriction. The Commerce Department in August extended the "temporary general license" that has allowed American companies to continue some sales to Huawei, but it is set to expire in mid-November. The Entity List action has hurt sales at a number of Huawei's US suppliers, including chip manufacturers such as Micron and Intel, and software makers like Google. Many of those American sellers to Huawei have spoken out against the policy, saying it could lead to the development of similar products from Chinese companies and threaten American technological dominance.Microsoft President Brad Smith told CNN's Poppy Harlow last month that while he understands the desire to keep Huawei equipment out of the US wireless networks, he disagrees with the decision to restrict sales of US products to the Chinese company. "If somebody from the government believes that Windows on a laptop sold by Huawei would create a national security risk to the United States, then of course that's something that we want to talk about and think hard about. But we don't think that is the case," Smith said, adding that Microsoft had applied for a license. "Right now, there is not a Chinese competitor in the PC operating system space. Is it really in the United States' economic interest to create not only an incentive, but the necessity to go create a Chinese operating system? Because once it's created, it will compete with us around the world," Smith said.US officials have long accused Huawei of working to undermine US national security and foreign policy interests. Ross has previously said that licenses will only be granted for sales of products that do not pose a national security risk. Huawei fiercely denies that is poses any threat to the United States or that it has any connection to the Chinese government.

NATION PLANS TO EXTEND LEAD OVER US IN 6G RACE: EXPERTSStates News ServiceNovember 8, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 918 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: BEIJING, China BodyThe following information was released by the Chinese Academy of Sciences:China likely to lead push for 6G technologyBy already launching research into sixth-generation (6G) technology, China can be expected to extend the country's healthy lead over the US in global 5G into a future world that is increasingly reliant on technology, Chinese experts said on Thursday.The announcement by the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) Wednesday that China was kicking off research into 6G came a few days after the rollout of 5G commercial services in China, the world's largest internet market.Chinese net users responded to the ministry announcement by expressing marvel at the nation's capability and resolve to set its eyes on next-generation technology.The ministry, together with several government departments, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the National Natural Science Foundation of China, held a meeting in Beijing on Sunday to start research on 6G technology, according to a statement posted on its website.Two teams were announced: one consisting of relevant government bodies and the other made up of 37 experts from universities, scientific research institutes and companies.The announcement invited a global spotlight on China's technological achievements, although 6G is already on the agenda of major economies including the US and a slew of technology firms including Chinese tech giant Huawei.Ready for a head start"6G will certainly be a major upgrade in terms of functions and performances including mobile broadband, latency, reliability, intelligence, power consumption and coverage, although 6G is still a concept so far without specific definition and standards," said Tang Xiongyan, chief scientist of the network technology research institute at China Unicom, one of the country's three telecom carriers.Technologies and frameworks should be adopted to boost research and exploration, Tang told the Global Times on Thursday.The system of networks carried by electromagnetic waves is nearing its technical limits, leaving the industry to contemplate what format will enable the next generation of mobile network technology.Xiang Ligang, director-general of the Beijing-based Information Consumption Alliance, predicted that researchers may explore the potential of terahertz waves or integrate space, sea and ground functions into an intelligent network.China's 6G drive, albeit not targeting the US, will inevitably add a new layer of anxiety for a country already haunted by China's rising technological prowess, Chinese industry insiders said.Europe, the US, Japan and South Korea are probably all about to kick off 6G research, Tang noted."When one generation of telecommunication technology is put into commercial use, it is time to carry out research on technologies and standards for the next generation," he said, "This is routine."In a fresh move in late October, Sony, NTT and Intel announced they were forming a 6G partnership.South Korea's LG Electronics announced as early as January that it was embarking on a research and development plan for 6G telecommunications, and in June Samsung Electronics and SK Telecom decided to work together to develop 6G, according to South Korean media reports.European countries have also started 6G research, with the University of Oulu in Finland establishing a 6G center early this year and publishing what it claimed was the world's first 6G white paper in September, outlining the key drivers, research requirements and challenges.Global cooperationLike 5G, 6G research will hinge on open innovation and international cooperation, Tang believed.But Chinese market watchers say the US fancies itself a pioneer in global protectionism, meaning any such global push would not be so easy and would most likely have to be spearheaded by China.Tang predicted the US would reinforce its technological advantage in microelectronics and software, and hope to change the traditional rules of the telecom industry and gain a new edge through subversive technology, ecosystem and business innovation.The US will surely be alert to Chinese 6G, said Xiang, the consumption alliance director-general."The Trump administration is likely to impose more severe sanctions on Chinese tech companies, including Huawei and ZTE, and meanwhile, ban more technology communication or transfer with Chinese companies in an attempt to contain China's 6G technology development," Xiang said.However, US sanctions and technology blocks will not deter China and will help Chinese technology develop more rapidly, he said, citing China's 5G technology as a precursor.Chinese analysts all agreed that China was likely to overtake the US in 6G development.They pointed out the US approach is driven by companies and so cannot attract the best manpower and equipment from all sectors.Meanwhile technology push is based on the comprehensive research of companies, research institutions and other related departments under government guidance "which is surely more competitive," Xiang said.As 6G blurs international borders, the US technological approach of splendid isolation will soon lag behind, experts said.China and the EU with their more open attitudes toward markets and technology will have broader cooperation opportunities, Fu Liang, a Beijing-based telecom industry expert, told the Global Times.Chinese companies such as Huawei have been cooperating with the EU to deepen 5G development, with broader market access for both sides, he noted.

Sizable M&A activity across several sectors also supported risk sentiment.The Russell 2000 rose 2.1%, climbing past its large-cap peers to close at a 52-week high.Press reports indicated that Chinese government officials called to increase penalties on IP theft, which was interpreted as a move that could help strike a Phase One deal. It should be noted that a separate report from Reuters that suggested a Phase Two deal before the 2020 election is unlikely to be reached did not have a noticeable effect on the market.The S&P 500 information technology sector (+1.4%), which typically outperforms when the prevailing view on trade is positive, led all sectors in gains amid strength in the semiconductor stocks. NVIDIA (NVDA 221.21, +10.32, +4.9%) was a notable gainer after the stock was upgraded to Overweight from Equal Weight at Morgan Stanley. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose 2.4%.The health care (+1.1%) and consumer discretionary (+0.9%) sectors also rose more than the S&P 500, while the utilities sector (-0.4%) was today's lone sector to finish in negative territory.Two of today's M&A deals were ones that were already on the market's radar: Charles Schwab (SCHW 49.31, +1.11, +2.3%) agreed to acquire TD Ameritrade (AMTD 51.78, +3.65, +7.6%) for $26 billion in an all-stock transaction, and LVMH (LVMUY 89.37, +1.98, +2.3%) agreed to acquire Tiffany & Co.

The market is still pricing in the completion of this agreement.The benchmark 10-yr yield is down three basis points to 1.73%.10:00 ETDow +43.99 at 28110.37, Nasdaq +13.33 at 8645.81, S&P +4.46 at 3138.1[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is now up 0.2%, while the Russell 2000 is down 0.1%.Just in, New Home Sales in October hit an annualized rate of 733,000, coming in above the Briefing.com consensus of 710,000.

Sizable M&A activity across several sectors also supported risk sentiment.The Russell 2000 rose 2.1%, climbing past its large-cap peers to close at a 52-week high.Press reports indicated that Chinese government officials called to increase penalties on IP theft, which was interpreted as a move that could help strike a Phase One deal. It should be noted that a separate report from Reuters that suggested a Phase Two deal before the 2020 election is unlikely to be reached did not have a noticeable effect on the market.The S&P 500 information technology sector (+1.4%), which typically outperforms when the prevailing view on trade is positive, led all sectors in gains amid strength in the semiconductor stocks. NVIDIA (NVDA 221.21, +10.32, +4.9%) was a notable gainer after the stock was upgraded to Overweight from Equal Weight at Morgan Stanley. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose 2.4%.The health care (+1.1%) and consumer discretionary (+0.9%) sectors also rose more than the S&P 500, while the utilities sector (-0.4%) was today's lone sector to finish in negative territory.Two of today's M&A deals were ones that were already on the market's radar: Charles Schwab (SCHW 49.31, +1.11, +2.3%) agreed to acquire TD Ameritrade (AMTD 51.78, +3.65, +7.6%) for $26 billion in an all-stock transaction, and LVMH (LVMUY 89.37, +1.98, +2.3%) agreed to acquire Tiffany & Co. (TIF 133.25, +7.74, +6.2%) for $16.2 billion in cash.New deals included Novartis (NVS 91.30, +0.82, +0.9%) agreeing to acquire The Medicines Co. (MDCO 83.80, +15.25, +22.3%) for $9.7 billion in cash and eBay (EBAY 35.85, +0.73, +2.1%) agreeing to sell StubHub to Viagogo for $4.05 billion in cash.Strikingly, U.S. Treasuries finished the session on a higher note despite the risk sentiment displayed in the stock market. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield declined one basis point to 1.76%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 98.32. WTI crude increased 0.2%, or $0.10, to $57.98/bbl.Investors did not receive any notable economic data on Monday.

The real estate sector (+0.9%) remains firmly atop the standings amid the decline in Treasury yields.Amazon's (AMZN 1789.50, +15.60, +0.9%) price target was lowered to $2100 from $2500 at Pivotal Research Group, but the stock is outperforming nicely today.

Sizable M&A activity across several sectors also supported risk sentiment.The Russell 2000 rose 2.1%, climbing past its large-cap peers to close at a 52-week high.Press reports indicated that Chinese government officials called to increase penalties on IP theft, which was interpreted as a move that could help strike a Phase One deal. It should be noted that a separate report from Reuters that suggested a Phase Two deal before the 2020 election is unlikely to be reached did not have a noticeable effect on the market.The S&P 500 information technology sector (+1.4%), which typically outperforms when the prevailing view on trade is positive, led all sectors in gains amid strength in the semiconductor stocks. NVIDIA (NVDA 221.21, +10.32, +4.9%) was a notable gainer after the stock was upgraded to Overweight from Equal Weight at Morgan Stanley. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose 2.4%.The health care (+1.1%) and consumer discretionary (+0.9%) sectors also rose more than the S&P 500, while the utilities sector (-0.4%) was today's lone sector to finish in negative territory.Two of today's M&A deals were ones that were already on the market's radar: Charles Schwab (SCHW 49.31, +1.11, +2.3%) agreed to acquire TD Ameritrade (AMTD 51.78, +3.65, +7.6%) for $26 billion in an all-stock transaction, and LVMH (LVMUY 89.37, +1.98, +2.3%) agreed to acquire Tiffany & Co. (TIF 133.25, +7.74, +6.2%) for $16.2 billion in cash.New deals included Novartis (NVS 91.30, +0.82, +0.9%) agreeing to acquire The Medicines Co. (MDCO 83.80, +15.25, +22.3%) for $9.7 billion in cash and eBay (EBAY 35.85, +0.73, +2.1%) agreeing to sell StubHub to Viagogo for $4.05 billion in cash.Strikingly, U.S. Treasuries finished the session on a higher note despite the risk sentiment displayed in the stock market. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield declined one basis point to 1.76%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 98.32.

The real estate sector (+0.9%) remains firmly atop the standings amid the decline in Treasury yields.Amazon's (AMZN 1789.50, +15.60, +0.9%) price target was lowered to $2100 from $2500 at Pivotal Research Group, but the stock is outperforming nicely today.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +1.80.The stock market is headed for a flat start, as the S&P 500 futures trade in-line with fair value. The market has received trade news, earnings reports, and economic data, but none of it is having a meaningful impact on trading this morning.There was a modest advance in the futures trade last evening after a report from China indicated that top trade negotiators held a phone call, but the initial enthusiasm waned upon realization that nothing substantial was included in that report.Notable pre-market moves include earnings-driven gains in Best Buy (BBY 77.35, +3.10, +4.2%) and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS 43.89, +4.46, +11.3%), while Dollar Tree (DLTR 97.48, -14.91, -13.3%) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW 230.40, -19.40, -7.9%) are on the retreat following their reports.Separately, investors received some housing data earlier. The FHFA Housing Price Index for September increased 0.6% following an unrevised 0.2% increase in August.

Xinhua reported that Chinese trade negotiators held a phone call with their U.S. counterparts, agreeing to keep working toward a partial trade deal.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +2.10.The S&P 500 futures trade roughly in-line with fair value after another record-setting day on Wall Street yesterday.

The market, which already expects both sides to talk until a deal is reached, has justifiably tempered its initial enthusiasm but will likely continue to react to trade headlines moving forward.On the data front, investors will receive the Advance reports for International Trade in Goods, Retail Inventories, and Wholesale Inventories at 8:30 a.m. ET, followed by the FHFA Housing Price Index for September and the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for September (Briefing.com consensus 2.6%) at 9:00 a.m. ET.After the open, investors will receive the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for November (Briefing.com consensus 126.9) and the New Home Sales report for October (Briefing.com consensus 710,000) at 10:00 a.m. ET.U.S. Treasuries have extended yesterday's modest advance, pushing yields slightly lower again this morning.

The market has received trade news, earnings reports, and economic data, but none of it is having a meaningful impact on trading this morning.There was a modest advance in the futures trade last evening after a report from China indicated that top trade negotiators held a phone call, but the initial enthusiasm waned upon realization that nothing substantial was included in that report.Notable pre-market moves include earnings-driven gains in Best Buy (BBY 77.35, +3.10, +4.2%) and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS 43.89, +4.46, +11.3%), while Dollar Tree (DLTR 97.48, -14.91, -13.3%) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW 230.40, -19.40, -7.9%) are on the retreat following their reports.Separately, investors received some housing data earlier.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +2.10.The S&P 500 futures trade roughly in-line with fair value after another record-setting day on Wall Street yesterday.

The market, which already expects both sides to talk until a deal is reached, has justifiably tempered its initial enthusiasm but will likely continue to react to trade headlines moving forward.On the data front, investors will receive the Advance reports for International Trade in Goods, Retail Inventories, and Wholesale Inventories at 8:30 a.m. ET, followed by the FHFA Housing Price Index for September and the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for September (Briefing.com consensus 2.6%) at 9:00 a.m. ET.After the open, investors will receive the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for November (Briefing.com consensus 126.9) and the New Home Sales report for October (Briefing.com consensus 710,000) at 10:00 a.m. ET.U.S. Treasuries have extended yesterday's modest advance, pushing yields slightly lower again this morning.

Sizable M&A activity across several sectors also supported risk sentiment.The Russell 2000 rose 2.1%, climbing past its large-cap peers to close at a 52-week high.Press reports indicated that Chinese government officials called to increase penalties on IP theft, which was interpreted as a move that could help strike a Phase One deal. It should be noted that a separate report from Reuters that suggested a Phase Two deal before the 2020 election is unlikely to be reached did not have a noticeable effect on the market.The S&P 500 information technology sector (+1.4%), which typically outperforms when the prevailing view on trade is positive, led all sectors in gains amid strength in the semiconductor stocks. NVIDIA (NVDA 221.21, +10.32, +4.9%) was a notable gainer after the stock was upgraded to Overweight from Equal Weight at Morgan Stanley. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose 2.4%.The health care (+1.1%) and consumer discretionary (+0.9%) sectors also rose more than the S&P 500, while the utilities sector (-0.4%) was today's lone sector to finish in negative territory.Two of today's M&A deals were ones that were already on the market's radar: Charles Schwab (SCHW 49.31, +1.11, +2.3%) agreed to acquire TD Ameritrade (AMTD 51.78, +3.65, +7.6%) for $26 billion in an all-stock transaction, and LVMH (LVMUY 89.37, +1.98, +2.3%) agreed to acquire Tiffany & Co. (TIF 133.25, +7.74, +6.2%) for $16.2 billion in cash.New deals included Novartis (NVS 91.30, +0.82, +0.9%) agreeing to acquire The Medicines Co. (MDCO 83.80, +15.25, +22.3%) for $9.7 billion in cash and eBay (EBAY 35.85, +0.73, +2.1%) agreeing to sell StubHub to Viagogo for $4.05 billion in cash.Strikingly, U.S. Treasuries finished the session on a higher note despite the risk sentiment displayed in the stock market. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield declined one basis point to 1.76%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 98.32.

The semiconductor space may be struggling after Analog Devices (ADI 113.28, +0.35, +0.3%) missed earnings estimates and guided Q1 top and bottom lines below consensus.Overseas, the major European indices closed near their flat lines. Germany's DAX declined 0.1%, UK's FTSE finished flat, and France's CAC increased 0.1%. The Europe Stoxx 600 increased 0.2%.11:25 ETDow +36.88 at 28103.26, Nasdaq +20.81 at 8653.29, S&P +5.37 at 3139.01[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to drift in positive territory, with the S&P 500 up 0.2%, the Dow up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq up 0.2%.Most sectors are up, except for the S&P 500 energy (-0.7%) and financials (-0.4%) sectors, which are succumbing to broad-based losses. The real estate sector (+0.9%) remains firmly atop the standings amid the decline in Treasury yields.Amazon's (AMZN 1789.50, +15.60, +0.9%) price target was lowered to $2100 from $2500 at Pivotal Research Group, but the stock is outperforming nicely today. This new price target still represents a 17% increase from the current price today. The firm is somewhat cautious about AWS margins meaningfully declining and about the introduction of one-day shipping.10:55 ETDow +30.93 at 28097.31, Nasdaq +15.02 at 8647.5, S&P +2.55 at 3136.19[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades higher by 0.1%.

Fellow retailer Dollar Tree (DLTR 96.32, -16.08, -14.3%), on the other hand, has disappointed investors with its results.Elsewhere, shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE 15.99, -1.46, -8.3%) are also on the retreat after the company missed revenue estimates.10:25 ETDow +35.84 at 28102.22, Nasdaq +13.48 at 8645.96, S&P +3.29 at 3136.93[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade higher by 0.1% and recently set another new intraday high.The continued advance in the Treasury market, which is driving yields lower, has reflected a defensive mindset despite the resiliency in the stock market. Equities have had a great run in part due to expectations for a trade deal, but some investors are leaning cautiously with a muted VIX (11.80, -0.07, -0.6%) amid the possibility a deal isn't reached.This isn't to say a deal won't be reached, though. China reported top negotiators had a phone call last evening and agreed to keep talking to resolve core issues in order to get a Phase One deal signed. The market is still pricing in the completion of this agreement.The benchmark 10-yr yield is down three basis points to 1.73%.10:00 ETDow +43.99 at 28110.37, Nasdaq +13.33 at 8645.81, S&P +4.46 at 3138.1[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is now up 0.2%, while the Russell 2000 is down 0.1%.Just in, New Home Sales in October hit an annualized rate of 733,000, coming in above the Briefing.com consensus of 710,000. The September reading was revised to 738,000 (from 701,000).Separately, the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index ticked down to 125.5 in November (Briefing.com consensus 126.9) from a revised 126.1 in October (from 125.9).09:40 ETDow +0.80 at 28067.18, Nasdaq +0.78 at 8633.26, S&P -0.15 at 3133.49[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 (unch), Dow Jones Industrial Average (unch), and Nasdaq Composite (unch) open the session little changed after each closed at record highs yesterday.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows nine of the 11 sectors trading within 0.3% of their flat lines. The energy sector (-0.4%) is today's early laggard despite the higher oil prices ($58.41, +0.40, +0.7%), while the real estate sector (+0.4%) outperforms.U.S. Treasuries have edged higher, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.74%.

Sizable M&A activity across several sectors also supported risk sentiment.The Russell 2000 rose 2.1%, climbing past its large-cap peers to close at a 52-week high.Press reports indicated that Chinese government officials called to increase penalties on IP theft, which was interpreted as a move that could help strike a Phase One deal. It should be noted that a separate report from Reuters that suggested a Phase Two deal before the 2020 election is unlikely to be reached did not have a noticeable effect on the market.The S&P 500 information technology sector (+1.4%), which typically outperforms when the prevailing view on trade is positive, led all sectors in gains amid strength in the semiconductor stocks.

The 2-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.74%.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +1.80.The stock market is headed for a flat start, as the S&P 500 futures trade in-line with fair value. The market has received trade news, earnings reports, and economic data, but none of it is having a meaningful impact on trading this morning.There was a modest advance in the futures trade last evening after a report from China indicated that top trade negotiators held a phone call, but the initial enthusiasm waned upon realization that nothing substantial was included in that report.Notable pre-market moves include earnings-driven gains in Best Buy (BBY 77.35, +3.10, +4.2%) and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS 43.89, +4.46, +11.3%), while Dollar Tree (DLTR 97.48, -14.91, -13.3%) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW 230.40, -19.40, -7.9%) are on the retreat following their reports.Separately, investors received some housing data earlier.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +2.10.The S&P 500 futures trade roughly in-line with fair value after another record-setting day on Wall Street yesterday. Futures were up as much as 0.4% above fair value after China's Xinhua News Agency reported that top trade negotiators held a phone call last evening.Both the U.S. and China reportedly reached an agreement in that call to continue to work toward resolving key issues for a Phase One trade agreement. The market, which already expects both sides to talk until a deal is reached, has justifiably tempered its initial enthusiasm but will likely continue to react to trade headlines moving forward.On the data front, investors will receive the Advance reports for International Trade in Goods, Retail Inventories, and Wholesale Inventories at 8:30 a.m. ET, followed by the FHFA Housing Price Index for September and the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for September (Briefing.com consensus 2.6%) at 9:00 a.m. ET.After the open, investors will receive the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for November (Briefing.com consensus 126.9) and the New Home Sales report for October (Briefing.com consensus 710,000) at 10:00 a.m. ET.U.S. Treasuries have extended yesterday's modest advance, pushing yields slightly lower again this morning.

Sizable M&A activity across several sectors also supported risk sentiment.The Russell 2000 rose 2.1%, climbing past its large-cap peers to close at a 52-week high.Press reports indicated that Chinese government officials called to increase penalties on IP theft, which was interpreted as a move that could help strike a Phase One deal. It should be noted that a separate report from Reuters that suggested a Phase Two deal before the 2020 election is unlikely to be reached did not have a noticeable effect on the market.The S&P 500 information technology sector (+1.4%), which typically outperforms when the prevailing view on trade is positive, led all sectors in gains amid strength in the semiconductor stocks. NVIDIA (NVDA 221.21, +10.32, +4.9%) was a notable gainer after the stock was upgraded to Overweight from Equal Weight at Morgan Stanley. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose 2.4%.The health care (+1.1%) and consumer discretionary (+0.9%) sectors also rose more than the S&P 500, while the utilities sector (-0.4%) was today's lone sector to finish in negative territory.Two of today's M&A deals were ones that were already on the market's radar: Charles Schwab (SCHW 49.31, +1.11, +2.3%) agreed to acquire TD Ameritrade (AMTD 51.78, +3.65, +7.6%) for $26 billion in an all-stock transaction, and LVMH (LVMUY 89.37, +1.98, +2.3%) agreed to acquire Tiffany & Co. (TIF 133.25, +7.74, +6.2%) for $16.2 billion in cash.New deals included Novartis (NVS 91.30, +0.82, +0.9%) agreeing to acquire The Medicines Co. (MDCO 83.80, +15.25, +22.3%) for $9.7 billion in cash and eBay (EBAY 35.85, +0.73, +2.1%) agreeing to sell StubHub to Viagogo for $4.05 billion in cash.Strikingly, U.S. Treasuries finished the session on a higher note despite the risk sentiment displayed in the stock market. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.61%, and the 10-yr yield declined one basis point to 1.76%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 98.32. WTI crude increased 0.2%, or $0.10, to $57.98/bbl.Investors did not receive any notable economic data on Monday.

Treasury futures saw very little movement during overnight trade but some selling pressure appeared as attention turned to the action in Europe. The European session has seen an uptick in risk tolerance after it was reported that new car registrations in the eurozone increased 8.7% yr/yr, which was the sharpest growth rate in ten years. However, even with the October spike, car registrations through the first ten months of 2019 are down 0.7% yr/yr.

A responder was defined as achieving and maintaining testosterone suppression to less than or equal to 50 ng/dL from Week 5 through Week 48. For the study to be successful, the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of the response rate had to be at least 90%.The study achieved all six key secondary endpoints, including superiority to leuprolide acetate on rapid suppression of testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA), all with p-values < 0.0001.Five key secondary endpoints demonstrated superiority to leuprolide acetate, including rapid suppression of testosterone at Day 4 and Day 15, profound suppression of testosterone at Day 15, rapid suppression of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at Day 15, and suppression of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) at Week 24 (all p-values < 0.0001). In addition, relugolix demonstrated non-inferiority to leuprolide acetate on sustained testosterone suppression through 48 weeks (96.7% vs. 88.8%, respectively) with a between-group difference of 7.9% (95% CI: 4.1%,11.8%), the primary endpoint required for regulatory submissions outside of the U.S. In addition, the pharmacodynamic results showed no testosterone flare after initiation of relugolix and mean testosterone levels returned to normal levels within 90 days after treatment discontinuation.A New Drug Application (NDA) submission is expected in the second quarter of 2020.A conference call and webcast are to be held today at 8:30 a.m. EST / 5:30 a.m. PST.07:32SRRK Scholar Rock announces preliminary pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic results from the TOPAZ Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial of SRK-015 for the treatment of patients with spinal muscular atrophy (7.20 )The planned preliminary PK/PD analysis, which includes data from 29 patients with SMA across all three cohorts, showed dose-proportional drug exposure and demonstrated target engagement, as evidenced by dose-dependent increases of up to 100-fold in the serum levels of latent myostatin following SRK-015 treatment (2 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg doses).

In the third quarter of 2019, loan originations facilitated by institutional partners increased to 75.1% of total loan origination volume, and the Company expects this proportion to further increase in the fourth quarter of 2019.

Khoury, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of KLX Energy Services commented, "Contemporaneously with the abrupt decline in activity, we took steps to align our business with current customer demand. Specifically, we implemented an approximate 17 percent reduction in force, as compared with the Company's July 31, 2019 staffing levels, consistent with the approximate 18 percent sequential quarterly decline in our third quarter revenues. We aggressively cut costs in every area of our business, and we warm stacked the vast majority of our Permian based wireline assets. As a result of these and other measures, we expect to take a third quarter charge of approximately $13 million. Notwithstanding the precipitous decline in industry conditions, we generated approximately $44 million in cash flow from operations and approximately $31 million in free cash flow, bringing our cash balance to approximately $121 million for the quarter ended October 31, 2019. In addition, our $100 million credit facility remains undrawn.""The abrupt deterioration in industry conditions, which accelerated through the end of our third quarter, was driven by a sharp sequential quarterly decline in U.S. land rig count and an unprecedented decline in active frac spreads from the second quarter to the third quarter. In fact, there was a significant sequential decline in hydraulic fracturing activity during each month of the third quarter. The decline in Exploration & Production activity resulted in lower demand levels and lower current and expected revenues for our business, which led the Company to accelerate its annual testing for asset impairment into the third quarter. While the Company has not yet completed this analysis, we expect to report a non-cash asset impairment charge in the range of approximately $45 million to $60 million. The Company is in the process of finalizing the actual amount of the impairment charge, which will be completed prior to reporting its third quarter financial results."06:00CEO CNOOC Ltd names President Xu Keqiang as CEO (152.50 )06:00TRP TC Energy to provide financial update and review strategic plans at Investor Day, reaffirms expectation to grow common share dividend at an annual rate of 8-10% through 2021 (51.44 )"Our $100 billion portfolio of high-quality, long-life energy infrastructure assets are expected to generate record financial results again in 2019 underpinned by strong market fundamentals," said Russ Girling, TC Energy's president and chief executive officer. "Looking forward, we continue to advance $30 billion of commercially secured projects that will expand and extend our asset footprint across North America."As those projects enter service, TC Energy expects comparable earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to exceed $10 billion in 2022. This represents an increase of more than 16 per cent when compared to comparable EBITDA of $8.6 billion in 2018 despite significant asset sales that have accelerated the strengthening of the company's balance sheet. Notably, approximately 95 per cent of comparable EBITDA is expected to come from regulated assets or long-term contracts. At the same time, the company continues to methodically advance more than $20 billion of projects under development including Keystone XL and the Bruce Power life extension program. Success in advancing these and other organic growth opportunities that are expected to emanate from TC Energy's five operating businesses across North America would add to the company's growth outlook."Based on the confidence we have in our business plans, we are reaffirming that we expect to grow our common share dividend at an annual rate of eight to 10 per cent through 2021," added Girling. "Our dividend outlook is supported by expected growth in earnings and cash flow and in line with our historically strong dividend coverage ratios."06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- World markets continue climb higher; US Futures in record territoryThe global equity markets are mostly higher once again with US Futures venturing into all-time high territory for a second straight night.

The Russell 2000 (-0.3%) closed in negative territory.The day began with the market digesting a tweet from a China-based CNBC reporter, who said she was informed by a Chinese government source that Beijing is pessimistic about a trade deal because President Trump hasn't supported a tariff rollback. Based on the modest losses and ensuing price action, the market presumably remained optimistic about a Phase One agreement.The large-cap indices eased their way into positive territory thanks to the turnarounds in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (+0.3%), information technology (+0.3%), and communication services (+0.3%) sectors. Consistent leaders included the consumer staples (+0.5%) and real estate (+0.5%) sectors, as the negative-sounding trade headline likely fostered some conservative-minded interest.The trade-sensitive industrials (-0.3%) and materials (-0.2%) sectors were among today's laggards, but their losses were small compared to the 1.3% drop in the energy sector, which was pressured by the decline in oil prices ($57.04, -0.71, -1.2%).Generally, there wasn't any concerted effort to sell a market trading at all-time highs, but investors weren't eager to embrace risk, either. The trend has been positive, which has likely drawn in some reluctant investors into the market, and today simply may have been a natural breather for a market breaking out to new highs.Notable corporate news included HP Inc. (HPQ 20.01, -0.17, -0.8%) turning down the takeover bid from Xerox (XRX 39.30, +0.36, +0.9%). HP remained open to a deal, though. Netflix (NFLX 302.57, +7.54, +2.6%) shares outperformed on speculation that either Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman built a large stake in the company.U.S. Treasuries extended last week's advance, pushing yields slightly lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points to 1.81%.

In addition, relugolix demonstrated non-inferiority to leuprolide acetate on sustained testosterone suppression through 48 weeks (96.7% vs. 88.8%, respectively) with a between-group difference of 7.9% (95% CI: 4.1%,11.8%), the primary endpoint required for regulatory submissions outside of the U.S. In addition, the pharmacodynamic results showed no testosterone flare after initiation of relugolix and mean testosterone levels returned to normal levels within 90 days after treatment discontinuation.A New Drug Application (NDA) submission is expected in the second quarter of 2020.A conference call and webcast are to be held today at 8:30 a.m. EST / 5:30 a.m. PST.07:32SRRK Scholar Rock announces preliminary pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic results from the TOPAZ Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial of SRK-015 for the treatment of patients with spinal muscular atrophy (7.20 )The planned preliminary PK/PD analysis, which includes data from 29 patients with SMA across all three cohorts, showed dose-proportional drug exposure and demonstrated target engagement, as evidenced by dose-dependent increases of up to 100-fold in the serum levels of latent myostatin following SRK-015 treatment (2 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg doses).

Khoury, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of KLX Energy Services commented, "Contemporaneously with the abrupt decline in activity, we took steps to align our business with current customer demand. Specifically, we implemented an approximate 17 percent reduction in force, as compared with the Company's July 31, 2019 staffing levels, consistent with the approximate 18 percent sequential quarterly decline in our third quarter revenues. We aggressively cut costs in every area of our business, and we warm stacked the vast majority of our Permian based wireline assets. As a result of these and other measures, we expect to take a third quarter charge of approximately $13 million. Notwithstanding the precipitous decline in industry conditions, we generated approximately $44 million in cash flow from operations and approximately $31 million in free cash flow, bringing our cash balance to approximately $121 million for the quarter ended October 31, 2019. In addition, our $100 million credit facility remains undrawn.""The abrupt deterioration in industry conditions, which accelerated through the end of our third quarter, was driven by a sharp sequential quarterly decline in U.S. land rig count and an unprecedented decline in active frac spreads from the second quarter to the third quarter. In fact, there was a significant sequential decline in hydraulic fracturing activity during each month of the third quarter. The decline in Exploration & Production activity resulted in lower demand levels and lower current and expected revenues for our business, which led the Company to accelerate its annual testing for asset impairment into the third quarter. While the Company has not yet completed this analysis, we expect to report a non-cash asset impairment charge in the range of approximately $45 million to $60 million. The Company is in the process of finalizing the actual amount of the impairment charge, which will be completed prior to reporting its third quarter financial results."06:00CEO CNOOC Ltd names President Xu Keqiang as CEO (152.50 )06:00TRP TC Energy to provide financial update and review strategic plans at Investor Day, reaffirms expectation to grow common share dividend at an annual rate of 8-10% through 2021 (51.44 )"Our $100 billion portfolio of high-quality, long-life energy infrastructure assets are expected to generate record financial results again in 2019 underpinned by strong market fundamentals," said Russ Girling, TC Energy's president and chief executive officer. "Looking forward, we continue to advance $30 billion of commercially secured projects that will expand and extend our asset footprint across North America."As those projects enter service, TC Energy expects comparable earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to exceed $10 billion in 2022. This represents an increase of more than 16 per cent when compared to comparable EBITDA of $8.6 billion in 2018 despite significant asset sales that have accelerated the strengthening of the company's balance sheet. Notably, approximately 95 per cent of comparable EBITDA is expected to come from regulated assets or long-term contracts. At the same time, the company continues to methodically advance more than $20 billion of projects under development including Keystone XL and the Bruce Power life extension program. Success in advancing these and other organic growth opportunities that are expected to emanate from TC Energy's five operating businesses across North America would add to the company's growth outlook."Based on the confidence we have in our business plans, we are reaffirming that we expect to grow our common share dividend at an annual rate of eight to 10 per cent through 2021," added Girling. "Our dividend outlook is supported by expected growth in earnings and cash flow and in line with our historically strong dividend coverage ratios."06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- World markets continue climb higher; US Futures in record territoryThe global equity markets are mostly higher once again with US Futures venturing into all-time high territory for a second straight night.

These utility operations have customers in eight states and expect customer growth to continue at a rate of 1-2% annually.

Also included in the utility's five-year program is the construction of an 88-megawatt simple-cycle, natural gas-fired combustion turbine near Mandan, North Dakota.The capital investment plan at the pipeline and midstream business reflects a focus on organic growth. This includes the Demicks Lake Expansion project under construction in North Dakota, which is expected to be in service in the first quarter of 2020 and as designed will increase capacity by 175 mln cubic feet per day. The North Bakken Expansion project is also included in the capital forecast. As designed, this project in the heart of the Bakken will increase capacity by an estimated 350 mln cubic feet per day and is expected to be in service in late 2021. This business is exploring additional organic growth projects that, if executed, would be incremental to the capital investment plan. Natural gas production continues at record levels in the Bakken, driving the need for additional infrastructure.At the company's construction materials and services businesses, the capital expenditures forecast is focused primarily on organic expansion opportunities, normal equipment and plant replacements and upgrades. Included in the outlined forecast is the development of Knife River's Honey Creek Quarry in Texas, which includes the construction of a rock-crushing plant and the purchase of aggregate railcars.

The Russell 2000 (-0.3%) closed in negative territory.The day began with the market digesting a tweet from a China-based CNBC reporter, who said she was informed by a Chinese government source that Beijing is pessimistic about a trade deal because President Trump hasn't supported a tariff rollback. Based on the modest losses and ensuing price action, the market presumably remained optimistic about a Phase One agreement.The large-cap indices eased their way into positive territory thanks to the turnarounds in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (+0.3%), information technology (+0.3%), and communication services (+0.3%) sectors. Consistent leaders included the consumer staples (+0.5%) and real estate (+0.5%) sectors, as the negative-sounding trade headline likely fostered some conservative-minded interest.The trade-sensitive industrials (-0.3%) and materials (-0.2%) sectors were among today's laggards, but their losses were small compared to the 1.3% drop in the energy sector, which was pressured by the decline in oil prices ($57.04, -0.71, -1.2%).Generally, there wasn't any concerted effort to sell a market trading at all-time highs, but investors weren't eager to embrace risk, either. The trend has been positive, which has likely drawn in some reluctant investors into the market, and today simply may have been a natural breather for a market breaking out to new highs.Notable corporate news included HP Inc. (HPQ 20.01, -0.17, -0.8%) turning down the takeover bid from Xerox (XRX 39.30, +0.36, +0.9%). HP remained open to a deal, though. Netflix (NFLX 302.57, +7.54, +2.6%) shares outperformed on speculation that either Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman built a large stake in the company.U.S. Treasuries extended last week's advance, pushing yields slightly lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points to 1.81%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 97.80.Separately, the NAHB Housing Market Index for November declined to 70 from 71 in October.

SPE now owns 100% of the multimedia entertainment company. Following the transaction, the Game Show Network channel will continue to be carried on DIRECTV.The sale is consistent with AT&T's strategy to monetize non-strategic assets as it de-levers its balance sheet and begins to retire shares. Prior to the transaction, SPE owned a 58% stake in Game Show Network, and AT&T owned the remaining 42%. In connection with the transaction, AT&T received approx. $500 mln, including proceeds for its equity stake valued at $380 mln (before transaction-related adjustments) and dividends of approx. $130 mln.

That corner is the retail industry, which has been broadsided today by disappointing earnings/sales results and guidance from Home Depot (HD 226.60, -12.25, -5.1%) and Kohl's (KSS 48.09, -10.31, -17.7%).The weakness in HD is having an outsized impact on the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (-0.9%); meanwhile, the combined impact of the disappointments from these well-known retailers is creating some angst about consumer spending activity entering the all-important holiday selling season.That angst is showing up in a sympathy trade that has knocked down the prices of many other retail stocks today, like Macy's (M 15.36, -1.51, -9.0%), Best Buy (BBY 75.61, -1.68, -2.2%), and Gap (GPS 16.62, -0.68, -3.9%) to name a few. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.97, -0.85, -1.9%) reflects the broader trend of underperformance for the retailers in today's market action.Those issues notwithstanding, the broader market is still holding up just fine as it is drawing influential support from the information technology (+0.3%), healthcare (+0.3%), and financial (+0.2%) sectors, which continue to attract interest from value and growth-minded investors alike.Separately, the market's overall resilience to selling pressure remains a tying factor for a number of participants who are fearful of missing out on further gains. That fear, ostensibly, is lending some buying support that has kept downside pressure in check.The Russell 2000 is up 0.2%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.1%; the S&P 500 is down 0.1%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%.10:00XLY Sector Briefing: Consumer Discretionary (120.74 -1.05)The consumer discretionary sector (-0.8%) represents an early pocket of relative weakness in a flat market. This makes for a continuation of this month's underperformance, which has the sector trading down 0.3% since the end of October versus a 2.8% gain in the S&P 500. Factors contributing to today's underperformance:Home Depot's (HD 227.72, -11.13, -4.7%) Q3 earnings report, which showed lower than expected revenue and lowered comparable sales guidance for FY20. Granted, Home Depot met Q3 EPS expectations, but the revenue shortfall and lowered comparable sales guidance have pressured the stock from a record high. Furthermore, the outlook is leading to some questions about the overall strength of consumer spending. Disappointing Q3 results and lowered FY20 guidance from Kohl's (KSS 48.86, -9.54, -16.4%), fueling worries that other apparel retailers could also report underwhelming results.Notable movers:Home Depot (HD 227.72, -11.13, -4.7%): falling back below its 50-day moving average (232.37) after setting a fresh record high on Monday. Kohl's (KSS 48.86, -9.54, -16.4%): falling to its lowest level in more than a month in response to weaker than expected quarterly results. Macy's (M 15.35, -1.53, -9.0%): sliding back below its 50-day moving average (15.76) after weak results from Kohl's. Nordstrom (JWN 35.10, -2.78, -7.3%): falling below its 200-day moving average (36.33) and toward its 50-day moving average (34.94) in sympathy with Kohl's. Gap (GPS 16.70, -0.60, -3.4%): approaching its October low after Kohl's disappointing results. TJX (TJX 60.68, +1.13, +1.9%): touched a fresh record after better than expected Q3 results overshadowed below-consensus Q4 EPS guidance. Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL 119.72, +1.32, +1.1%): bucking the overall trend in the sector.09:46SCANX Earnings mvoersJKS +13.79% WUBA +7.04% NJR +3.91% CRMT +3.57% TJX +2.82% DAVA +2.24% ASND +2.07% ESE +1.57%KSS -15.96% PPDF -7.14% HD -5.30% ASH -4.63% MMS -2.59% BILI -2.32% WWD -2.00% ZTO -1.29% KRNT -1.30% TDG -0.78% ALV -0.56% MDT -0.36%09:41WRAPX Opening Market Summary: Stock market opens slightly higher, retail dragsThe major indices open slightly higher at new all-time highs. The S&P 500 is up 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.3%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows financials (+0.4%) and information technology (+0.3%) leading the early advance. Conversely, the utilities (-0.6%) and consumer discretionary (-0.4%) sectors underperform, with the latter pressured by Home Depot (HD 228.90, -9.94, -4.2%) following its earnings results and guidance.The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 44.37, -0.45, -1.0%) is being dragged lower by shares of Kohl's (KSS 49.48, -8.86, -15.1%) after the company missed earnings estimates and lowered its FY20 EPS below consensus.U.S. Treasuries are little changed. The 2-yr yield is up one basis point to 1.60%, and the 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.80%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 97.79. WTI crude is down 1.9% to $56.06/bbl.09:29WIRES On The WiresOmeros (OMER) announced new findings on GPR174, its novel cancer immunotherapy target, demonstrating that GPR174-deficiency enhances anti-tumor immune responses in animals.

Highlights of the 10-year plan include free cash flow of approximately $50 bln, a forecast for underlying compound annual production growth averaging over 3%, and a projection for $30 bln in share buybacks over the 10-year period.09:16ALV Autoliv provides mid-term and long-term targets at Investor Day (82.22 )Medium term (up to 3-5 years) targets: On average to grow sales organically* by 3-4% more per year than light vehicle production growth and the company aim to improve its adjusted operating margin* to around 12%, based on an assumed average light vehicle production growth of 1-2% per year.Long term (beyond 5 years) ambitions: Our ambition remains to grow at least in line with our market. When our ongoing and planned strategic initiatives are fully implemented, the ambition is to further increase our earnings capacity, to an adjusted operating margin* of around 13%.For 2020, Co states, "Potential tailwinds include raw material costs, organic growth from market share gains, positive impacts from ongoing cost reduction programs and a stabilization of light vehicle production.

Considering these potential tailwinds and headwinds we expect a year over year improvement in adjusted operating margin*, absent unforeseen events."09:14WRAPX S&P futures vs fair value: +7.60. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +35.10.The stock market's bullish bias is set to continue at the open, with the S&P 500 futures trading seven points, or 0.2%, above fair value.

A responder was defined as achieving and maintaining testosterone suppression to less than or equal to 50 ng/dL from Week 5 through Week 48. For the study to be successful, the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of the response rate had to be at least 90%.The study achieved all six key secondary endpoints, including superiority to leuprolide acetate on rapid suppression of testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA), all with p-values < 0.0001.Five key secondary endpoints demonstrated superiority to leuprolide acetate, including rapid suppression of testosterone at Day 4 and Day 15, profound suppression of testosterone at Day 15, rapid suppression of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at Day 15, and suppression of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) at Week 24 (all p-values < 0.0001). In addition, relugolix demonstrated non-inferiority to leuprolide acetate on sustained testosterone suppression through 48 weeks (96.7% vs. 88.8%, respectively) with a between-group difference of 7.9% (95% CI: 4.1%,11.8%), the primary endpoint required for regulatory submissions outside of the U.S. In addition, the pharmacodynamic results showed no testosterone flare after initiation of relugolix and mean testosterone levels returned to normal levels within 90 days after treatment discontinuation.A New Drug Application (NDA) submission is expected in the second quarter of 2020.A conference call and webcast are to be held today at 8:30 a.m. EST / 5:30 a.m. PST.07:32SRRK Scholar Rock announces preliminary pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic results from the TOPAZ Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial of SRK-015 for the treatment of patients with spinal muscular atrophy (7.20 )The planned preliminary PK/PD analysis, which includes data from 29 patients with SMA across all three cohorts, showed dose-proportional drug exposure and demonstrated target engagement, as evidenced by dose-dependent increases of up to 100-fold in the serum levels of latent myostatin following SRK-015 treatment (2 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg doses).

Khoury, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of KLX Energy Services commented, "Contemporaneously with the abrupt decline in activity, we took steps to align our business with current customer demand. Specifically, we implemented an approximate 17 percent reduction in force, as compared with the Company's July 31, 2019 staffing levels, consistent with the approximate 18 percent sequential quarterly decline in our third quarter revenues. We aggressively cut costs in every area of our business, and we warm stacked the vast majority of our Permian based wireline assets. As a result of these and other measures, we expect to take a third quarter charge of approximately $13 million. Notwithstanding the precipitous decline in industry conditions, we generated approximately $44 million in cash flow from operations and approximately $31 million in free cash flow, bringing our cash balance to approximately $121 million for the quarter ended October 31, 2019. In addition, our $100 million credit facility remains undrawn.""The abrupt deterioration in industry conditions, which accelerated through the end of our third quarter, was driven by a sharp sequential quarterly decline in U.S. land rig count and an unprecedented decline in active frac spreads from the second quarter to the third quarter. In fact, there was a significant sequential decline in hydraulic fracturing activity during each month of the third quarter. The decline in Exploration & Production activity resulted in lower demand levels and lower current and expected revenues for our business, which led the Company to accelerate its annual testing for asset impairment into the third quarter. While the Company has not yet completed this analysis, we expect to report a non-cash asset impairment charge in the range of approximately $45 million to $60 million. The Company is in the process of finalizing the actual amount of the impairment charge, which will be completed prior to reporting its third quarter financial results."06:00CEO CNOOC Ltd names President Xu Keqiang as CEO (152.50 )06:00TRP TC Energy to provide financial update and review strategic plans at Investor Day, reaffirms expectation to grow common share dividend at an annual rate of 8-10% through 2021 (51.44 )"Our $100 billion portfolio of high-quality, long-life energy infrastructure assets are expected to generate record financial results again in 2019 underpinned by strong market fundamentals," said Russ Girling, TC Energy's president and chief executive officer. "Looking forward, we continue to advance $30 billion of commercially secured projects that will expand and extend our asset footprint across North America."As those projects enter service, TC Energy expects comparable earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to exceed $10 billion in 2022. This represents an increase of more than 16 per cent when compared to comparable EBITDA of $8.6 billion in 2018 despite significant asset sales that have accelerated the strengthening of the company's balance sheet. Notably, approximately 95 per cent of comparable EBITDA is expected to come from regulated assets or long-term contracts. At the same time, the company continues to methodically advance more than $20 billion of projects under development including Keystone XL and the Bruce Power life extension program. Success in advancing these and other organic growth opportunities that are expected to emanate from TC Energy's five operating businesses across North America would add to the company's growth outlook."Based on the confidence we have in our business plans, we are reaffirming that we expect to grow our common share dividend at an annual rate of eight to 10 per cent through 2021," added Girling. "Our dividend outlook is supported by expected growth in earnings and cash flow and in line with our historically strong dividend coverage ratios."06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- World markets continue climb higher; US Futures in record territoryThe global equity markets are mostly higher once again with US Futures venturing into all-time high territory for a second straight night.

These utility operations have customers in eight states and expect customer growth to continue at a rate of 1-2% annually. The anticipated investment reflects opportunities to improve the safety and reliability of the company's systems. Also included in the utility's five-year program is the construction of an 88-megawatt simple-cycle, natural gas-fired combustion turbine near Mandan, North Dakota.The capital investment plan at the pipeline and midstream business reflects a focus on organic growth. This includes the Demicks Lake Expansion project under construction in North Dakota, which is expected to be in service in the first quarter of 2020 and as designed will increase capacity by 175 mln cubic feet per day. The North Bakken Expansion project is also included in the capital forecast. As designed, this project in the heart of the Bakken will increase capacity by an estimated 350 mln cubic feet per day and is expected to be in service in late 2021. This business is exploring additional organic growth projects that, if executed, would be incremental to the capital investment plan. Natural gas production continues at record levels in the Bakken, driving the need for additional infrastructure.At the company's construction materials and services businesses, the capital expenditures forecast is focused primarily on organic expansion opportunities, normal equipment and plant replacements and upgrades. Included in the outlined forecast is the development of Knife River's Honey Creek Quarry in Texas, which includes the construction of a rock-crushing plant and the purchase of aggregate railcars. The company expects public sector workload growth as new state and local infrastructure spending initiatives are introduced.16:44ZG Zillow announced that Greg Schwartz, president of media and marketplaces, is stepping down to take a professional break (39.74 +0.23)The businesses that currently report to Schwartz in the Mortgages and Internet, Media and Technology (IMT) segments are being transitioned to other senior executives.

The Russell 2000 (-0.3%) closed in negative territory.The day began with the market digesting a tweet from a China-based CNBC reporter, who said she was informed by a Chinese government source that Beijing is pessimistic about a trade deal because President Trump hasn't supported a tariff rollback. Based on the modest losses and ensuing price action, the market presumably remained optimistic about a Phase One agreement.The large-cap indices eased their way into positive territory thanks to the turnarounds in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (+0.3%), information technology (+0.3%), and communication services (+0.3%) sectors. Consistent leaders included the consumer staples (+0.5%) and real estate (+0.5%) sectors, as the negative-sounding trade headline likely fostered some conservative-minded interest.The trade-sensitive industrials (-0.3%) and materials (-0.2%) sectors were among today's laggards, but their losses were small compared to the 1.3% drop in the energy sector, which was pressured by the decline in oil prices ($57.04, -0.71, -1.2%).Generally, there wasn't any concerted effort to sell a market trading at all-time highs, but investors weren't eager to embrace risk, either. The trend has been positive, which has likely drawn in some reluctant investors into the market, and today simply may have been a natural breather for a market breaking out to new highs.Notable corporate news included HP Inc. (HPQ 20.01, -0.17, -0.8%) turning down the takeover bid from Xerox (XRX 39.30, +0.36, +0.9%). HP remained open to a deal, though. Netflix (NFLX 302.57, +7.54, +2.6%) shares outperformed on speculation that either Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman built a large stake in the company.U.S. Treasuries extended last week's advance, pushing yields slightly lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points to 1.81%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 97.80.Separately, the NAHB Housing Market Index for November declined to 70 from 71 in October.

SPE now owns 100% of the multimedia entertainment company. Following the transaction, the Game Show Network channel will continue to be carried on DIRECTV.The sale is consistent with AT&T's strategy to monetize non-strategic assets as it de-levers its balance sheet and begins to retire shares. Prior to the transaction, SPE owned a 58% stake in Game Show Network, and AT&T owned the remaining 42%. In connection with the transaction, AT&T received approx. $500 mln, including proceeds for its equity stake valued at $380 mln (before transaction-related adjustments) and dividends of approx. $130 mln.

That corner is the retail industry, which has been broadsided today by disappointing earnings/sales results and guidance from Home Depot (HD 226.60, -12.25, -5.1%) and Kohl's (KSS 48.09, -10.31, -17.7%).The weakness in HD is having an outsized impact on the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (-0.9%); meanwhile, the combined impact of the disappointments from these well-known retailers is creating some angst about consumer spending activity entering the all-important holiday selling season.That angst is showing up in a sympathy trade that has knocked down the prices of many other retail stocks today, like Macy's (M 15.36, -1.51, -9.0%), Best Buy (BBY 75.61, -1.68, -2.2%), and Gap (GPS 16.62, -0.68, -3.9%) to name a few. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.97, -0.85, -1.9%) reflects the broader trend of underperformance for the retailers in today's market action.Those issues notwithstanding, the broader market is still holding up just fine as it is drawing influential support from the information technology (+0.3%), healthcare (+0.3%), and financial (+0.2%) sectors, which continue to attract interest from value and growth-minded investors alike.Separately, the market's overall resilience to selling pressure remains a tying factor for a number of participants who are fearful of missing out on further gains. That fear, ostensibly, is lending some buying support that has kept downside pressure in check.The Russell 2000 is up 0.2%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.1%; the S&P 500 is down 0.1%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%.10:00XLY Sector Briefing: Consumer Discretionary (120.74 -1.05)The consumer discretionary sector (-0.8%) represents an early pocket of relative weakness in a flat market. This makes for a continuation of this month's underperformance, which has the sector trading down 0.3% since the end of October versus a 2.8% gain in the S&P 500. Factors contributing to today's underperformance:Home Depot's (HD 227.72, -11.13, -4.7%) Q3 earnings report, which showed lower than expected revenue and lowered comparable sales guidance for FY20. Granted, Home Depot met Q3 EPS expectations, but the revenue shortfall and lowered comparable sales guidance have pressured the stock from a record high. Furthermore, the outlook is leading to some questions about the overall strength of consumer spending. Disappointing Q3 results and lowered FY20 guidance from Kohl's (KSS 48.86, -9.54, -16.4%), fueling worries that other apparel retailers could also report underwhelming results.Notable movers:Home Depot (HD 227.72, -11.13, -4.7%): falling back below its 50-day moving average (232.37) after setting a fresh record high on Monday. Kohl's (KSS 48.86, -9.54, -16.4%): falling to its lowest level in more than a month in response to weaker than expected quarterly results. Macy's (M 15.35, -1.53, -9.0%): sliding back below its 50-day moving average (15.76) after weak results from Kohl's. Nordstrom (JWN 35.10, -2.78, -7.3%): falling below its 200-day moving average (36.33) and toward its 50-day moving average (34.94) in sympathy with Kohl's. Gap (GPS 16.70, -0.60, -3.4%): approaching its October low after Kohl's disappointing results. TJX (TJX 60.68, +1.13, +1.9%): touched a fresh record after better than expected Q3 results overshadowed below-consensus Q4 EPS guidance. Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL 119.72, +1.32, +1.1%): bucking the overall trend in the sector.09:46SCANX Earnings mvoersJKS +13.79% WUBA +7.04% NJR +3.91% CRMT +3.57% TJX +2.82% DAVA +2.24% ASND +2.07% ESE +1.57%KSS -15.96% PPDF -7.14% HD -5.30% ASH -4.63% MMS -2.59% BILI -2.32% WWD -2.00% ZTO -1.29% KRNT -1.30% TDG -0.78% ALV -0.56% MDT -0.36%09:41WRAPX Opening Market Summary: Stock market opens slightly higher, retail dragsThe major indices open slightly higher at new all-time highs. The S&P 500 is up 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.3%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows financials (+0.4%) and information technology (+0.3%) leading the early advance. Conversely, the utilities (-0.6%) and consumer discretionary (-0.4%) sectors underperform, with the latter pressured by Home Depot (HD 228.90, -9.94, -4.2%) following its earnings results and guidance.The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 44.37, -0.45, -1.0%) is being dragged lower by shares of Kohl's (KSS 49.48, -8.86, -15.1%) after the company missed earnings estimates and lowered its FY20 EPS below consensus.U.S. Treasuries are little changed. The 2-yr yield is up one basis point to 1.60%, and the 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.80%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 97.79. WTI crude is down 1.9% to $56.06/bbl.09:29WIRES On The WiresOmeros (OMER) announced new findings on GPR174, its novel cancer immunotherapy target, demonstrating that GPR174-deficiency enhances anti-tumor immune responses in animals.

Highlights of the 10-year plan include free cash flow of approximately $50 bln, a forecast for underlying compound annual production growth averaging over 3%, and a projection for $30 bln in share buybacks over the 10-year period.09:16ALV Autoliv provides mid-term and long-term targets at Investor Day (82.22 )Medium term (up to 3-5 years) targets: On average to grow sales organically* by 3-4% more per year than light vehicle production growth and the company aim to improve its adjusted operating margin* to around 12%, based on an assumed average light vehicle production growth of 1-2% per year.Long term (beyond 5 years) ambitions: Our ambition remains to grow at least in line with our market.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +35.10.The stock market's bullish bias is set to continue at the open, with the S&P 500 futures trading seven points, or 0.2%, above fair value. Relative weakness in the retail space hasn't been enough to deter the good mood on Wall Street.Home Depot (HD 230.37, -8.48, -3.6%) and Kohl's (KSS 50.70, -7.70, -13.2%) have disappointed investors with their quarterly results and guidance, causing selling pressure in many of the other retail stocks, too.

A responder was defined as achieving and maintaining testosterone suppression to less than or equal to 50 ng/dL from Week 5 through Week 48. For the study to be successful, the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of the response rate had to be at least 90%.The study achieved all six key secondary endpoints, including superiority to leuprolide acetate on rapid suppression of testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA), all with p-values < 0.0001.Five key secondary endpoints demonstrated superiority to leuprolide acetate, including rapid suppression of testosterone at Day 4 and Day 15, profound suppression of testosterone at Day 15, rapid suppression of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at Day 15, and suppression of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) at Week 24 (all p-values < 0.0001).

Khoury, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of KLX Energy Services commented, "Contemporaneously with the abrupt decline in activity, we took steps to align our business with current customer demand. Specifically, we implemented an approximate 17 percent reduction in force, as compared with the Company's July 31, 2019 staffing levels, consistent with the approximate 18 percent sequential quarterly decline in our third quarter revenues. We aggressively cut costs in every area of our business, and we warm stacked the vast majority of our Permian based wireline assets. As a result of these and other measures, we expect to take a third quarter charge of approximately $13 million. Notwithstanding the precipitous decline in industry conditions, we generated approximately $44 million in cash flow from operations and approximately $31 million in free cash flow, bringing our cash balance to approximately $121 million for the quarter ended October 31, 2019. In addition, our $100 million credit facility remains undrawn.""The abrupt deterioration in industry conditions, which accelerated through the end of our third quarter, was driven by a sharp sequential quarterly decline in U.S. land rig count and an unprecedented decline in active frac spreads from the second quarter to the third quarter. In fact, there was a significant sequential decline in hydraulic fracturing activity during each month of the third quarter. The decline in Exploration & Production activity resulted in lower demand levels and lower current and expected revenues for our business, which led the Company to accelerate its annual testing for asset impairment into the third quarter. While the Company has not yet completed this analysis, we expect to report a non-cash asset impairment charge in the range of approximately $45 million to $60 million. The Company is in the process of finalizing the actual amount of the impairment charge, which will be completed prior to reporting its third quarter financial results."06:00CEO CNOOC Ltd names President Xu Keqiang as CEO (152.50 )06:00TRP TC Energy to provide financial update and review strategic plans at Investor Day, reaffirms expectation to grow common share dividend at an annual rate of 8-10% through 2021 (51.44 )"Our $100 billion portfolio of high-quality, long-life energy infrastructure assets are expected to generate record financial results again in 2019 underpinned by strong market fundamentals," said Russ Girling, TC Energy's president and chief executive officer. "Looking forward, we continue to advance $30 billion of commercially secured projects that will expand and extend our asset footprint across North America."As those projects enter service, TC Energy expects comparable earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to exceed $10 billion in 2022. This represents an increase of more than 16 per cent when compared to comparable EBITDA of $8.6 billion in 2018 despite significant asset sales that have accelerated the strengthening of the company's balance sheet. Notably, approximately 95 per cent of comparable EBITDA is expected to come from regulated assets or long-term contracts. At the same time, the company continues to methodically advance more than $20 billion of projects under development including Keystone XL and the Bruce Power life extension program. Success in advancing these and other organic growth opportunities that are expected to emanate from TC Energy's five operating businesses across North America would add to the company's growth outlook."Based on the confidence we have in our business plans, we are reaffirming that we expect to grow our common share dividend at an annual rate of eight to 10 per cent through 2021," added Girling. "Our dividend outlook is supported by expected growth in earnings and cash flow and in line with our historically strong dividend coverage ratios."06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- World markets continue climb higher; US Futures in record territoryThe global equity markets are mostly higher once again with US Futures venturing into all-time high territory for a second straight night.

Based on the modest losses and ensuing price action, the market presumably remained optimistic about a Phase One agreement.The large-cap indices eased their way into positive territory thanks to the turnarounds in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (+0.3%), information technology (+0.3%), and communication services (+0.3%) sectors. Consistent leaders included the consumer staples (+0.5%) and real estate (+0.5%) sectors, as the negative-sounding trade headline likely fostered some conservative-minded interest.The trade-sensitive industrials (-0.3%) and materials (-0.2%) sectors were among today's laggards, but their losses were small compared to the 1.3% drop in the energy sector, which was pressured by the decline in oil prices ($57.04, -0.71, -1.2%).Generally, there wasn't any concerted effort to sell a market trading at all-time highs, but investors weren't eager to embrace risk, either. The trend has been positive, which has likely drawn in some reluctant investors into the market, and today simply may have been a natural breather for a market breaking out to new highs.Notable corporate news included HP Inc. (HPQ 20.01, -0.17, -0.8%) turning down the takeover bid from Xerox (XRX 39.30, +0.36, +0.9%). HP remained open to a deal, though. Netflix (NFLX 302.57, +7.54, +2.6%) shares outperformed on speculation that either Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman built a large stake in the company.U.S. Treasuries extended last week's advance, pushing yields slightly lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points to 1.81%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 97.80.Separately, the NAHB Housing Market Index for November declined to 70 from 71 in October.

SPE now owns 100% of the multimedia entertainment company. Following the transaction, the Game Show Network channel will continue to be carried on DIRECTV.The sale is consistent with AT&T's strategy to monetize non-strategic assets as it de-levers its balance sheet and begins to retire shares. Prior to the transaction, SPE owned a 58% stake in Game Show Network, and AT&T owned the remaining 42%. In connection with the transaction, AT&T received approx. $500 mln, including proceeds for its equity stake valued at $380 mln (before transaction-related adjustments) and dividends of approx. $130 mln. Game Show Network will continue to be managed by Sony Pictures Television (SPT) with Mark Feldman continuing as President and CEO of the multimedia outlet.16:15EFC Ellington Financial commences public offering of 4.2 mln shares of common stock (18.81 +0.01)The company expects to use proceeds to acquire its targeted assets.

Their weakness has acted as a weight on the broader market, yet the movement of the S&P 500 index has been largely a function of technical price action.Briefing.com's Technical Take page identified 3127 as a secondary resistance level for the S&P 500. That level was tested with the opening move (3127.64) but quickly failed as steady selling eventually dropped the S&P 500 back to 3113.46 at this morning's low, which was reached just before 11:00 a.m. ET. That level fell within a secondary support level (3115/3112) that was also identified on the Technical Take Page.Traders, therefore, appear to be respecting these technical boundaries for now on a day that is devoid of any major macro news drivers, particularly as they relate to trade, and as it is suggested that the market is short-term overextended and due for a pullback.The Russell 2000 is up 0.4%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.3%; the S&P 500 is unchanged; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.4%.11:51QCOM Qualcomm issues 3 year targets at Analyst Day (88.73 -1.78)From CFO's presentation at Analyst Day:3 year targets as earnings mix shift to QCT from QTLRevenue: QCT segment SAM: 10% CAGR, grow faster than SAM and Apple product revenues QTL: current run rate + Huawei resolution Operating margin: QCT grows to >20%; QTL: ~70%Summarizing Qualcomm opportunities: Mature handset industry and current macroeconomic environment; Accelerated 5G migration compared to 4G; Mobile handset platform: 4G->5G transition, RF Front-End growth; Growth beyond mobile: Auto, IoT, Compute, ADAS, Cloud/Edge AI 75+ 5G licenses including key anchor agreements.Grow earnings faster than revenues.

The ACHIEVE II trial evaluated ubrogepant 50 mg and 25 mg, compared with placebo, across a wide range of clinical endpoints, including the co-primary endpoints of pain freedom (no pain) and freedom from the most bothersome migraine-associated symptom at two hours post-initial dose. For the two co-primary endpoints, ubrogepant 50 mg and 25 mg showed statistically significant higher response rates for pain freedom at two hours (21.8% for 50 mg, 20.7% for 25 mg and 14.3% for placebo), and the 50 mg dose demonstrated statistically significant higher response rates for the freedom from the most bothersome migraine-associated symptom at two hours (38.9% for 50 mg and 27.4% for placebo). Additionally, ubrogepant 50 mg was statistically superior to placebo in the absence of light sensitivity (43.8% for 50 mg and 35.5% for placebo) and sound sensitivity (54.1% for 50 mg and 46.3% for placebo).FDA action on the NDA for ubrogepant is expected in December 2019, potentially making it the first oral CGRP to address unmet patient needs in acute treatment of migraine and the first FDA-approved gepant.11:21XLE Sector Briefing: Energy (58.71 -0.65)The energy sector (-1.1%) sits at the bottom of today's sector standings after showing relative weakness yesterday. The growth-sensitive sector is now down 2.4% since Friday versus a much more modest 0.1% week-to-date downtick in the S&P 500. Factors contributing to the underperformance:Notable pressure on crude oil. The energy component is down more than $1.00 today (-2.3%) and down $2.01 (-3.5%) since Friday's settlement. This has sent the price of oil beneath its 200-day moving average (57.37) with the 50-day average (55.65) looming just below. Tax-loss related selling. The energy sector has been the weakest performer of 2019, meaning the group contains a fair share of names that have underperformed since the end of 2018. These names are more likely to be sold before the end of 2019 as investors look to reduce some of the tax impact of taking capital gains this year.Notable movers:HollyFrontier (HFC 51.56, -2.35, -4.4%): falling to its lowest level since early October. The company announced a new project and a new buyback authorization yesterday morning. Noble Energy (NBL 19.41, -0.51, -2.6%): nearing its 2019 low after finding resistance at its 50-day moving average (21.34) at the end of last week. Marathon Petroleum (MPC 62.13, -1.88, -2.9%): falling to its 50-day moving average (61.89). Occidental Petroleum (OXY 38.20, -1.10, -2.8%): on the verge of hitting fresh low for the year.

ConocoPhillips (COP 57.26, +0.56, +1.0%): best performing sector component, reclaiming its 50-day moving average (57.03). The company is hosting its analyst & investor meeting today, where it is expected to reaffirm its commitment to a strategy unveiled in 2016.10:35OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:DO Jan20 5 calls are seeing interest with 4230 contracts trading vs. open int of 0, pushing implied vol up around 10 points to ~87%.

That corner is the retail industry, which has been broadsided today by disappointing earnings/sales results and guidance from Home Depot (HD 226.60, -12.25, -5.1%) and Kohl's (KSS 48.09, -10.31, -17.7%).The weakness in HD is having an outsized impact on the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (-0.9%); meanwhile, the combined impact of the disappointments from these well-known retailers is creating some angst about consumer spending activity entering the all-important holiday selling season.That angst is showing up in a sympathy trade that has knocked down the prices of many other retail stocks today, like Macy's (M 15.36, -1.51, -9.0%), Best Buy (BBY 75.61, -1.68, -2.2%), and Gap (GPS 16.62, -0.68, -3.9%) to name a few. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.97, -0.85, -1.9%) reflects the broader trend of underperformance for the retailers in today's market action.Those issues notwithstanding, the broader market is still holding up just fine as it is drawing influential support from the information technology (+0.3%), healthcare (+0.3%), and financial (+0.2%) sectors, which continue to attract interest from value and growth-minded investors alike.Separately, the market's overall resilience to selling pressure remains a tying factor for a number of participants who are fearful of missing out on further gains. That fear, ostensibly, is lending some buying support that has kept downside pressure in check.The Russell 2000 is up 0.2%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.1%; the S&P 500 is down 0.1%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%.10:00XLY Sector Briefing: Consumer Discretionary (120.74 -1.05)The consumer discretionary sector (-0.8%) represents an early pocket of relative weakness in a flat market. This makes for a continuation of this month's underperformance, which has the sector trading down 0.3% since the end of October versus a 2.8% gain in the S&P 500. Factors contributing to today's underperformance:Home Depot's (HD 227.72, -11.13, -4.7%) Q3 earnings report, which showed lower than expected revenue and lowered comparable sales guidance for FY20. Granted, Home Depot met Q3 EPS expectations, but the revenue shortfall and lowered comparable sales guidance have pressured the stock from a record high. Furthermore, the outlook is leading to some questions about the overall strength of consumer spending. Disappointing Q3 results and lowered FY20 guidance from Kohl's (KSS 48.86, -9.54, -16.4%), fueling worries that other apparel retailers could also report underwhelming results.Notable movers:Home Depot (HD 227.72, -11.13, -4.7%): falling back below its 50-day moving average (232.37) after setting a fresh record high on Monday. Kohl's (KSS 48.86, -9.54, -16.4%): falling to its lowest level in more than a month in response to weaker than expected quarterly results. Macy's (M 15.35, -1.53, -9.0%): sliding back below its 50-day moving average (15.76) after weak results from Kohl's. Nordstrom (JWN 35.10, -2.78, -7.3%): falling below its 200-day moving average (36.33) and toward its 50-day moving average (34.94) in sympathy with Kohl's. Gap (GPS 16.70, -0.60, -3.4%): approaching its October low after Kohl's disappointing results. TJX (TJX 60.68, +1.13, +1.9%): touched a fresh record after better than expected Q3 results overshadowed below-consensus Q4 EPS guidance. Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL 119.72, +1.32, +1.1%): bucking the overall trend in the sector.09:46SCANX Earnings mvoersJKS +13.79% WUBA +7.04% NJR +3.91% CRMT +3.57% TJX +2.82% DAVA +2.24% ASND +2.07% ESE +1.57%KSS -15.96% PPDF -7.14% HD -5.30% ASH -4.63% MMS -2.59% BILI -2.32% WWD -2.00% ZTO -1.29% KRNT -1.30% TDG -0.78% ALV -0.56% MDT -0.36%09:41WRAPX Opening Market Summary: Stock market opens slightly higher, retail dragsThe major indices open slightly higher at new all-time highs. The S&P 500 is up 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.3%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows financials (+0.4%) and information technology (+0.3%) leading the early advance. Conversely, the utilities (-0.6%) and consumer discretionary (-0.4%) sectors underperform, with the latter pressured by Home Depot (HD 228.90, -9.94, -4.2%) following its earnings results and guidance.The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 44.37, -0.45, -1.0%) is being dragged lower by shares of Kohl's (KSS 49.48, -8.86, -15.1%) after the company missed earnings estimates and lowered its FY20 EPS below consensus.U.S. Treasuries are little changed. The 2-yr yield is up one basis point to 1.60%, and the 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.80%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 97.79. WTI crude is down 1.9% to $56.06/bbl.09:29WIRES On The WiresOmeros (OMER) announced new findings on GPR174, its novel cancer immunotherapy target, demonstrating that GPR174-deficiency enhances anti-tumor immune responses in animals. The studies were conducted in mouse models of melanoma and of colon carcinoma, each of which was modified to partially deplete regulatory T cells; GPR174 deficiency in these mice resulted in significantly reduced tumor growth and improved survival of the animals (p=0.006 in melanoma; p=0.03 in colon cancer) versus normal mice.XBiotech (XBIT) today announced rapid enrollment in its Phase 2 clinical study evaluating bermekimab in patients with moderate to severe Hidradenitis Suppurativa.

The company will outline the details of a 2020-2029 operating and financial plan and will provide region and asset reviews of its global portfolio. Highlights of the 10-year plan include free cash flow of approximately $50 bln, a forecast for underlying compound annual production growth averaging over 3%, and a projection for $30 bln in share buybacks over the 10-year period.09:16ALV Autoliv provides mid-term and long-term targets at Investor Day (82.22 )Medium term (up to 3-5 years) targets: On average to grow sales organically* by 3-4% more per year than light vehicle production growth and the company aim to improve its adjusted operating margin* to around 12%, based on an assumed average light vehicle production growth of 1-2% per year.Long term (beyond 5 years) ambitions: Our ambition remains to grow at least in line with our market. When our ongoing and planned strategic initiatives are fully implemented, the ambition is to further increase our earnings capacity, to an adjusted operating margin* of around 13%.For 2020, Co states, "Potential tailwinds include raw material costs, organic growth from market share gains, positive impacts from ongoing cost reduction programs and a stabilization of light vehicle production. Potential headwinds include lower inflator replacement sales and higher depreciation and amortization. Considering these potential tailwinds and headwinds we expect a year over year improvement in adjusted operating margin*, absent unforeseen events."09:14WRAPX S&P futures vs fair value: +7.60. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +35.10.The stock market's bullish bias is set to continue at the open, with the S&P 500 futures trading seven points, or 0.2%, above fair value. Relative weakness in the retail space hasn't been enough to deter the good mood on Wall Street.Home Depot (HD 230.37, -8.48, -3.6%) and Kohl's (KSS 50.70, -7.70, -13.2%) have disappointed investors with their quarterly results and guidance, causing selling pressure in many of the other retail stocks, too.

In the primary endpoint responder analysis, 96.7% (95% CI: 94.9%, 97.9%) of men receiving once-daily, oral relugolix achieved sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels. A responder was defined as achieving and maintaining testosterone suppression to less than or equal to 50 ng/dL from Week 5 through Week 48. For the study to be successful, the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of the response rate had to be at least 90%.The study achieved all six key secondary endpoints, including superiority to leuprolide acetate on rapid suppression of testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA), all with p-values < 0.0001.Five key secondary endpoints demonstrated superiority to leuprolide acetate, including rapid suppression of testosterone at Day 4 and Day 15, profound suppression of testosterone at Day 15, rapid suppression of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at Day 15, and suppression of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) at Week 24 (all p-values < 0.0001). In addition, relugolix demonstrated non-inferiority to leuprolide acetate on sustained testosterone suppression through 48 weeks (96.7% vs. 88.8%, respectively) with a between-group difference of 7.9% (95% CI: 4.1%,11.8%), the primary endpoint required for regulatory submissions outside of the U.S. In addition, the pharmacodynamic results showed no testosterone flare after initiation of relugolix and mean testosterone levels returned to normal levels within 90 days after treatment discontinuation.A New Drug Application (NDA) submission is expected in the second quarter of 2020.A conference call and webcast are to be held today at 8:30 a.m. EST / 5:30 a.m. PST.07:32SRRK Scholar Rock announces preliminary pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic results from the TOPAZ Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial of SRK-015 for the treatment of patients with spinal muscular atrophy (7.20 )The planned preliminary PK/PD analysis, which includes data from 29 patients with SMA across all three cohorts, showed dose-proportional drug exposure and demonstrated target engagement, as evidenced by dose-dependent increases of up to 100-fold in the serum levels of latent myostatin following SRK-015 treatment (2 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg doses).

Khoury, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of KLX Energy Services commented, "Contemporaneously with the abrupt decline in activity, we took steps to align our business with current customer demand. Specifically, we implemented an approximate 17 percent reduction in force, as compared with the Company's July 31, 2019 staffing levels, consistent with the approximate 18 percent sequential quarterly decline in our third quarter revenues. We aggressively cut costs in every area of our business, and we warm stacked the vast majority of our Permian based wireline assets. As a result of these and other measures, we expect to take a third quarter charge of approximately $13 million. Notwithstanding the precipitous decline in industry conditions, we generated approximately $44 million in cash flow from operations and approximately $31 million in free cash flow, bringing our cash balance to approximately $121 million for the quarter ended October 31, 2019. In addition, our $100 million credit facility remains undrawn.""The abrupt deterioration in industry conditions, which accelerated through the end of our third quarter, was driven by a sharp sequential quarterly decline in U.S. land rig count and an unprecedented decline in active frac spreads from the second quarter to the third quarter. In fact, there was a significant sequential decline in hydraulic fracturing activity during each month of the third quarter. The decline in Exploration & Production activity resulted in lower demand levels and lower current and expected revenues for our business, which led the Company to accelerate its annual testing for asset impairment into the third quarter. While the Company has not yet completed this analysis, we expect to report a non-cash asset impairment charge in the range of approximately $45 million to $60 million. The Company is in the process of finalizing the actual amount of the impairment charge, which will be completed prior to reporting its third quarter financial results."06:00CEO CNOOC Ltd names President Xu Keqiang as CEO (152.50 )06:00TRP TC Energy to provide financial update and review strategic plans at Investor Day, reaffirms expectation to grow common share dividend at an annual rate of 8-10% through 2021 (51.44 )"Our $100 billion portfolio of high-quality, long-life energy infrastructure assets are expected to generate record financial results again in 2019 underpinned by strong market fundamentals," said Russ Girling, TC Energy's president and chief executive officer. "Looking forward, we continue to advance $30 billion of commercially secured projects that will expand and extend our asset footprint across North America."As those projects enter service, TC Energy expects comparable earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to exceed $10 billion in 2022. This represents an increase of more than 16 per cent when compared to comparable EBITDA of $8.6 billion in 2018 despite significant asset sales that have accelerated the strengthening of the company's balance sheet. Notably, approximately 95 per cent of comparable EBITDA is expected to come from regulated assets or long-term contracts. At the same time, the company continues to methodically advance more than $20 billion of projects under development including Keystone XL and the Bruce Power life extension program. Success in advancing these and other organic growth opportunities that are expected to emanate from TC Energy's five operating businesses across North America would add to the company's growth outlook."Based on the confidence we have in our business plans, we are reaffirming that we expect to grow our common share dividend at an annual rate of eight to 10 per cent through 2021," added Girling. "Our dividend outlook is supported by expected growth in earnings and cash flow and in line with our historically strong dividend coverage ratios."06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- World markets continue climb higher; US Futures in record territoryThe global equity markets are mostly higher once again with US Futures venturing into all-time high territory for a second straight night.

This includes the Demicks Lake Expansion project under construction in North Dakota, which is expected to be in service in the first quarter of 2020 and as designed will increase capacity by 175 mln cubic feet per day.

The Russell 2000 (-0.3%) closed in negative territory.The day began with the market digesting a tweet from a China-based CNBC reporter, who said she was informed by a Chinese government source that Beijing is pessimistic about a trade deal because President Trump hasn't supported a tariff rollback. Based on the modest losses and ensuing price action, the market presumably remained optimistic about a Phase One agreement.The large-cap indices eased their way into positive territory thanks to the turnarounds in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (+0.3%), information technology (+0.3%), and communication services (+0.3%) sectors. Consistent leaders included the consumer staples (+0.5%) and real estate (+0.5%) sectors, as the negative-sounding trade headline likely fostered some conservative-minded interest.The trade-sensitive industrials (-0.3%) and materials (-0.2%) sectors were among today's laggards, but their losses were small compared to the 1.3% drop in the energy sector, which was pressured by the decline in oil prices ($57.04, -0.71, -1.2%).Generally, there wasn't any concerted effort to sell a market trading at all-time highs, but investors weren't eager to embrace risk, either. The trend has been positive, which has likely drawn in some reluctant investors into the market, and today simply may have been a natural breather for a market breaking out to new highs.Notable corporate news included HP Inc. (HPQ 20.01, -0.17, -0.8%) turning down the takeover bid from Xerox (XRX 39.30, +0.36, +0.9%). HP remained open to a deal, though. Netflix (NFLX 302.57, +7.54, +2.6%) shares outperformed on speculation that either Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman built a large stake in the company.U.S. Treasuries extended last week's advance, pushing yields slightly lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points to 1.81%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 97.80.Separately, the NAHB Housing Market Index for November declined to 70 from 71 in October.

SPE now owns 100% of the multimedia entertainment company. Following the transaction, the Game Show Network channel will continue to be carried on DIRECTV.The sale is consistent with AT&T's strategy to monetize non-strategic assets as it de-levers its balance sheet and begins to retire shares. Prior to the transaction, SPE owned a 58% stake in Game Show Network, and AT&T owned the remaining 42%. In connection with the transaction, AT&T received approx. $500 mln, including proceeds for its equity stake valued at $380 mln (before transaction-related adjustments) and dividends of approx. $130 mln. Game Show Network will continue to be managed by Sony Pictures Television (SPT) with Mark Feldman continuing as President and CEO of the multimedia outlet.16:15EFC Ellington Financial commences public offering of 4.2 mln shares of common stock (18.81 +0.01)The company expects to use proceeds to acquire its targeted assets.

Their weakness has acted as a weight on the broader market, yet the movement of the S&P 500 index has been largely a function of technical price action.Briefing.com's Technical Take page identified 3127 as a secondary resistance level for the S&P 500. That level was tested with the opening move (3127.64) but quickly failed as steady selling eventually dropped the S&P 500 back to 3113.46 at this morning's low, which was reached just before 11:00 a.m. ET. That level fell within a secondary support level (3115/3112) that was also identified on the Technical Take Page.Traders, therefore, appear to be respecting these technical boundaries for now on a day that is devoid of any major macro news drivers, particularly as they relate to trade, and as it is suggested that the market is short-term overextended and due for a pullback.The Russell 2000 is up 0.4%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.3%; the S&P 500 is unchanged; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.4%.11:51QCOM Qualcomm issues 3 year targets at Analyst Day (88.73 -1.78)From CFO's presentation at Analyst Day:3 year targets as earnings mix shift to QCT from QTLRevenue: QCT segment SAM: 10% CAGR, grow faster than SAM and Apple product revenues QTL: current run rate + Huawei resolution Operating margin: QCT grows to >20%; QTL: ~70%Summarizing Qualcomm opportunities: Mature handset industry and current macroeconomic environment; Accelerated 5G migration compared to 4G; Mobile handset platform: 4G->5G transition, RF Front-End growth; Growth beyond mobile: Auto, IoT, Compute, ADAS, Cloud/Edge AI 75+ 5G licenses including key anchor agreements.Grow earnings faster than revenues.

The ACHIEVE II trial evaluated ubrogepant 50 mg and 25 mg, compared with placebo, across a wide range of clinical endpoints, including the co-primary endpoints of pain freedom (no pain) and freedom from the most bothersome migraine-associated symptom at two hours post-initial dose. For the two co-primary endpoints, ubrogepant 50 mg and 25 mg showed statistically significant higher response rates for pain freedom at two hours (21.8% for 50 mg, 20.7% for 25 mg and 14.3% for placebo), and the 50 mg dose demonstrated statistically significant higher response rates for the freedom from the most bothersome migraine-associated symptom at two hours (38.9% for 50 mg and 27.4% for placebo). Additionally, ubrogepant 50 mg was statistically superior to placebo in the absence of light sensitivity (43.8% for 50 mg and 35.5% for placebo) and sound sensitivity (54.1% for 50 mg and 46.3% for placebo).FDA action on the NDA for ubrogepant is expected in December 2019, potentially making it the first oral CGRP to address unmet patient needs in acute treatment of migraine and the first FDA-approved gepant.11:21XLE Sector Briefing: Energy (58.71 -0.65)The energy sector (-1.1%) sits at the bottom of today's sector standings after showing relative weakness yesterday. The growth-sensitive sector is now down 2.4% since Friday versus a much more modest 0.1% week-to-date downtick in the S&P 500. Factors contributing to the underperformance:Notable pressure on crude oil. The energy component is down more than $1.00 today (-2.3%) and down $2.01 (-3.5%) since Friday's settlement. This has sent the price of oil beneath its 200-day moving average (57.37) with the 50-day average (55.65) looming just below. Tax-loss related selling. The energy sector has been the weakest performer of 2019, meaning the group contains a fair share of names that have underperformed since the end of 2018. These names are more likely to be sold before the end of 2019 as investors look to reduce some of the tax impact of taking capital gains this year.Notable movers:HollyFrontier (HFC 51.56, -2.35, -4.4%): falling to its lowest level since early October. The company announced a new project and a new buyback authorization yesterday morning. Noble Energy (NBL 19.41, -0.51, -2.6%): nearing its 2019 low after finding resistance at its 50-day moving average (21.34) at the end of last week. Marathon Petroleum (MPC 62.13, -1.88, -2.9%): falling to its 50-day moving average (61.89). Occidental Petroleum (OXY 38.20, -1.10, -2.8%): on the verge of hitting fresh low for the year. Helmerich & Payne (HP 37.79, -1.05, -2.7%): nearing its 2019 low after being downgraded to Hold from Buy at Argus. ConocoPhillips (COP 57.26, +0.56, +1.0%): best performing sector component, reclaiming its 50-day moving average (57.03). The company is hosting its analyst & investor meeting today, where it is expected to reaffirm its commitment to a strategy unveiled in 2016.10:35OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:DO Jan20 5 calls are seeing interest with 4230 contracts trading vs. open int of 0, pushing implied vol up around 10 points to ~87%.

That corner is the retail industry, which has been broadsided today by disappointing earnings/sales results and guidance from Home Depot (HD 226.60, -12.25, -5.1%) and Kohl's (KSS 48.09, -10.31, -17.7%).The weakness in HD is having an outsized impact on the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (-0.9%); meanwhile, the combined impact of the disappointments from these well-known retailers is creating some angst about consumer spending activity entering the all-important holiday selling season.That angst is showing up in a sympathy trade that has knocked down the prices of many other retail stocks today, like Macy's (M 15.36, -1.51, -9.0%), Best Buy (BBY 75.61, -1.68, -2.2%), and Gap (GPS 16.62, -0.68, -3.9%) to name a few. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.97, -0.85, -1.9%) reflects the broader trend of underperformance for the retailers in today's market action.Those issues notwithstanding, the broader market is still holding up just fine as it is drawing influential support from the information technology (+0.3%), healthcare (+0.3%), and financial (+0.2%) sectors, which continue to attract interest from value and growth-minded investors alike.Separately, the market's overall resilience to selling pressure remains a tying factor for a number of participants who are fearful of missing out on further gains. That fear, ostensibly, is lending some buying support that has kept downside pressure in check.The Russell 2000 is up 0.2%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.1%; the S&P 500 is down 0.1%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%.10:00XLY Sector Briefing: Consumer Discretionary (120.74 -1.05)The consumer discretionary sector (-0.8%) represents an early pocket of relative weakness in a flat market. This makes for a continuation of this month's underperformance, which has the sector trading down 0.3% since the end of October versus a 2.8% gain in the S&P 500. Factors contributing to today's underperformance:Home Depot's (HD 227.72, -11.13, -4.7%) Q3 earnings report, which showed lower than expected revenue and lowered comparable sales guidance for FY20. Granted, Home Depot met Q3 EPS expectations, but the revenue shortfall and lowered comparable sales guidance have pressured the stock from a record high. Furthermore, the outlook is leading to some questions about the overall strength of consumer spending. Disappointing Q3 results and lowered FY20 guidance from Kohl's (KSS 48.86, -9.54, -16.4%), fueling worries that other apparel retailers could also report underwhelming results.Notable movers:Home Depot (HD 227.72, -11.13, -4.7%): falling back below its 50-day moving average (232.37) after setting a fresh record high on Monday. Kohl's (KSS 48.86, -9.54, -16.4%): falling to its lowest level in more than a month in response to weaker than expected quarterly results. Macy's (M 15.35, -1.53, -9.0%): sliding back below its 50-day moving average (15.76) after weak results from Kohl's. Nordstrom (JWN 35.10, -2.78, -7.3%): falling below its 200-day moving average (36.33) and toward its 50-day moving average (34.94) in sympathy with Kohl's. Gap (GPS 16.70, -0.60, -3.4%): approaching its October low after Kohl's disappointing results. TJX (TJX 60.68, +1.13, +1.9%): touched a fresh record after better than expected Q3 results overshadowed below-consensus Q4 EPS guidance. Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL 119.72, +1.32, +1.1%): bucking the overall trend in the sector.09:46SCANX Earnings mvoersJKS +13.79% WUBA +7.04% NJR +3.91% CRMT +3.57% TJX +2.82% DAVA +2.24% ASND +2.07% ESE +1.57%KSS -15.96% PPDF -7.14% HD -5.30% ASH -4.63% MMS -2.59% BILI -2.32% WWD -2.00% ZTO -1.29% KRNT -1.30% TDG -0.78% ALV -0.56% MDT -0.36%09:41WRAPX Opening Market Summary: Stock market opens slightly higher, retail dragsThe major indices open slightly higher at new all-time highs. The S&P 500 is up 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.3%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows financials (+0.4%) and information technology (+0.3%) leading the early advance. Conversely, the utilities (-0.6%) and consumer discretionary (-0.4%) sectors underperform, with the latter pressured by Home Depot (HD 228.90, -9.94, -4.2%) following its earnings results and guidance.The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 44.37, -0.45, -1.0%) is being dragged lower by shares of Kohl's (KSS 49.48, -8.86, -15.1%) after the company missed earnings estimates and lowered its FY20 EPS below consensus.U.S. Treasuries are little changed. The 2-yr yield is up one basis point to 1.60%, and the 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.80%. The U.S. Dollar Index is unchanged at 97.79. WTI crude is down 1.9% to $56.06/bbl.09:29WIRES On The WiresOmeros (OMER) announced new findings on GPR174, its novel cancer immunotherapy target, demonstrating that GPR174-deficiency enhances anti-tumor immune responses in animals. The studies were conducted in mouse models of melanoma and of colon carcinoma, each of which was modified to partially deplete regulatory T cells; GPR174 deficiency in these mice resulted in significantly reduced tumor growth and improved survival of the animals (p=0.006 in melanoma; p=0.03 in colon cancer) versus normal mice.XBiotech (XBIT) today announced rapid enrollment in its Phase 2 clinical study evaluating bermekimab in patients with moderate to severe Hidradenitis Suppurativa.

The company will outline the details of a 2020-2029 operating and financial plan and will provide region and asset reviews of its global portfolio. Highlights of the 10-year plan include free cash flow of approximately $50 bln, a forecast for underlying compound annual production growth averaging over 3%, and a projection for $30 bln in share buybacks over the 10-year period.09:16ALV Autoliv provides mid-term and long-term targets at Investor Day (82.22 )Medium term (up to 3-5 years) targets: On average to grow sales organically* by 3-4% more per year than light vehicle production growth and the company aim to improve its adjusted operating margin* to around 12%, based on an assumed average light vehicle production growth of 1-2% per year.Long term (beyond 5 years) ambitions: Our ambition remains to grow at least in line with our market. When our ongoing and planned strategic initiatives are fully implemented, the ambition is to further increase our earnings capacity, to an adjusted operating margin* of around 13%.For 2020, Co states, "Potential tailwinds include raw material costs, organic growth from market share gains, positive impacts from ongoing cost reduction programs and a stabilization of light vehicle production.

In the primary endpoint responder analysis, 96.7% (95% CI: 94.9%, 97.9%) of men receiving once-daily, oral relugolix achieved sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels. A responder was defined as achieving and maintaining testosterone suppression to less than or equal to 50 ng/dL from Week 5 through Week 48. For the study to be successful, the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of the response rate had to be at least 90%.The study achieved all six key secondary endpoints, including superiority to leuprolide acetate on rapid suppression of testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA), all with p-values < 0.0001.Five key secondary endpoints demonstrated superiority to leuprolide acetate, including rapid suppression of testosterone at Day 4 and Day 15, profound suppression of testosterone at Day 15, rapid suppression of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at Day 15, and suppression of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) at Week 24 (all p-values < 0.0001). In addition, relugolix demonstrated non-inferiority to leuprolide acetate on sustained testosterone suppression through 48 weeks (96.7% vs. 88.8%, respectively) with a between-group difference of 7.9% (95% CI: 4.1%,11.8%), the primary endpoint required for regulatory submissions outside of the U.S. In addition, the pharmacodynamic results showed no testosterone flare after initiation of relugolix and mean testosterone levels returned to normal levels within 90 days after treatment discontinuation.A New Drug Application (NDA) submission is expected in the second quarter of 2020.A conference call and webcast are to be held today at 8:30 a.m. EST / 5:30 a.m. PST.07:32SRRK Scholar Rock announces preliminary pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic results from the TOPAZ Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial of SRK-015 for the treatment of patients with spinal muscular atrophy (7.20 )The planned preliminary PK/PD analysis, which includes data from 29 patients with SMA across all three cohorts, showed dose-proportional drug exposure and demonstrated target engagement, as evidenced by dose-dependent increases of up to 100-fold in the serum levels of latent myostatin following SRK-015 treatment (2 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg doses).

Khoury, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of KLX Energy Services commented, "Contemporaneously with the abrupt decline in activity, we took steps to align our business with current customer demand. Specifically, we implemented an approximate 17 percent reduction in force, as compared with the Company's July 31, 2019 staffing levels, consistent with the approximate 18 percent sequential quarterly decline in our third quarter revenues. We aggressively cut costs in every area of our business, and we warm stacked the vast majority of our Permian based wireline assets. As a result of these and other measures, we expect to take a third quarter charge of approximately $13 million. Notwithstanding the precipitous decline in industry conditions, we generated approximately $44 million in cash flow from operations and approximately $31 million in free cash flow, bringing our cash balance to approximately $121 million for the quarter ended October 31, 2019. In addition, our $100 million credit facility remains undrawn.""The abrupt deterioration in industry conditions, which accelerated through the end of our third quarter, was driven by a sharp sequential quarterly decline in U.S. land rig count and an unprecedented decline in active frac spreads from the second quarter to the third quarter. In fact, there was a significant sequential decline in hydraulic fracturing activity during each month of the third quarter. The decline in Exploration & Production activity resulted in lower demand levels and lower current and expected revenues for our business, which led the Company to accelerate its annual testing for asset impairment into the third quarter. While the Company has not yet completed this analysis, we expect to report a non-cash asset impairment charge in the range of approximately $45 million to $60 million. The Company is in the process of finalizing the actual amount of the impairment charge, which will be completed prior to reporting its third quarter financial results."06:00CEO CNOOC Ltd names President Xu Keqiang as CEO (152.50 )06:00TRP TC Energy to provide financial update and review strategic plans at Investor Day, reaffirms expectation to grow common share dividend at an annual rate of 8-10% through 2021 (51.44 )"Our $100 billion portfolio of high-quality, long-life energy infrastructure assets are expected to generate record financial results again in 2019 underpinned by strong market fundamentals," said Russ Girling, TC Energy's president and chief executive officer. "Looking forward, we continue to advance $30 billion of commercially secured projects that will expand and extend our asset footprint across North America."As those projects enter service, TC Energy expects comparable earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to exceed $10 billion in 2022. This represents an increase of more than 16 per cent when compared to comparable EBITDA of $8.6 billion in 2018 despite significant asset sales that have accelerated the strengthening of the company's balance sheet. Notably, approximately 95 per cent of comparable EBITDA is expected to come from regulated assets or long-term contracts. At the same time, the company continues to methodically advance more than $20 billion of projects under development including Keystone XL and the Bruce Power life extension program. Success in advancing these and other organic growth opportunities that are expected to emanate from TC Energy's five operating businesses across North America would add to the company's growth outlook."Based on the confidence we have in our business plans, we are reaffirming that we expect to grow our common share dividend at an annual rate of eight to 10 per cent through 2021," added Girling. "Our dividend outlook is supported by expected growth in earnings and cash flow and in line with our historically strong dividend coverage ratios."06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- World markets continue climb higher; US Futures in record territoryThe global equity markets are mostly higher once again with US Futures venturing into all-time high territory for a second straight night.

These utility operations have customers in eight states and expect customer growth to continue at a rate of 1-2% annually. The anticipated investment reflects opportunities to improve the safety and reliability of the company's systems. Also included in the utility's five-year program is the construction of an 88-megawatt simple-cycle, natural gas-fired combustion turbine near Mandan, North Dakota.The capital investment plan at the pipeline and midstream business reflects a focus on organic growth. This includes the Demicks Lake Expansion project under construction in North Dakota, which is expected to be in service in the first quarter of 2020 and as designed will increase capacity by 175 mln cubic feet per day. The North Bakken Expansion project is also included in the capital forecast. As designed, this project in the heart of the Bakken will increase capacity by an estimated 350 mln cubic feet per day and is expected to be in service in late 2021. This business is exploring additional organic growth projects that, if executed, would be incremental to the capital investment plan. Natural gas production continues at record levels in the Bakken, driving the need for additional infrastructure.At the company's construction materials and services businesses, the capital expenditures forecast is focused primarily on organic expansion opportunities, normal equipment and plant replacements and upgrades. Included in the outlined forecast is the development of Knife River's Honey Creek Quarry in Texas, which includes the construction of a rock-crushing plant and the purchase of aggregate railcars. The company expects public sector workload growth as new state and local infrastructure spending initiatives are introduced.16:44ZG Zillow announced that Greg Schwartz, president of media and marketplaces, is stepping down to take a professional break (39.74 +0.23)The businesses that currently report to Schwartz in the Mortgages and Internet, Media and Technology (IMT) segments are being transitioned to other senior executives.

The Russell 2000 (-0.3%) closed in negative territory.The day began with the market digesting a tweet from a China-based CNBC reporter, who said she was informed by a Chinese government source that Beijing is pessimistic about a trade deal because President Trump hasn't supported a tariff rollback. Based on the modest losses and ensuing price action, the market presumably remained optimistic about a Phase One agreement.The large-cap indices eased their way into positive territory thanks to the turnarounds in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (+0.3%), information technology (+0.3%), and communication services (+0.3%) sectors. Consistent leaders included the consumer staples (+0.5%) and real estate (+0.5%) sectors, as the negative-sounding trade headline likely fostered some conservative-minded interest.The trade-sensitive industrials (-0.3%) and materials (-0.2%) sectors were among today's laggards, but their losses were small compared to the 1.3% drop in the energy sector, which was pressured by the decline in oil prices ($57.04, -0.71, -1.2%).Generally, there wasn't any concerted effort to sell a market trading at all-time highs, but investors weren't eager to embrace risk, either. The trend has been positive, which has likely drawn in some reluctant investors into the market, and today simply may have been a natural breather for a market breaking out to new highs.Notable corporate news included HP Inc. (HPQ 20.01, -0.17, -0.8%) turning down the takeover bid from Xerox (XRX 39.30, +0.36, +0.9%). HP remained open to a deal, though. Netflix (NFLX 302.57, +7.54, +2.6%) shares outperformed on speculation that either Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman built a large stake in the company.U.S. Treasuries extended last week's advance, pushing yields slightly lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points to 1.81%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 97.80.Separately, the NAHB Housing Market Index for November declined to 70 from 71 in October.

SPE now owns 100% of the multimedia entertainment company. Following the transaction, the Game Show Network channel will continue to be carried on DIRECTV.The sale is consistent with AT&T's strategy to monetize non-strategic assets as it de-levers its balance sheet and begins to retire shares. Prior to the transaction, SPE owned a 58% stake in Game Show Network, and AT&T owned the remaining 42%. In connection with the transaction, AT&T received approx. $500 mln, including proceeds for its equity stake valued at $380 mln (before transaction-related adjustments) and dividends of approx. $130 mln.

Both the Dow and S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (-0.8%), meanwhile, can attribute their underperformance to Home Depot.The S&P 500 energy sector (-1.1%) is down even more amid a sharp decline in oil prices ($55.69, -1.45, -2.5%), but the market isn't getting concerned about the U.S. consumer based on a couple of reports. Instead, the market is hanging in there amid gains in the heavily-weighted health care (+0.3%), information technology (+0.1%), and financials (+0.1%) sectors.The consensus among many investors is that the market is due for a pullback, but the absence of one has created a sort of pain trade for investors fearful of missing out on further gains. The S&P 500 was down just 0.3% at its low earlier today before a buy-the-dip effort briefly brought it back above its flat line.Separately, shares of AT&T (T 37.65, -1.99) are down 5.0% after the stock was downgraded to Sell from Neutral at MoffettNathanson with a price target of $30. Shares of Slack (WORK 20.88, -2.24, -9.7%) have dropped 10% on news that Microsoft's (MSFT 150.99, +0.65, +0.4%) competitive product, Teams, has increased daily active users by nearly 50% since July.In the Treasury market, demand for longer-dated bonds has caused some minor curve-flattening activity. The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.79%. The U.S. Dollar Index is flat at 97.79.Today's economic calendar was limited to Housing Starts and Building Permits for October:Total housing starts increased 3.8% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.314 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.300 million) while total building permits increased 5.0% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.461 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.365 million).There was a sizable jump in starts (+8.6%) and permits (+8.2%) for multi-unit dwellings, yet the key takeaway from the report is that starts (+2.0%) and permits (+3.2%) increased for single-family units in an inventory-constrained environment for single-family homes.12:45MRK Merck increases quarterly dividend to $0.61 from $0.55/share (84.21 +0.08)12:25SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Myovant Sciences (MYOV) gains on Phase 3 relugolix data -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersMYOV (10.86 +79.21%): Announced results from the Phase 3 HERO study of once-daily, oral relugolix in men with advanced prostate cancer; the trial met its primary efficacy endpoint and all six key secondary endpoints -- in the primary endpoint responder analysis, 96.7% of men receiving the relugolix regimen achieved sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels through 48 weeks. These results, noted co, support NDA submission to the FDA in Q2 of 2020 and future regulatory submissions in Europe and Japan. Jumps to six-month highs. ATNX (15.12 +32.12%): Moves to its highest levels since August after previewing its presentation at the 2019 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium; co's abstract for the Phase 3 study of oral paclitaxel and encequidar in metastatic breast cancer has been selected for the conference's press program. DRNA (23.72 +10.89%): Price target raised to $30 from $22 at H.C. Wainwright, citing a positive view of co's new strategic alliance with Novo Nordisk (NVO), which was announced yesterday; the firm views the deal as underscoring a "Burgeoning RNAi Powerhouse." Continued strength sees the stock touch up to new four-year highs.Small Cap LosersI (6.19 -22.91%): Continued weakness following FCC Chairman Ajit Pai's announcement midday yesterday of support for a public auction of 280 megahertz of the C-band spectrum; the C-Band Alliance, a satellite operator group of which co is a member, issued a statement yesterday following the Chairman's communication, noting, among other comments, that the announcement "does not address the critical involvement of the incumbent satellite operators in executing the complex task of reconfiguring and transitioning their networks." Following yesterday's developments, the stock was downgraded to In-Line from Outperform at Evercore ISI, which also cut co's price target to $11 from $38; JPMorgan lowered co's target to $9 from $22. Wells Fargo noted that embrace of a public auction "does not seem to offer much potential capital to the satellite players" and also noted the impact that the public approach will have on timing, saying, "Getting this spectrum auctioned off in 1H 2020 (as the C-Band Alliance plan had outlined) seems naively optimistic at this point." The stock again records new 52-week lows, now down circa 76% month-to-date. PPDF (2.53 -11.85%): Missed estimates for Q3 EPS and revs (+35.0% yr/yr to RMB1.51 bln). Cumulative registered users increased to approx. 102.8 mln while cumulative number of borrowers reached 17.4 mln as of September 30; number of unique borrowers increased +28.6% yr/yr. Co expects total loan origination volume between RMB16-19 bln for Q4. Co also noted that it plans to discontinue its online information intermediary business between individual borrowers and individual investors. At all-time lows. PLUG (3.33 -11.12%): Pulls back from yesterday's four-year highs with above average volume; factoring in today's move, the stock continues to trade higher by circa +26% month-to-date.11:59SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (95) outpacing new lows (63) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: AAPL, AES, AGEN, AIZ, ALL, AMD, AME, AMED, ANSS, AON, APD, ARDX, ARMK, ARVN, ARWR, ATEC, ATRS, AVGO, AZO, BIO, BIP, BLDR, BLK, BLMN, BRO, CACI, CATM, CDE, CDW, CLH, CPRT, CRSP, CSGS, CSL, CVNA, CZR, DEA, DEI, DKS, DOX, DRNA, DXCM, EIDX, EPAM, ESE, EVRI, EW, FISV, FNF, FTNT, GLIBA, GPN, HALO, HIG, INFO, INOV, INST, KMX, KRG, KRTX, LDOS, LIN, LPT, LULU, LXP, LZB, MCO, MDCO, MGM, MMC, MSCI, MSFT, NSIT, OC, PFSI, PLMR, PRFT, RDN, RLI, SEM, SHOO, SPGI, TDY, TJX, TMO, TROW, TRU, UI, USB, VAC, VRTX, XBIT, XPEL, XRX, ZYMEStocks that traded to 52 week lows: AM, AR, ASIX, BCEI, BIG, BTU, BXC, CDEV, CEIX, CHK, CNP, CPS, CRZO, CTRA, CVEO, DCP, ENBL, ENLC, EQM, ETRN, EXPE, EXTN, EZPW, FLNT, FOSL, FPRX, FTSI, GLOG, GLOP, GSM, GTE, GTLS, I, IIVI, KLXE, LBRT, MDR, MPLX, NEWM, NVEE, OAS, PAA, PAGP, PBT, PNNT, PRMW, QUAD, RBBN, RVLV, SDRL, SINA, SMLP, SNH, TCO, TCS, TDW, TH, TRIP, UPWK, VG, VNOM, WES, WLLThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: CABO, FWONA, IHC, LACQ, NWPX, PLOW, WDFCETFs that traded to 52 week highs: CUT, DIA, EWC, EWG, EWQ, EZU, FAN, GREK, IAI, IOO, ITA, IWF, IYF, IYG, IYH, IYJ, KCE, OEF, QQQ, SPY, UYG, VGK, VTI, XLKETFs that traded to 52 week lows: AMJ, VXX, XES11:53TALKX Market Briefing: Price action getting technicalThere hasn't been a lot of conviction in the morning session, evidenced by an S&P 500 that is basically unchanged through the first two hours of trading.Retail stocks have been a notable pocket of weakness following the disappointments from Home Depot (HD 226.88, -11.98, -5.0%) and Kohl's (KSS 48.21, -10.19, -17.5%). Their weakness has acted as a weight on the broader market, yet the movement of the S&P 500 index has been largely a function of technical price action.Briefing.com's Technical Take page identified 3127 as a secondary resistance level for the S&P 500. That level was tested with the opening move (3127.64) but quickly failed as steady selling eventually dropped the S&P 500 back to 3113.46 at this morning's low, which was reached just before 11:00 a.m. ET. That level fell within a secondary support level (3115/3112) that was also identified on the Technical Take Page.Traders, therefore, appear to be respecting these technical boundaries for now on a day that is devoid of any major macro news drivers, particularly as they relate to trade, and as it is suggested that the market is short-term overextended and due for a pullback.The Russell 2000 is up 0.4%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.3%; the S&P 500 is unchanged; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.4%.11:51QCOM Qualcomm issues 3 year targets at Analyst Day (88.73 -1.78)From CFO's presentation at Analyst Day:3 year targets as earnings mix shift to QCT from QTLRevenue: QCT segment SAM: 10% CAGR, grow faster than SAM and Apple product revenues QTL: current run rate + Huawei resolution Operating margin: QCT grows to >20%; QTL: ~70%Summarizing Qualcomm opportunities: Mature handset industry and current macroeconomic environment; Accelerated 5G migration compared to 4G; Mobile handset platform: 4G->5G transition, RF Front-End growth; Growth beyond mobile: Auto, IoT, Compute, ADAS, Cloud/Edge AI 75+ 5G licenses including key anchor agreements.Grow earnings faster than revenues.

The ACHIEVE II trial evaluated ubrogepant 50 mg and 25 mg, compared with placebo, across a wide range of clinical endpoints, including the co-primary endpoints of pain freedom (no pain) and freedom from the most bothersome migraine-associated symptom at two hours post-initial dose. For the two co-primary endpoints, ubrogepant 50 mg and 25 mg showed statistically significant higher response rates for pain freedom at two hours (21.8% for 50 mg, 20.7% for 25 mg and 14.3% for placebo), and the 50 mg dose demonstrated statistically significant higher response rates for the freedom from the most bothersome migraine-associated symptom at two hours (38.9% for 50 mg and 27.4% for placebo). Additionally, ubrogepant 50 mg was statistically superior to placebo in the absence of light sensitivity (43.8% for 50 mg and 35.5% for placebo) and sound sensitivity (54.1% for 50 mg and 46.3% for placebo).FDA action on the NDA for ubrogepant is expected in December 2019, potentially making it the first oral CGRP to address unmet patient needs in acute treatment of migraine and the first FDA-approved gepant.11:21XLE Sector Briefing: Energy (58.71 -0.65)The energy sector (-1.1%) sits at the bottom of today's sector standings after showing relative weakness yesterday. The growth-sensitive sector is now down 2.4% since Friday versus a much more modest 0.1% week-to-date downtick in the S&P 500. Factors contributing to the underperformance:Notable pressure on crude oil. The energy component is down more than $1.00 today (-2.3%) and down $2.01 (-3.5%) since Friday's settlement. This has sent the price of oil beneath its 200-day moving average (57.37) with the 50-day average (55.65) looming just below. Tax-loss related selling. The energy sector has been the weakest performer of 2019, meaning the group contains a fair share of names that have underperformed since the end of 2018. These names are more likely to be sold before the end of 2019 as investors look to reduce some of the tax impact of taking capital gains this year.Notable movers:HollyFrontier (HFC 51.56, -2.35, -4.4%): falling to its lowest level since early October. The company announced a new project and a new buyback authorization yesterday morning. Noble Energy (NBL 19.41, -0.51, -2.6%): nearing its 2019 low after finding resistance at its 50-day moving average (21.34) at the end of last week. Marathon Petroleum (MPC 62.13, -1.88, -2.9%): falling to its 50-day moving average (61.89). Occidental Petroleum (OXY 38.20, -1.10, -2.8%): on the verge of hitting fresh low for the year. Helmerich & Payne (HP 37.79, -1.05, -2.7%): nearing its 2019 low after being downgraded to Hold from Buy at Argus. ConocoPhillips (COP 57.26, +0.56, +1.0%): best performing sector component, reclaiming its 50-day moving average (57.03). The company is hosting its analyst & investor meeting today, where it is expected to reaffirm its commitment to a strategy unveiled in 2016.10:35OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:DO Jan20 5 calls are seeing interest with 4230 contracts trading vs. open int of 0, pushing implied vol up around 10 points to ~87%.

That corner is the retail industry, which has been broadsided today by disappointing earnings/sales results and guidance from Home Depot (HD 226.60, -12.25, -5.1%) and Kohl's (KSS 48.09, -10.31, -17.7%).The weakness in HD is having an outsized impact on the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector (-0.9%); meanwhile, the combined impact of the disappointments from these well-known retailers is creating some angst about consumer spending activity entering the all-important holiday selling season.That angst is showing up in a sympathy trade that has knocked down the prices of many other retail stocks today, like Macy's (M 15.36, -1.51, -9.0%), Best Buy (BBY 75.61, -1.68, -2.2%), and Gap (GPS 16.62, -0.68, -3.9%) to name a few. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 43.97, -0.85, -1.9%) reflects the broader trend of underperformance for the retailers in today's market action.Those issues notwithstanding, the broader market is still holding up just fine as it is drawing influential support from the information technology (+0.3%), healthcare (+0.3%), and financial (+0.2%) sectors, which continue to attract interest from value and growth-minded investors alike.Separately, the market's overall resilience to selling pressure remains a tying factor for a number of participants who are fearful of missing out on further gains. That fear, ostensibly, is lending some buying support that has kept downside pressure in check.The Russell 2000 is up 0.2%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.1%; the S&P 500 is down 0.1%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%.10:00XLY Sector Briefing: Consumer Discretionary (120.74 -1.05)The consumer discretionary sector (-0.8%) represents an early pocket of relative weakness in a flat market. This makes for a continuation of this month's underperformance, which has the sector trading down 0.3% since the end of October versus a 2.8% gain in the S&P 500. Factors contributing to today's underperformance:Home Depot's (HD 227.72, -11.13, -4.7%) Q3 earnings report, which showed lower than expected revenue and lowered comparable sales guidance for FY20. Granted, Home Depot met Q3 EPS expectations, but the revenue shortfall and lowered comparable sales guidance have pressured the stock from a record high. Furthermore, the outlook is leading to some questions about the overall strength of consumer spending. Disappointing Q3 results and lowered FY20 guidance from Kohl's (KSS 48.86, -9.54, -16.4%), fueling worries that other apparel retailers could also report underwhelming results.Notable movers:Home Depot (HD 227.72, -11.13, -4.7%): falling back below its 50-day moving average (232.37) after setting a fresh record high on Monday. Kohl's (KSS 48.86, -9.54, -16.4%): falling to its lowest level in more than a month in response to weaker than expected quarterly results. Macy's (M 15.35, -1.53, -9.0%): sliding back below its 50-day moving average (15.76) after weak results from Kohl's. Nordstrom (JWN 35.10, -2.78, -7.3%): falling below its 200-day moving average (36.33) and toward its 50-day moving average (34.94) in sympathy with Kohl's. Gap (GPS 16.70, -0.60, -3.4%): approaching its October low after Kohl's disappointing results. TJX (TJX 60.68, +1.13, +1.9%): touched a fresh record after better than expected Q3 results overshadowed below-consensus Q4 EPS guidance. Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL 119.72, +1.32, +1.1%): bucking the overall trend in the sector.09:46SCANX Earnings mvoersJKS +13.79% WUBA +7.04% NJR +3.91% CRMT +3.57% TJX +2.82% DAVA +2.24% ASND +2.07% ESE +1.57%KSS -15.96% PPDF -7.14% HD -5.30% ASH -4.63% MMS -2.59% BILI -2.32% WWD -2.00% ZTO -1.29% KRNT -1.30% TDG -0.78% ALV -0.56% MDT -0.36%09:41WRAPX Opening Market Summary: Stock market opens slightly higher, retail dragsThe major indices open slightly higher at new all-time highs. The S&P 500 is up 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.3%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows financials (+0.4%) and information technology (+0.3%) leading the early advance. Conversely, the utilities (-0.6%) and consumer discretionary (-0.4%) sectors underperform, with the latter pressured by Home Depot (HD 228.90, -9.94, -4.2%) following its earnings results and guidance.The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 44.37, -0.45, -1.0%) is being dragged lower by shares of Kohl's (KSS 49.48, -8.86, -15.1%) after the company missed earnings estimates and lowered its FY20 EPS below consensus.U.S. Treasuries are little changed.

Potential headwinds include lower inflator replacement sales and higher depreciation and amortization. Considering these potential tailwinds and headwinds we expect a year over year improvement in adjusted operating margin*, absent unforeseen events."09:14WRAPX S&P futures vs fair value: +7.60.

In the primary endpoint responder analysis, 96.7% (95% CI: 94.9%, 97.9%) of men receiving once-daily, oral relugolix achieved sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels. A responder was defined as achieving and maintaining testosterone suppression to less than or equal to 50 ng/dL from Week 5 through Week 48. For the study to be successful, the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of the response rate had to be at least 90%.The study achieved all six key secondary endpoints, including superiority to leuprolide acetate on rapid suppression of testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA), all with p-values <0.0001.Five key secondary endpoints demonstrated superiority to leuprolide acetate, including rapid suppression of testosterone at Day 4 and Day 15, profound suppression of testosterone at Day 15, rapid suppression of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at Day 15, and suppression of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) at Week 24 (all p-values <0.0001). In addition, relugolix demonstrated non-inferiority to leuprolide acetate on sustained testosterone suppression through 48 weeks (96.7% vs. 88.8%, respectively) with a between-group difference of 7.9% (95% CI: 4.1%,11.8%), the primary endpoint required for regulatory submissions outside of the U.S. In addition, the pharmacodynamic results showed no testosterone flare after initiation of relugolix and mean testosterone levels returned to normal levels within 90 days after treatment discontinuation.A New Drug Application (NDA) submission is expected in the second quarter of 2020.A conference call and webcast are to be held today at 8:30 a.m. EST / 5:30 a.m. PST.07:32SRRK Scholar Rock announces preliminary pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic results from the TOPAZ Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial of SRK-015 for the treatment of patients with spinal muscular atrophy (7.20 )The planned preliminary PK/PD analysis, which includes data from 29 patients with SMA across all three cohorts, showed dose-proportional drug exposure and demonstrated target engagement, as evidenced by dose-dependent increases of up to 100-fold in the serum levels of latent myostatin following SRK-015 treatment (2 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg doses).

Khoury, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of KLX Energy Services commented, "Contemporaneously with the abrupt decline in activity, we took steps to align our business with current customer demand. Specifically, we implemented an approximate 17 percent reduction in force, as compared with the Company's July 31, 2019 staffing levels, consistent with the approximate 18 percent sequential quarterly decline in our third quarter revenues. We aggressively cut costs in every area of our business, and we warm stacked the vast majority of our Permian based wireline assets. As a result of these and other measures, we expect to take a third quarter charge of approximately $13 million. Notwithstanding the precipitous decline in industry conditions, we generated approximately $44 million in cash flow from operations and approximately $31 million in free cash flow, bringing our cash balance to approximately $121 million for the quarter ended October 31, 2019. In addition, our $100 million credit facility remains undrawn.""The abrupt deterioration in industry conditions, which accelerated through the end of our third quarter, was driven by a sharp sequential quarterly decline in U.S. land rig count and an unprecedented decline in active frac spreads from the second quarter to the third quarter. In fact, there was a significant sequential decline in hydraulic fracturing activity during each month of the third quarter. The decline in Exploration & Production activity resulted in lower demand levels and lower current and expected revenues for our business, which led the Company to accelerate its annual testing for asset impairment into the third quarter. While the Company has not yet completed this analysis, we expect to report a non-cash asset impairment charge in the range of approximately $45 million to $60 million. The Company is in the process of finalizing the actual amount of the impairment charge, which will be completed prior to reporting its third quarter financial results."06:00CEO CNOOC Ltd names President Xu Keqiang as CEO (152.50 )06:00TRP TC Energy to provide financial update and review strategic plans at Investor Day, reaffirms expectation to grow common share dividend at an annual rate of 8-10% through 2021 (51.44 )"Our $100 billion portfolio of high-quality, long-life energy infrastructure assets are expected to generate record financial results again in 2019 underpinned by strong market fundamentals," said Russ Girling, TC Energy's president and chief executive officer. "Looking forward, we continue to advance $30 billion of commercially secured projects that will expand and extend our asset footprint across North America."As those projects enter service, TC Energy expects comparable earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to exceed $10 billion in 2022. This represents an increase of more than 16 per cent when compared to comparable EBITDA of $8.6 billion in 2018 despite significant asset sales that have accelerated the strengthening of the company's balance sheet. Notably, approximately 95 per cent of comparable EBITDA is expected to come from regulated assets or long-term contracts. At the same time, the company continues to methodically advance more than $20 billion of projects under development including Keystone XL and the Bruce Power life extension program. Success in advancing these and other organic growth opportunities that are expected to emanate from TC Energy's five operating businesses across North America would add to the company's growth outlook."Based on the confidence we have in our business plans, we are reaffirming that we expect to grow our common share dividend at an annual rate of eight to 10 per cent through 2021," added Girling. "Our dividend outlook is supported by expected growth in earnings and cash flow and in line with our historically strong dividend coverage ratios."06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- World markets continue climb higher; US Futures in record territoryThe global equity markets are mostly higher once again with US Futures venturing into all-time high territory for a second straight night.

The Russell 2000 (-0.3%) closed in negative territory.The day began with the market digesting a tweet from a China-based CNBC reporter, who said she was informed by a Chinese government source that Beijing is pessimistic about a trade deal because President Trump hasn't supported a tariff rollback. Based on the modest losses and ensuing price action, the market presumably remained optimistic about a Phase One agreement.The large-cap indices eased their way into positive territory thanks to the turnarounds in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary (+0.3%), information technology (+0.3%), and communication services (+0.3%) sectors. Consistent leaders included the consumer staples (+0.5%) and real estate (+0.5%) sectors, as the negative-sounding trade headline likely fostered some conservative-minded interest.The trade-sensitive industrials (-0.3%) and materials (-0.2%) sectors were among today's laggards, but their losses were small compared to the 1.3% drop in the energy sector, which was pressured by the decline in oil prices ($57.04, -0.71, -1.2%).Generally, there wasn't any concerted effort to sell a market trading at all-time highs, but investors weren't eager to embrace risk, either. The trend has been positive, which has likely drawn in some reluctant investors into the market, and today simply may have been a natural breather for a market breaking out to new highs.Notable corporate news included HP Inc. (HPQ 20.01, -0.17, -0.8%) turning down the takeover bid from Xerox (XRX 39.30, +0.36, +0.9%). HP remained open to a deal, though. Netflix (NFLX 302.57, +7.54, +2.6%) shares outperformed on speculation that either Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman built a large stake in the company.U.S. Treasuries extended last week's advance, pushing yields slightly lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.59%, and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points to 1.81%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 97.80.Separately, the NAHB Housing Market Index for November declined to 70 from 71 in October.

SPE now owns 100% of the multimedia entertainment company. Following the transaction, the Game Show Network channel will continue to be carried on DIRECTV.The sale is consistent with AT&T's strategy to monetize non-strategic assets as it de-levers its balance sheet and begins to retire shares. Prior to the transaction, SPE owned a 58% stake in Game Show Network, and AT&T owned the remaining 42%. In connection with the transaction, AT&T received approx. $500 mln, including proceeds for its equity stake valued at $380 mln (before transaction-related adjustments) and dividends of approx. $130 mln.

On the occasion of Thanksgiving, a police officer in Oklahoma.Chinese commentators also said Batwoman's black clothing and masked face referenced the de facto uniform of the Hong Kong protests - a black t-shirt, black pants, and a gas mask.'No matter what the reason, to put an image like this up at a sensitive time like this means you have a death wish, ' another added. "Aquaman" broke Chinese box office records last December to take in a cumulative $292 million, while "Shazam!' made $43.8 million in April".Since the image was posted, Weibo and WeChat has seen a wave of negative comments about the art and there have been calls for a boycott of DC.'Really disappointed on @DCComics, ' tweeted one user.An additional social media user said: 'Apparently China rules the world now.China has proven itself to be an increasingly valuable market to Hollywood production studios, including DC Comics' parent company Warner Bros.Load-Date: December 2, 2019End of Document

KUALA LUMPUR SUMMIT: A CHALLENGE TO SAUDI LEADERSHIP?States News ServiceDecember 10, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1448 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Middle East Institute:Giorgio Cafiero, Khalid Al-JaberOn Nov. 23, Malaysia's prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, announced that his country will stage an Islamic summit in Kuala Lumpur from Dec. 19-21. The event, on the theme of "The Role of Development in Achieving National Security," will feature representatives from the host country as well as Indonesia, Pakistan, Qatar, and Turkey. Around 450 leaders, scholars, clerics, and thinkers from 52 countries will attend, along with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, Indonesian President Joko Widodo, and Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan.Mahathir said that the summit will be the first step toward finding solutions to the Islamic world's ills, and he asked for international support for this effort. Problems that will be discussed include the displacement of Muslims worldwide, food security, national/cultural identity, and Islamophobia. Other pillars of the summit will be technology, trade, internet governance, and security.Mahathir lamented the fact that "failed states" and underdeveloped ones exist throughout the Islamic world. "Why is there this problem? There must be a reason behind this. We can only know the reason if we get the thinkers, the scholars, and the leaders to give their observations and viewpoints," he said.According to the Malaysian news agency Bernama, Mahathir devised plans for the summit while meeting with Turkey and Pakistan's heads of state at the UN General Assembly in New York last year. Reportedly, Malaysian Foreign Minister Saifuddin Abdullah and his deputy, Marzuki Yahya, recently visited several Muslim-majority countries including Oman and Iran to invite other leaders as well.In the past, Mahathir has received praise from officials in Ankara and Islamabad for his outspokenness on a number of issues on which his positions align closely with those of Turkey and Pakistan. These include the Palestinian question, the plight of Muslims in Indian-administered Kashmir, and the human rights of the Rohingya in Myanmar. According to Bernama, the summit "aims to revive Islamic civilization, deliberate [over] and find new and workable solutions for problems afflicting the Muslim world, contribute [to] the improvement of the state of affairs among Muslims and Muslim nations, and form a global network between Islamic leaders, intellectuals, scholars, and thinkers."According to Qatari journalist Jaber al-Harami, this month's summit in Malaysia will be about laying the foundations for an Islamic alliance that could pursue joint projects, including, eventually, the introduction of a common currency. "The initiative is ambitious, and comes in accordance with the aspirations of these countries, especially as some of them talked about the creation of an Islamic bloc focused on defense industries, development, and good governance, and Qatar had a [lead] in this aspect."It is notable that high-level representatives from Saudi Arabia, whose king is the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques (at least officially since 1986), were not invited. Further, the summit is to serve as an alternative to the Jeddah-headquartered Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), which is under Saudi Arabia's de facto leadership. Mahathir also said that this mini-Islamic conference could turn into a much grander initiative down the road, suggesting a potential challenge to the OIC.It appears that a growing number of Muslim-majority countries are becoming increasingly uncomfortable with Riyadh's leadership in Islamic affairs since the ascendancy of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MbS). From the Yemen war to a growing tacit alliance with Israel to the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, MbS has made a number of decisions that have unsettled many in Muslim-majority countries. Now leaders across the Islamic world are considering that MbS could soon become the next Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, and asking how that will impact Islamic affairs. These countries have perspectives on many issues facing Muslim countries that strongly differ from MbS' own views and priorities.Plight of the UighursPerhaps the 64,000-dollar question is whether the plight of Muslims in Xinjiang will be discussed at this month's summit. With the partial exceptions of Qatar and Turkey, none of the governments sending officials to Kuala Lumpur have taken a stance against the Chinese leadership on the oppression of Uighurs and other Muslim communities in western China. Given China's economic, diplomatic, and geopolitical weight in the broader Islamic world, with virtually all Muslim-majority countries seeing deeper ties with Beijing as serving their national interests, it is understandable why Islamabad, Jakarta, and Kuala Lumpur have refrained from publicly criticizing China on this front.This is not to say that the plight of Muslims in China is not a cause for concern among various groups within all of these countries, however. "Aside from the already well-known Palestinian, Syria, and Yemen conflicts, the issues of Uighurs and Rohingyas are still not well deliberated," said the president of the Malaysian Consultative Council for Islamic Organisation (Mapim), Mohd Azmi Abdul Hamid. "We hope that the KL summit will be successful in charting the cause for unity of the ummah, and the rebuilding of the economic standing and development of the Muslims."In fact, Azmi has challenged China's official narrative about human rights in Xinjiang, describing the situation in western China as a "historical moment of darkness" and drawing parallels between the struggle of the Uighurs and the predicament of Muslims in Kashmir and Myanmar. Mapim has called on Malaysian officials to raise Xinjiang-related issues with their Chinese counterparts.Alexander Wain, of the International Institute of Advanced Islamic Studies Malaysia, has argued that the Southeast Asian country has a special role to play in relation to the Uighurs because of China's reliance on Malaysia for trade, given the latter's proximity to the Strait of Malacca. "[Malaysia] should try to reach a resolution by raising this and making sure the Chinese government hears it," said WainNaturally, the leaders of the five countries participating in the Kuala Lumpur summit will have to strike a balance when it comes to addressing the situation in Xinjiang. Refusal to toe Beijing's line risks fueling tensions at a time when all of these states are seeking to strengthen their ties with China. By the same token, if the plight of the Uighurs is not addressed, the participants will face criticism from various Muslim voices worldwide, who may see this forum as the most appropriate venue for raising the issue.A brighter future for Muslims?Today there is much despair among the world's 1.7 billion Muslims. The hopelessness and violence in Syria, Yemen, Gaza, Iraq, Libya, and other places highlights how many dreams are shattered throughout the greater Islamic world. Growing unease with Saudi Arabia's leadership among Muslim-majority countries has contributed to a desire to see institutions and summits led by other states, which could, theoretically, provide alternative paths to solving the problems of the Islamic world. From a geopolitical perspective, the reaction from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates may be significant, as will the countries that receive invitations and ultimately end up attending the summit.No one knows what will come out of this event. However, it is probably safe to say that, at a minimum, Mahathir who is known for championing solidarity among the global ummah will strengthen his country's relations with the participating governments. The gathering will also likely boost his image as a leader who is willing to take on problems facing Muslims in a forum that is independent of Saudi influence. Yet it remains to be seen whether this summit will end up being mainly an exercise in optics and rhetoric, or a new beginning in finding ways for Muslims to exchange ideas and join together on issues where there is significant common ground.Giorgio Cafiero is a contributor at MEI and is the CEO and founder of Gulf State Analytics, a geopolitical risk consultancy based in Washington, DC.

UNITED STATES REMAINS COMMITTED TO UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTSUS Fed NewsDecember 10, 2019 Tuesday 10:21 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 HT Media Ltd. All Rights ReservedLength: 489 wordsBodyBRASILIA, Brazil, Dec. 10 -- The U.S. Embassy & Consulates in Brazil issued the following news release:In today's splintered world, it is hard to imagine that there might be a common denominator upon which all nations can agree. But International Human Rights Day reminds us that it wasn't so long ago that the world came together to do exactly that. On December 10, 1948, the United Nations unanimously adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), a set of rights to which all individuals are entitled.The word "universal" in the UDHR's title was a purposeful choice, showing that the UDHR was the product of consensus among a wide cross-section of global rights traditions. Brazil's own representative at the UN noted at the time that the Declaration did not reflect the particular view of any one people or group of people. The United States' Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the drafting committee, bringing with her the beliefs expressed in our Declaration of Independence that all persons are "endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights." Rene Cassin was a Jewish Basque from France who later received the Nobel Peace Prize for his work on the UDHR. Charles Malik was a Maronite Christian from Lebanon who fled the Nazis in the 1930s. China's Peng Chun Chang brought a strong Confucian influence to the committee.The UDHR was born of the Second World War, which showed that governments that had no regard for the rights of their citizens similarly had no reservations about immersing the world into a terrible conflict for their own twisted aims. Sadly, the news today demonstrates that some of the worst abusers of human rights were original adopters of the UDHR who committed themselves to defending those rights.In Venezuela, Maduro having plundered one of the wealthiest nations on earth, has caused nearly 20 percent of the population to flee. The brutal repression of human rights continues to this day with credible reports of extrajudicial killings, torture, and suppression of the freedoms of speech, and association.The Chinese government has forced more than one million Uighurs and members of other Muslim minority groups into internment camps in the Xinjiang region of China since April 2017. The allegations of forced labor, torture, and other inhumane conditions in the camps belie the Chinese government's false claims that the purpose of the camps is education.The Russian human rights organization Memorial now lists 315 political prisoners in Russia, up from 195 last year, and reports that 200 of them are imprisoned for exercising their freedom of religion or belief. The government increasingly restricts freedom of expression and Internet freedom, and civil society and the independent press face constant harassment, character smears, threats and violence.

The market has received trade news, earnings reports, and economic data, but none of it is having a meaningful impact on trading this morning.There was a modest advance in the futures trade last evening after a report from China indicated that top trade negotiators held a phone call, but the initial enthusiasm waned upon realization that nothing substantial was included in that report.Notable pre-market moves include earnings-driven gains in Best Buy (BBY 77.35, +3.10, +4.2%) and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS 43.89, +4.46, +11.3%), while Dollar Tree (DLTR 97.48, -14.91, -13.3%) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW 230.40, -19.40, -7.9%) are on the retreat following their results.Separately, investors received some housing data earlier. The FHFA Housing Price Index for September increased 0.6% following an unrevised 0.2% increase in August.

Futures were up as much as 0.4% above fair value after China's Xinhua News Agency reported that top trade negotiators held a phone call last evening.Both the U.S. and China reportedly reached an agreement in that call to continue to work toward resolving key issues for a Phase One trade agreement. The market, which already expects both sides to talk until a deal is reached, has justifiably tempered its initial enthusiasm but will likely continue to react to trade headlines moving forward.On the data front, investors will receive the Advance reports for International Trade in Goods, Retail Inventories, and Wholesale Inventories at 8:30 a.m. ET, followed by the FHFA Housing Price Index for September and the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for September (Briefing.com consensus 2.6%) at 9:00 a.m. ET.After the open, investors will receive the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for November (Briefing.com consensus 126.9) and the New Home Sales report for October (Briefing.com consensus 710,000) at 10:00 a.m. ET.U.S. Treasuries have extended yesterday's modest advance, pushing yields slightly lower again this morning.

Sizable M&A activity across several sectors also supported risk sentiment.The Russell 2000 rose 2.1%, climbing past its large-cap peers to close at a 52-week high.Press reports indicated that Chinese government officials called to increase penalties on IP theft, which was interpreted as a move that could help strike a Phase One deal. It should be noted that a separate report from Reuters that suggested a Phase Two deal before the 2020 election is unlikely to be reached did not have a noticeable effect on the market.The S&P 500 information technology sector (+1.4%), which typically outperforms when the prevailing view on trade is positive, led all sectors in gains amid strength in the semiconductor stocks. NVIDIA (NVDA 221.21, +10.32, +4.9%) was a notable gainer after the stock was upgraded to Overweight from Equal Weight at Morgan Stanley. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose 2.4%.The health care (+1.1%) and consumer discretionary (+0.9%) sectors also rose more than the S&P 500, while the utilities sector (-0.4%) was today's lone sector to finish in negative territory.Two of today's M&A deals were ones that were already on the market's radar: Charles Schwab (SCHW 49.31, +1.11, +2.3%) agreed to acquire TD Ameritrade (AMTD 51.78, +3.65, +7.6%) for $26 billion in an all-stock transaction, and LVMH (LVMUY 89.37, +1.98, +2.3%) agreed to acquire Tiffany & Co. (TIF 133.25, +7.74, +6.2%) for $16.2 billion in cash.New deals included Novartis (NVS 91.30, +0.82, +0.9%) agreeing to acquire The Medicines Co. (MDCO 83.80, +15.25, +22.3%) for $9.7 billion in cash and eBay (EBAY 35.85, +0.73, +2.1%) agreeing to sell StubHub to Viagogo for $4.05 billion in cash.Strikingly, U.S. Treasuries finished the session on a higher note despite the risk sentiment displayed in the stock market.
