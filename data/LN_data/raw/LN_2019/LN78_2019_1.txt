GUEST ROOM | Cornell Should Suspend Its China ProjectsCornell Daily Sun: Cornell UniversityAugust 27, 2019 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 1027 wordsByline: Magnus FiskesjöBodyThe massive scale of the Chinese atrocities in Xinjiang has become quite clear. Cornell should suspend all projects involving Chinese counterparts and undertake a transparent review to see if any ought to be terminated because they are aiding these atrocities.Since 2017, the Chinese government has carried out a mass terror campaign in the northwestern province of Xinjiang, targeting millions of ethnic-minority people and forcing them to give up their culture and religion. Those who refuse are sent to brainwashing camps, where they are tormented into denying their ethnic identity and everyday faith and told to stop speaking their own language.As I have argued elsewhere, this campaign is effectively a program of genocide. It includes a massive effort to break up families, with children confiscated and cut off from both their families and their culture. This is a mass trauma that will linger for generations. Then there is the mass detention of indigenous cultural icons, which is why the campaign is also called a "cultural genocide."Chinese universities and Chinese tech companies are entangled in all this, profiting immensely from government contracts on surveillance, enforcement, concentration camp construction, propaganda campaigns and so on.The tech giant Tencent, for example, is deeply involved in the building of China's dystopian high-tech police state. Yet Tencent's chairman was enlisted as an advisor to Cornell's China center - even invited to speak to Cornell Tech students. What programs are going on with Tencent and other "private" firms that collude with the police state, in destroying the dignity of millions of innocent people collectively punished because of their ethnicity?Some universities are already undertaking reviews to make sure they are not enabling this 21st-century tragedy. Others are already dealing with the fallout. MIT collaborated with the surveillance industry; at Yale, a genetics professor helped devise the racist profiling system China is now using against its own minorities. But huge problems remain.It's definitely not just Eric Prince's Blackwater conglomerate that is collaborating. Pension funds in New York and elsewhere are also financing the oppression. The global clothing industry is being called out for sourcing materials from forced labor in China's colony in Xinjiang. The next uproar will be about ketchup - much of the world's ketchup uses forced-labor tomatoes, including those grown by the Bingtuan, the infamous Chinese military corporation charged with colonizing Xinjiang since the 1950s.Some might say it is anti-Chinese or Sinophobic to point these things out. But that's precisely what the regime would like you to think. Chinese people are not sheep to be herded around by the Communist Party. Some Chinese people have protested their government's policies in Xinjiang, but mostly only in exile: Voicing one's opinion inside China is a different matter. Han Chinese are also being sent to the camps, alongside the million or more Uyghurs, Kazakhs and others already there.It can be dangerous outside China, too. When I spoke about the Xinjiang catastrophe at a Cornell China center event recently, pushing for a review of our China links, a Chinese man I never met grabbed my hand on my way out, shook it and said quietly: "Thank you for what you said." To speak up might be dangerous for him.Indeed, the foremost challenge with Chinese scholars and students abroad, including on Cornell's campus, is ensuring they are free to explore ideas and express opinions without fear of intrusive monitoring, punitive censorship, or threats and pressure from Chinese consulates, embassies or government-controlled "Chinese scholars and students associations."To do this, we first need to ditch blanket terms like "the Chinese" and distinguish between Chinese people and the regime under which they're suffering. We also need to find ways to protect Chinese students from being pressured into "patriotic" acts, including on-campus violence to shut down criticism of the regime, as happened in Australia and New Zealand recently, and earlier in the U.S. Cornell should make clear to those consuls, that they are not allowed to interfere on our campus.Back in 2008, my colleague at Cornell received death threats for daring to screen a film about Tibet. But we got a Cornell police officer posted in the back - and a pep talk on the freedom of speech from a University Vice President - and the event went without incident.But today, Cornell and its new China center are observing a blanket silence on the unprecedented genocide in Xinjiang. The center has a Chinese advisory board with corporate types only - no cultural figures or anyone else that could offer critical perspectives. If we want the best Chinese advice on China, why didn't we invite, say, Teng Biao, the brilliant exiled Chinese lawyer who recently lectured in our Law School?Worse, the center runs a grant program set up to self-censor. By requiring Chinese collaborators, it submits us to the Chinese government's draconian censorship machine. No Chinese scholar in China would be allowed to collaborate with outsiders on taboo topics like the Xinjiang concentration camps, forced labor or anything close. They'd lose their job if they tried.Cornell's own WeChat account was promoted by administrators at a recent China center event. We should all follow and post to it, they said. WeChat is run by Tencent; it's a police-monitored, heavily censored platform. Many people in China are in jail because they voiced opinions there - among them Zhang Haitao, who got 19 years for daring to criticize the government in Xinjiang. Other U.S. universities have already cautioned its students of the dangers of expressing themselves on WeChat, yet there's no warning to Cornellians that if you use it, you better watch yourself.I wonder if Cornell is just assuming that Cornellians automatically will know to go along with the self-censorship - that we already know to be silent. But silence is complicity.Magnus Fiskesjö is an associate professor in the department of anthropology. Comments may be sent to opinion@cornellsun.comLoad-Date: August 27, 2019End of Document

Chinese Australian writer facing possible charges after six months in China jailCNN WireJuly 19, 2019 Friday 8:12 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 946 wordsByline: By Steven Jiang, CNNDateline: BEIJING (CNN) BodyBEIJING (CNN) --  A China-born Australian writer accused by Chinese authorities of espionage has been moved to a detention center in Beijing after six months of house arrest, paving the way for formal indictment, one of his lawyers said Friday.Yang Hengjun's family had earlier told the Australian embassy in Beijing that the writer had been taken to the facility, an Australian foreign ministry spokesman confirmed in a statement Thursday.The 53-year-old writer routinely posted satirical commentaries critical of the Chinese government to his nearly 130,000 Twitter followers before his detention in January, during a visit to see family in China."Australia continues to have consular access and have again asked that (Yang) be granted immediate access to his lawyers," the Australian foreign ministry spokesperson said.Mo Shaoping, Yang's Beijing-based lawyer, told CNN on Friday that his client's detention status changed Wednesday but his case remained under investigation. Mo added that he was still not allowed to meet Yang due to the "national security" nature of his case.Yang's case has drawn widespread attention amid growing international concern over the detention of foreign citizens in China during geopolitical disputes, though China denies the arrests are politically motivated. Yang's Melbourne-based family lawyer, Robert Stary, said Wednesday that Beijing faced a Friday deadline to decide whether to charge or release the writer based on information provided by a source in China.Chinese law enforcement authorities usually have up to six months to hold suspects, but legal experts say officials can extend detentions in cases of national security.Stary said he is focusing his efforts on lobbying the Australian government to intervene on behalf of Yang's wife -- Yuan Xiaoliang -- a Chinese citizen with Australian permanent residency. Yuan went into hiding after authorities stopped her at Beijing airport as she attempted to travel to Sydney in early July, Stary said. When asked about Yang's status Wednesday, a Chinese foreign ministry official said his case was still under investigation. "China's national security agencies handle their cases in strict accordance with law and have fully guaranteed Yang's legitimate rights," said ministry spokesman Geng Shuang. "I understand that Yang is in good health."Rocky relationsYang's detention in January came amid a period of rocky relations between Beijing and Canberra. Both countries were increasingly clashing on issues ranging from China's alleged attempts to influence Australian politics, to the Australian government's decision to ban technology by Chinese company Huawei from the country's 5G mobile networks and Beijing's rising ambitions in the South Pacific.Australia isn't the only country to see its nationals arrested after falling foul of the Chinese government. Two Canadians were detained on December 10, 2018, accused of gathering and stealing "sensitive information and other intelligence" since 2017. Ottawa continues to call for the immediate release of former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor, who were arrested in May.The Canadians' detention in December came just over a week after the Canadian government arrested Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Chinese tech giant Huawei. Meng was taken into custody on December 1, 2018, in Vancouver on behalf of the United States on charges of working to evade US sanctions against Iran.Enraged by Meng's detention, the Chinese government has repeatedly called the case "political" and accused Canada and the US of "abusing their bilateral extradition treaty." Meng remains under house arrest in Vancouver while fighting extradition to the US in a Canadian court.Exit banThe exit ban faced by Yang's wife mirrors the plight of two young American siblings who have been prevented from leaving China for over a year following a family visit. Cynthia Liu, 28, and Victor Liu, 19 -- both born in the US -- are reportedly being used to pressure their high-profile fugitive father into returning to China, where he is wanted for financial crimes.In a video obtained by CNN in May, an emotional Cynthia Liu said she and her brother "wake up every morning terrified," adding that they had "never felt more exhausted, sad and hopeless."Although Beijing denies any link between its detention of foreign nationals and bilateral disputes, critics say the cases have had a "chilling effect" on how foreigners view and deal with China."You start to hear people say, If my government has frictions with China, I'd better not be in China," said Yaqiu Wang, a China researcher for the international advocacy group Human Rights Watch. "Other people feel, I'd better stay quiet and not say anything critical of the Chinese government in case something happens to me."Wang said that Chinese officials under President Xi Jinping have become "increasingly confident and aggressive" on the global stage when defending Beijing's human rights records, but urged the international community, especially Western governments, to keep pressing China on the issue.Expressing disappointment in US President Donald Trump for "using human rights as a bargaining chip" in trade negotiations with China, Wang said such moves send a wrong signal and don't help foreign citizens arbitrarily detained in China."The Chinese government is getting the message (from the US) -- 'You don't really care about human rights' -- which should be independent of other political and economic talks," she said.CNN's Angus Watson and Serenitie Wang contributed to this article.TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Good morning, everyone, happy Tuesday to you, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, August 6th, big day today after that selloff yesterday, your top stories right now, just before 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast.Markets are poised for bit of a turnaround this morning. We've got a triple-digit rally underway this morning after yesterday's broad selloff which was sparked by the Yuan, falling to an 11-year low, against the dollar. The Dow, the NASDAQ and the S&P seeing their worst day of the year yesterday, the numbers tell the story, 767 lower on the Dow.Global markets this morning are a bit better on the session this morning, although, we see that it is fractional, FT-100 up about 2 points, the CAC Quarante in Paris up 45, and the DAX Index higher by 75. In Germany, factory orders rebounded, rising 2-1/2 percent that was higher than economists were expecting.In Asia overnight, the red was across the board, it was off of the session lows, but nonetheless, the Shanghai Composite down 1-1/2 percent as was the KOSPI Index in Korea, Nikkei, also down two-thirds of a percent.U.S.-China trade turmoil turning to currency, the U.S. has designated China, a currency manipulator, after letting the Yuan depreciate, an accusation Beijing denies, what it all means for the economy and trade negotiations, coming up.Big tech, hit hard by China trade, the sector seeing the heaviest selling yesterday, with names like Facebook, Apple, Netflix, Google's parent, Alphabet, chip maker, Nvidia, among the big losers on the session, where are they headed from here, all that right here, right now, MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.And, of course, a big -- and a busy show this morning, joining the conversation this morning to talk all about the damage yesterday, FOX Business Network's Dagen McDowell, FOX Business Network's Deirdre Bolton and Forbes Media chairman, former Republican presidential candidate, Steve Forbes, also on deck this morning, FOX News senior strategic analyst and retired four-star general, Jack Keane, is here to talk Hong Kong protests which are accelerating this morning.Former Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy and the Environment, Bob Hormats is stopping by today, with the latest on China. The Allianz chief economic adviser Mohamed El-Erian, talk markets and investing after that selloff and A&W CEO, Kevin Bazner, on the minimum wage and the state of consumer today.Plus, Alpha One Capital Partners founding partner, Dan Niles, is here, to talk techs, market tumbled. Don't miss a moment of it. We've got a big three hours coming up.And this morning, we do have a bit of a rebound, Futures indicating a triple-digit gain at the start of trading, obviously not coming back all the way from that almost 7 -- almost 800-point selloff yesterday, rough session, all three major indices seeing their worse day of the year, yesterday, the U.S. throwing a counterpunch in the trade dispute with China, labelling Beijing, a currency manipulator.That was in response to the decline of the Yuan, yesterday. China has since stabilized that currency. We see a market that is trying to come back a bit today.Steve Forbes, let me get your take right away, Beijing, being a currency manipulator. What does that mean?STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA: It's really symbolic. It just means that we now have the right, in our own minds, to impose tariffs, for what they've done, take it to IMF, but in the real world, we're already doing the things that we would've gotten normally permission for from somebody -- of a foreign body.But it's a war of words, and when do have a currency, let's say a war on each country trying to make its currency less valuable to get a trade advantage. That smacks to the 1930s, bigger than neighbor policies. Hopefully, that'll stop because everyone loses in that kind of a war.BARTIROMO: Hasn't China been devaluating, regardless? I mean, yes, I know the U.S. is now calling it the currency manipulator, but this has been going on for some time?FORBES: Well, until a few years ago, China pegged the Yuan to the dollar, and we got mad at them because they -- we said, oh, the Yuan should be even more valuable. Currencies are not stocks. They're simply a measure of value.And so, the confusion on our part, and by the way, just for the record, one of the biggest currency manipulators in that sense, has been the United States, starting the early 2000s which helped give us the crisis of 2008, deliberately weakening the dollar.BARTIROMO: Yes, good point. They say they just want a strong dollar, but it's really the action that --FORBES: Well, the way they phrase it, the markets know, wink, wink, weaken the dollar.BARTIROMO: Exactly.DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: And then the PBOC governor, right, he said, oh, we would never use the Yuan as a tool in a trade war which, I think, yesterday, a lot of people just took to be P.R., right? But then, overnight, they actually did set the Yuan at a more official reference point than, I think, a lot of people had expected it.And when I was watching European trade, it seems like that was a little bit of a game-changer for those markets coming back too.FORBES: And the danger in this currency, changes, is a lot of entities in China have taken on dollar-denominated debt and so you make the dollar, dearer, those companies affected debts have gone up at a time when the economy is not in such good shape.BARTIROMO: Important point. Dagen, how do you see it? This morning, we are seeing a bit of a rebound, obviously, not to the extent that we saw the selloff yesterday.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: To Steve's point about dollar-denominated debt in China, the big risk now is that we win this trade war. What if the U.S. "wins" and we send China into a recession, what are the dominoes that will fall?Again, what will this look like, globally? Tesla has spent, what, a couple of billion dollars setting up a factory, a giga factory, in China, that falls apart, what does that do to Tesla's debt here in the United States, what about the stability of the entire globe when we are the -- we're growing and we might be one of the strongest economies, but the rest of the world looks lousy.So, if we push China into a recession, what are the knock-on effects going to be, globally, but even here in the United States? Again, this could turn into a debt crisis if we're not careful.BARTIROMO: Well, that was the reaction yesterday for this market. When you see this market take such a hit that it did yesterday, Deirdre, sometimes you almost want to see the same thing happen on the upside, or do you feel, like, maybe everything wasn't out yesterday, you know --BOLTON: Right. That's always the question --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Have we seen capitulation?BOLTON: Yes, and we weren't too many points away from a 10 percent drop, right? We weren't so many, so far, from correction territory in that way. I mean, listen, the bidding up that we're seeing, at least, in Europe, I do think is an attempt to stabilization.And I think there's a lot of people saying that this U.S.-China trade war may tip the Fed's hand and I think that's part of the positivity that we are seeing, I mean, Fed funds futures are now placing in three cuts for this year, which I was kind of surprised.BARTIROMO: So, one in September and one in December.MCDOWELL: But the Fed's not going to rescue the U.S. of the world from this, quite frankly. We have weak factory growth four months in a row. We had a drop in business investment in the second quarter, which you have pointed out. We have slowing job growth in this country.This is not a tit-for-tat where the Fed cuts a quarter point and it offsets any weakness from this trade war that's been started.FORBES: And that's the thing to look at it, as business investment, if you don't have investment, you're not going to get future growth.BARTIROMO: Right.FORBES: And that's what we have to revive and that's not going to revive if this is uncertainty by trade is out there, and we have another front over in Europe, in a couple of months, that six-month moratorium we've put on those (INAUDIBLE) tariffs. If we put tariffs on cars from Europe, parts from Europe, forget it, we're going to have a global crisis.BARTIROMO: Well, the decline in business investment was sparked by the uncertainty of a trade and yesterday, we saw big technology, consumers stocks really hit particularly hard by this U.S.-China trade fight falling, at least, three percent.Apple was the worst performer over the -- over five percent lower on the session. Now, you know, China obviously makes the iPhone, I mean, Apple makes the iPhone in China, so that's --BOLTON: Yes, so much of their manufacturing is there and I think this just reminds everybody to, what extent, we are interconnected, you know, to Dagen's point, as well, even if the U.S. is, let's say, stable, listen, you know, their factories are over there, actually Apple get still more than 20 percent of its revenue from China, so there's a direct play on a lot of these technology names.And then there's also the question of the manufacturing and the assembly for which, you know, something like 35 percent of our companies are trying to refuel their supply chains, trying to find other places in Asia that they can do business with, whether it's Vietnam, whether it's more in South Korea, but, yes, it just highlights our vulnerability even if we are strong.BARTIROMO: Yes, yes, the stock was down five and a quarter percent, Dagen.MCDOWELL: The issue with this -- the fight that we pick with China and how it's escalated, if you look at just the raw numbers of this, and I think Steve will agree with this, if you look at the raw numbers just the pure dollar amount of tariffs impacting, say, U.S. corporations, it pales in comparison to the size of the corporate tax cut.Nevertheless, panics in the past, the Russian debt default, even the Asian contagion, it's usually triggered by something small. But, again, there are dominoes that fall in a knock on effect usually related to credit, whether it's the credit of a nation or the credit -- or lack of credit worthiness of companies that are deeply in debt.So, it doesn't take much, and you will never really know what that -- where that first domino is and where it might fall. But, again --BARTIROMO: I don't know if it's fair to say, though, that the U.S., you know, picked this fight with China, I mean, China has been stealing from the United States for decades. China has been the bad actor here. It just so happens that now the U.S. is pushing back and saying, we're not going to take this anymore. But, it's not like the U.S. just decided to go pick a fight with China.FORBES: Well --MCDOWELL: Trade wars -- trade wars are easy to win, it's what the president said. And that's just simply not true.FORBES: But that gets the basic question, what do you do about China when it wasn't obey the rules? And I've always said go after specific sectors, go after specific companies --BARTIROMO: Like Huawei, go after Huawei.FORBES: Like Huawei, ZTE, we could've put them out of business, go after the bad actors.BOLTON: Or stealth, right? She, kind of, tighten the screws in other ways, there are a lot of people who criticize, maybe, the methods, right --FORBES: Also make it clear --BOLTON: -- the tariffs.FORBES: And also make it clear that China, you're not going to have the South China Sea as your lake. And we should be putting our own bases there. It's -- the whole marines and navy are considering that choke points for Chinese oil.MCDOWELL: But the issue now is that, in the story in the Journal yesterday, that President Trump, that all of his advisers were against this additional tariff that kind of came out of the blue, except for Peter Navarro. And that it seems you have someone acting in a mercurial, unpredictable way, when your businesses that create jobs in this country, need predictability.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: That is what -- that it was the tipping point last week and yesterday.BARTIROMO: I still go back to the question, though, what is the U.S. to do? I mean, now, it's common, you know, it's common knowledge that China is a national security risk, that it's not just an economic fight, that they are putting military bases across the world, that they are bullying other countries that come into that waterway, the South China Sea.So, what is the --(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: We shouldn't pick a fight with our allies to begin with, which we did with the steel and aluminum tariffs. We should've locked arms with them and gone, and basically, linked up to take on China, and we could do that even with, in terms of trade negotiations, and in terms of currency manipulation.We are much stronger together when you look at all of the developed nations in China's trading partners. We didn't do that.BARTIROMO: Which was partly the idea behind TPP that the president --BOLTON: And to your point, all that we were doing in the past -- over the past few decades, limiting certain kinds of investments and more working behind the scenes, right, no headline-moving tariffs, it wasn't working, arguably.BARTIROMO: Yes, exactly.BOLTON: So --BARTIROMO: Final word, real quick, before we go to break.FORBES: If they resolve it, market goes up 5,000.BARTIROMO: Wow, 5,000.FORBES: Yes.BARTIROMO: You're serious about that?FORBES: The uncertainty, the investment side, you remove that with Europe and with China --BARTIROMO: I agree with you.FORBES: -- takes off like a rocket.MCDOWELL: Stephen Moore said yesterday, he thinks that something gets done by the end of the year, not big, but at least -- if there's some semblance of peace --BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: -- by December --BOLTON: Or framework.MCDOWELL: -- we should be OK.BARTIROMO: To get out of this, elegantly, with China, not making that promise to stop intellectual property.FORBES: And this is also going to be --BARTIROMO: I don't know.FORBES: This is also going to be, perhaps, overtaken by events in Hong Kong that's becoming more --BARTIROMO: Which are rising this morning.FORBES: Yes.BARTIROMO: We've got more protesters on the streets in Hong Kong. We'll take a short break. When we come back, challenging Beijing, Hong Kong protests ramp up as the government clamps down hard, their latest tactics, coming up.You heard that Chinese dissident, Jimmy Lai, say Hong Kong is over if Beijing goes through with that extradition bill. Plus, returning to service, Boeing's attempts to restore trust, testing its 737 Max jets, the company's outlook when we come right back, stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. President Trump is planning to visit El Paso and Dayton tomorrow, following the two mass shootings over the weekend, Cheryl Casone now with headlines, good morning to you, Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria, well, the president's visit is coming as the death toll in El Paso now stands at 22, 2 more people died overnight at the hospital. The shooting happening, of course, at a Wal-Mart store, investigators now zeroing in on an online post before the shooting, they're trying to link it to the suspect there.And then to Ohio, Republican Governor Mike DeWine says he's going to run through a set of proposals to deal with gun violence and mental health, nine people died in the Dayton, Ohio shooting, both shootings happening over the weekend.Boeing CEO, Dennis Muilenburg, says his company has conducted now 500 test flights with a new software update to the 737 Max. A fault in the software is believed to be responsible for both deadly crashes that killed nearly 350 people last year and this year.The 737 Max has been grounded since March, Muilenburg added, though, that Boeing plans to send a certification package to the FAA next month, and hopefully, get that jet back in service later this year. The stock is slightly higher in the premarket, Maria.We should add that the CEO of American Airlines, Maria, so he said that we believe that this aircraft is safe, I would take my family on this aircraft.BARTIROMO: Yes.CASONE: Now, we see to get to the final hurdle and hopefully that will help Boeing.BARTIROMO: We'll see if those orders resume from those major airlines. Cheryl, thank you. Coming up, market turmoil, all three indices seeing the worst day of 2019 yesterday, as the trade fight between the U.S. and China intensifies, we have more on that. Plus, a warning from all living former Fed chairman, an op-ed this morning, we're going to bring it to you.Then, this, McDonald's green efforts, the fast food chain's new paper straws may actually be hurting the environment, wait until you hear this one, back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Markets are looking to rebound this morning. We've got a pretty good triple-digit bounce this morning after a massive meltdown yesterday. U.S.-China trade tensions are flaring up. The U.S. is accusing China of currency manipulation and the president did that late yesterday. The S&P, the Dow and the NASDAQ all took a traumatic tumble yesterday.Joining us right now is Potomac Wealth Advisors president and founder, Mark Avallone, Mark, it's good to see you on the day that markets are struggling to come back from that huge selloff yesterday, what would you do today, coming in, after that 800-point selloff yesterday, what are you advising clients?MARK AVALLONE, PRESIDENT AND FOUNDER, POTOMAC WEALTH ADVISORS: Well, I think it's a wait and see, first of all, if you're in the markets, I don't think you panic and sell out because we have some rough headlines, and if you're not in the market, I think you're going to continue to see volatility, so there's no reason to dive right in.Look, we've had an ongoing spat with China, it's going to continue that way, it may continue for a decade. I think this is just a continuation of China, flexing its muscles and showing the U.S. it doesn't want public beat down neither with tariffs or tweets or messages and I think we, as investors, have to understand this is going to be a slow process that is going online and volatility is the new norm.BARTIROMO: Yes, do you want to sell the things that are going to get particularly hard hit from the -- from the tariffs, because I know that this latest tariff threat is impacting the consumer sector pretty hard.You've got things like cell phones, laptops, flat screen T.V.s, set top boxes, routers, apparel, footwear, toys, all in the category of getting hit by that 10 percent tariff on the 300 billion of goods coming from China.AVALLONE: Well, if the U.S. consumer stops purchasing to some extent, that's going to happen, keep in mind, the weaker Chinese currency's going to also minimize the impact with those tariffs, somewhat, and I think retails are already feeling the pinch. They're trying to absorb some of this.The good news is that the U.S. consumer's flashed with cast, still buying, still spending. I don't think it's going to be a one for one. If tariffs do take effect, we're going to see a massive impact. I think there are several mitigants that the economy will be allowed to be absorbed into it and hence, into some stock prices.BOLTON: There is -- Deirdre here, there is some headlines saying that China is trying to keep the Yuan from devaluing further, if that is, in fact, true, so we have that they might sell about 30 billion Yuan in Hong Kong, mid-August, will that matter to our markets?AVALLONE: Well, I think stability is what we are looking at and ratcheting down of tensions, so if they do take steps like that, that'll be a big reassurance. I think the unknown is what drove yesterday, if they're going to devalue their currency one step, well, they go two steps, three steps.So, if they pull that back and look playing ball with the U.S. and the global economic community, that's a net positive, so, yes, any step by them, in that direction would be welcome to reduce these fears and jitters.MCDOWELL: Mark --FORBES: Go ahead.MCDOWELL: No, you go ahead.FORBES: What's going to be the impact on investing, are businesses going to overcome the reluctance even though they don't know the rules of the game and how is that going to affect the economy in 2020 and 2021?AVALLONE: Well, you all have been talking about that on the panel for some time now, and it's this lack of foresight, the lack of ability to plan, the lack -- the lack of being able to make meaningful capital expenditures. And it's really a shame because in light of these tax cuts, were a terrific boost for business. The hesitancy remains because of the lack of clarity.BARTIROMO: Yes.AVALLONE: If we can get -- and this is why I heard earlier, I think, Maria said, if we can get an elegant deal, even if it's on the smaller side, it creates more certainty for the business community just to take the heat off, get something in place, so businesses can continue, that would be a huge boost, Steve.BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, what was it down, six or eight-tenths of a percent in the last reading on business CapEx?MCDOWELL: Yes, it was eight-tenths of a percent.BARTIROMO: Eight-tenths of a percent, Dagen.MCDOWELL: Yes, seasonally adjusted in the second quarter. But Mark, one thing I want to ask is that, in this environment -- because companies flashed with cash could actually benefit from these tariffs in a sense of, say, Apple. Apple could take market share in this environment if goods made in China, say, other phones that are important to the U.S., Samsung, phones made in China, they could be --Apple could take market share in this kind of -- with this backdrop. And all the other companies that are flashed with cash, they could eat these tariffs in the short run. Those are the stocks you want to look at.AVALLONE: Well, they could do that. What concerns me about Apple is the by China rhetoric that we're starting to hear, and that could be an offset to any benefit that you're outlining. Sure, Apple, you know, a world-class leader, super strong balance sheet, they can choose to absorb some of this.I am more concerned, though, that they could lose access to one of the world's biggest markets and that -- that's a bigger concern for me in the trade fight with Apple, more of a threat than an opportunity.BARTIROMO: Let me ask you about this op-ed on the Fed, defending the Federal Reserve, former Fed chairman, Paul Volcker, Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke, and Janet Yellen, all got together, they wrote an op-ed in the Journal this morning, advocating for the independent Central Bank, for the independence of the Central Bank, titled, America Needs an Independent Fed.They write, even the perception that monetary-policy decisions are politically motivated, or influenced by threats that policy makers won't be able to serve out their terms of office, can undermine public confidence. That the Central Bank is acting in the best interest of the economy.That can lead to unstable financial markets and worse economic outcomes, interesting that they all got together with this op-ed this morning.AVALLONE: Right, but I don't think there's any indication that Jay Powell is reacting to President Trump just yet. You know, we do wish the president would tone it down. I think it does create the perception. And I think that's the issue.BARTIROMO: Yes.AVALLONE: I don't think -- I don't think the Fed chair has been reacting and I don't think they're going to, and in fact, there could be the counter effect that they want to dig in their heels and fight for and show their independence. Interesting that they all came out and wrote that, I don't think it's happening just yet.BARTIROMO: All right, we will -- we will leave it there, Mark, it's great to have you this morning, thanks so much.AVALLONE: Good to be here.BARTIROMO: Mark Avallone, joining us. Coming up, pressuring Beijing, Hong Kong protests are ramping up this morning, the Chinese government is threatening punishment. We've got the very latest there, on the ground. And then, more lights in Las Vegas, the Raiders find a sponsor for their new stadium, the big money behind the naming rights, coming up, all right here, back in a moment.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thank you so much for joining us. Good morning, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, August 6th. Your top stories right now, 6:31 a.m. on the East Coast.We're taking a look at a bit of a bounce this morning on Wall Street. Take a look, Dow Futures up 213 points. S&P Futures up 25, and the Nasdaq Futures up 75. Pretty good relief after yesterday's broad sell-off which was sparked by the Chinese yuan, falling to an 11-year low against the dollar.The Dow, the Nasdaq, and the S&P experiencing their worst day of the year with the Dow down 767 points, almost three percent. The Nasdaq down 278. That was almost 3-1/2 percent.Global markets this morning are off of the lows, and actually trading up. FT-100 up four points. CAC Quarante in Paris up 48, and the DAX Index in Germany up 71.In Germany, factory orders were out, they rebounded up 2-1/2 percent. That was higher than economists were expecting. That was a bit of good news on the economy in Germany.In Asia overnight, it was red across the board, but here two the major indices ended off of the session lows. Shanghai Composite down 1-1/2 percent as you can see there.U.S.-China trade turmoil turning to currency yesterday. The U.S. designated China as a currency manipulator, after letting the Chinese yuan depreciate. An accusation that Beijing is denying. What it all means for the economy and trade negotiations? Coming up.Protests are ramping up meanwhile in Hong Kong. China issued a strong warning not to take restraint for weakness. Saying people should not underestimate China's firm resolve and strength. A warning coming from the government there.And then, Las Vegas football nearing the end zone. The future home of the Raiders gets a name. Find out the company that's sponsoring the new stadium and the big money behind the naming rights. Coming up this morning.Paper straws. McDonald's is dumping plastic for paper. However, it might not be the most environmentally friendly move. What you hear the problems around paper straws? All those stories coming up.But our top story this half-an-hour. U.S.-China trade tensions. Chinese officials are speaking out. Saying that the country is ready to take countermeasures if the U.S. puts intermediate-range missiles in Asia.This after the U.S. defense secretary Mark Esper expressed his openness to the idea. The U.S. had pulled out of the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty last week, which banned ground-launched ballistic missiles.Joining me right now is retired four-star general, Fox News senior strategic analyst, General Jack Keane. General, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST: Yes, good to see you, Maria.BARTIROMO: This decision about missiles. First, talk to us about what's happening between the U.S. and China. So far, the public has talked about this fight as an economic one. But now, we're actually opening this up to show the real story which is about the military in China.KEANE: Yes, I mean, we're in a major geopolitical struggle with China where economics is part of it -- military is part of it. And that's the reality that we're facing here. And what the United States is trying to do is trying to bring the military situation in the Pacific back in the balance.The fact is China has been developing intermediate conventional and nuclear missiles for years. And they have not been a part of the INF treaty that Gorbachev and Reagan signed in 1987. And obviously, recently, the Russians have been violating that treaty that's why the United States has pulled out of it.But the United States so much respected the treaty that even though China was building those kinds of missiles in there between five and 5,000 kilometers, we respected it and did not put ours in place.Now, we're balancing what China is doing. And that's called deterrence. We're trying to prevent a conflict. China is upping their militarization of the western Pacific, and they are the rapid -- most rapid growing military in the world. Maria.BARTIROMO: Do they see it though as we're trying to quiet things down? Or do they see this as the opposite?KEANE: No, China believes United States is trying to contain them is what they believe our strategy is. We're trying to avoid their domination of the Western Pacific and the Indo-Pacific region itself.And as he stated, he clearly wants to replace the United States as a preeminent global power in the world sometime in the -- in the 2030. So, they are strategically very ambitious and they definitely want the United States influence, minimized in the Pacific region for certain.BARTIROMO: You know, I mean, I've said this before, and I don't think this is a controversial thing to say. I almost feel like -- General, the U.S. has a duty to stop China from becoming the dominant player, the dominant superpower of the world, because it's a communist country, because of their human rights behavior, because of all of the things that they do as bad actors. The U.S. should not want -- and the world should not want this communist country being the most dominant superpower militarily.KEANE: I couldn't agree with you more. I mean, it is absolutely a clash of values. Much as it was with the United States and the Soviet Union. This ideology that China has in repressing its own society. It's got 3 million Muslims in concentration camps. Let's call it what they really are. They call it a reeducation camps.They take pictures of everybody in every major city in China, constantly all day long. And they are a repressive regime. The struggle in Hong Kong is symptomatic of what that struggle is all about.BARTIROMO: Yes.KEANE: And yes, we should stand up for our values and promote them wherever we can.BARTIROMO: Yes, funny, you mentioned -- you mentioned the Muslims being rounded up. And I'm told that -- you know, these Uyghurs that they have rounded up, they put in these so-called education centers, which look like concentration camps, given the fact that they are guarded by -- you know, men with guns and machine weapons.But apparently, some officials went there during Ramadan, and forced them to eat pork, forced them to do everything that Chinese do as opposed to what they wanted to do for their own religion. I mean, it was just horrible stories.But I got to get your take on Hong Kong. Because you've got the Chinese government speaking out this morning on those ongoing protests there. Saying that they are prepared to punish protesters.Look at these pictures general. Demonstrations against the mainland government have been going on for weeks and we know that this started because of the extradition bill where the Chinese government said, look, if you're arrested in Hong Kong, you will come back to China for punishment.We had Jimmy Lai on and activists from China, who you know very well. Who said look, if this goes through, this extradition bill, Hong Kong is over. It will completely undermine the value system because Hong Kong has been raised -- had grown up on Western values.KEANE: Yes, there is no doubt about that. And clearly, this is -- this is what we're talking about. We see this on the frontlines, a clash of a repressive regime in mainland China. And when we think about China, obviously, we're going to think about the people in China, many of us visited. We find it a very interesting cultural heritage.But it's a Communist Chinese party that is really the opposition here. Not the people in China. And Hong Kong represents to them in an anathema because this is a flourishing democracy with a thriving capitalistic system.And they do -- they have been slowly over 10 years as Jimmy Lai pointed out to us, slowly walking back the freedoms and the liberties that the Hong Kong people have.BARTIROMO: Right.KEANE: Most of the people now on the frontlines of this demonstration and young people. And many of them believe that this is it for them. They're going to -- they're going to stay here and fight because they believe their freedom is on the line, their liberties on the line.BARTIROMO: Even if it means loss of life. And I do think it appears that we may be heading to some kind of actual military confrontation. What the Chinese are monitoring is, what is the impact of this protest on mainland China? On the people of mainland China.And now, they're showing the violence that's taking place in a protest to the mainland Chinese. They've been denying them having access to it when it was 2 million people and there was a civil protest.And I think it's a mistake to that on the part of the demonstrators, to turn this into a violent protest in my view.BARTIROMO: Well, I mean when activist Jimmy Lai came on, on my Sunday morning program on Fox News. He basically made an appeal to the U.S. government. Stand with Hong Kong. Make sure the world knows that you're with Hong Kong. Do you think the U.S. should be getting involved in this?You said that there's going to be a military conflict. What do you saying? Do you think that could be with the U.S.?KEANE: No, no. I think at some point, if this protest movement starts to have adverse impact inside of mainland China, which there -- if there really concern about, then likely, they'll deploy army troops to put the protest down and clear the streets.BARTIROMO: I say.KEANE: That will -- that will cause violence to be sure. I do think that the president of the United States should support the protesters in Hong Kong. And I also believe as opposed to that, getting in the way of the deal with China over trade, and maybe interfering with the potential for negotiations.BARTIROMO: Right.KEANE: I think the more pressure on mainland China, the better.BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. We'll be watching these stories that are flaring up this morning certainly. General, it's good to see you.KEANE: Good talking to you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Thanks so much for your wonderful insights as always. General Jack Keane, joining us there.Meanwhile, the U.S. expanding sanctions on Venezuela. Now, freezing all government assets there. Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines on that. Cheryl.CASONE: Yes, Maria, busy morning. President Trump has issued an executive order that immediately bans American companies and individuals from doing business with the government of Nicolas Maduro and any tough supporters.The National Security Advisor John Bolton has warned China and Russia not to double down its support of Maduro. Saying, Venezuela might not repay its debt after Maduro falls.Now, the United States recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela's legitimate leader that was back in January, we should add.Well, two major newspaper companies are merging Gannett, the owner of USA Today has been acquired by New Media Investment Group. That is the parent of GateHouse Media. This is a $1.4 billion cash and stock deal. The combined company going to keep the Gannett name, and will publish more than 260 newspapers throughout the country more than 2,100 newspapers have closed since 2004. That's according to a University of North Carolina study.Well, you know that saying about good intentions. Well, McDonald's in the U.K. and Ireland switched to paper straws. As part of a global effort to help protect the environment. But despite the effort, they're not being recycled. The McDonald's is telling Fox that the technology needed to process the paper straws isn't available.But, they say they're working on a solution and they gave no timeline. It turns out those plastic straws Maria that they used to use could have been recycled. But I have to say for McDonald's, A, for effort. And I think it's great that they're trying to do something for the environment and get rid of some of the plastic in our oceans.BARTIROMO: They're trying.CASONE: They are making a good effort. We got to hand it to them able to come up with the technology.BARTIROMO: All right. Thank you, Cheryl.Coming up, medical marijuana headed to the south. Louisiana becomes the first state in the region to see it on shelves. That's next. And then, nearing the end zone. The future home of the Las Vegas Raiders gets a name. The big money behind the naming rights, coming up, right here, back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Headlines across America this morning. The South Florida Sun Sentinel writes: "Plastic straw ban headed to Florida legislature again." The fate of the plastic straw in Florida hangs in balance and could end up back in state legislature even though Governor Ron DeSantis vetoed a bill earlier this year that would have blocked banning the sipping staple. The new measure would prohibit plastic straws and plastic carry-out bags statewide, only allowing straws made from paper, pasta, sugar cane, wood or bamboo.The Advocate reports when and how can I get it? Answering your questions as medical marijuana hits shelves in Louisiana. The first round of marijuana released to pharmacies today. About 80 doctors now licensed to "recommend the drug to patients." Louisiana is the first deep south state to dispense marijuana.And the San Francisco Chronicle this morning reports: "Why opening a chain store in San Francisco can take forever?" It takes a long time for chain stores with 11 or more locations to set up shop beyond downtown. They need a special OK or even expand and that could take up to eight months which is far longer than other major cities like New York. You could also explain why San Francisco has many vacant store fronts, direct impact from regulation.You know, this plastic straw story; Cheryl just reported a second ago that plastic straws can be recycled and paper straws are the ones that can't be -- and that's why McDonald's.BOLTON: Yes, that's what they're fighting now, right? That people are just tossing them in the trash, the paper ones. They are supposed to be recycling -- and then there is that crazy story of this lady who actually fell on metal straw and impaired her eye.BARTIROMO: Oh my gosh!BOLTON: And you know that's extreme, but I'm just saying this doesn't seem like our biggest problem. I'm not a recycling expert, but this is --FORBES: The whole straw thing is fake virtue of the real problem with plastic coming from Vietnam and from China in the Pacific Ocean. Straws -- the numbers are exaggerated but people feel they're doing something; they are not, they're making it worse.BARTIROMO: Exactly. I agree because I think the majority of the plastic in the ocean, or at least 50 percent is from fishing nets.FORBES: Yes.BARTIROMO: It's fishing nets and you're talking --BOLTON: And plastic bottles. I mean, there's other products, right?BARTIROMO: Yes. Exactly. Of course. Yes, absolutely. All right, we will take a break, when we come back, more lights in Las Vegas to tell you about the home of the Raiders, now with the new name. Who won the rights? We've got it next up, and then, but guy on a little bike. See what happened when J.J. Watts took a ride in a Wisconsin tradition. All that coming up.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.

CRU China Formulates Aluminium Industry Development Plan for Chinese Government; Baise City, Guangxi commissions CRU for aluminium industry development strategyPR NewswireJuly 8, 2019 Monday 7:29 AM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 985 wordsDateline: LONDON, July 8, 2019 BodyPR NewswireIn March 2019, CRU was tasked to perform a comprehensive review of Baise City's aluminium industry chain, from bauxite mining to aluminium products. The review was completed in May 2019 and praised by the Deputy Mayor of Baise.From the 1980s, Baise's aluminium industry has grown into an important part of the Guangxi economy. CRU's remit was to specify which downstream aluminium products Baise should prioritise in its future development plans. As an international commodities consultancy, with a presence in China, CRU's reports were developed by world-leading technical analysts and a project team in China with local experience.CRU provided detailed product positioning reports, analysing how the recommended downstream products might be compatible with the productive capacity, costs and revenues of Baise's existing value chain.Deputy Mayor of Baise Mr Shi Guohuai endorses CRU's reportDeputy Mayor of Baise Mr Shi Guohuai stated, "CRU's work has not only given us an international perspective from which to view the development of the global aluminium refining industry, but, even more importantly, has addressed one of the key questions for the development of Baise's aluminium industry-how Baise should orient its downstream aluminium refining industry for high, medium and low end products, and how to cultivate value.""I particularly thank CRU for outlining the areas of aluminium industry which Baise should be cautious to enter, such as aluminium for aviation. I believe CRU's level of expertise will allow Baise to determine a stable plan for the development of Baise's downstream aluminium industry."CRU is proud to work with Baise cityThe story of Baise city's aluminium industry goes back to 1986, when Deng Xiaoping gave instructions for the development of Guangxi Pingguo Bauxite. Since then, the government of the Guangxi Prefecture Autonomous Region and the Federal Government have provided more than 30 years of continuous support. CRU sees great potential in the future development of the aluminium industry in Baise.Read the full story:https://www.crugroup.com/about-cru/news/2019/cru-china-formulates-aluminium-industry-development-plan-for-chinese-government/ Read more about CRU:http://bit.ly/About_CRUAbout CRUCRU offers unrivalled business intelligence on the global metals, mining and fertilizer industries through market analysis, price assessments, consultancy and events.Since our foundation by Robert Perlman in 1969, we have consistently invested in primary research and robust methodologies, and developed expert teams in key locations worldwide, including in hard-to-reach markets such as China.CRU employs over 280 experts and has more than 11 offices around the world, in Europe, the Americas, China, Asia and Australia - our office in Beijing opened in 2004 and Singapore in 2018.When facing critical business decisions, you can rely on our first-hand knowledge to give you a complete view of a commodity market. And you can engage with our experts directly, for the full picture and a personalised response.CRU - big enough to deliver a high-quality service, small enough to care about all of our customers.Introduction of the development of Baise aluminum industryBaise is a major channel for exporting to the southwest of China. It is a national highway transportation hub, it basically forms a three-dimensional traffic pattern of "five in one" of expressway, railway, aviation, shipping and port. Bordering Vietnam, it is the frontier of the two-way opening between China and ASEAN. It governs 12 counties (cities, districts) with a total population of 4.18 million, With a total area of 36,300 square kilometers, it is a city with a pleasant scenery and simple folk customs.Baise is rich in minerals, abundant in bauxite, coal, manganese copper, calcium carbonate and other resources. Since Deng Xiaoping made an important instruction on "Guangxi Pingguo Aluminum must to be engaged" in 1986, the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Party Committee and Government of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region have paid more attention to Baise and strongly supported the development of its aluminum industry. In 2011, the state established the Baise Eco-Aluminum Industry Demonstration Base. In recent years, Baise City has boldly explored the supply-side structural reform road with characteristics of the times and resource-based economy, take the "coal, electricity and aluminum integrated circular economy industrial chain" to guide the overall development.Baise has the advantage of clustering in the industrial parks. The city has 9 aluminum-related industrial parks, and a new one is planning. The park has a reasonable layout, complete functions and complete infrastructure. In 2018, the output of alumina reached 8.17 million tons, and the output of electrolytic aluminum was 1.43 million tons. In addition, the output of aluminum processing was 3.08 million tons. According to industry statistics, the output value of the aluminum industries and supporting industries in the city reached 128 billion yuan in 2018.To achieve high-quality development, Baise proposes five major aluminum industrial chains, such as aluminum for transportation, aluminum for industrial use, aluminum for packaging, aluminum for construction, and aluminum for electronic household appliances. By the year 2023, Baise will achieve the innovation drive of the demonstration base, Industry clusters are highlighted, output benefits are improved, and product added value is increased. The core gathering area of "Baise aluminum deep processing" will be built, and the national resource-based urban industrial transformation and upgrading demonstration zone will be found. View original content to download multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cru-china-formulates-aluminium-industry-development-plan-for-chinese-government-300880646.htmlSOURCE CRUCONTACT: Media Lemar Montellano - lemar.montellano@crugroup.com / tel: +44-20-7903-2070; Colin Mills - colin.mills@crugroup.com / tel: +44-20-7903-2235Load-Date: July 9, 2019End of Document

"A brilliant, cool guy who knows this subject better than anyone! The Trump Administration will take a look!"Google claimed the allegations were unfounded and questioned the motivations of Thiel, a longtime Trump supporter and Facebook board member."As we have said before, we do not work with the Chinese Army," Google said in a statement sent to AFP.Google withdrew its search engine from China in 2010 in protest at Beijing's efforts to censor its operation. The company, however, recently began working on a version of its engine for China, although it said it had no plans to implement it.Trump has repeatedly blamed Google for "bias" against him and his supporters.Earlier this year, the representative criticized the company for withdrawing from the tender for a large Pentagon computer contract. Attitude he softened after meeting with Google's chief executive, Sundar Pichai.Google has limited its business operations in China, but information this year revealed that one of its scientists participated in a research project that could have both civilian and military applications in the Asian giant.The Trump post warns that he will review possible ties between Google and the Chinese government was first published in The Third.Load-Date: July 17, 2019End of Document

US has the wrong strategy on China; Beat it on economics, don't disengageUSA TODAYAugust 26, 2019 MondayFIRST EDITIONCopyright 2019 Gannett Company, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: OPINION; Pg. 7ALength: 921 wordsByline: Will HurdBodyAll Americans should be concerned about the potential for China to replace the United States as the most important economy in the world. We face a potential future where Mandarin and the yuan, not English and the dollar, dominate the global economy, and the U.S. government is pursuing the wrong strategy to prevent this reality.Over the past two decades as a former CIA officer, partner in an international strategic consulting firm and now member of  the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, I've seen how the Chinese government has threatened global supply chains, stolen U.S. intellectual property and economically bullied smaller countries. Instead of pursuing a 19th century tit-for-tat tariff war, which is a self-imposed sales tax on American consumers, we should be collaborating with our allies to out-innovate China.A common mistake in Washington is thinking about U.S.-China competition through a Cold War mentality that views Beijing as an adversary that we can contain and isolate like the Soviet Union. The United States and China are economically intertwined in a way that America and the Soviet Union never were and that America and Russia are not today. Regardless of presidential tweets saying that "we don't need China" and that U.S. companies should find alternative markets, decoupling from China  is simply unrealistic and would be in neither country's interest.Economic competition we can winMeeting the challenge of  head-to-head economic competition with an authoritarian regime requires a new approach. We are not fighting a Cold War but a New War. And it is an economic competition we can win.The first step in this New War is to focus on  policies that incentivize structural changes in China's economy and its treatment of foreign companies and investors. U.S. consumers shouldn't have to pay for Middle Kingdom misdeeds through tariffs. Instead of a tax on our consumers and businesses, we should have a policy of reciprocity.If U.S. companies and investors are unable to do something in China, then Chinese companies and investors should be unable to do those things here. If U.S. venture capital firms can't invest in Chinese artificial intelligence companies, then Chinese capital shouldn't be allowed in the American AI industry. If U.S. software companies operating in China must turn over their source code to the Chinese government, then Chinese software companies will have to reciprocate in America.We also must build a coalition to counter the Chinese government's growing global influence. Strengthening North American supply chains will bolster advanced manufacturing in the Western Hemisphere, providing an alternative to China. Ratifying the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement  would provide a framework for attracting advanced manufacturing and technology production to places like San Antonio, Toronto and Monterrey -- not Shanghai, Shenzhen and Beijing.We should also strengthen economic ties  with countries wary of an aggressive China, such as Vietnam.Old battle lines  will still exist, like Hong Kong, Taiwan and human rights abuses, but the new line of conflict is advanced technology -- AI,  5G, the Internet of Things and aerospace engineering. China was clear about its intentions  when it released its 2015 Made in China plan. By  2049, when China celebrates 100 years of communist rule, it plans  to be the world's leader in advanced technology and manufacturing.Innovation and immigrationThe United States and our allies will not prevent countries from doing business with Chinese companies like Huawei on the basis of security concerns alone, though they exist. We must provide an alternative service or product that is better, cheaper and more secure. We need to out-innovate our opponent. Close cooperation between the government and the private sector will be essential to win this competition.Instead of stifling innovation through regulations or talking about breaking up  American companies, Washington should work on things like a national strategy to coordinate efforts across government, academia and the private sector to advance research, development and adoption of AI.Washington should also be working to streamline legal immigration so that America remains  the beneficiary of the decades-long "brain drain" of the rest of the world. Today, more than 1million international students are studying in the United States, including more than 360,000 from China. The best and brightest  are educated here, and we need an immigration system that lets  more of them stay. If the Chinese want to steal our secrets, we should be stealing their engineers and scientists.While we are attracting global talent, we must prepare our American workforce to meet the challenges of a 21st century economy and long-term competition with China. We simply do not have enough people to fill jobs in technology and advanced manufacturing. We have to retrain and "reskill" our workforce over time and prepare our kids for jobs that don't even exist today.To ensure that the free world continues to set the rules in the global economy, America and its allies must work together to  preserve their positions as world centers of innovation and technological advancement.By moving past Cold War-era thinking and adopting 21st century solutions to this New War, the United States can continue as the world's most important economy, creating  opportunity at home and for  millions around the world.Republican Rep. Will Hurd represents Texas' 23rd Congressional District. Load-Date: August 26, 2019End of Document

China is ramping up its media abroad - and not just in Chinese; Beijing is intensifying efforts to shape its image abroad - and not just for Chinese-speaking audiences.The Christian Science MonitorJuly 3, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 Christian Science Publishing Society All Rights ReservedSection: WorldLength: 1725 wordsByline: Ann Scott Tyson Staff writerBodyAs Hong Kong protesters staged huge marches last month over a bill to allow extradition to China, some of Seattle's Chinese-speaking residents knew nothing about the demonstrations. One reason: For their news, they rely on China's propaganda outlets, which didn't cover the large-scale, politically sensitive demonstrations in the semi-autonomous southern Chinese port city."I didn't hear about any protests in Hong Kong," says a health worker who moved to Seattle 11 years ago from China's Guangdong Province, which borders Hong Kong. "I get all my news online from Sina.com - it's very popular here," she says, referring to the website of a Chinese technology company that runs news from China's state-owned media. She declined to be quoted by name.Over the past decade, the proliferation inside the United States of China's official news - both in Chinese and English - is part of what the Communist Party calls its "Grand Overseas Propaganda Campaign," aimed at "grabbing the right to speak" from Western media, according to official Chinese media reports and government websites.The campaign aims to bolster China's image and soft power abroad by spreading party messaging among the large Chinese diaspora in the U.S. and other countries - as well as, increasingly, foreigners. But it focuses heavily on millions of Chinese in communities abroad, aiming to mold overseas organizations into "propaganda bases" for China's "united front," according to a state-run publication cited in a 2017 report by Anne-Marie Brady, an expert on Chinese politics.The campaign involves not just promoting pro-Beijing information, but discouraging negative reports. Censorship extends into social media, and is strengthened by Chinese platforms' suppression of content that authorities deem negative. For example, some U.S. citizens have recently had messages or entire accounts censored on the popular Chinese messaging app WeChat, owned by the firm Tencent."It's quite shocking to me that China's Great Firewall is coming to the U.S. in digital form," says George Shen, a technology consultant from Newton, Mass., who had his WeChat accounts banned last month. "It's a very stealthy, sophisticated censorship. ... They are filtering out your messages without even telling you," he says. Bankrolled with billions of dollars of government funds, the strategy goes beyond establishing Chinese media entities abroad, to leasing or purchasing foreign news outlets and hiring foreign reporters. This tactic, known as "borrowing a boat to go out on the ocean" - or buying a boat, as the case may be - is aimed at offering a cloak of credibility.Even as China expands its channels to American audiences, it is increasing restrictions on U.S. media in China. Last month, Chinese authorities blocked several more U.S. media outlets from the internet in China, including the websites of The Washington Post, The Christian Science Monitor, and NBC News."The expansion of the CCP's [Chinese Communist Party's] media influence is a global campaign, and the United States is among its targets," writes Sarah Cook, senior research analyst for East Asia at Freedom House, a U.S. government-funded NGO, in a report released last month. "The results have already affected the news consumption of millions of Americans."Last September prior to U.S. midterm elections, for example, China's state-run media placed an advertising section in the Des Moines Register warning of the harm to soybean farmers of the U.S.-China trade conflict - an apparent effort to influence Iowa voters.The spread of pro-Beijing content, often coupled with a lack of transparency over its origins, makes "the potential for political, electoral manipulation very strong," Ms. Cook says in an interview.* * *In an herbal medicine shop in Seattle's Chinatown, China's state-owned China Central Television (CCTV) news beams from a flat-screen TV near the entry, as it does from many businesses in the historic district. Shopkeeper Jianhe Hang says he tunes into China's government broadcasts every day.Mr. Hang arrived in Seattle 10 years ago from Guangdong to join relatives, and has a green card, but like other residents of the district, he's cautious about voicing opinions to a reporter. Asked about the protests in Hong Kong, he says he's aware of them, but declines to say more. "I am middle of the road. I don't support them, and I don't oppose."CCTV dominates the Chinese-language cable offerings in the U.S., where it is available in about 90 million cable-watching households, far more than the estimated 4 million to 5 million Chinese Americans in the country."Here, every day I can watch CCTV or Phoenix TV [a pro-Beijing outlet based in Hong Kong], and when I go to the market I can buy Chinese state newspapers," says Zhang Weiguo, a Chinese journalist in Sacramento, who was jailed and exiled by Chinese authorities.The growing saturation of China's official media over the past decade means some Chinese speakers in the U.S., particularly recent arrivals from China, "are very close to Beijing - in a lot of places their thinking is totally aligned," he says.Increasingly, however, Beijing's media push goes beyond Chinese-speaking communities. Since China launched its overseas propaganda campaign in 2009, with a budget of $7 billion, it has moved swiftly to expand its English-language media in the U.S.China Daily, a state-owned English newspaper, established a U.S. edition in 2009 with newspaper vending boxes on the streets from Seattle to New York City. China Daily did not respond to calls and email queries about its current U.S. circulation, but in 2012 it was reportedly 170,000. It has also placed paid "China Watch" advertising supplements in U.S. newspapers including The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post. China Daily has spent nearly $20 million on U.S. influence since 2016, according to U.S. Justice Department reports.China Global Television Network (CGTN), part of the international arm of China's state-owned CCTV, reaches 30 million U.S. households with English programs. Recently, CGTN anchor Liu Xin made one of the first major appearances for a Chinese media personality on mainstream U.S. television - a debate on U.S.-China trade with Fox News host Trish Regan.Both CGTN and China Daily are registered as foreign agents in the U.S., as required of groups representing foreign powers. As a result of its registration this year, CGTN last month was denied press credentials by the Senate Press Gallery. The Justice Department reportedly asked the state-run Xinhua News Agency, which has several U.S. offices, to register as well. Asked about the matter, the Justice Department declined to comment.China's involvement is sometimes opaque. For example, pro-China radio content in English is broadcast from about 30 radio stations across the U.S. - from Boston to Los Angeles. The stations are owned or their airtime leased by a U.S. company that is, in turn, controlled by the state-run China Radio International. In another case, a Beijing-linked firm bought a radio station in Mexico and is broadcasting Chinese-language content throughout Southern California, although the FCC has not yet approved the sale.Such outlets broadcast Beijing-slanted news, for example by omitting reports that criticize China's human rights violations, while presenting the official line on sensitive issues such as China's territorial claims in the South China Sea."Before, the West was coming to influence China," says Mr. Zhang, "so now China's strategy is to flip this upside down, and use Communist Party ideology to change the West."So far, China's rising media presence in the U.S. has been felt most strongly among the Chinese diaspora, while having a relatively limited impact on average Americans, experts say. But the networks give China "the potential of mobilizing Chinese Americans and Americans alike to espouse policies counter to US interest," according to a report by prominent China scholars published last year by the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. "The constant drumbeat of anti-American reporting in pro-Beijing media outlets headquartered in the United States creates an unhealthy environment."Although U.S. authorities have limited tools for countering this influence in an open society, they can work to determine the ownership of Chinese companies buying U.S.-based media and require foreign-controlled media that promote a government agenda to register as foreign agents, the report concludes.* * *Relaxing near the Chinese pavilion at Seattle's Hing Hay Park after a 10-hour shift at a local eatery, Tan Ancun reads a free copy of the pro-Beijing newspaper Qiao Bao. "I only read free newspapers," says Mr. Tan, a slight man with graying hair who emigrated four years ago from Guangdong. Hard-pressed to cover rent for his small room, Mr. Tan says he can't afford to pay for news.A U.S. Chinese-language paper with a circulation of about 100,000 in 17 U.S. cities, Qiao Bao has an office in Bellevue, Washington, and also runs a Mandarin-language radio station in Seattle.

For example, Ms. Ng publishes Seattle China Post, which she founded 37 years ago after she noticed Chinatown residents relying on news from a street-corner bulletin board.Like other independent publishers, Ms. Ng has come under pressure from China's growing media presence in the U.S. But she's confident her paper's combination of hard news and strong local coverage will continue to appeal to subscribers."We criticize China and Taiwan whenever we like," she says, wearing a pink jacket and a baseball cap.

China is ramping up its media abroad - and not just in Chinese; Beijing is intensifying efforts to shape its image abroad - and not just for Chinese-speaking audiences.The Christian Science MonitorJuly 3, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 Christian Science Publishing Society All Rights ReservedSection: WorldLength: 1725 wordsByline: Ann Scott Tyson Staff writerBodyAs Hong Kong protesters staged huge marches last month over a bill to allow extradition to China, some of Seattle's Chinese-speaking residents knew nothing about the demonstrations. One reason: For their news, they rely on China's propaganda outlets, which didn't cover the large-scale, politically sensitive demonstrations in the semi-autonomous southern Chinese port city."I didn't hear about any protests in Hong Kong," says a health worker who moved to Seattle 11 years ago from China's Guangdong Province, which borders Hong Kong. "I get all my news online from Sina.com - it's very popular here," she says, referring to the website of a Chinese technology company that runs news from China's state-owned media. She declined to be quoted by name.Over the past decade, the proliferation inside the United States of China's official news - both in Chinese and English - is part of what the Communist Party calls its "Grand Overseas Propaganda Campaign," aimed at "grabbing the right to speak" from Western media, according to official Chinese media reports and government websites.The campaign aims to bolster China's image and soft power abroad by spreading party messaging among the large Chinese diaspora in the U.S. and other countries - as well as, increasingly, foreigners. But it focuses heavily on millions of Chinese in communities abroad, aiming to mold overseas organizations into "propaganda bases" for China's "united front," according to a state-run publication cited in a 2017 report by Anne-Marie Brady, an expert on Chinese politics.The campaign involves not just promoting pro-Beijing information, but discouraging negative reports. Censorship extends into social media, and is strengthened by Chinese platforms' suppression of content that authorities deem negative. For example, some U.S. citizens have recently had messages or entire accounts censored on the popular Chinese messaging app WeChat, owned by the firm Tencent."It's quite shocking to me that China's Great Firewall is coming to the U.S. in digital form," says George Shen, a technology consultant from Newton, Mass., who had his WeChat accounts banned last month. "It's a very stealthy, sophisticated censorship. ... They are filtering out your messages without even telling you," he says. Bankrolled with billions of dollars of government funds, the strategy goes beyond establishing Chinese media entities abroad, to leasing or purchasing foreign news outlets and hiring foreign reporters. This tactic, known as "borrowing a boat to go out on the ocean" - or buying a boat, as the case may be - is aimed at offering a cloak of credibility.Even as China expands its channels to American audiences, it is increasing restrictions on U.S. media in China. Last month, Chinese authorities blocked several more U.S. media outlets from the internet in China, including the websites of The Washington Post, The Christian Science Monitor, and NBC News."The expansion of the CCP's [Chinese Communist Party's] media influence is a global campaign, and the United States is among its targets," writes Sarah Cook, senior research analyst for East Asia at Freedom House, a U.S. government-funded NGO, in a report released last month. "The results have already affected the news consumption of millions of Americans."Last September prior to U.S. midterm elections, for example, China's state-run media placed an advertising section in the Des Moines Register warning of the harm to soybean farmers of the U.S.-China trade conflict - an apparent effort to influence Iowa voters.The spread of pro-Beijing content, often coupled with a lack of transparency over its origins, makes "the potential for political, electoral manipulation very strong," Ms. Cook says in an interview.* * *In an herbal medicine shop in Seattle's Chinatown, China's state-owned China Central Television (CCTV) news beams from a flat-screen TV near the entry, as it does from many businesses in the historic district. Shopkeeper Jianhe Hang says he tunes into China's government broadcasts every day.Mr. Hang arrived in Seattle 10 years ago from Guangdong to join relatives, and has a green card, but like other residents of the district, he's cautious about voicing opinions to a reporter. Asked about the protests in Hong Kong, he says he's aware of them, but declines to say more. "I am middle of the road. I don't support them, and I don't oppose."CCTV dominates the Chinese-language cable offerings in the U.S., where it is available in about 90 million cable-watching households, far more than the estimated 4 million to 5 million Chinese Americans in the country."Here, every day I can watch CCTV or Phoenix TV [a pro-Beijing outlet based in Hong Kong], and when I go to the market I can buy Chinese state newspapers," says Zhang Weiguo, a Chinese journalist in Sacramento, who was jailed and exiled by Chinese authorities.The growing saturation of China's official media over the past decade means some Chinese speakers in the U.S., particularly recent arrivals from China, "are very close to Beijing - in a lot of places their thinking is totally aligned," he says.Increasingly, however, Beijing's media push goes beyond Chinese-speaking communities. Since China launched its overseas propaganda campaign in 2009, with a budget of $7 billion, it has moved swiftly to expand its English-language media in the U.S.China Daily, a state-owned English newspaper, established a U.S. edition in 2009 with newspaper vending boxes on the streets from Seattle to New York City. China Daily did not respond to calls and email queries about its current U.S. circulation, but in 2012 it was reportedly 170,000. It has also placed paid "China Watch" advertising supplements in U.S. newspapers including The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post. China Daily has spent nearly $20 million on U.S. influence since 2016, according to U.S. Justice Department reports.China Global Television Network (CGTN), part of the international arm of China's state-owned CCTV, reaches 30 million U.S. households with English programs. Recently, CGTN anchor Liu Xin made one of the first major appearances for a Chinese media personality on mainstream U.S. television - a debate on U.S.-China trade with Fox News host Trish Regan.Both CGTN and China Daily are registered as foreign agents in the U.S., as required of groups representing foreign powers. As a result of its registration this year, CGTN last month was denied press credentials by the Senate Press Gallery. The Justice Department reportedly asked the state-run Xinhua News Agency, which has several U.S. offices, to register as well. Asked about the matter, the Justice Department declined to comment.China's involvement is sometimes opaque. For example, pro-China radio content in English is broadcast from about 30 radio stations across the U.S. - from Boston to Los Angeles. The stations are owned or their airtime leased by a U.S. company that is, in turn, controlled by the state-run China Radio International. In another case, a Beijing-linked firm bought a radio station in Mexico and is broadcasting Chinese-language content throughout Southern California, although the FCC has not yet approved the sale.Such outlets broadcast Beijing-slanted news, for example by omitting reports that criticize China's human rights violations, while presenting the official line on sensitive issues such as China's territorial claims in the South China Sea."Before, the West was coming to influence China," says Mr. Zhang, "so now China's strategy is to flip this upside down, and use Communist Party ideology to change the West."So far, China's rising media presence in the U.S. has been felt most strongly among the Chinese diaspora, while having a relatively limited impact on average Americans, experts say. But the networks give China "the potential of mobilizing Chinese Americans and Americans alike to espouse policies counter to US interest," according to a report by prominent China scholars published last year by the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. "The constant drumbeat of anti-American reporting in pro-Beijing media outlets headquartered in the United States creates an unhealthy environment."Although U.S. authorities have limited tools for countering this influence in an open society, they can work to determine the ownership of Chinese companies buying U.S.-based media and require foreign-controlled media that promote a government agenda to register as foreign agents, the report concludes.* * *Relaxing near the Chinese pavilion at Seattle's Hing Hay Park after a 10-hour shift at a local eatery, Tan Ancun reads a free copy of the pro-Beijing newspaper Qiao Bao. "I only read free newspapers," says Mr. Tan, a slight man with graying hair who emigrated four years ago from Guangdong. Hard-pressed to cover rent for his small room, Mr. Tan says he can't afford to pay for news.A U.S. Chinese-language paper with a circulation of about 100,000 in 17 U.S. cities, Qiao Bao has an office in Bellevue, Washington, and also runs a Mandarin-language radio station in Seattle.

This tactic, known as "borrowing a boat to go out on the ocean" - or buying a boat, as the case may be - is aimed at offering a cloak of credibility.Even as China expands its channels to American audiences, it is increasing restrictions on U.S. media in China. Last month, Chinese authorities blocked several more U.S. media outlets from the internet in China, including the websites of The Washington Post, The Christian Science Monitor, and NBC News."The expansion of the CCP's [Chinese Communist Party's] media influence is a global campaign, and the United States is among its targets," writes Sarah Cook, senior research analyst for East Asia at Freedom House, a U.S. government-funded NGO, in a report released last month. "The results have already affected the news consumption of millions of Americans."Last September prior to U.S. midterm elections, for example, China's state-run media placed an advertising section in the Des Moines Register warning of the harm to soybean farmers of the U.S.-China trade conflict - an apparent effort to influence Iowa voters.The spread of pro-Beijing content, often coupled with a lack of transparency over its origins, makes "the potential for political, electoral manipulation very strong," Ms. Cook says in an interview.* * *In an herbal medicine shop in Seattle's Chinatown, China's state-owned China Central Television (CCTV) news beams from a flat-screen TV near the entry, as it does from many businesses in the historic district. Shopkeeper Jianhe Hang says he tunes into China's government broadcasts every day.Mr. Hang arrived in Seattle 10 years ago from Guangdong to join relatives, and has a green card, but like other residents of the district, he's cautious about voicing opinions to a reporter. Asked about the protests in Hong Kong, he says he's aware of them, but declines to say more. "I am middle of the road. I don't support them, and I don't oppose."CCTV dominates the Chinese-language cable offerings in the U.S., where it is available in about 90 million cable-watching households, far more than the estimated 4 million to 5 million Chinese Americans in the country."Here, every day I can watch CCTV or Phoenix TV [a pro-Beijing outlet based in Hong Kong], and when I go to the market I can buy Chinese state newspapers," says Zhang Weiguo, a Chinese journalist in Sacramento, who was jailed and exiled by Chinese authorities.The growing saturation of China's official media over the past decade means some Chinese speakers in the U.S., particularly recent arrivals from China, "are very close to Beijing - in a lot of places their thinking is totally aligned," he says.Increasingly, however, Beijing's media push goes beyond Chinese-speaking communities. Since China launched its overseas propaganda campaign in 2009, with a budget of $7 billion, it has moved swiftly to expand its English-language media in the U.S.China Daily, a state-owned English newspaper, established a U.S. edition in 2009 with newspaper vending boxes on the streets from Seattle to New York City. China Daily did not respond to calls and email queries about its current U.S. circulation, but in 2012 it was reportedly 170,000. It has also placed paid "China Watch" advertising supplements in U.S. newspapers including The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post. China Daily has spent nearly $20 million on U.S. influence since 2016, according to U.S. Justice Department reports.China Global Television Network (CGTN), part of the international arm of China's state-owned CCTV, reaches 30 million U.S. households with English programs. Recently, CGTN anchor Liu Xin made one of the first major appearances for a Chinese media personality on mainstream U.S. television - a debate on U.S.-China trade with Fox News host Trish Regan.Both CGTN and China Daily are registered as foreign agents in the U.S., as required of groups representing foreign powers. As a result of its registration this year, CGTN last month was denied press credentials by the Senate Press Gallery. The Justice Department reportedly asked the state-run Xinhua News Agency, which has several U.S. offices, to register as well. Asked about the matter, the Justice Department declined to comment.China's involvement is sometimes opaque. For example, pro-China radio content in English is broadcast from about 30 radio stations across the U.S. - from Boston to Los Angeles. The stations are owned or their airtime leased by a U.S. company that is, in turn, controlled by the state-run China Radio International. In another case, a Beijing-linked firm bought a radio station in Mexico and is broadcasting Chinese-language content throughout Southern California, although the FCC has not yet approved the sale.Such outlets broadcast Beijing-slanted news, for example by omitting reports that criticize China's human rights violations, while presenting the official line on sensitive issues such as China's territorial claims in the South China Sea."Before, the West was coming to influence China," says Mr. Zhang, "so now China's strategy is to flip this upside down, and use Communist Party ideology to change the West."So far, China's rising media presence in the U.S. has been felt most strongly among the Chinese diaspora, while having a relatively limited impact on average Americans, experts say. But the networks give China "the potential of mobilizing Chinese Americans and Americans alike to espouse policies counter to US interest," according to a report by prominent China scholars published last year by the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. "The constant drumbeat of anti-American reporting in pro-Beijing media outlets headquartered in the United States creates an unhealthy environment."Although U.S. authorities have limited tools for countering this influence in an open society, they can work to determine the ownership of Chinese companies buying U.S.-based media and require foreign-controlled media that promote a government agenda to register as foreign agents, the report concludes.* * *Relaxing near the Chinese pavilion at Seattle's Hing Hay Park after a 10-hour shift at a local eatery, Tan Ancun reads a free copy of the pro-Beijing newspaper Qiao Bao. "I only read free newspapers," says Mr. Tan, a slight man with graying hair who emigrated four years ago from Guangdong. Hard-pressed to cover rent for his small room, Mr. Tan says he can't afford to pay for news.A U.S. Chinese-language paper with a circulation of about 100,000 in 17 U.S. cities, Qiao Bao has an office in Bellevue, Washington, and also runs a Mandarin-language radio station in Seattle. Qiao Bao's content echoes China's messaging - for example in a story Tuesday condemning Hong Kong's protests. Its founders and other personnel have close ties to Beijing; some formerly worked for state-run media in China."Qiao Bao is all over Chinatown," says Assunta Ng, a veteran Chinese American newswoman in Seattle. "A lot of people like to get freebies, so they don't care if they read propaganda," says Ms. Ng, who was born in Guangdong, raised in Hong Kong, and has an M.A. in communications from the University of Washington.Still, some independent Chinese-language media retain a voice in U.S. cities. For example, Ms. Ng publishes Seattle China Post, which she founded 37 years ago after she noticed Chinatown residents relying on news from a street-corner bulletin board.Like other independent publishers, Ms. Ng has come under pressure from China's growing media presence in the U.S. But she's confident her paper's combination of hard news and strong local coverage will continue to appeal to subscribers."We criticize China and Taiwan whenever we like," she says, wearing a pink jacket and a baseball cap.

China is ramping up its media abroad - and not just in Chinese; Beijing is intensifying efforts to shape its image abroad - and not just for Chinese-speaking audiences.The Christian Science MonitorJuly 3, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 Christian Science Publishing Society All Rights ReservedSection: WorldLength: 1725 wordsByline: Ann Scott Tyson Staff writerBodyAs Hong Kong protesters staged huge marches last month over a bill to allow extradition to China, some of Seattle's Chinese-speaking residents knew nothing about the demonstrations. One reason: For their news, they rely on China's propaganda outlets, which didn't cover the large-scale, politically sensitive demonstrations in the semi-autonomous southern Chinese port city."I didn't hear about any protests in Hong Kong," says a health worker who moved to Seattle 11 years ago from China's Guangdong Province, which borders Hong Kong. "I get all my news online from Sina.com - it's very popular here," she says, referring to the website of a Chinese technology company that runs news from China's state-owned media. She declined to be quoted by name.Over the past decade, the proliferation inside the United States of China's official news - both in Chinese and English - is part of what the Communist Party calls its "Grand Overseas Propaganda Campaign," aimed at "grabbing the right to speak" from Western media, according to official Chinese media reports and government websites.The campaign aims to bolster China's image and soft power abroad by spreading party messaging among the large Chinese diaspora in the U.S. and other countries - as well as, increasingly, foreigners. But it focuses heavily on millions of Chinese in communities abroad, aiming to mold overseas organizations into "propaganda bases" for China's "united front," according to a state-run publication cited in a 2017 report by Anne-Marie Brady, an expert on Chinese politics.The campaign involves not just promoting pro-Beijing information, but discouraging negative reports. Censorship extends into social media, and is strengthened by Chinese platforms' suppression of content that authorities deem negative. For example, some U.S. citizens have recently had messages or entire accounts censored on the popular Chinese messaging app WeChat, owned by the firm Tencent."It's quite shocking to me that China's Great Firewall is coming to the U.S. in digital form," says George Shen, a technology consultant from Newton, Mass., who had his WeChat accounts banned last month.

Rubio, Wyden Urge State Department to Issue Travel Advisories for Americans Traveling to Countries Using Chinese SurveillanceTargeted News ServiceAugust 1, 2019 Thursday 9:00 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 468 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodySen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, issued the following news release:U.S. Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Ron Wyden (D-OR) today sent a letter urging Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to update the State Department's travel advisories in order to alert U.S. citizens who are traveling to countries that use Chinese surveillance and monitoring systems about the threat they face through the use of Chinese-supplied technologies like "smart city" and "safe city" systems.The full text of the letter is below.Dear Secretary Pompeo:We write to urge the State Department to issue travel advisories to U.S. citizens traveling to countries that use Chinese surveillance and monitoring systems, including so-called "smart city" and "safe city" systems. Doing so would make Americans aware that these technologies could expose their personal data to foreign governments, including potentially China.The Chinese government is exporting advanced surveillance and monitoring systems as part of a broad effort to spread its authoritarian model abroad and influence foreign countries. Chinese companies like Huawei and China National Electronics Import &#38; Export Corporation are selling, loaning, or transferring to foreign governments so-called "smart city" and "safe city" systems--a broad array of surveillance and monitoring technologies, including cameras, facial recognition along with artificial intelligence and cloud systems, that can be used to track and monitor individuals.According to The New York Times, more than 18 countries now use Chinese intelligent monitoring systems. These include Germany, which has strong privacy and human rights protections, but also Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates, which do not. Freedom House's 2018 Freedom on the Net report indicates that supplying technology to countries with poor rights records might not only benefit local authoritarians; it might also benefit China. "As more of the world's critical telecommunications infrastructure is built by China," writes Freedom House, "global data may become more accessible to Chinese intelligence agencies through both legal and extralegal methods."The State Department has a core responsibility to make American citizens aware of threats as they travel--including, in the 21st century, the threats to privacy and personal information. Indeed, Americans need to know that repressive regimes may use Chinese-made technology to gain access to sensitive data--or that Chinese intelligence may gain access to data, even if Americans never set foot in China. We therefore urge you to update State Department travel advisories and alert Americans to the presence of Chinese-supplied technologies like "smart city" and "safe city" systems in foreign countries.Sincerely,Copyright Targeted News Services'TeamManager'-6811294 'TeamManager'Load-Date: August 2, 2019End of Document

Forty-seven ethnic groups including Uyghur, Han, Kazak, Hui, Mongol, Tajik and Manchu are flourishing across this vast land of 1.66 million sq km. For thousands of years, Xinjiang has been home to various ethnic groups, where diverse cultures converge and different religions coexist. It was also the heartland of the famed Silk Road connecting ancient China with the rest of the world. The Chinese government has always endeavored to discover, conserve and promote valuable traditional ethnic cultures in Xinjiang. Ethnicities influence, assimilate and integrate with each other in spoken and written languages, customs, arts and other aspects of social and cultural life. Each becomes more confident of its own cultural strength as it adapts to the ever-changing modern world. The government promotes standard Chinese for the convenience of cross-ethnic communication and protects the individual's right to use ethnic spoken and written languages in accordance with the law. Ethnic minority languages are extensively used in the judiciary, administration, public affairs, education, publishing, media, and on the internet. Schools and other educational institutions enrolling ethnic minority students highlight the study and use of ethnic languages in curriculum and assessments. The Chinese government protects citizens' right to freedom of religious beliefs in accordance with the law. Various religions like Protestantism, Buddhism, Taoism, Islam and Catholicism coexist in Xinjiang. The government supports lawful religious activities and fulfills reasonable religious needs of believers. There are 24,400 mosques in Xinjiang alone. To put it in another way, every 530 Muslims in Xinjiang share a mosque, an even higher proportion than that of some Islamic countries. Xinjiang was once a terror-stricken place. Since the 1990s, especially after the September 11 attacks in the US, with rapidly shifting international landscape, terrorism and extremism have started to spread globally. The "three evil forces" of terrorism, extremism and separatism inside and outside China gradually emerged and ran rampant. Adversaries plotted and launched thousands of terrorist attacks in Xinjiang, killing large numbers of innocent civilians, trampling on human rights and endangering public security. The major actors"East Turkestan Islamic Movement"have long been recognized as an international terrorist organization by the United Nations and many countries. Religious extremism is an important ideological foundation for violent and terrorist activities. In recent years, the local government in Xinjiang has been taking a strong stance on violence and terrorism, meanwhile exploring preventive counter-terrorism and de-radicalization approaches. One of the effective measures is educating and rehabilitating people guilty of minor crimes or law-breaking through vocational education and training centers, to help them reintegrate into local communities and prevent them from falling victims to terrorism and extremism. As stated in the agreements between education and training centers and trainees, the centers adopt a boarding school management system and the curricula comprise free and career-oriented courses on standard Chinese language, law, vocational skills, and eradicating extremism. Basic rights of the trainees are guaranteed and their languages,beliefs and customs are fully respected. Ninety percent of the trainees who complete all programmes have found desirable jobs with adequate incomes. They are now a positive force for local communities. The centers are open to visitors and so far have hosted thousands of journalists, members of foreign missions, scholars and religious leaders from all over the world. Seeing is believing. They all understand and support what the local government has been successfully doing. Unfounded claims like "the centers detain and abuse Uyghurs" made up by some few countries and media serve hidden agendas and do not hold any ground. It is notable that, Xinjiang has not witnessed any violent terrorist incidents in the past three years or so. The security situation there has been greatly improved. Domestic and foreign tourists made more than 150 million trips to Xinjiang in 2018, up more than 40 percent year-on-year. Recently, fifty Ambassadors to the United Nations Office in Geneva sent a joint letter to the President of the UN Human Rights Council and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to voice their support for China's position on issues related to Xinjiang. Terrorism is the common enemy of humanity. The Chinese government firmly opposes any forms of terrorism and extremism. China will continue to work with the international community to crack down on violence and terrorism and ensure the rights to life, health and development of people of all ethnic groups.Load-Date: August 13, 2019End of Document

My baby Dusty can cure all ills. Good morning, everyone, thanks so much for joining us, happy Wednesday, I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, July 17th, your top stories right now, just before 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast.Big tech is under fire, Facebook's proposed cryptocurrency coming under pressure on the Hill yesterday. Lawmakers also demanding more regulation of technology giants; Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple, questioning if they all need to be broken up. This, as Amazon also faces trouble overseas, as the E.U. launches an antitrust investigation.Let's take a look at market and this, the week where we are in the middle of the beginning of the second quarter earnings reporting season. Markets record run took a pause yesterday. This morning, we're looking at momentum on the upside.We're focused on earnings, of course, Bank of America, the company to watch this morning, ahead of the open, following beats yesterday by Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan and Wells Fargo. We've got all the numbers and full analysis of the banking earnings.China trade turmoil this morning, President Donald Trump saying that there is still a long way to go before a deal gets done, the fallout, coming up. And then, of course, Democrats divided, the progressive Democrats known as, the squad, reviving their feud with Speaker Nancy Pelosi, more on this very public spat, coming up. MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.We've got a big show this morning, coming up, my exclusive interview with Commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, this morning.Customs and Border Patrol acting director, Mark Morgan, is here to talk the border crisis and Georgia senator, member of the Senate Budget Banking and Armed Services Committee, David Perdue, also here this morning on technology, trade, to discuss the real estate market, as we get economic housing data out this morning, as well.Plus, the founder of chairman -- and the chairman of Equity International, Sam Zell, joining us this morning as well. Don't miss a moment of it, we've got a big three hours.And joining the conversation this morning, CFRA investment strategist, Lindsey Bell is here, along with the former CEO of Home Depot and Chrysler, Bob Nardelli, former Ohio state senate minority leader and American University School of Public Affairs executive resident, Capri Cafaro, great to see everybody this morning.CAPRI CAFARO, EXECUTIVE RESIDENT, AMERICAN UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS: Good morning.BARTIROMO: Thanks so much for being here.BOB NARDELLI, FORMER CEO OF HOME DEPOT AND CHRYSLER: Good morning. It's exciting.BARTIROMO: Yes, it's exciting because here we are, in the beginning of another week of second quarter earnings, and we're going to get a good window into where we are in the economy. Lindsey, what can you tell us, in terms of how the earning season has kicked off?LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA RESEARCH: So far, it's very early earnings. We've heard from a lot of the big banks, and earnings have been pretty decent led by the consumer, which is a very good thing.We're going hear from Bank of America and some of the regional banks today which could be a little bit more dicey, given the net interest environment, with the Fed cutting rates, that's really going to pressure the margin for some of these regional banks. But one thing I also noticed is that trade and tariffs have been a topic of discussion in some of these earnings calls, and you've seen it especially with some of these industrial companies and most notably within the banks, I think this is under reported, is that they're underwriting revenue, declined double digits in the quarter.And I think that's a reflection of the sensitivity to trade, Citi called that out. They're especially seeing a slowdown in Asia. But also, I think it's just a concern for some of these companies as they think about the future of their businesses.BARTIROMO; Yes, we'll see, because I really want to get a window into how strong or weak the economy is right now, because we continue to see record numbers in terms of record low unemployment, and pretty good growth numbers in the first quarter.But we're all worried about things slowing down, so we'll watch that. In the face of all of that, technology is taking some real heat here. We have another hearing yesterday, executives from America's tech giant answered questions from lawmakers yesterday, and faced harsh criticism. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. SHERROD BROWN (D-OH): Facebook is dangerous. Now, Facebook might not intend to be dangerous, but surely they don't respect the power of the technologies they're playing with, like a toddler who has gotten his hands on a book of matches. Facebook has burned down the house over and over and called every arson a learning experience.SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA): In September 2017, when senior management told your board of directors, you also wish Facebook also issued a statement. It said, yes, the Russians have tried to disrupt the election through Facebook, but they only spend 100,000 and they only rent 3,000 ads. That was a lie, wasn't it?DAVID MARCUS, EXECUTIVE, FACEBOOK: I'm sorry, senator.KENNEDY: That was a lie wasn't it?MARCUS: I don't believe it was.REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD): According to data produced by Rand Fishkin, Google controls over 90 percent of the search engine market in the United States, so congratulations on that, although, this seems to fit the classical definition of monopoly. Google was argued that the company's monopoly in the search market is nothing to worry about because competition is just a click away.ADAM COHEN, DIRECTOR OF ECONOMIC POLICY, GOOGLE: I would say that that definition of the market is quite narrow and that when consumers are searching for information online, the range of different services that they use, for example, when people are searching for products, the majority of Americans start their products searches on Amazon.When they're searching for places to travel, hotels and airlines, they start with a dedicated specialist competitor, so I think the market is much broader than that.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Bob, your reaction.NARDELLI: Well, I mean, timing, right, is everything, and there probably couldn't have been a worst time Maria, to bring out this cryptocurrency for Facebook. You can see they're trying to do in this cross-armed salute, no, it's not Google, it's Amazon.It's interesting they're trying to throw stones at each other now to deflect the focus there and the attention that they're under.BARTIROMO: It's hard to argue that Google doesn't have dominant market share.NARDELLI: Absolutely.BARTIROMO: I mean, 90 percent of all search results.NARDELLI: Yes, absolutely. And, you know, Facebook is already, again, under the spotlight to come out with this new cryptocurrency and to be managing, you know, cash now, and financing, it's just the wrong time. You know, it may have been a better time. I would've held back on it myself.BELL: I think this is going to be a period -- a long period of investigation for all of these companies that remind you of the days of Microsoft back in the 90s --NARDELLI: Yes.BELL: -- when we went through that whole process. But you know, monopoly, seems like it's a bad word, but it's actually not illegal, so yes, Google might have monopoly on the search engine market, but as long as they're not preventing other players from getting involved, it's OK, and maybe that's where those companies need to start with.What they're doing isn't wrong if they're not preventing any competition.CAFARO: It'll be interesting to see whether or not, you know, you speak about monopolies, I mean, you know, whether or not, you know, at some point, the Department of Justice would get involved when it comes to, you know, antitrust issues in -- with some of these companies.And I want to go back to this issue of cryptocurrency. We saw some of the numbers from Bitcoin, just there on the screen.BARTIROMO: Yes.CAFARO: Bitcoin was actually noticeably absent from some of these hearings when it came to Libra's you know, the cryptocurrency that Facebook rolled out here. So, one thing that I have found very interesting as well, is that at a time where Washington is so divided, the issue of Facebook and big tech has actually united Democrats and Republican against a common enemy.NARDELLI: Yes.BARTIROMO: It's true.NARDELLI: With the -- with the cryptocurrency with Bitcoin, who would be the person sitting in that seat?CAFARO: Right.NARDELLI: That's part of the issue that people are concerned about. At least, you've got a face with -- Facebook.CAFARO: Right.NARDELLI: And it's what --CAFARO: No transparency --NARDELLI: Yes, and the Bitcoin, you don't know who it is, at this point, really.BARTIROMO: Well, you know, it could have been a different narrative around the crypto, Libra, had it not been for the privacy breaches --CAFARO: Right.BARTIROMO: -- at Facebook. But because this company has shown up that it has breached people's privacy, and has used our data and sold it --NARDELLI: Yes.BARTIROMO: Then, there's a fair argument to be made, though, wait a minute, we have to check this first. We want to look into this.BELL: And I think what's more scary about the Libra thing is, they're really trying to get it to your average everyday consumer to use it to pay for things on Facebook and across the internet.CAFARO: Almost like replacing a PayPal.BELL: Exactly.BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, it has been a wild 48 hours, that's for sure, in Washington, the president versus progressive Democrats, the House voting to pass a resolution, condemning President Trump's recent tweets, singling out four progressive congresswomen.The (INAUDIBLE) done largely along party lines, with only four Republicans joining the Democratic colleagues, they singled out Democrats referred to as the squad, weighing in on a few of the President Trump and their relationship with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. RASHIDA TLAIB (D-MI): l'm dealing with the biggest bully I've ever had to deal with my lifetime. And trying to push back on that, and trying to do job that we all have been sent here to do, which is centered around the people at home. This is a distraction.REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): Our teams are in communication and our chiefs are --GAYLE KING, CHIEF ANCHOR, CBS NEWS: But shouldn't it be a face-to-face? I want to know if you were speaking --TLAIB: She's the new member, not the speaker.KING: No, but I want to know --TLAIB: She has every right to sit down with her in any moment, any time, with any of us. She is Speaker of the House. She can ask for a meeting to sit down with us for clarification.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Wow. Capri, what's your reaction?CAFARO: You know, we've watched the Democrats, the "squad" versus the establishment speaker Pelosi, in leadership, you know, go head-to-head for the last several weeks, frankly actually since, you know, the new class has been in office in January.And I think what's happened here with these incendiary tweets coming out of President Trump, talk about, again, unifying a divided group. What's happened here is, you know, President Trump has kind of brought this group together.Hopefully, we're going to be able to move forward and govern, but unfortunately, I don't think that's probably --NARDELLI: And we've gone from the resistance, to the squad.BARTIROMO: What Tlaib was talking about when she said I'm being -- I'm faced with the biggest bully, I mean, have they ever had a conversation, President Trump --CAFARO: That's a good question.BARTIROMO: -- and Congresswoman Tlaib, she says I'm faced with this bully, I mean, has he said a word to her ever?NARDELLI: Not that I'm aware of, I mean, look, if you look at President Trump's style, I mean, I think he's probably doing this somewhat intentionally, poking the bear, to get this kind of reaction.BARTIROMO: Could be.NARDELLI: And if you look at it towards the election, I think it's going to play in his favor of what's happening here, I mean, I've never seen -- we reach such a low in a House, with Pelosi yesterday, with the Executive Order, I mean, it's just unbelievable what's happened to our leadership team.BARTIROMO: And why go specifically to being women of color? What does that have to do with anything?CAFARO: There's a lot -- there are so many other policy issues --BARTIROMO: Right.CAFARO: -- to address.BARTIROMO: Why are you telling me you're a woman of color? I don't --NARDELLI: Let's work on immigration policy.CAFARO: Yes, there's a whole lot --(CROSSTALK)BELL: Yes, several other issues, major issues.BARTIROMO: A lot to talk about and we'll talk about it this morning. We'll take a break. When we come back, President Trump taking on Google, he wants to look into the technology giant's ties to China, after comments by billionaire investor and entrepreneur, Peter Thiel, a closer look at that, coming up.Then, digital crime, a Microsoft employee charged for allegedly scheming to steal cryptocurrency, back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Retired Supreme Court justice John Paul Stevens has passed away, Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now, Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, Maria, a statement from the Supreme Court says that Stevens died of complications from a stroke. The Navy veteran was appointed by President Gerald Ford back in 1975, and served through 2010.President Trump offered condolences, saying "his passion for the law and for our country will not soon be forgotten." He was known for his humbleness and faith in the law, Justice Stevens, 99 years old.Well, some shocking numbers on the U.S. opioid crisis, the Washington Post is reporting 76 billion opioid pills flooded into the United States just over a six-year period. The DEA says the pills shipped by major drug companies contributed to more than 100,000 American deaths, between the years 2006 and 2012.The Sunny data released as part of several lawsuits by local governments and states that are seeking to hold pharmaceutical companies -- pharmaceutical companies accountable, Oklahoma and JNJ, the head of that fight right now.Well, a former Microsoft worker has been changed in a scheme to steal $10 million in digital currencies. The U.S. attorney's office in Seattle, says a 25-year-old Ukrainian citizen stole things like Microsoft gift cards then resold them out on the internet.Prosecutors say he used money to buy $160,000 dollar Tesla. And get this, Maria, a $1.7 million-dollar lake front home. There you go, digital theft, alive and well.BARTIROMO: Wow, it sure is. All right, thanks so much Cheryl.CASONE: You bet.BARTIROMO: Technology has been under fire, big tech grilled on Capitol Hill yesterday, as President Trump targets Google over its ties to China. Then, delivery wars, McDonald's strikes a blow to Uber Eats, with a new partnership. We've got it all right after this break. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. China and Google, President Trump announcing his administration will take a look at accusations that Google is working with the Chinese government. Now, Facebook board member, Peter Thiel, and Anduril Industries founder, Palmer Luckey, told me earlier this year about the threat from China, Google, and A.I. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: General Dunford, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a senate hearing that Google working with China is actually helping the Chinese military, indirectly. So they're not working with the U.S. military, but they're perfectly fine helping the Chinese military?PETER THIEL, BOARD MEMBER, FACEBOOK: Yes, I think they're officially working with the Chinese University, but then, the question is whether all of these things are, sort of, interlinked and connected in China in practice.There's -- you know, I think -- I think one of the ways to think about the A.I. technology in this, sort of, political context is, that there is a -- there's an innovation research part where, you know, needed to develop new algorithms, maybe some new hardware. And I do think that -- that's where the U.S. is still clearly in the lead, everywhere.PALMER LUCKEY, FOUNDER, ANDURIL INDUSTRIES: When you build an A.I. research center in China, where -- China is not even allowed to operate. They're doing this thing there, kind of, in the hopes that maybe someday, they'll be in China. They are directly helping the Chinese military.The people who work in that center are going to either be working for the military now or in the near future. You better believe it. There's no way that China is going to say, oh no that came from America. We're not going to use that. China's all about using American technology. They'll steal it if we give it to them, and they'll steal it when we don't want to give it to them.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is the former National Security Council Chief of Staff, former CIA official and Center for Security Policy president and CEO, Fred Fleitz, and Fred, it's good to have you on the program this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.FRED FLEITZ, PRESIDENT AND CEO, CENTER FOR SECURITY POLICY: Good to be here.BARTIROMO: So you heard what Palmer Luckey and Peter Thiel just said. What's your take on Google, working in China, I mean, isn't it true that China's main priority is to make sure everything goes by the military first. If you have an innovation in China, there's something called civil fusion, civil military fusion where first, they check that if it's going to be used with the military.FLEITZ: Look, Maria, China is -- Google is operating an A.I. laboratory in Beijing to attract Chinese tech talent, and we know the way the Chinese government operates, every single employee is working for being vetted by Chinese intelligence.Now, Google is trying to reassure us, well, we don't work with the Chinese military, that's nonsense. Anything developed in that laboratory is going to flow through those employees to Chinese intelligence, and be used by the Chinese military.BARTIROMO: Well, that's what I was trying to articulate, that there's this thing called civil military fusion, where anything, any innovation that happens in China. First, it's tested on the military, because their ultimate goal is to be the number one superpower, largest military in the world, bigger than the United States.I mean, if that's the ultimate goal, of course, you're working with the Chinese, whether it's a university or a company. Ultimately, you're working with the military.FLEITZ: I mean, it will be just as bad if this company was operating in the United States and it decided to hire Chinese nationals which Google is probably also doing. But putting this A.I. lab in Beijing, is a real problem and it makes it even worse because of -- because of Google's left wing politics, it has stopped working with the Pentagon.Now, we already know it is slamming its search result against conservatives, but this is moving from a free speech issue to a national security issue. And that's why I'm glad that President Trump wants to look into this.BELL: Fred, Lindsey Bell here, why is it taking Peter Thiel, making these strong accusations against Goggle to actually finally look into this, if this is a problem that has been known for a long time.FLEITZ: You know, that's a good point. It has been known for a long time. It's been written about in the press for quite a while. I think the mainstream media doesn't want to look at this because they don't see China for the threat that it is.And I'm glad that Thiel spoke up, you know, he's breaking with his colleagues in the tech world who -- you know, they want to invest in China. And, I mean, they have this distorted world view that it's OK to deal with the Chinese government and not the Pentagon. And you know, I think that they're going to be under a lot of scrutiny on Capitol Hill.NARDELLI: Hey Fred, Bob Nardelli here. You know, I've had 45 years in business and we've had restrictions over the year about what we could buy from China and what we could produce in China. How does Google get around those policy issues and being able to set up this university, if you call it that, in China? Where's the loophole?PLEITZ: Well, I don't know if there's a restriction stopping Google from doing this. Now, we know Google's pulled out its search engine in 2012 because China was forcing it to censor search results, but just last year, Google was trying to build a secret censorable search engine for the Chinese government that had to drop because of protest in the United States.So, I don't know what the restrictions are from the U.S. government. Popular pressure might be able to reverse this, but Google seems to want -- the revenue from China is not worried about the threat that this poses.BARTIROMO: Well, that's exactly right, because for too long, American companies have been so interested and so focused on getting their, you know, wares in front of the 1.4 billion people in China that along the way, they completely forgot to protect their own product.I mean, the Chinese will steal it and they will steal it so that it can be used for the military. Imagine, Capri, back in World War II days, if one of the leading American companies said to the U.S. government no, no, no, we're not going to work with you on this because we really need to get a foothold into the imperial Japan.CAFARO: It's really --BARTIROMO: It's outrageous.CAFARO: It really is outrageous. And I want to go back to this issue of loopholes, if I -- if I may, Fred just asked a quick question of you on this because we've mentioned this issue of loopholes and, obviously, Google has been able to get around certain, you know, existing regulations and laws in order to get their wares in front of China.So, if President Trump is successful in looking into these, you know, these issues of Google and China, what actual recourse from a regulatory or legislative standpoint does the federal government have to go after Google if they identify that they are these issues that they can prove?FLEITZ: Well, I think Google arguing that, look, we're just running an A.I. lab and we're not working with the military, is just laughable on the face, and I think U.S. government is going to have to be much clearer that this type collaboration poses a national security threat, because there's no way to stop this technology from going to the military.BARTIROMO: Yes.FLEITZ: And maybe there's a way we can bar this.BARTIROMO: Real quick Fred, on Turkey, F-35 sales, the president yesterday cancelled a plan to sell F-35 jet fighters to Turkey, after the country got a new air defense system from Russia. Texas Representative Michael McCaul was with me on Sunday, explaining the problem on "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES." Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: I know that we're selling Turkey, military equipment, your committee overseeing that. They're also buying military equipment from Russia.REP. MICHAEL MCCAUL (R-TX): Very problematic. You have a NATO ally buying Russian military equipment. You can't be a NATO ally and buy Russian military equipment. And what endangers it even more so. We offer them the patriot missile battery system. They chose the Russian instead. This actually blocks the F-35 sales because the S-400 actually tracks our F-35s.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: That was a really important there. The S-400 tracks our F-35, so the S-400 is a ground military piece of equipment and can shoot down F- 35s. And here you have Turkey, a NATO ally, buying from Russia. Do you think Turkey should face sanctions, even though it's a NATO ally?FLEITZ: I think, legally, it has to see. The S-400 is designed to shoot down stealth fighters, and the worry is that once Turkey has this technology, the Russians -- if the Turks get the F-35, Russia will learn more about the stealth plane's capabilities which will help Russia shoot them down.But, you know, the issue of patriot missile is a big one. The Obama administration was involved in negotiations to sell the patriot to Turkey, and they didn't pull off the sale. It isn't that we offer to patriot, is that the negotiation to sell to patriot missiles to Turkey did not succeed.So, I think President Trump's criticism of the Obama administration on this point is valid.BARTIROMO: All right, we will leave it there. We'll see what happens next with Turkey given it is a NATO ally. Fred, it's great to get your insights on all of this. Thanks so much.FLEITZ: Good to be here.BARTIROMO: Fred Fleitz joining us there. Coming up, bank earnings are on tap this week. Bank of America is coming up. We'll bring you the numbers, it should be reporting any minute now. We'll have the analysis as well, stock is up going into the number.And then, it is World Emoji Day, check this out, Apple's rolling out a preview of its 2019 digital images. We'll take a look right after this break. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, July 17th. Your top stories right now, 6:31 a.m. on the East Coast.We are focused on earnings this morning, Bank of America, the company watching this morning ahead of the open. Following beats yesterday from Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, and Wells Fargo.We've got the numbers on the quarterly numbers out of Bank of America momentarily. Stay with us for that. Meanwhile, we are looking at markets higher this morning. Futures indicating a gain as the start of trading.Dow Futures up 27, S&P Futures up 3-1/4, and the Nasdaq Futures up 14-1/2 right now. Bank of New York just coming out right now, by the way.The record run on Wall Street took a pause yesterday. President Trump's comments about the China trade deal weighed on investors a bit. He says -- he says there is still a long way to go in terms of a deal between the U.S. and China.Dow Industrials yesterday down 23 at the close. S&P was down 10, and the Nasdaq was lower by 35.Global markets this morning looked like this. European Indices are mixed. FT-100 is lower, down 8-1/2. But CAC Quarante is up about a point and the DAX Index up about four points, fractional moves in the Eurozone this morning.In Asia overnight, trade fears drove markets lower across the board. It was just a fractional move as you can see. But nonetheless, in the negative column.McDonald's at your doorstep. The fast-food giant deliver is a blow to Uber with a new deal. We've got the details, coming up.Then, it is World Emoji Day. A look at the newest offerings coming to your phones. All of that right here coming up.But first, our top story this half an hour. Markets in focus and the economy after record-breaking highs. U.S. markets dipped yesterday after President Trump's comments challenging China, yet again, on trade and technology with the potential of more tariffs.Joining us right now to take a look at the macro story is Cornerstone Macro co-founder and chief economist, Nancy Lazar. And Nancy, it's always great to see you.NANCY LAZAR, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND PARTNER, CORNERSTONE MACRO: Good morning.BARTIROMO: Thanks so much for joining us. What's your take on the economy right now, the backdrop?LAZAR: I think the U.S. economy is some of the healthiest -- has a healthiest economic backdrop I've seen in a long time. 2Q economic weakness that we're going to see in GDP is old news. New news is that we'll probably like to see a pickup in the economy because there's lots of supports for growth, cyclically and also secularly.BARTIROMO: So, what's with all of the talk about, rate cuts about? Things slowing down quite a bit?LAZAR: Yes.BARTIROMO: Second half of the year.LAZAR: Yes.BARTIROMO: Where did that come from and do you think we've actually survived it?LAZAR: Yes. So, you do have an earnings recession. You'll see that as you go through 2Q data. And that recession was in part related to the China trade war and the sharp slowdown we saw in Chinese economic activity.China is really the driver of the corporate earnings recession. And businesses, as a result, business confidence as a result of that got hit. And so, now what you're seeing as that trade tension has eased, and as China has eased massively. We've kind of 80 easy moves out of Beijing over the past year.That stimulus is slowly starting to help, support the Chinese economy. You also had some distortion to the trade data as activity was pulled forward because of the trade war. That's all now starting to fade.Interest rates are lower around the world. The U.S. economy is healthy. We have productivity that's driving growth. And so, at the end of the day, as you move into the second half of the year, I think growth, yes, incrementally definitely picks up.BARTIROMO: Yes, and you -- and you -- and you also, let's not forget wages up better than three percent year-over-year. First time Americans have gotten an increase in their pay at about 10 years.NARDELLI: Yes.BARTIROMO: The president spoke yesterday about the U.S.-China trade deal. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We have a long way to go as far as tariffs which others concerned if we want. We have another $325 billion that we can put a tariff on if we want.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: He is not backing down, Bob. Even if that additional tariff on $325 billion means ahead to the economy.NARDELLI: No.BARTIROMO: I don't know, I want to get your take on that.NARDELLI: Yes, no, I -- listen, I admire his tenacity. He's really looking for the longer term, I think, how do we really fix the problem? We've been kind of kicking the can down the road for a long time.BARTIROMO: And they're not going to stop stealing.NARDELLI: And they're not. And so, I admire his tenacity. You know, he's taking a lot of criticism for it. And, but Nancy, I'd be interested, you know, you laid out a pretty positive future here.You know, consumer's strong. In the second quarter, we were talking about that earlier. But some of the profitability may be a little depressed. What do you see for the second half?LAZAR: The consumer is pretty healthy but they're not spending beyond their means. So, the 3-1/2 percent kind of growth trajectory we have for consumer spending for the second quarter probably doesn't continue into the back half of the year. Something around to 2-1/2 percent is probably a better track record.As Maria says, they have a healthy employment backdrop, solid wage gains. And what I really impressed with is the breadth of the job growth. You are lifting the boat, you are creating a healthier job market for all Americans and you see it in the data.This is not just talk, you see it in the unemployment rates, you see it in the labor force participation rates, you see it in low-income wages are up as much as high-income wages are, and you see that an overall income growth.So, the consumer is healthy. You had a weak first quarter, a very robust second quarter backdrop. But a pretty healthy. I'm more interested in focused on capitals pending. I think that's really the key driver to growth today.NARDELLI: Yes.BARTIROMO: And what about capex, Nancy?LAZAR: Well, capex also took a little bit of a lull in the first half of the year.NARDELLI: Yes.LAZAR: But I do think that's going to pick back up in the second half of the year. Capitals, this has been the strongest capital spending cycle in history, and it's been the longest capital spending cycle in history.And so, capex today, and it's very broad-based, it's being driven by technology, but also old economy investments in this -- in this country. And capex today is creating -- is helping to create the strength in the job -- in the job -- in the job market. Companies create jobs, and that investment cycle is.There's a really huge misperception that I've been passionate about on capex in this country and that it's been week -- it's not been week, it's been -- it's been the one of the healthiest capex cycles we've seen.BARTIROMO: Well, part of the issue is that when you measure capex, some people don't measure technology --LAZAR: Right.BARTIROMO: Which is probably one of the biggest spends for corporations today.NARDELLI: Definitely a shift. It's no longer brick-and-mortar so much as it is technology.LAZAR: Yes, that's right. That's right.NARDELLI: Driving productivity, Nancy, as you mentioned.LAZAR: That's right. That's right.NARDELLI: And really the e-commerce side.LAZAR: I was excited about your McDonald's news item. They've been at the forefront of productivity since their inception. And so, for McDonald's to be continuing to innovate change their business model is a beautiful example of companies, in general, continuing to invest in their business.BARTIROMO: And you have to believe Lindsey, as A.I. gets further implemented into businesses, that's going to only increase productivity.BELL: Yes, that's a --BARTIROMO: What's your question?BELL: That's a great point is on productivity. It's been kind of weak lately. So, I'm wondering what drives the pickup in productivity and then in the second half of the year when you're expecting capex to increase, what's the key driver there?Because if tariffs are still in place, there's threats of escalating tariffs to the whole -- full kit and caboodle of all the goods that we import from China, isn't that a risk?LAZAR: Well, let's take a step back. First, productivity has picked up. It's picked up since 2016, productivity has been in an approving trend. And indeed, in 2018, and here in early '19, it broke out on the upside. So, productivity is an accelerating trend for some reason nobody doesn't get much respect.BELL: But is it below historical averages that this --(CROSSTALK)LAZAR: Well, absolutely. It hit a record low growth rate and that was because of the lack of investment in this country in the last expansion. But when the facts changed change, and what's changed is we have had an investment cycle, this expansion. It is now showing up in product -- in productivity.Unit labor cost which is really the driver of inflation are actually now declining. And so, that's going to keep inflationary pressures lower longer. Yes, the trade war is indeed probably the biggest risk. Not so much by the increase in the tariffs, but what it does do to business? What that does do to business confidence, and businesses willing to reinvest in this country.But the bigger issue is we've had a solid investment cycle already, and this could slow it down -- has slowed it down some. And it could keep it slow if it indeed re-escalates and that to me is one of the biggest risks to the outlook in the back --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: She -- under President Obama, there were so many rules and regulations. A lot of people compared it to 15 King James Bibles, literally. I mean, no, seriously, that the number of pages of regulation.And then companies were sitting on cash. They weren't only handcuffs because of the regulations they were facing, they didn't know what was around the corner.LAZAR: Yes.BARTIROMO: So, they had to sit on cash. Would you disagree with that, that the president's deregulation plan sparked an enormous amount of (INAUDIBLE)?CAFARO: No question about that. We actually have this experience on the state of Ohio, where I worked on regular reform there, where things were slowed down significantly because we have so many regulations, we were not able to permit and thing of that nature.BARTIROMO: Yes.CAFARO: I'm curious to see what's going to happen with the manufacturing sector going forward in the second half of the year.BARTIROMO: And that's one area that you, you know, Jay Powell said is a weak spot manufacturing. We saw it in the PMI, right, Nancy? Real quick.LAZAR: You did. But then, yesterday you saw better manufacturing data, and indeed, in part was led by semi-conductor production in this country.NARDELLI: Yes.LAZAR: So, I think, manufacture activity is bottomed, it got hit because of concerns. Inventory is on export, but now those things are turning.NARDELLI: Yes.BARTIROMO: Nancy, it's so great to get your insight.LAZAR: Thanks very much.BARTIROMO: Thanks so much for joining us. Nancy Lazar, from Cornerstone Macro.Coming up, we are awaiting earnings from Bank of America. We bring you those numbers and analysis as soon as they hit the tape. Stock is up, two- thirds represent going into it.And then, no more facial recognition. One city votes to unanimously ban the technology. We'll let you know where, and why. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We are waiting on Bank of America's quarterly earnings. The earnings are expected to be 71 cents a share on revenue of $23.19 billion. Joining us right now is Mendon Capital advisor, senior portfolio manager, Anton Schutz, who is a long-time bank investor. And you've invested in regional, smaller cap. But you've also invested in the big guys like Bank of America overtime.ANTON SCHUTZ, FOUNDER, MENDON CAPITAL ADVISORS: Sure, absolutely.BARTIROMO: Are you expecting a good quarter? What are you expecting here?SCHUTZ: You know, like the rest of the big guys? I think I expect a mixed quarter, but I think, really, what we're looking for is continued, you know, long growth, continued customer acquisition and lots of return of capital -- and pretty good credit metrics. I mean, credit has been benign.BELL: That's a good point: credit has not crept up yet, even though in these late stages and everybody is worrying about what's going to happen next. But what is next catalyst for the banks? Because you think about interest rates coming down that's going to hurt net interest income and interest margins; the consumer still feeling good. We just got past the c- car, so now they're giving more money investors, what's next?SCHUTZ: Well, I mean, I think if you look at the big banks, they're like utilities, right? They pay big dividends, they buy back lots of stock, and if you look at their evaluation relative to the S&P, it's at 40-year historic lows. So, if there's ever a rotation from growth value, these guys will benefit. I don't think there's a ton of downside into them. And by the way, the fed cuts -- as much as they may be a negative for things like (INAUDIBLE), they're positive for credit, right? They extend the credit cycle and people are really worried about credit, and I'm just not seeing it. I mean, their pockets -- I look around this country, and I look at the different geographies around this country and people are moving to the south and the southeast, and to states that have much lower taxes. Well, those economies are thriving.BARTIROMO: Yes.SCHUTZ: You know.NARDELLI: Let me ask a question. You know, you mentioned earlier about Bank of America, 30 million buy back. We're seeing some of the small region growth together. We saw SunTrust purchase. What's really happening out there. And Lindsey mentioned interest rate down, what would you -- what's going to happen to these banks going forward, both big ones, why aren't they acquiring more?BARTIROMO: Let's get right to Ashley to get to the numbers and the answer that question. I just want to get -- because the numbers are actually out and it is better than expected. Ashley Webster with those.ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER: Yes, good morning Maria. A little bit of a mixed story on EPS, beat at $0.74, as you said; the estimate was $0.71. By the way, that is now the 13th quarter in a row that has beaten on the earning side. Revenue very, very slight miss coming in at 23.1 billion. The estimate was 23.2 billion. So, just a slight miss on revenue, and we're just looking at a some of the headlines coming down. The consumer banking revenue 9.72 billion, waiting to see some comments on cost cutting that speaks for Bank of America.As we know the securities trading environment has been a bit tough, but consumer lending has been solid, let's put it that. Global Wealth Investment revenue, 4.9 billion. That's kind of in line with what people are expecting. Average loan and lease balances, up 34 billion or four percent. That is -- solid global banking revenue coming in again at 4.975 billion. So, overall, I think pretty much what we've seen with the big banks up to now, that have reported similar for Bank of America. But we should mention, just a slight miss on revenue side, Maria.BARTIROMO: All right, thank you so much Ashley, you're in middle of a dialogue with Anton. Your reaction, Anton?SCHUTZ: Well, you know, if you think about what's going to happen to this industry, you've got the top four banks which can't buy, right? They're at the 10 percent deposit cap; they're not buying any other banks. Maybe they buy a (INAUDIBLE), maybe they improve that.BARTIROMO: Or they could buy on AUM; they could increase their AUM, right?SCHUTZ: Oh yes, absolutely. (INAUDIBLE) asset management, they do but they can't --BARTIROMO: Yes, but they just can't buy deposit.SCHUTZ: Yes, exactly. But you know what, there are 88 banks between 10 billion and 100 billion. And given, you know, the new regulatory bias to allow banks to merge, obviously, we saw SunTrust, the BB&T, we're going see a lot of those 88 banks partner up and that will create some shifting sands. Clearly, the BB&T-SunTrust merger is going to be good for shareholders but it's also good for every other bank in their footprint.I mean, you know everybody is going to gather a little bit of customers, a little bit of some of the people that they lose. So, you know, if you're in the southeast, you're going get some customers, you're going to get some good people and you're going to upgrade your talent -- and by the way, their shareholder is getting 1.6 billion of cost saves. So, we will see a lot of mergers between those banks between 10 and 100.BARTIROMO: I think the market -- what is it, 90 percent chance that the Fed cuts rates in a week and a half on July 30-31? What does that mean for banking sector when the Fed cuts rates?SCHUTZ: So, not every bank's balance sheet --BARTIROMO: And do you agree with that Fed cut?SCHUTZ: Oh yes. I mean, I think, you know -- I think the one the Fed -- thinks the Fed has done over the last few years is be a little more clear about messaging; not trying to shock markets, so there's a cut coming but the question is the degree of it. I think, you know, the easy one is 25 bases points and probably most logical one because you still see these mix number, right? You see really good consumer numbers yesterday, good growth, you know, GDP looks a little better this quarter, so they need to give us a 50-base point shock. I mean, you know, I think, when I was here last, we talk about 13 trillion around world negative interest rates, are you kidding me?BARTIROMO: That's right. But isn't that one of the reasons that fed has to cut because everybody else across the world is actually cutting -- and it's putting our currency at a disadvantage.BELL: Right, and it's putting pressures also on interest rates here in the U.S. when you have the highest interest rate around the world, the money is going to come -- right. But with respect to the interest rate for banks' earnings, you saw, JPMorgan, they cut net interest income expectations. Citigroup talked about it being a $50 billion impact per quarter. So, there is going to be a real impact. Can you talk about how it's going to impact the regionals?SCHUTZ: Sure. I mean, again, it depends on the balance sheet. And JPMorgan assumed three cuts on their numbers and I -- I think, you know, two is probably relatively more likely. I mean, again, we continue to see decent GDP growth.BARTIROMO: I think we're going to be like, what do you know that I don't know if they cut so much and so aggressively? I mean --SCHUTZ: I mean, I think the Fed is really worried about trade wars. So, I think they're just trying to get in front of that.BARTIROMO: That's the unknown, true.SCHUTZ: You know. I mean, if we get a deal, great. You know, then not going to be as aggressive. We don't get a deal and we have to be more aggressive.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Speaking of deals. I mean, one of the things that we're talking about as far as, sort of, global question marks -- I mean, what about Brexit? I mean, right now, we're facing -- they're facing, you know, a prime minister race. I mean is that going to have any impact on the global markets?SCHUTZ: Well, I mean, I think the world has been calm about it because we've got nothing but headlines on it for three-year, and no, you know, real direct impact. I mean, I think what actually happens, I think, you actually are going to have a little bit of a shock and we're going to have to figure out the chest board. I'm not sure the market alike at the day it happens.BARTIROMO: Real quick, Anton, before you go: where do you want to put money right here? How are you investing?SCHUTZ: I am absolutely investing in the southeast, and I'm absolutely buying companies, you know, ten times forward earnings. If you think about cost cuts that company is getting together, that's 25 percent in the bank. And we just saw a deal announced the other day were cross-cuts are 55 percent.BARTIROMO: Wow! Anton, it's great to have you on the show.SCHUTZ: My pleasure.BARTIROMO: Thanks so much, Anton Schutz. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Family members of victims killed in the Boeing Max 737 crashes testifying on Capitol Hill today. Cheryl Casone on headlines now, Cheryl.CASONE: It's going to be quite the testimony, Maria. This is coming as a congressional panel is examining aviation safety following those two deadly crashes involving Boeing's best-selling plane -- that 737. Paul (INAUDIBLE), is a Canadian. He lost his wife, three children, and mother- in-law in the Ethiopia crash this March. He is scheduled to appear. He wants Boeing to scrap the plane and company executive to resign and face criminal charges.We should also add that United Airlines is expecting profits to rise despite the grounding of the Max 737. Company says that strong domestic demand going it'd be forecast but airline expects to only boost flying capacity by about four percent.No more facial recognition, folks. The Oakland City Council has voted unanimously to ban the technology in city departments including police, making it the second city in the country to do so after San Francisco. This amends the cities current surveillance ordinance and prevent city departments from adopting any facial recognition technology and from using information that is obtained by this software.Well, McDonald's is partnering with DoorDash in a major blow to Uber Eats. DoorDash is going to start delivering orders from about 200 McDonald's restaurants in Houston later this month. This could expand nationally later in the year.

Chinese Government Leads the World in Blockchain Standardized Certification; Aelf, Alipay and Lenovo some of the first to receive certificationPR NewswireJuly 22, 2019 Monday 4:00 AM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 780 wordsDateline: BEIJING and SINGAPORE, July 22, 2019 BodyPR NewswireFor years, governments around the world have been floundering with the challenge of how to respond to cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. The Chinese Government has not been immune to the controversy taking a publicly conservative stance towards many aspects of the cryptocurrency world. However, a lesser known fact is that the Chinese Government has been regarding blockchain technology and its potential with a positive view. Starting 2017, China Electronics Technology Standardization Institute (CESI) - a government authorized institution founded in 1973, has been conducting Standard Blockchain System Function Test in order to pressure test and certify the top blockchain projects operating in China. Since inception, the organization has certified only 30 projects globally, including Lenovo, Alipay, and most recently,aelf.The underlying thought behind this organization lies in the belief in the technology. Despite the appearance shared internationally because of its conservative stance on crypto currency, China in fact understands the benefits and application potential of the technology. At the launching ceremony and the first academic seminar of the Digital Finance Open Research Program held on July 8, 2019, Xin Wang, director of People's Bank of China Research Bureau and head of the Monetary and Financial Bureau, remarked on the potential of blockchain based financial solutions."We need to strengthen the construction of digital financial solutions (based on blockchain). There are various technical shortcomings involving the current financial infrastructure in areas of privacy protection and the system security against malicious attacks."The creation of the Standard Blockchain System Function Test shows that China is on the forefront when compared with governments around the world, in regards to regulatory and development solutions. While many governments are struggling to regulate blockchain projects, China has taken a decisive stance and developed extensive guidelines and tests to validate the previously uncharted technology. The certification provides a standard that can be used by the general public and other enterprises to judge the foundation of the projects that otherwise would be difficult without the knowledge and manpower to independently conduct the validation. Currently there is no obligation for any project to apply for certification, but those that do apply undergo rigorous testing and scrutiny to verify the quality of all aspects of the technology. Upon having an application approved, the project will then receive a visit from specialized government agents who complete a comprehensive process consisting of over 40 pages of tests and analysis. The test is so complex and difficult that a pass constitutes of a score above 60%. From application to certification, the process takes almost 4 months. Out of an unverified number of applicants, only 30 projects have received certification over the course of the past 2 years.Aelf is the latest to receive certification and is the first international blockchain focused company to receive the globally recognized status with a score of over 90%. They have now joined the ranks with Lenovo and Alipay. Aelf's CEO and Founder, Ma Haobo stated, "This certification shows the quality and core ability of not only our developers, but our blockchain platform. It is designed to meet the strict quality large enterprises are given to expect, and indeed require, to ensure they can function at the performance their clients expect." He went on to explain that this certification is something other governments should take notice of and employ to aid in their ever-evolving regulatory solutions.For more information visitaelf.ioaelf Founder, Haobo Ma and aelf Co-founder, Zhuling Chen are available for interview.About aelfaelf is a multi-chain network and smart contract platform pioneering blockchain in business. aelf's blockchain will enable businesses to operate their applications on the public chain domain, or their own private chains, without the hassle of building their own. Within the aelf ecosystem, each application will have its own resources to secure high performance. aelf's token (ELF) was recently selected by Huobi's HB10 fund as one of the top 10 most reliable investments based on its well-founded platform. aelf recently announced the results of its initial testnet, which achieved 15,000 transactions per second (TPS).

China uses LinkedIn to recruit spies abroadCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 28, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 992 wordsBody       Chinese President Xi JinpingForeign agents are exploiting social media to recruit resources, using LinkedIn asthe primary talent seeker, according to Western counterintelligence officials interviewed by the New York Times. Intelligence agencies from the United States, Britain, Germany and France have issued warnings about foreign agents approaching thousands of users on the site. Chinese spies are the most active, officials say."We've seenChina's intelligence services do this on a large scale," said William R. Evanina, director of the National Center for Counterintelligence and Security, a government agency that tracks foreign espionage and alerts companies possible infiltrations. "Instead of sending spies to the U.S. to recruit a single target, it's more efficient to sit behind a computer in China and send friend requests to thousands of targets using fakeprofiles."The Chinese government's misuse of social media has been the subject of increased scrutiny in recent weeks. Facebook, Twitter and YouTube said they deleted accounts that had spread misinformation about protests in Hong Kong. Twitter alone said it deleted nearly 1,000 accounts.It was the first time Facebook and Twitter had deleted accounts linked to misinformation from China. Several governments have been on disinformation since Russia used the tactic effectively in 2015 and 2016.LinkedIn, owned by Microsoft, not only provides another vehicle for misinformation but is ideal for recruiting espionage,U.S. officials say.LinkedIn is the main social network used by Chinese agents to recruit spies abroad. (Reuters)This is because many of its 645 million users seek employment opportunities, often from unknown people. To improve their prospects, many former government employees announce that they have security clearances.LinkedIn is also the only U.S. social network that is not blocked in China because the company has agreed to censor messages containing sensitive material.Chinese agents often bid through various networks, including LinkedIn, to attract talent, sometimes through the facade of a corporate recruitment company that offers to pay them for their talks, their consulting services or their help in the Research. From there, agents develop the relationship."The Chinese want to build these alternatives with political, academic and business elites," said Jonas Parello-Plesner, a former Danish Foreign Ministry official who reported the apparent recruitment attempt by the Chinese in Linkedin. "Much of this thrives in the grey zone or on the spectrum between the search for influence and classic espionage."People who have just left the government are especially vulnerable because they often seek a new job, he and other former officials say.Nicole Leverich, spokeswomanLinkedIn said the company proactively searches for fake accounts to remove and has a team acting on information from a variety of sources, including government agencies."We enforce our policies, which are very clear: creating a fake account or fraudulent activity with the intent of deceiving or lying to our members is a violation of our terms of service," he said.In some cases, LinkedIn has proven to be an effective recruiting tool. A former CIA and Defense Intelligence Agency employee, Kevin Patrick Mallory, was sentenced in May to 20 years in prison for spying for China. The relationship began after he responded in February 2017 to a LinkedIn message from a Chinese intelligence agent posing as a representative of a think tank, the F.B.I. said.Last October, the Justice Department accused a Chinese intelligence agent, Yanjun Xu, of economic espionage after recruiting a GE Aviation engineer in a relationship that began on LinkedIn, according to the indictment.Amid trade and diplomatic tensions between Beijing and Washington, an extradited Chinese spy arrived in the US, accused of conspiracy and theft of trade secrets (AP)Jonas Parello-Plesner,a former Foreign Affairs official, was contacted on LinkedIn by a user named Grace Woo in 2011. Woo said he worked for DRHR, a talent search company in Hangzhou, China. When he discovered that Parello-Plesner was visiting Beijing in 2012, he invited him to stop by Hangzhou to meet with the company. He asked for an image of his passport so he could make the travel arrangements, but he refused.The former Danish official agreed to meet at the St. Regis Hotel in Beijing. Woo never showed up, but a young man who claimed to be from DRHR led the Parello-Plesner to a conference room, where three middle-aged men welcomed him. They said they were from a government research organization, but they didn't have business cards."'This meeting is very suspicious, ' I thought, " said Parello-Plesner.The men told Parello-Plesner that they could fund their research if he worked with them, promising "broad access to the Chinese system," he said.Parello-Plesner, suspecting the men were intelligence or security agents, reported the meeting to British officials when he returned to London, where he was living at the time." If I were LinkedIn, I would do my homework very carefullynow," added Parello-Plesner, who wrote about his experience last year.DRHR was one of three companies that German intelligence officials pointed out in December 2017 as front organizations for Chinese agents. Agents concluded that China used LinkedIn to try to contact 10,000 Germans, which is why LinkedIn closed some accounts, including those of DRHR and Woo.In October, French intelligence agencies informed the government that Chinese agents had used social media - in particular LinkedIn - to contact 4,000 French people. Targets included government employees, scientists and business executives, according to the French newspaper Le Figaro.MORE ABOUT THISSubject:Australian writer and activist Yang Hengjun was arrested in China for "espionage"China installs spyware on the cell phones of tourists visiting the northwest of the country Load-Date: August 29, 2019End of Document

BIPARTISAN ROUDA PROVISION BLOCKING FEDERAL TRANSIT DOLLARS TO CHINESE STATE SPONSORED COMPANIES PASSES HOUSE IN NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACTStates News ServiceJuly 12, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 532 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, D.C. BodyThe following information was released by he office of California Rep. Harley Rouda:This afternoon, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to pass H.R. 2500, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2020. In the bill's base text was a provision blocking federal transit dollars for procurement of electric rail cars from Chinese State Owned Enterprises (SOEs), and other state-supported companies, originally introduced in the Senate by Senator John Cornyn (R-TX), and the House by Rep. Harley Rouda (D-CA), as part of the Transit Infrastructure Vehicle Security Act (TIVSA).Said Rouda, "I'm proud to be the lead sponsor of this important piece of legislation with Senator John Cornyn (R-TX), who worked to secure this provision in this year's Senate NDAA. China's 'Made in China 2025' initiative is an unmistakable effort to harm American manufacturers by subsidizing Chinese rail and bus industries. Chinese companies misrepresent themselves as benevolent actors, but let's be clear: this is an attack on our economy and national security. I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for coming together to stop the flow of Americans' taxpayer dollars to Chinese state-owned or state-supported companies."Specifically, the provision prohibits financial assistance to be used in awarding a contract or subcontract to an entity for the procurement of rail rolling stock for use in public transportation if the manufacturer is owned, controlled by, or legally or financially related to corporations under certain conditions identified in the bill that designate the corporation to be a state-sponsored or owned enterprise located in adversarial non-market economies like China.The Chinese government continues to use a range of state subsidies and predatory practices to support its market ascension in certain sectors of the United States' economy. Two of these sectors, rail manufacturing and bus manufacturing, are included as part of China's "Made in China 2025" initiative, a plan targeting global dominance in areas that the Chinese government considers most strategic to its global aims.Chinese state-owned and state-supported enterprises have used subsidized "bargain prices" well-below competitive market price to win contracts throughout the United States. A number of large, metropolitan areas have recently awarded rail rolling stock procurements to a Chinese state-owned enterprise. There are a number of threats these procurements pose including impeding economic competitiveness and overtaking the supply chains that support United States public transportation agencies. Chinese state-owned and state-supported enterprises have increased security vulnerabilities and create new risks for rolling stock procurements.Joining Rouda in originally introducing the provision in May were Reps. Rick Crawford (R-AR), Scott Perry (R-PA), Kay Granger (R-TX), Tim Ryan (D-OH), Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC), Randy Weber (R-TX), and John Garamendi (D-CA). In the Senate, the original bill was led by Senators John Cornyn (R-TX), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Mike Crapo (R-ID), and Sherrod Brown (D-OH).Additionally, Rouda cosponsored eight amendments adopted in the NDAA.Load-Date: July 12, 2019End of Document

U.S. Futures extending losses from last week, pointing to a sell-off at the open, last week, the S&P and NASDAQ suffering their worst week of the year, following an escalation in the trade tensions with China.Trade, also hitting markets around the globe, in Europe red across the board, a loss north of two percent, in England. In Asia overnight, steep losses there, as well. In China, Yuan dropping to its lowest level in more than a decade, and what could be Beijing's answer to President Trump's latest tariff threat.So, 10 percent tariffs on $300 billion in imports here, if the currency in China falls that offsets the impact it would have, on trade.U.S.-China trade in focus, a global sell-off coming off President Trump's threats to impose that 10 percent tariff on another $300 billion in Chinese goods. That would include items like smartphones, clothing, toys, many are starting to think that the trade battle is nowhere near an end, and could be intensifying.We look at where the trade talks could go from here, and if the currency is becoming the latest battlefield. Chipmakers, taking a bit hit, shares of Advanced Micro Devices, Intel, and Nvidia, seeing steep drops, losses there, almost four percent on AMD and Nvidia.Plus, the country, mourning. Two mass shootings in a matter of hours over the weekend, 29 people murdered, President Trump calling for Republicans and Democrats to come together and get strong on background checks.We will discuss that as the morning wears on. Here to break it all down with me, associate editor at Barron's, Jack Hough, pollster and Maslansky & Partners president, Lee Carter, and PWC partner, Mitch Roschelle, welcome one and all.Stephen Moore, I should point out, who was on before author of Trumponomics. Is that how you say it, Lee, Trumponomics? Said that he thinks that a deal will get done by the end of the year.It'll be something small, but the lynchpin here, at least, in the recent escalation, seemed to be or the sticking point was buying more agricultural goods that President Trump wanted assurances from Bob Lighthizer and Steven Mnuchin, the treasury secretary who were in China, that the Chinese were going to do more of that, they couldn't give him that with certainty.And he said -- he said, in one word, in a meeting with White House advisers, all of whom pushed back on him, other than Peter Navarro, tariffs, and he went ahead with this, and tweeted about it, kind of, to the surprise of investors, surely.MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC: (INAUDIBLE) was supposed to up their soybean imports, they didn't. I think that was one of the sticking points in this conversation, but it's no surprise that some of the states that export on soybeans to China are also swing states in -- or battleground states, if you will.So, I think China is hip to our Electoral College map, and they're a little bit smarter than maybe we're giving credit for.JACK HOUGH, ASSOCIATE EDITOR, BARRON'S: I've been saying, the Fed put is kaput, like the rate cuts, you don't get the automatic stock jump anymore that you used to get. There might be a Trump put, and I don't know how powerful it's going to be.If the president is watching the stock market today and if we keep seeing declines in the stock market, I think there's that much more incentive to find a way to come to a deal in China. Now, I don't know if that gets us back on track, but I think the White House is watching carefully.MCDOWELL: President Trump being unpredictable, maybe it works in the China trade negotiations, but certainly, it caught the investors off-guard, and it's catching businesses off-guard.LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS: Yes, and this has happened over and over and over again, when it comes to tariffs, everybody thinks. I mean, everybody thinks, I mean, conventional wisdom would say nobody would ever do this, and yet, he continuously does that.So, and it-- and it throws us all off-kilter. This one feels a little bit different than others, I think as it seems more like a retaliatory measure, than some of the others that's more of a negotiating strategy, but we'll see.MCDOWELL: There was a report out this morning that the Chinese government had ordered any government agencies to stop buying agricultural goods coming in the U.S. But I want to point out China's top economic planner said on state media CCTV on Monday that the U.S. accusations that the country didn't start buying American farm products as agreed are untrue, what to make of this?American Enterprise Institute U.S. Research Strategy in Asia, U.S. alliance, a former White House national security adviser, Zack Cooper is here, Zack, just put the reset eruption in the last several days into perspective here.ZACK COOPER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: Well, just as you said, the president seems to have overruled most of his advisers and gone ahead with the tariffs. I think the real question now is what's the path forward, is there a deal, are the Chinese really willing to come back to the table?If you look at the markets, and certainly, the reaction in Beijing overnight, I think the answer might be no. The devaluing of the Renminbi, is a big sign in my view, that the Chinese are in this for the long haul, and that's what they're trying to show. MCDOWELL: But how much damage could that do, the devaluation of that currency, and the real drop in trade with the United States, now no longer the number one trading partner with the U.S. How much of -- how much damage has that done to the Chinese economy and will do?COOPER: Well, it's certainly an effort to prop up the economy, see if they can get, at least, a couple more months of solid growth. We never know whether any of the growth numbers in China are real. But I think you have to think that this is a sign that they're under some pressure, but also that they are trying to stay strong for the long term.This doesn't seem like a move that China would be making if it was going to be making a deal in the next month or two.ROSCHELLE: Zack, good morning, Mitch Roschelle. One of the things that's driving their currency down or it's being manipulated as it's been reported, is they are also printing money to help stimulate the economy. How long can they continue to do that?How long can they continue to devalue their currency whether they're doing it as a direct result to stimulus, or to retaliate, but how long can that go on.COOPER: No one really knows the answer to that. I think the other question that's related is, how long can the United States keep doing this? How long can the Trump administration keep using tariffs as this tool, when does the concern about the 2020 campaign kick in and force the president to come back to the table and make a deal? And which one of those two sides is going to bend first?That's the real question in my view.MCDOWELL: Jack, do you have a question?HOUGH: Zack, who -- I keep hearing that the U.S. holds a strong hand and you -- and you can look at the consumer side of the economy here and certainly that looks solid. But, I mean, do you agree with that? I think of China, as a country, that has this relatively new middle class, right?They don't have the rich history or economic power that we have here. And I wonder, I hear about a lot of Americans that are kind of hanging on right now, paying the bills. Who has the weaker hand right now in these negotiations who can hang on for longer?COOPER: Oh, I think it looks like the Chinese are being hurt more in the short term, certainly if you look at the stock market shifts. But the real question, I think, is whether the Chinese Communist Party feels that it is under pressure because it's delivered decades of double-digit economic growth.And now that growth is slowing, first to seven percent, now to six percent and whether the tariffs are going to do more damage is the real question.But, I think, on the U.S. side, the real debate is going to be, as we get closer to 2020, does the president need to make a deal to make sure that he can get re-elected or is he willing to go to the mat with the tariffs.CARTER: I mean, I think the president -- right. He promised to get tough on China. He didn't -- and that's what he has done here, so everybody -- I think, in some ways, it benefits the president the more people are taken off guard by the way he is doing things, because that was his -- that's what he said he was going to do and nobody else would ever do it.So, I think he looks like a fighter for the American people, whether the deal gets done by 2020, I'm not sure that's going to have an impact. One of the things I'm looking at, though, is now China's making deals with Russia, you know, they have approved deals of -- with wheat and soy imports, and is that going to make a deal less likely?COOPER: That's a great question. I think we've seen the Chinese pushing out, trying to find other markets. I don't know that they are going to be incredibly successful in trying to supplant the U.S. market. But, I think at the end of the day, one has to wonder whether the Chinese can really bear all of this pressure and for how long.But, now that we're talking about this last $300 billion of goods, these really start to get into a lot of the consumer products that Americans are also going to feel more directly. And so, I think the Chinese are probably hoping that maybe the Trump administration will pull back before it actually puts those tariffs on in September.MCDOWELL: And just really quickly, Zack, we discussed it last week, but the idea that the 10 percent in additional tariffs was somehow pushed by an individual in the White House to force the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates again, that just seems like lunacy, because, again, this is not something that the Fed can fix.It might be a great deal more damaging to U.S. consumers in the U.S. economy, something that another quarter point cut by Federal Reserve won't offset not by any stretch.COOPER: That wouldn't make a lot of sense to me either. I think the other question is, you know, are we going to get a big deal? Probably not out of China anymore, right? We're looking at a small deal, one that's largely focused on agricultural purchases, energy purchases by China.We're not actually going to talk about any of the underlying concerns that have been the biggest issues for most of those White House advisers, which are intellectual property issues, market access, those things are off the table.So, what's this additional pressure really going to do? I think that's the tough question for those in the White House that have been supporting it.MCDOWELL: Zack, good to see you. Thank you so much for being here, Zack Cooper on China. And moving on to El Paso, and the country, reeling, after a deadly mass shooting at a Wal-Mart over the weekend, Jonathan Serrie is on the scene with the very latest on that investigation. Jonathan?JONATHAN SERRIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: The gunman is being held without bond, charged with capital murder, that in Connection with the deaths of 20 people, who lost their lives in the Wal-Mart, you see behind me.Meanwhile, federal investigators are looking into whether the defendant offered an anti-immigrant online post as they considered domestic terrorism hate crime charges. And the FBI is interviewing acquaintances of the defendant, in the Dallas area.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JEANETTE HARPER, SPECIAL AGENT, FBI: So, through those interviews, we're putting the investigation together to be able to determine if he was part of group or working with other individuals that were planning any future attacks. At this point, we don't have any credible intelligence saying that there's anything going on in the future.(END VIDEO CLIP)SERRIE: A video posted on Facebook shows the inside of the Wal-mart, when Saturday's gunfire broke out. You can see someone hiding under a shelf as you actually hear the shots being fired. Over the weekend, El Paso county sheriff Richard Wiles wrote on his personal Facebook page about the shooting. He writes this, Anglo man came here to kill Hispanics.I'm outraged and you should be too. This entire nation should be outraged. In this day and age, with all the serious issues we face, we are still confronted with people who will kill another for the sole reason of the color of their skin.Last night, Democratic presidential candidate, Beto O'Rourke, who used to represent El Paso in Congress, joined hundreds of residents for a silent march and vigil in honor of the victims.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BETO O'ROURKE (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: And we know the solutions, universal background checks where we close every single loophole. And end to the sale of assault weapons in United States of America.(END VIDEO CLIP)SERRIE: And responding to the shootings here in Texas and also Ohio, President Trump tweeted this morning, Republicans and Democrats must come together and get strong background checks, perhaps, marrying this legislation with desperately needed immigration reform, back to you.MCDOWELL: Jonathan, thank you so much for that, Jonathan Serrie in El Paso. And it was two shootings in less than 24 hours, over the weekend. Nine additional people shot and killed, dozens more wounded in Dayton, Ohio.It happened around 1:00 a.m. Sunday morning in a popular area in downtown Dayton. This new video shows people running from the shots as officers rush toward the chaos. Police say officers took down the gun man within 30 seconds, of him, firing the first shot. But still, 29, at least, 29 dead, 53 injured, in those two shootings, over the weekend. We'll be right back.MCDOWELL: We are an hour and 14 minutes away from the opening bell. Stocks set to open sharply lower on escalating trade tension with China.The NASDAQ on pace for its longest losing streak since November of 2016. The NASDAQ and the S&P both suffering their worst week last week of the year so far.And President Trump just tweeting on China, China dropped the price of their currency to an almost historic low, it's called currency manipulation, are you listening Federal Reserve? This is a major violation which will greatly weaken China over time.I want to get Mitch Roschelle's quick reaction to this because again, this does seem to be a renewed -- a focus on the Federal Reserve what it did last week, it want -- the president wants to get a lower dollar is one of the things.And somebody wrote me this morning Andy Brenner who's on the network, frequently, the U.S. could intervene by using the exchange stabilization fund if they want lower dollar, the fund has only about $95 billion to use in it. Dwarfed by the trillions that trade and foreign exchange daily. We could reach out to allies to do a coordinated effort but everybody has their own kind of country interests.Or I think you to have raise the question, is President Trump, if he's really this upset, is he going to target China and then try and fire Jay Powell later? Because again, they investigated whether they could get rid of him or not.ROSCHELLE: If you weaken the dollar, you import inflation, and then, that becomes something that the Federal Reserve then has to respond to. So I just think currency shouldn't be manipulated at all.MCDOWELL: So respond by raising interest rates if you're import --ROSCHELLE: By raising interest rates, correct.MCDOWELL: Right, so which is not what --ROSCHELLE: Which is not what he wants, correct. I just think let free markets behave like free markets, and fight one fight like the trade fight, do it, leave the Fed out of it.MCDOWELL: Steve Forbes says, do not whisper -- you know, again you want a strong dollar policy.ROSCHELLE: And we don't wish for a weak dollar.MCDOWELL: Yes, exactly. Hong Kong's leader meantime, speaking out as more protests hit the city. The latest affecting travel in and out of the city. Cheryl Casone has the details. Hi, Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, Dagen. So the pro- democracy movement is holding a general strike today and that's caused more than 200 flight cancellations so far and major traffic disruptions there. And her first (INAUDIBLE) comments from two weeks Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam said the city is becoming more dangerous and unstable.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CARRIE LAM, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF HONG KONG: Such extensive disruptions in the name of certain demands or uncooperative movement have seriously undermined Hong Kong's law and order.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Lam though maintains that she has no plans to resign.Well, Fiat Chrysler's got a lot riding on plans to expand its Jeep brand. The company going to reportedly add larger electrified SUVs to its lineup, (INAUDIBLE) in China and unveil plug-in hybrids of its models in the United States and Europe, all this according to the Journal. Fiat Chrysler which reported a record quarterly up rating profit for North America last week has a third of its sales from the Jeep brands. Stock unchanged in the premarket despite the selloff for saying.And there is this, Ed Sheeran's got a lot more to sing about. The pop star is now on the highest grossing tour of all time, that's according to Pollstar. The Divide Tour has grossed $736.7 million that beat out the previous record holder U2 who took in $734.4 million -- $735.4 million in 2011. Ed Sheeran started his tour on March 16th, 2017. He's finishing up on August 26. That's guys, 893 days but U2 knocked them -- knocked off the top spot, Dagen, pretty impressive.MCDOWELL: All right, I have -- thank you for that. I'm not the biggest Ed Sheeran fan but I --CASONE: I'm not either. So I was kind of surprised by this to be frank with you.MCDOWELL: I'm usually wrong about everything but I am right about following. If you are in the south or somewhere in Texas, go see Lyle Lovett and his large band.CARTER: Amen.MCDOWELL: They're on tour, their -- Wednesday night, they're in Raleigh, North Carolina people. They're in Brevard on Thursday night. You should go see them. You will never see a better musical show, period. That's my own advice.CARTER: I love Lyle Lovett.MCDOWELL: Yes, I do too. And the whole band, Russ Kunkel on drums, come on people.Coming up, mean -- Tehran tension as Iran seizing a tanker carrying smuggled fuel. But the geopolitical concerns being outwade by trade.Futures are pointing to a major selloff at the open as China retaliates against new U.S. tariffs, devaluing that currency to offset that 10 percent tariff that's on deck. We take a look at stocks most impacted with just an hour and 10 minutes before the opening bell. Stay with us.MCDOWELL: Welcome back. Tensions in the Gulf, Iran saying its revolutionary guard seized another oil tanker in the Persian Gulf, taking smuggled fuel. This coming as tensions of when the U.S. and Iran are boiling over.Joining us now Lipow Oil Associates' president, Andy Lipow. Andy, what about the direction of oil on these rising tensions?ANDY LIPOW, PRESIDENT, LIPOW OIL ASSOCIATES: Well, believe it or not, oil is ignoring these rising tensions even though this is the third tanker that Iran has seized the Stena Impero is still sitting there in Iranian waters. But the oil market is really being weighed down by all these tariffs and trade wars that we see are happening around the world.HOUGH: Gas prices look pretty favorable here. You know, it's good news for the consumer, what I wonder is, is that because people expect a further softening in the world economy to come. Is it good news or bad news that we see gas prices pretty reasonable here?LIPOW: Well, the gasoline prices are reflective of really the oil market which is being weighed down number one by increasing supplies from the U.S., and number two from revised downward growth forecasts due to the economies around the world. It's good news for the consumer here but it's really indicative more of, you know, slowing economic growth, especially overseas.ROSCHELLE: Andy, good morning, Mitch Roschelle. One of the things that I'm curious about, is we talk about geopolitical risks around the world, and economies slowing down. How about the OPEC countries themselves and how are those economies faring with this lower oil prices and do they need to do something to get all prices up to help their own economies?LIPOW: Well, they do need higher prices, there's no doubt. I mean, people look at Saudi Arabia and say they need over $70.00 a barrel in order to balance their budget. But what we've seen is OPEC and non-OPEC producers have already been cutting production, and they really have not been able to get the oil price up.Imagine what the price of oil would be if Iranian exports return to the market or sanctions on Venezuela would be lifted, we would probably be seeing numbers below $50.00 a barrel here.So I think that the OPEC and non-OPEC producers really have to just grit their teeth and wait for demand around the world to soak up the oversupply.MCDOWELL: Turning to oil earnings, Andy, Exxon and Chevron, reporting solid earnings last week. Analyst said associated earnings base with low oil prices, can you explain that?LIPOW: Well, sure. I mean, what they're doing is making up their profits in volume so we see company like Exxon who's been significantly increasing their production out of the Permian Basin as well as Chevron. So their earnings are going up in spite of these lower oil prices and the integrated majors of course having advantage over the independents because they've got refining, they've got marketing.But if you look at the oil patch itself, with some of these independent producers, they are really feeling the strain of these lower prices and higher operating costs.MCDOWELL: Andy, I have one quick question. So if you watch the Democratic debates, all of the candidates have some form of a climate change policy, a Green Deal or New Deal, whatever you want to call it. But you have even the likes of vice president Joe Biden talking about doing away with fossil fuels. At what point do we start seeing a reaction in maybe some of the oil stocks, the price of crude oil and even -- what would that -- again, if that's really the goal, you're going to have people in this country paying, $8-10.00 for a gallon of gasoline.LIPOW: Well, the consumer really demands affordable energy and that includes gasoline, diesel and electricity. So if they see the alternative going up in price that really causes a damper on the enthusiasm for alternative fuels. What the consumers has been fortunate to see is a world that's really oversupplied with fossil fuel, they're not really high.But if you would look at California there, they do have a trade-off. Gasoline prices average about a dollar a gallon higher than the rest of the country. And of course their trade-off is, you know, we want clean air, and we're willing to pay more for those fossil fuels in exchange for a more renewable energy whether it means solar, wind or electric vehicles.MCDOWELL: But we use gas because it's plentiful and cheap and it lifts people out of poverty and gets them to their job with these good luck giving them $8-10.00 a gallon gasoline.Andy, thank you so much. Good to see you.LIPOW: Thank you very much, Dagen.MCDOWELL: Thanks Andy.Coming up, trade fears tearing into the markets. We eye the sell-off at the open as China ramps up its attacks against new U.S. tariffs. What's at stake for trade truce? And the stocks most impacted with just an hour to go before the opening bell.MCDOWELL: Welcome back. I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Monday, August 5th, your top stories at 8:30 a.m. Eastern. Global markets sell-off on China trade turmoil. In China, it's currency, the Yuan, dropping to its lowest level in more than a decade. President Trump calling it currency manipulation and a major violation that will greatly weaken China over time.But what's weak this morning? Certainly, the U.S. futures, extending losses from last week, the worst week -- that W-E-E-K -- for the S&P and NASDAQ this year. The NASDAQ on pace for its longest losing streak since about November 2016.Tech stocks taking a hard hit. Shares of micron technology, applied materials and microchip technology seeing steep losses in premarket trading. Trade also hitting stocks around the globe.In Europe, we have red across the board a loss north of two percent on FTSE 100 in England, and it was even worse in some of Asian markets where Hang Seng, and Kospi in South Korea lost more than 2-1/2 percent.Our top story this half an hour: U.S.-China trade tensions hitting market. President Trump, is speaking out. Blake Burman live at the White House, with more, Blake.BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Dagen, good morning. A spokesperson for People's Bank of China is blaming latest tariff threat from President Trump as the reason why China has suddenly decided to devalue its currency. The Yuan, breaking below the seven per dollar level for the first time in more than a decade dating all the way back to May 2008. Here's what that spokesperson said, in part, earlier today: "Affected by unilateralism and trade protectionism measures, and the imposition of tariff increases on China, the RMB has depreciated against the U.S. dollar today, breaking through seven yuan, but the Renminbi continues to be stable and strong against a basket of currencies."Now, this was the reaction within the last 15-20 minutes or so from President Trump. He took to Twitter, said the following: "China dropped the prize of currency to an almost historic low, it's called currency manipulation. Are you listening, Federal Reserve," the president asked? He says, "This is a major violation which will greatly weaken China, over time."Meantime, Dagen, later this morning here at the White House, President Trump will also address the two mass shootings from over the weekend in which 29 died in El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio. Already this morning, the president is trying to tie the epidemic of mass shootings to immigration reform. Tweeting at one point, "Republicans and Democrats must come together get strong background checks, perhaps marrying this legislation with desperately needed immigration reform." The president, Dagen, is in part, pointing the finger at the media. Dagen?MCDOWELL: Thank you so much. Good to see you, Blake. Thank you for that live report from the White House.Joining me now is former White House Deputy Brad Brakeman to cover it all. Brad, how do you -- what do you make of the -- let's start with the trade fight because clearly there's a great deal of fallout in not just the U.S. market but the global stock market. China devaluing its currency, China offset the upcoming 10 percent additional tariffs on $300 billion in imports into U.S. What happens here? Because again, the Wall Street Journal reporting that the president defied virtually everyone in the White House other than Peter Navarro and just said tariffs -- when Mnuchin and Lighthizer came back from China last week.BRAD BLAKEMAN, FORMER SENIOR WHITE HOUSE STAFF: Well, the president is right. We have -- we cannot allow China to continue not only in its trade war with the United States. Remember they started this, by taxing our goods, by stealing our technology, and intellectual property. The president is right to stand up to China and he's also right that their current move is currency manipulation. It's not new to China; they've been doing this for decades.They're now just doing it brazenly and now, it's up to the world to come, to our defense, because it's also affecting their economies as well. I'm looking to Britain, France, Germany Italy, and others to start not only vocalizing their concern about China but doing something about it. We cannot let China do this. It's going to cost China long-term problems and our goal now is to keep the dollar strong.MCDOWELL: Lee, I want to bring you in here because again, no one should be surprised by the president's tough stance with China. The one thing -- one of the unique hallmarks of this presidency is he literally goes through campaign promises and checks them off, even it was moving the embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, but it's one by one by one and he's not going to giving this up fight.CARTER: No. I mean, he had five signature policies when he was running for president. And number one was getting tough on China, he had the wall, he had -- and he has gone through each one of them. And this is one that he will not back down from no matter what experts, advisers tell him. He goes harder that I think anybody ever expects him to. So, we shouldn't be surprised as we continuously are that he is not following advice, that he is being tough.And you know, I think what's going to be interesting to see is if it is going to work. Because what we've seen in the past is we all get so afraid and then something changes, and there's a shift. So, how long is it going to be before China responds may be the way they want them too? Is to it going to have rollback before the September release of these tariffs? I'm not so sure that it's not, but it's scary for us to see but he's doing exactly what he said he was going to do.MCDOWELL: But Brad, he's got to get -- he's got run for reelection next year, and you have an economy in some ways that's softening. And I'm not talking about the stock market but I'm talking about business investment in the second quarter, I'm talking about factory activity, job growth is looking a little soft. So, what say you? He's got to wrap this up.BLAKEMAN: Well, the best time to take on is from a position of strength. And thank god, we have a good economy in order to do that. But President Trump is looking long term; you know, China thinks 10, 50, 100 years down the road. We're consumed by a news cycle of 24 hours. So, the president is right! He's doing the right thing. He said he was going to do it, and I have every confidence that the United States economy will continue to be strong.I think China has made a huge miscalculation. Also, Xi is president for life. Xi is going to wait out Donald Trump as long as he can, hoping that he doesn't get re-elected. But as Donald Trump warned President Xi, you know, if he is re-elected, it's going to be a long next four years, so you better deal with him now. We're not going to deal from weakness, President Trump is dealing from strength.HOUGH: Hey, Brad, you said the president wants a strong dollar but when he is tweeting are you reasoning Federal Reserve, sound to me like he wants lower rates and he wants a weaker dollar. And when I pulled back the lens and I look around the world, I see all these negative rates in Europe. It looks to me like every rich country in the world has gotten well beyond its means on its fiscal spending; everyone is running debts that's taking on debt. And now, everyone is trying to weaponize their currencies in this race to the bottom, doesn't the president want to respond here by taking our dollar lower?BLAKEMAN: No, I think the Fed has already made their move last week. I don't see any -- action by them, in regard to what China just did. And I think the markets need to play out. And we shouldn't automatically have a knee-jerk reaction to what China has done. Let's see how this plays out, but on the other hand, I think the president has to continue to put the pressure on tariffs. And as long as we can move from a position of strengthen and a good economy, China has more to lose than we do.MCDOWELL: I want to move to something -- more serious. Obviously, Brad with the two shootings: one in El Paso one in Dayton, Ohio over weekend, at least 29 dead, 53 injured in those two mass murders, mass shootings. The president tweeted this morning that he's seeming to tie more intensive background checks with immigration reform. Seems off.BLAKEMAN: I think the president should stick to mental health because I think that that has become a huge issue, in America. Access, affordability, availability of mental health. And you know, single-lone gunman who take out dozens of people. Yet on the other hand in Chicago, we have multiple people taking out hundreds of people over a year in places like Chicago. I would say less on immigration with the regard to the violence and more on mental health in preventing criminals from getting instruments of death.MCDOWELL: Well, if you've been adjudicated by a court and found to be mentally incompetent or mentally ill, you're not supposed to be able to buy a gun in this country. That's one of the protections for the American people. But as we were talking about earlier, people slipped through cracks -- number one. And number two, that is a -- that is a very big -- large lift in terms of being found by a court to be mentally unfit to possess a weapon, number one. Number two, I want to ask you: Ivanka Trump tweeted over the weekend about congress should enact red flag laws and extreme risk protection orders in every state and increase resources as you know said, dedicated to mental health support.But with these red flags laws, they're essentially like domestic violence restraining orders but aimed at preventing people who are a threat to themselves or others from possessing a weapon. It would -- it gives police the ability to take a weapon away from someone. There are orders that are taken out by, say, family members or loved ones. Does Ivanka have her father's ear? Does Ivanka Trump have the president's area? Do you think that this is something he would pay attention to?BLAKEMAN: There's no doubt. The first daughter is also a senior adviser to president, has the president's ear. But common-sense solutions like red flags are important as we've seen in some of these shootings, people failed to connect the dots. The dots were there to be seen but nobody ever did anything, perhaps they didn't know they could do anything. And I think that mental health has to be a priority in this country. It's long since been stigmatized. Those days should be over. The brain is an organ just like heart; we give people with a heart attack so much compassion, but what about people who have mental issues? They should be given the same compassion and the help as we give those who have other ailments.MCDOWELL: Brad, thank you so much for that. Brad Blakeman joining us.BLAKEMAN: Thank you.MCDOWELL: Coming up, sharp sell-off. Markets under pressure this morning. China ramping up attacks against new U.S. tariffs. Stuart Varney breaks down what is at stake for truce, next.MCDOWELL: U.S. trade tensions escalating, prompting what could be a drawn- out dispute between two economic superpowers. Joining me now, the host of "VARNEY & CO." Stuart Varney. Mr. Varney, what say you, sir?STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Dagen, I would have to agree with that. This is an escalation. It's now a currency war and it's very hard to see a quick resolution to this. Both sides if -- put it like this, if either side backed down and blinked in this confrontation, both sides would lose credibility and that's the last thing you want to do in a tense negotiating situation.So, what you've got a currency war with all kinds of negative fallout. For a start, you've got this flight-to-safety. Now that's now necessarily a huge negative, but it's a real mark of what's going on in the world. The flight-to-safety to U.S. Treasury Bonds, as you've been reporting, Dagen, that's pushed the yield all the way down to about 1.78 percent. Flight-to- the-safety of gold, it's a six-year high. Even bitcoin has been drawn into this. Bitcoin's now a, what, four -- is 11,700 bucks a coin, I think, up about $700 just a day.So, you've got flight-to-safety because this trade fight shows no sign of being -- of backing down at any point in the future. And right now, we're in the middle of a currency war. That's the way I see it.MCDOWELL: Can I pose the question to you?VARNEY: Please.MCDOWELL: The president definitely seems fixated on the Federal Reserve, and wanting lower interest rates. He wants a weaker dollar as we get into this currency fight. Is that -- what do you make of that? Where does that go from here?VARNEY: Well, I wonder, is it possible for the Federal Reserve to intervene in the Chinese currency market, not the market in China --MCDOWELL: Uh-hmm.VARNEY: -- but the market for China's currency, the Yuan.MCDOWELL: Uh-hmm.VARNEY: Now I don't know whether the Federal Reserve could or would do that, but isn't that something of an option that the Jay Powell might want to even look at? This is a currency war. Does the Federal Reserve have a role in it? I don't know. But I'm sure it's going to be under consideration, Dagen.MCDOWELL: Stuart Varney, I just made you talk about Federal Reserve and currencies.VARNEY: Not easy.MCDOWELL: I know, but I love it when you do it because, again, you make it so easy for all of us to understand, so.VARNEY: Oh, let's not get carried away.MCDOWELL: You know I adore you.VARNEY: I'm not going to talk about the inverted yield curve either. OK?MCDOWELL: Preceded every recession since World War II. Just saying that.VARNEY: Right. And the spread is wider now than it's been since 2007, I think.MCDOWELL: Well, can --VARNEY: That's not a good sign.MCDOWELL: Can I tell a little secret? Stuart got to work in before I did this morning because that's how much he loves this job.VARNEY: Oh, stop it.MCDOWELL: And that's how much he loves his viewers. And --VARNEY: That's true.MCDOWELL: -- you will see Stuart in less than 10 minutes, 9:00 a.m. every weekday, 9:00 a.m. to noon Eastern. Thank you, Mr. Varney. "VARNEY & CO."Coming up, trade fears tearing into market. We go live to the New York Stock Exchange for a look at the stocks most affected with just 40 minutes before the opening bell.MCDOWELL: Market set to open sharply lower on escalating trade tensions with China. Jackie DeAngelis on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange with more. Hey, Jackie.JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Good morning to you, Dagen. Well, futures sharply lower this morning, almost 400 points. This is that further reaction to China and trade tensions that you guys have been talking about all morning. That new round of tariffs at heightened uncertainty last week, China now striking back with the currency is adding to that.Trade stocks are going to be in focus today. Dow stocks, the industrials, Caterpillar 3M, Boeing sensitive to China. We watch those closely. Tech stocks also lower in premarket as well. The NASDAQ set to fall for sixth straight day. That would be the longest losing streak in almost three years so watch the semis. AMD, NVIDIA, Intel, Micron, Applied Materials, and, of course, Apple.Meantime, gold the highest since May of 2013, safety trade in play here. Bitcoin, a huge jump, safety trade as well, and a currency play there. Finally, Cars.com down almost 30 percent after its board ended a strategic review. No bids there, this coming after a push from activist investor, Starboard. Dagen.MCDOWELL: Jackie, thank you for that. Jackie DeAngelis at the New York Stock Exchange. Still ahead, final thoughts from this all-star panel. Stay with us.MCDOWELL: We're a little more than half an hour away from the opening bell. It's going to be a rough one. Final thoughts. Jack, you first.HOUGH: Well, only a week ago, I was saying, you know, 2 percent on bonds. You might not love it, but it might be the best you'll see for some time. You might not get that today. I don't know what you're going to find out there. I'm sure rates, but, you know, if you're looking to raise a little cash and you can find some out there, 1-1/2, 1-3/4. Look at all the negative yields in Europe. That's where we're headed. We're going lower and lower.MCDOWELL: Yikes.HOUGH: Lock it in while you can.MCDOWELL: Mitch.ROSCHELLE: Yikes. He's right. I want to remind everybody, this market selloff started with the fed and then continued with the China trade, and just to bring those two together, what we don't want is inflation and that would cause the fed to raise rates. So doing something to manipulate our currency, probably not a good idea.MCDOWELL: Right. And we need some powder at this point.ROSCHELLE: We need powder.MCDOWELL: Yes. Lee.CARTER: So 9 of 10 Americans are for stronger background checks. About 7 in 10 Americans want stronger gun control laws. But only 14 percent of Americans are confident that the government's going to do anything about it. Congress, it's time. Let's surprise us and do something that the people want.MCDOWELL: You think it can get done though?CARTER: I don't know. I mean it does -- I don't see any indication that any of the politicians are willing to work across the aisles right now, especially in an election year.MCDOWELL: Well, because --CARTER: So I'm concerned.MCDOWELL: Well, on both sides of the aisle, demonization comes first.CARTER: Absolutely.MCDOWELL: And that's a problem because, again, you alienate those people you need to come together with you. Thank you so much, Lee, and Jack, and Mitch. Right now, Mr. Varney, take it away.VARNEY: Thank you, Dagen.Load-Date: August 5, 2019End of Document

Global Graphene Industry Report, 2019-2025 with Focus on the Chinese Market - China as a Key Graphene Market Saw a Market Size of Roughly RMB280 Million in 2018PR NewswireAugust 7, 2019 Wednesday 12:15 PM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1224 wordsDateline: DUBLIN, Aug. 7, 2019 BodyPR NewswireThe"Global and China Graphene Industry Report, 2019-2025"report has been added toResearchAndMarkets.com'soffering.Graphene is featured with excellent performance and enjoys a rosy prospect China as a key graphene market saw a market size of roughly RMB280 million (or $42 million, 1 US dollar = 6.6174 yuan) in 2018, an upsurge of over 70% from the previous year. Bolstered by policies, Chinese graphene market will expectedly sustain growth rates of at least 50% from 2019 to 2025.Chinese graphene market is characterized by the following:Graphene industry is still in its infancy and graphene is being researched vigorously in all countries, leading to a boom in patent filings. The Chinese government has issued a set of policies supporting the industry, for example, graphene was taken as a priority in the Development Plan for New Materials during the 13th Five-year Plan Period (2016-2020), through which China has led the world in a number of graphene patents and researches. In 2018, graphene patent fillings in the country outnumbered 30,000. Graphene powder finds most application in China nowadays (Graphene powder is used in battery conductive additives, lithium battery materials and special coatings; graphene film gets utilized for thermally conductive films, flexible displays and sensors.). Taking features like high thermal conductivity and small size into account, graphene film will be increasingly applied in domains such as smartphones, computers and wearable devices, so its market share will rise further. Use of graphene in a lithium battery is mature enough currently. Over 50% of graphene in China is demanded by lithium batteries. As research goes on and technology advances, the downstream application of graphene will be expanding. Besides its widespread use in anti-corrosion coatings, resins, rubber and battery materials, graphene also plays an ever more important role in emerging industries, for instance, new-generation display devices, big health and advanced manufacturing, with the advent of new products like graphene-based organic photovoltaic (OPV) films. There are over 300 producers of graphene power and films in China, but most of them are incompetent for large-scale industrial production though their products are mature enough to be put into mass production. Key players include Beijing Moxi Holding Group Co., Ltd., Der Future Science & Technology Holding Group, 2D Carbon (Changzhou) Tech Inc. and The Sixth Element (Changzhou) Materials Technology Co., Ltd., among which Beijing Moxi Holding Group Co., Ltd. boasts the biggest market share, commanding over 20% of the market in 2018.Global and China Graphene Industry Report, 2019-2025 focuses on the following:Graphene (definition, performance, preparation methods, development course, industrial chain) Global graphene industry (development status quo, market size, prices, prospects of industrialization, patents, etc.) China's graphene industry (policy climate, current development, patents, enterprises' forays, etc.) Upstream (graphite, methane, etc.) and downstream (lithium battery, supercapacitor, transparent electrode, integrated circuit, etc.) markets of graphene, applications of graphene, etc. 19 foreign and 16 Chinese graphene manufacturers (operation, graphene business, etc.)Key Topics Covered:1 Overview of Graphene Industry1.1 Definition1.2 Performance1.3 Preparation Method1.4 Development History1.5 Development Bottleneck1.6 Industry Chain2 Development of Global Graphene Industry2.1 Status Quo2.2 Market Size2.3 Market Price2.4 Industrialization Prospects2.5 Overview of Patents2.5.1 Total Filings2.5.2 Structure2.5.3 Patent Filings in Major Countries2.5.4 Patent Filings in Major Companies2.6 Competitiveness Analysis3 Development of Chinese Graphene Industry3.1 Policy Environment3.2 Current Situation3.2.1 Graphene Powder3.2.2 Graphene Film3.3 Industrialization Development3.3.1 Industry-University-Research Collaboration3.3.2 Industrial Park3.3.3 Patents3.4 Enterprises' Layout4 Upstream Sectors4.1 Graphite4.2 Others4.2.1 Methane4.2.2 Ethanol5 Downstream Applications5.1 Lithium Battery5.1.1 Graphene Application5.1.2 Market Situation5.2 Supercapacitor5.2.1 Graphene Application5.2.2 Market Situation5.3 Transparent Electrode5.3.1 Graphene Application5.3.2 Market Situation5.4 Integrated Circuit5.5 Others5.5.1 Polyester-based Composites5.5.2 Electrically Conductive Printing Ink5.5.3 Heat Dissipating Material6 Major Global Graphene Manufacturers6.1 Northern Graphite6.1.1 Profile6.1.2 Operation6.1.3 Graphene Business6.2 CVD6.2.1 Profile6.2.2 Operation6.2.3 Graphene Business6.3 Focus Graphite6.3.1 Profile6.3.2 Operation6.3.3 Graphene Business6.4 Lomiko Metals6.4.1 Profile6.4.2 Operation6.4.3 Graphene Business6.5 Applied Graphene Materials6.5.1 Profile6.5.2 Operation6.5.3 Graphene Business6.6 Graphene NanoChem Plc6.6.1 Profile6.6.2 Operation6.6.3 Graphene Business6.7 Haydale Graphene Industries6.7.1 Profile6.7.2 Operation6.7.3 Revenue Structure6.7.4 Graphene Business6.8 Other Enterprises6.8.1 Graphene Laboratories6.8.2 Graphenea6.8.3 Graphene Square6.8.4 Grafoid6.8.5 XG Sciences Inc6.8.6 BGT Materials Limited6.8.7 Angstron Materials6.8.8 Graphenano6.8.9 Vorbeck Materials6.8.10 CambridgeNanosystems6.8.11 GRAPHENEFRONTIERS6.8.12 GraphenePlatform Corp7.

The last major opponent of China's Muslim oppression has retreated into silence. Here's why that's a big deal.Business Insider USJuly 6, 2019 Saturday 04:46 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1590 wordsByline: ama@businessinsider.com,  (Alexandra Ma)Highlight: Turkey is home to hundreds of thousands of Uighurs. Many of them already live in limbo, unable to return to China and effectively stateless.BodyRoman Pilipey/Pool via Reuters• Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan recently said that Uighurs - the Muslim ethnic minority under oppression by the Chinese government - actually lead happy lives in China, Chinese state-media reported.• This apparent capitulation is particularly significant because Turkey, until now, had been the only Muslim country to stand up against China for the Uighurs.• Turkey is also home to hundreds of thousands of Uighurs. Many of them already live in limbo without work permits or legal residency, and unable to return to China.• The reason behind Erdogan's about-face is not clear. He has, however, been trying to strike greater economic partnerships with Beijing.• Turkey - whose currency collapsed, and whose economy went into recession last year - has grown increasingly reliant on Chinese economic aid in recent years.• Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.In recent months, a wave of Islamic countries stood up to China over its oppression of the Muslim Uighur ethnic minority before backing down again, largely due to fear of Beijing's economic vengeance.Turkey - which bills itself as a leader of the Islamic world - is the latest country to retreat into silence.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has spoken out against China's oppression of the Uighurs on numerous past occasions, but this week he gave his implicit support to China's policies in Xinjiang during a state visit to the country.Mark Schiefelbein/Pool via Reuters"It is a fact that the people of all ethnicities in Xinjiang are leading a happy life amid China's development and prosperity," Erdogan said on Tuesday, the state-run China Daily newspaper reported, paraphrasing the Turkish president.He added that some people were seeking to "abuse" the Xinjiang crisis to jeopardize Turkey and China's economic relationship, saying according to Agence France-Presse."This abuse is having a negative impact on Turkish-Chinese relations. It is necessary that we do not give opportunity to such abuse."China has installed a modern surveillance state in Xinjiang. Uighurs in the region are forced to download malware that sweeps their phones for content unsavory to the Chinese regime, and authorities have detained up to 1.5 million of them in prison-like camps where people are reportedly tortured.Read more: Chilling undercover footage taken inside China's most oppressive region shows it's virtually impossible to escape the paranoid police stateKevin Frayer/Getty ImagesThough major Muslim countries like Pakistan,            Indonesia, and            Saudi Arabia have also been silent about China's Uighur crisis, Turkey's apparent capitulation is perhaps most threatening to Uighurs.Until now, Turkey had been the only Islamic country that dared speak up for the Uighurs.It has also offered a safe haven to the community. Many members of the Uighur diaspora have moved there in recent decades, enticed by the similarities between the Turkish and Uighur languages and cultures.Turkey is currently home to some 35,000 Uighurs, Reuters reported this March, citing the Istanbul-based East Turkestan National Center.That number includes many former detainees in China's prison-like camps, where guards reportedly force Uighur inmates to sing patriotic hymns in order to get food, and subject them to physical and mental torture.Many Uighurs in Turkey still have relatives living in Xinjiang, and regularly stage large-scale protests calling for the release of their loved ones.Read more: This man's family vanished in China's most oppressed region. The next time he saw his son was 2 years later, in a Chinese propaganda video.Lefteris Pitarakis/APErdogan himself has previously been a prominent voice for the Uighurs. Here's his record:• In 2009, then-Prime Minister Erdogan described ethnic violence in Xinjiang as "a kind of genocide."• In 2015, President Erdogan's government openly offered to offer shelter to Uighur refugees.• In February 2019, Turkey's foreign ministry condemned China's "reintroduction of internment camps in the 21st century." It went on to describe China's "policy of systematic assimilation against the Uighur Turks" as "a great shame for humanity."February's statement came in response to widespread protests in Turkey over the reported death of Abdurehim Heyit, a Chinese Uighur poet and musician well known among Turks.China has responded to all these statements by repeatedly threatening to jeopardize the            two countries' economic relations.Beijing also temporarily closed a consulate in Izmir, western Turkey, with Chinese ambassador to Turkey Deng Li telling Reuters: "Criticizing your friend publicly ... will be reflected in commercial and economic relations."Read more: The mystery of a Muslim poet who may or may not be dead in a Chinese detention camp is at the center of a diplomatic crisis between China and TurkeyMark Schiefelbein/Pool via ReutersWhy has Erdogan changed his tune?Turkey - which underwent a currency collapse and            a recession last year - has grown increasingly reliant on Chinese economic aid in recent years.Ankara has been trying to join President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative, which aims to link China to dozens of countries through infrastructure. The project has seen Chinese investment flow into developing countries, and critics have described the initiative as "           debt-trap diplomacy."Erdogan heaped praise on the Belt and Road during his China visit, with both Turkish and            Chinese media reporting his eagerness to work alongside China on new projects in the region.Turkey may also want to become closer to China militarily, having bristled with the US over its arms programs and foreign policy.Read more: Turkey unveils new stealth-fighter concept as the US prepares to kick its ally out of the F-35 programEvan Vucci/APThe Organization of Islamic Cooperation - a 57-country consortium that calls itself "the collective voice of the Muslim world" - followed a similar pattern of speaking up, then rowing back their comments about Xinjiang.Experts told Business Insider earlier this year that this behavior could be the result of Chinese threats against the countries if they do speak up.Adrian Zenz, an independent researcher into the Xinjiang surveillance state, tweeted after Erdogan's visit to Beijing: "I guess the Muslim world's actual care for their spiritual brothers is essentially zero."Read more: A wave of Islamic countries started to stand up to China over its persecution of its Muslim minority. But then they all got spooked.Murad Sezer/ReutersUighurs in Turkey left in limboMany Uighurs in Turkey either had their Chinese passports revoked on their way out, or are unable to renew them at Beijing's embassy in Turkey, Deutsche Welle and            Reuters reported earlier this year.Without those Chinese passports, they cannot file for work permits or legal residency in Turkey. This effectively renders them stateless, which precludes them from finding work, both outlets reported.For this reason many Uighurs in the country are unemployed. Those who find jobs are forced to take informal, cash-based work, Deutsche Welle noted.Murad Sezer/ReutersErdogan's conspicuous silence in Beijing is making Uighurs even more uncertain about their future.Alip Erkin, an activist who runs the Uyghur Bulletin network, told Business Insider: "Wary of growing Chinese economic influence in Turkey and its increasingly cozy relations with China, Uighurs fear for even more restrictions on political activities and media coverage of what is going on in East Turkestan."Many Uighurs refer to Xinjiang as East Turkestan.

He went on to say that the country will do all it can to ensure Uighurs "reach tomorrow as citizens of the Republic of Turkey."Erkin called this "a reassuring message to Uighurs living" in Turkey. He added that the contrast between Soylu's support and Erdogan's apparent kowtowing to Beijing is "a delicate balancing act on the part of Turkey."Business Insider has contacted Turkey's foreign ministry for comment on whether Turkey would change its policies toward Uighurs' path to Turkish citizenship.NOW WATCH: Stewart Butterfield, co-founder of Slack and Flickr, says 2 beliefs have brought him the greatest success in lifeSee Also:• Europe reportedly threatens to activate nuclear-deal clause that could reimpose sanctions and push Iran into China and Russia's arms• Iran's sudden rush for weapons-grade nuclear fuel is alienating its last few friends• Chilling undercover footage taken inside China's most oppressive region shows it's virtually impossible to escape the paranoid police stateSEE ALSO: Chinese officials are forcing tourists to install an invasive app that downloads their texts and scans their phones at the border of one of the most surveilled regions in the countryLoad-Date: July 6, 2019End of Document

Reif emphasizes the value of immigrants in light of U.S. government actions against Chinese researchers and scientistsThe Tech: Massachusetts Institute of TechnologyJuly 5, 2019 FridayUniversity WireCopyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 1040 wordsByline: Whitney ZhangBody• Facebook• Twitter• Reddit• Email• PrintPresident L. Rafael Reif sent a letter to the MIT community June 25, calling on the MIT community to not "create a toxic atmosphere in unfounded suspicion and fear" in managing research risks, in light of both anti-immigration rhetoric and U.S. policies and statements that have targeted Chinese and Chinese-American researchers and scientists. Reif wrote that although the U.S. government has raised serious concerns about incidents of Chinese government supported academic espionage and there have been some cases of researchers of Chinese background who have acted in bad faith, these incidents "are the exception and very far from the rule." "Yet, faculty members, post-docs, research staff and students tell me that, in their dealing with government agencies, they now feel unfairly scrutinized, stigmatized, and on edge - because of their Chinese ethnicity alone," Reif wrote. Reif pointed to issues such as protracted visa delays and "harsh rhetoric against most immigrants and a range of other groups, because of religion, race, ethnicity or national origin."Reif denounced these agencies' actions as "corrosive to [the Institute's] collaborative strength and open-hearted ideals." Reif concluded, "In a nation like ours, immigration is a kind of oxygen, each fresh wave reenergizing the body as a whole. As a society, when we offer immigrants the gift of opportunity, we receive in return vital fuel for our shared future."Associate Provost Richard Lester PhD '80 said in an interview with The Tech that the letter was not motivated by any singular event, but rather a buildup of concerns that "had been brewing for a while" and the expression of such concerns by faculty.  Like Reif, Lester noted that there have been difficulties with visa delays, which will continue to be a problem if circumstances do not change. Lester said he is not aware of any faculty members that have been directly affected by these issues. There has also been no decline in the number of students who come to MIT from China. Lester said that the U.S. government has been concerned about espionage and theft issues for about a year and a half, and that MIT has similarly been concerned for "some significant period." The rhetoric about immigration has also been accumulating for the past couple of years, Lester continued.Lester said that MIT has been taking actions, mostly privately, in discussions with officials in Washington. Discussions have included explaining "how we work, why we work, why it's so important for us that outstanding students and researchers and faculty members are able to come to our campus, and why the country benefits from uninterrupted flows of talented people to our universities," as well as listening to the concerns of the government. The MIT Washington Office has been active in these discussions.MIT additionally participates in university consortia, such as the Association of American Universities and the Association of Public Land-Grant Universities. These consortia have formed working groups with agencies to discuss these problems, Lester said.Although many officials in Washington have appreciated these discussions and listened politely, the conversations in Washington have become "unbalanced," Lester said. "It is sometimes hard for people who have not worked in research and who have not worked in science or technology to appreciate that collaboration between researchers generally involves flows of information in both directions."  Lester said that MIT will continue looking for new ways to collaborate with colleagues in China and working hard to ensure that the "best people can come to MIT," especially as he foresees collaborations with China to be "increasingly important," with co-publication increasing tenfold over the past decade. Lester emphasized that MIT takes security "very seriously" and that it does not support ethnicity-targeting measures. He stressed the need for both MIT and the U.S. to "balance the need for protection and maintaining national security against the importance to the country as well as our university of preserving openness and ensuring no discrimination on the basis of national origin or ethnicity."All MIT research is open; therefore, the Institute does not accept any research grants whose projects discriminate on citizenship or require permission before publication, Maria Zuber, vice president for research, said in an interview with The Tech.However, at Lincoln Lab, there is both classified and unclassified research. Classified research can impose requirements on researchers, such as requiring them to be a U.S. citizen, obtain a security clearance, or not openly share their work. Fellowships that are ethnicity-based or grants that only give funding to U.S. citizens are allowed. But, non-U.S. citizens are still allowed to participate in these projects, provided that they can obtain another funding source, Zuber said. Zuber emphasized that improving security relies on identifying processes and organizational structures that need to be enhanced, rather than targeting any particular ethnic group. MIT instituted a new review process for "elevated risk" international proposals this past April. For certain countries, including China, proposals may be subject to review by the Senior Risk Group. The process is meant to assess the risks of both undertaking and not undertaking a project, Zuber explained. The process evaluates the uniqueness of the relationship; treatment of intellectual property, data sharing and security, and personal privacy; whether the work could be used for repressive purposes or otherwise misused; the location of the work; if there will be travel; and who the collaborators on the project will be. Additionally, MIT requires researchers to report conflicts of interest and outside professional activities, including their current and pending sources of support. These reports are reviewed annually, Zuber said. Lester invited anyone in the MIT community that was worried about these circumstances to talk to administrators, especially if there are specific instances in which they have been affected. "My door is open. I know it's true about others in the administration," Lester said. Load-Date: July 5, 2019End of Document

Thanks so much for joining us.I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Friday, August 2nd.Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast on the button.U.S.-China trade turmoil, the story of the day this morning. President Trump is planning to impose an additional 10 percent tariff on that $300 billion of Chinese goods coming into the country that he has not tariffed yet. The move could impact the prices on a slew of items including smartphones, clothing, toys. Now China says it will retaliate.Markets are lower on this news, futures extending the decline of yesterday when it first broke. The Dow futures down 36, S&P futures down 7, Nasdaq futures down 41. Markets turned sharply lower yesterday as soon as the President tweeted the tariff plan. The Dow Industrials when all was said and down was down 280 points, 1 percent. The S&P was down 26. And the Nasdaq was down 64, three-quarters of 1 percent.Global reaction also lower this morning. European indices down across the board. FT 100 down 124 points, one and two thirds percent. CAC 40 in Paris down 141 points, 2.5 percent. And the DAX index in Germany down 285, that's two and a third percent.In Asia overnight, red across the board. Trade concerns undermining stocks. Hang Seng worst performer in Hong Kong, down two and a third percent.Meanwhile jobs in America, big story today. Investors are waiting on the July jobs report. We'll if it moves markets. Economists are expecting 164,000 jobs to have been added to the economy last month with the unemployment rate holding steady at 3.7 percent.We have special coverage this morning 8:00 a.m. Eastern -- "Jobs in America". Join us when all hands are on deck as we identify where the jobs are.We are also watching the price of oil this morning, trade and the global economic slowdown pushing crude oil to the largest decline in four years. Take a look at crude right here, as you see.Google's artificial intelligence program is good for Google but it's bad for America, so says investor Peter Thiel. Find out why it could be a military threat in his new op-ed this morning.All those stories coming up this Friday morning. And joining me to break it all down: Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell; Moody's Capital Markets chief economist John Lonski, and chief workforce analyst at EmployBridge Joanie Courtney.Great to see you this morning.JOANIE COURTNEY, CHIEF WORKFORCE ANALYST, EMPLOYBRIDGE: Great to be here. Big day. So much to talk about. Not only jobs but how tariffs and everything else is going to impact the job market as well.BARTIROMO: Yes. We had the President coming out with this big announcement yesterday, that it's planning September 1, tariffs on $300 billion. We'll see how China reacts -- John.JOHN LONSKI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S CAPITAL MARKETS: Yes, the market didn't do that well in China, you know. That's the initial reaction.But let's not forget. This problem with tariffs has been around for more than a year. And it was just last week, the U.S. equity market set a new record high. The U.S. economy is still doing well, much better than some had predicted when tariffs began to take effect.BARTIROMO: So you're not so worried?LONSKI: I'm not frightened. Another big surprise -- core inflation. Core PCE price index inflation -- 1.5 percent despite the imposition of tariffs on so many American consumer products.BARTIROMO: We'll see when all of this is said and done when prices start going up at the cash register, Dagen -- if this actually impacts economic growth.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Right. And if it does indeed continue to impact job growth in this country because again, the "Wall Street Journal" writes that the pullback in payroll growth this year so far, the bulk of it's been concentrated in goods producing industries, mining, construction, manufacturing.Even though that's a relatively small slice of the overall employment market, the pullback in those industries has accounted for 60 percent of the job slowdown in this year compared to last year. So it is having an out-size impact.COURTNEY: Well, you could see it yesterday in the stock market too. I mean the healthcare stocks did very well yesterday. So they're not going to be impacted with, you know, the trades and the tariffs.BARTIROMO: I guess retail gets impacted big-time.COURTNEY: Retail definitely.(CROSSTALKING)BARTIROMO: -- prices go up, consumers get squeezed, you want to look at the retail stocks.COURTNEY: Yes, definitely.BARTIROMO: All right. We'll keep watching the specific sectors that get impacted from this as we continue our coverage this morning.But our top story right now is that escalating trade fear. President Trump planning to hit China with a 10 percent tariff on the remaining $300 billion worth of Chinese imports.Dow futures are down 52 points right now, extending a big triple-digit selloff of yesterday. The move boosting taxes on nearly everything China sends to the United States from electronics to footwear to children's toys.One comment was that an average bike at Walmart is going to go up in price. The President targeting China's trade during his campaign rally last night in Ohio. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We've taken the toughest ever action to stand up to China's trade abuse. And I just announced another 10 percent tariff on $300 billion worth of Chinese products that come into our country. And that's on top of the 25 percent that we a take of $250 billion coming in from China.For the last 20 years, China's taken hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars out of our country and now we're stopping the theft of American jobs.If foreign countries don't want to pay a tariff, I have a simple solution. Make your product in America. Come on back to the United States.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, Beijing is vowing to retaliate if the U.S. goes through with this tariff plan of 10 percent.Joining me right now is Pennsylvania Congressman, member of the Judiciary and Armed Services Committees, Guy Reschenthaler. It's good to see you -- Congressman. Thanks very much for being here this morning.REP. GUY RESCHENTHALER (R), PENNSYLVANIA: Thanks for having me on -- Maria.BARTIROMO: You know, Secretary Pompeo has been with me a number of times, really outlining the threat of national security that China represents. We know that China keeps reneging on everything. They refuse to put it into law that IP theft is against the law, the forced transfer of technology. They won't stop bringing fentanyl into this country.There's a ton of things that China has reneged on the U.S., the things that the U.S. feels are most important in any deal. Do you think a deal is dead?RESCHENTHALER: I think that the Chinese are taking a very long view. They're thinking beyond President Trump. They think they can outlast him. And I'm not talking just 2020, 2024.You've got to remember that they think in terms of centuries. We think in terms of the next quarter. And that's a problem.But China is a threat. They're a threat economically and from a national security viewpoint as well. They're a problem.BARTIROMO: Yes. I want to ask you a couple of things because there's really important information that you can weigh in on, given the committees that you're on.The U.S. officially withdrew from the long-standing arms control treaty with Russia, accusing Russia of violating its terms, not holding up its half of the deal.Secretary Pompeo commented on this, this morning. Here's what the Secretary tweeted out. He said "On February 2nd, 2019 the U.S. gave Russia six months to return to compliance with the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty. Russia refused. So the treaty ends today. The U.S. will not remain party to a treaty when others violate it. Russia bears sole responsibility."Your reaction -- Congressman?RESCHENTHALER: I support Secretary Pompeo. I'm really tired of getting the United States into treaties and having the United States be the only one that abides by those treaties. These other countries have been taking advantage of America and the American people for way too long. And I'm happy that this administration is finally standing up for America.BARTIROMO: All right. Well, that's certainly what it sounds like here but is there going to be an impact to this? I mean how does this play out?RESCHENTHALER: Well, I think that -- let's look at it this way. Russia is not abiding by the treaty in the first place --BARTIROMO: Yes.RESCHENTHALER: -- so the only thing this can do is it can bring the Russians back to the negotiating table. We can only improve from here.BARTIROMO: Ok.RESCHENTHALER: But other countries will take notice of this and we'll get better treatment from other nations.BARTIROMO: Let me switch gears since you're on the Judiciary Committee. The Justice Department now we have understood that it will not prosecute former FBI director Jim Comey over leaking memos sources told Fox News. John Solomon from "The Hill" first reported this.It follows that report from the Inspector General Michael Horowitz recommending a criminal referral against Comey for disclosing classified information. Are these guys just going to get off and not get accountability after putting their finger on the scale, trying to stop Donald Trump, despite the will of the people?RESCHENTHALER: Well, I support AG Barr and his decision. But I can tell you that I am disappointed. I think that there were serious issues with leaks in the investigation. And if somebody broke the law, they should be held accountable for it.I'm really excited for the IG report that's going to be released, I'm being told, in a matter of weeks. And we have to look and see what the Obama administration did to weaponize the FBI against political opponents.BARTIROMO: Yes. For sure. And do you think that there are going to be other charges that perhaps he gets charged with? Comey, Andy McCabe, Peter Strzok, John Brennan -- are there going to be other charges do you think that maybe he gets charged for given the fact that he's getting away with the leaking we should add (ph)?RESCHENTHALER: I wouldn't be surprised if there's other charges. But I want to wait and see what the IG report has to say. But I'm really troubled by the beginnings of the investigation with Mueller. And I think what we need to focus on is how the upper echelons of the FBI spied on political opponents.BARTIROMO: Yes, for sure. Well, we know that for sure.Congressman -- it's good to see you. Thanks so much.RESCHENTHALER: Thanks -- Maria.BARTIROMO: Congressman Guy Reschenthaler joining us there.Coming up, slamming Google -- entrepreneur and Trump supporter Peter Thiel sounding off on the technology giant. He has an op-ed this morning. His comments, next.And then healthy or not, the meatless industry exploding but are there real benefits to the plant-based diet? We're investigating. We're taking a look.Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: A massive Pentagon contract is now on hold in a veiled swipe against Amazon. Billionaire technology investor Peter Thiel meanwhile is targeting Google over its ties to China.Grady Trimble with all the details this morning. Grady -- good morning to you.GRADY TRIMBLE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Good morning -- Maria.The Pentagon reportedly taking a second look at whether it wants to do a deal with Amazon. Reports indicate new Defense Secretary Mark Esper is putting the $10 billion contract to use the tech giant's Cloud computing service on hold. This comes after the President suggested the DOD rigged the bidding process in favor of Amazon.In other tech news this morning, we've got billionaire Peter Thiel railing against Google in a "New York Times" op ed. He says that company should be scrutinized because of its new artificial intelligence lab in China.The country he claims will require Google to share its technology with the Chinese military. Here's a quote from that op-ed. "How can Google use the rhetoric of borderless benefits to justify working with the country whose great firewall has imposed a border on the Internet itself?"See what he did there? A lot going on obviously in the tech r world today. We're working to get responses from both of those tech giants -- Maria.BARTIROMO: Really big stories -- Grady. Thank you. Grady Trimble.Peter Thiel is an investor in Anduril Industries which has government contracts. I sat down with Anduril founder Palmer Luckey several months ago on this topic.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: Do some companies in Silicon Valley not understand that? Because in China, China's government will tell its companies and its universities, do this, work together, we want to be number one in A.I. by 2020 or 2025.In America, you've got technology companies like Google who walked away from a contract with the Pentagon who are saying you know what, we don't want to work with you, U.S. administration.PALMER LUCKEY, FOUNDER, ANDURIL INDUSTRIES: Well, first of all, in the United States it's pretty great that these companies have the right to do that. I don't want companies to do this. I want them to work with the U.S. Department of Defense. But they do have the right to walk away.In China, that's not the case. There's no difference between their civil sector and between their military sector. It's all one thing. And that's why when you help Chinese companies work on artificial intelligence, you are almost directly helping the Chinese military work on artificial intelligence.So, you know, we have the freedom to not work on these things. China doesn't have that freedom. And that is just one of the many reasons we have to make sure that we preserve our freedom by being ahead of this technology.A lot of people in Silicon Valley don't really understand this. A lot of people in Silicon Valley, a lot of companies in Silicon Valley, see China as the ultimate business opportunity, not the ultimate adversary. And that is a huge problem.Think about if in World War II, if the biggest companies in the United States with the best technology had believed in an imperial Japan or Nazi Germany were better long term business prospects in their own country, do you think that we would have won? Would we have built the tech that we did? No, of course not.And so we're in a position right now where things are pretty stable. They're pretty peaceful and we're able to kind of pretend that all of these companies or these international organizations that aren't really members of any one nation.But when push comes to shove, I worry about the fact that China is so huge and such a big business opportunity that companies in the United States are willing to work with them and work with their military and not our military because they want to be in China. They want to work with China.BARTIROMO: Such an important point that you just made. Really important. What is China wanting to do? I mean when you look at what China is trying to do in terms of being number one in A.I. it is largely about the military, not just consumers.LUCKEY: Right. It's two things. In China there is no difference between economic warfare and real military warfare. They -- the same people are planning both of these things. So they want to beat other countries economically and they want to beat them in actual armed conflict. And they're using artificial intelligence to bolster their advantages in both those fields and that's why they have such strong collaboration between their private sector and between their military.(END VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: Really a fascinating point there. And he's a patriot. Anduril Industries got the contract with the Pentagon that Google walked away from -- Dagen. So he's got real opinions in terms of Google walking away from the Pentagon and inadvertently straight away working for the Chinese military.MCDOWELL: And we know what's going on at Google because of the video that we saw of the company-wide meeting that they had after the election in 2016, where the finance chief literally started crying about Hillary Clinton losing. So again, there is bias there and there is bias at the top, number one.Number two, in terms of the Pentagon reviewing this Jedi Cloud contract, if you're a conservative or somebody who is a libertarian, you sit on the outside of all of these politicians taking more and more power and handing it to the government, whether it is regulation or financial authority. And we do expect bureaucrats to be held to the same standard anybody else would and to make sure that there're no conflicts of interest there.And that's what this review is about because there was a Pentagon employee who had worked on the contract and for Amazon. And Oracle lost a legal bid to force a deeper review of the potential conflict.So again this is making sure that taxpayer dollars are being spent properly and that there isn't too much power in the hands of too few people who were not being held in check.BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, I mean it's all wrapped up in the whole bias story which is where you started because you've got these companies with more power than they've ever had, when they are handling our data, they are breaching it and they are selling our private information. We didn't even know that. There's that.And then they've got employees that have become activists, that the employees of Google are saying no, we don't want you to work with the Pentagon. We don't like the way this administration deals with immigration. Really?Do you have any idea of the issues on immigration that there is seven billion people on this planet and six billion of them are largely economically-challenged. How many people are we going to let in? We let in on a legal basis 1.4 million people every year.Now you've got a million people, illegals getting ahead of everybody else who is doing it in the legal way, and cutting the line. The Google employees don't want to hear any of that. They just say don't work with the Trump administration.LONSKI: Well, that's so true. A lot of these activists do not have a very good grasp of reality -- that is in question. With China, what we're beginning to see is that every company must recognize that the U.S. relationship with China is very complicated and there are going to be these political risks involved and so perhaps you have to be careful not to have too much reliance on China for manufacturing and not have too much reliance on China in your supply chain.BARTIROMO: And this president understands that.LONSKI: He does. And again, the previous president, it was never an issue for some strange reason.COURTNEY: The President understands it. I think the concern is the leadership of some of these companies in Silicon Valley.BARTIROMO: Right. They don't understand.COURTNEY: And these activists are saying they would rather work with China or they want so badly to get into China and they're putting operations there and they're working with the Chinese government and they're saying they don't want to work with the American government.This is a very deep-rooted issue that we need to protect obviously our country, our national security, our own personal data. It's very, very concerning.BARTIROMO: Absolutely. It sure is. We're talking about that this morning.And we're also looking at earnings and oil on deck. Exxon and Chevron reporting next hour. We're going to tell you what analysts are expecting from those numbers on earnings.And then base-brawl fallout, Major League Baseball teaching the Reds and Pirates a lesson. The punishments coming up.Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Second quarter earnings in focus, ExxonMobil and Chevron both set to report earnings later this morning. Analysts are looking at Exxon to report a profit revenue of 66 cents a share on revenue of $65 billion in the quarter. Chevron expected to earn $1.78 a share on $40.5 billion in revenue.Joining us right now is CFRA Research energy analyst Stewart Glickman. Stewart -- it's good to see you. Thanks so much for joining.STEWART GLICKMAN, ENERGY ANALYST, CFRA RESEARCY: Thank you for having me.BARTIROMO: What kind of a quarter has -- have the oil companies had?GLICKMAN: It's been kind of a mixed bag so far this quarter. The E&Ps have really suffered. You had more misses with E&Ps. They've also missed consensus earnings.The midstream names actually have done relatively well. That's one area within energy we like a lot right now.BARTIROMO: Exxon and Chevron are trading up this morning going into their earnings, Exxon up 1.5 percent. Are you expecting good numbers there?GLICKMAN: No. I mean Exxon earned 92 cents a share in June 2018 quarter. This year on a normalized basis, like 73 cents so I think there's going to be some earnings degradation this quarter for them.Chevron probably a little bit better off. I think they might eke out a small gain year over year.BARTIROMO: Why?GLICKMAN: They have less exposure to refining chemicals than Exxon does. And refining chemicals has suffered so far this year. The other integrated oils that have reported -- World Dutch Shell, Total -- they have had some trouble this quarter.LONSKI: Well, what I'm thinking here about oil and gas, we do have, you know, the price of oil down under $60 per barrel but it was a lot worse back in 2016.And I think the current slowdown still lacks the severity of what we had in 2015, 2016 even though we didn't have a problem with tariffs back then. This holds true for industrial commodity prices in general.BARTIROMO: Do you agree with that?GLICKMAN: I do think it's relative to 2016 -- sure, the situation is a lot better. I think what's weighed on oil prices the last couple of days has really been the demand side of the equation.Supply from OPEC is actually at a five-year low. I think that the fundamentals don't point to oil being this low. I think it should be a little bit higher than where it is now.COURNEY: Stewart -- how do you feel about, you know, with you know, hearing more and more about a global kind of slowdown and what's happening with trade. How that is going to impact certainly the price of oil moving forward.GLICKMAN: So it's a great question. And yesterday with the renewed talk about tariffs, that just threw more sand in the gears of global trade and that's the real concern. It's a real wild card because if it's a supply situation, the producers can kind of tap the brakes a little bit. If it's a demand side problem, it's much harder to deal with.BARTIROMO: So you think that the price of oil is reflective of what's going on in the economy, not necessarily that the price of oil will lead to upset in the economy?GLICKMAN: Correct. I think it's reflective of the demand side concerns and I don't think the supply side situation is quite as pessimistic as what prices have suggested lately.BARTIROMO: All right. We will --LONSKI: You know, in general, a credit front with these smaller E&P companies as well as oil and gas service companies, we're not seeing the same problems that we saw back in 2016. We maybe have more downgrades than upgrades, but I don't think we're really at that point where we're about to see another jump in defaults, comparable to what happened a couple of years ago.BARTIROMO: So not so weak.(CROSSTALKING)LONSKI: Right. Not as weak, no.GLICKMAN: Yes, I agree. I don't think companies are fighting for survival in the same way that they were in 2016.BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, and certainly we have this incredible story in the oil patch post-deregulation in terms of the supply in this country and the ability to export.Stewart -- it's great to get your insights. Thanks so much.GLICKMAN: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Stewart Glickman joining us there.Coming up, trade tensions heating up. President Trump planning new tariffs against Chinese goods. How it affects consumers, next up.And then the meatless debate. Plant-based food popularity blowing up -- the health benefits now being called into question though. Dr. Mike is here to weigh in.Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Friday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Friday, August 2nd. Your top stories right now 7:31 a.m. on the East Coast.U.S.-China trade turmoil working its way through markets. President Trump announced yesterday he is planning to impose a 10 percent tariff on that additional $300 billion of Chinese goods coming into the country. The move could impact the prices of a slew of items including smartphones and clothing, children's toys, now China says it will retaliate.Futures are extending yesterday's big declines on this news. The Dow Futures are down 63 points, a quarter of a percent. The S&P Futures are down 11 and the NASDAQ Futures lower by 52.Markets turn sharply lower yesterday as soon as the president tweeted the tariffs threat. In fact, when all was said and done, the Dow Industrials were down 280 points, that was one percent. S&P was down 26 and the NASDAQ was down 64 points, three quarters of one percent.ExxonMobil earnings coming out, beating on revenue as you see. It's hitting the tape right now.Global markets are following the U.S. lower, FT-100 down 135 points, CAC Quarante down 156, DAX Index in Germany down 323. That's 2-2/3 percent in Germany.In Asia overnight, similar story, red across the screen. Worst performer was Hong Kong, Hang Seng index down 2-1/3 percent.Jobs in America, investors are waiting on the July jobs report this morning. Economists are looking for 164,000 jobs added to the economy in the last month with the unemployment rate holding steady at 3.7 percent.We have special coverage this morning beginning at 08:00 a.m. Eastern for our jobs in America. Jobs Friday coverage, all hands on deck, do join us, coming up.But first this, the meat alternative craze, Burger King is taking its Impossible Whopper national. Dr. Mike is here weighing in on the health value of these meat substitutes versus the real thing.All those stories coming up, but first, our top story this hour and that is escalating trade fears. President Trump planning to hit China with a 10 percent tariff on the remaining $300 billion worth of Chinese imports. Markets are selling off on that, extending yesterday's decline, Futures down 59 points. It follows a wild day on Wall Street yesterday. And you can see the Dow slide right as soon as the president tweeted on the tariff, where markets basically fell out of bed. As you can see, right there, at about 01:00.Beijing is vowing to retaliate if the U.S. does in fact go through with this plan and joining us right now is Heritage Policy analyst on Asian economy and technology, Riley Walters along with Strategic Resource Group managing director, Burt Flickinger. Great to see you, gentleman. Thanks so much for joining us.BURT FLICKINGER, MANAGING DIRECTOR, STRATEGIC RESOURCE GROUP: Good morning.BARTIROMO: Burt, let me kick it off with you here. Are you expecting an impact to retail? Are you expecting products to go higher in price and the consumers to take a hit?FLICKINGER: De minimis effect on retail, Maria, next to nothing. It's only been three-tenths of one percent increase so far. Consumers will not take a hit, it will be primarily the Chinese suppliers, the distributors and the best retailers are winning with marketing and merchandising and the ones who are losing through poor marketing and merchandising are the ones whining and complaining.So, tariffs don't go into effect until September. China's got a food crisis and water crisis similar to 30 years ago with the Tiananmen Square massacre tragedy and China has to worry about unrest with its own people. 200 million pigs dying, 55 percent of the population, water undrinkable, can't irrigate crops with it. They've got their own crisis and they have an impaired negotiating position. They need a deal, they need a deal quickly (INAUDIBLE) consumer.BARTIROMO: Yes, nobody's talking about that pig story because of the swine flu. They're dumping all those pigs, huge numbers of pigs into the river. It's disgusting. You're right, I'm glad you mentioned that.But let me ask Riley, in terms of China, Riley, because they say they're going to retaliate. So what should we expect?RILEY WALTERS, ANALYST, HERITAGE POLICY: Well, they certainly can't tariff as many goods as we are. I mean, at this point, we're tariffing basically every single thing that we buy from China, which I disagree with our colleague here. I mean, I think we will see some cost increase over the rest of the year.But China, again, because they can't tariff as much, they will increase pressure on business camp -- businesses in China through harassment, customs delays, other, you know, nontariff measures.MCDOWELL: I want to ask Burt something, though, that he brought up. Because this is a story that you will never hear on a Democratic debate stage. You will not hear it from the leany left. It's that -- well, these major retailers can handle the cost of this in part because of the savings from investments in solar energy. That they've switched to a more reliable but basically self-driven form of electricity and that's where they can make up some of the cost savings from these tariffs.FLICKINGER: Dagen's bringing up a really present point, bipartisan deal between the administration, front page story on Investors' Business Daily, solar's new dawn. 60 percent of the panels well many are made in the U.S., 60 percents from the People's Republic of China and the consumer's benefiting because with solar it's cheaper power.Amazon, ALDI, Costco, Target, Walmart, BJ's are all lowering their prices through commercial solar and as a result, consumers are paying a benefit in both countries, they're benefiting and in these negotiations there's a -- there's a great opportunity to do more constructive working.Like you said, Maria, the mitigation of the food crisis that the Chinese people and the country is going through, that's the key issue. The Chinese know it. And your guest is correct. There will be a little bit of an increase for consumer products but most of the goods are already here. We're over-inventoried, too much manufacturing capacity. Competition will take care of price increases which will be modest if any at all and they'll be deflation in T.V. and other consumer electronics.BARTIROMO: You know, it's interesting because China was not an expert on solar until they started copying the U.S. on solar.FLICKINGER: Right and --BARTIROMO: So they acquired companies in solar and all of a sudden, next thing you know, they're the major producer of solar panels. This is exactly what's going on in every segment. But they didn't solar, I'm glad you mentioned solar because that's exactly the story that's happening. China acquires a solar company, they copy all their stuff, now they're the largest producer of solar panels.FLICKINGER: Completely correct and Canadian Solar is now a leading Chinese company supplying solar to the U.S.BARTIROMO: Exactly.MCDOWELL: But it's -- but it's fixable.FLICKINGER: Yes.MCDOWELL: It's fixable and in the short run, it's helping the retailers offset the tariffs. Again, it's not -- these are not issues in a vacuum. It is, OK, we've invested in solar, we might have bought most of those panels from China but now the president is taking on this fight with China and we -- because we've made these investments, now we can actually weather this, move production to other nations and also try to move solar panel production back here to the United States.BARTIROMO: That's pretty hard.FLICKINGER: Yes, as Dagen's referencing, while with you Maria, solar panel production is moving to the U.S., it's have record growth. And their professional patriotism with Kevin Plank at Under Armour and Jim Davis and Joe Preston at New Balance manufacturing in the U.S. and increasing on- shoring job, people and robotics. While the retail trade groups are complaining and letting Nike strip mine America with almost all their production offshore.BARTIROMO: Good point.MCDOWELL: Strip mining America. I'm stealing that. I am stealing that, Burt Flickinger.BARTIROMO: Strip mining America.JOANIE COURTNEY, CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER & WORKFORCE ANALYST, EMPLOYBRIDGE: But Burt, the big thing is going to be even moving manufacturing back here, we have to have the people to put in those jobs and we do have a challenge with that. I mean, that's going to be a concern.BARTIROMO: Yes, for sure. Riley, weigh in here. Final thoughts here.WALTERS: You know, I think there's going to be a lot of capacity questions about how much of manufacturing is actually moving out of China to the United States, to other countries. Certainly, you know, scarcity is the law of economics. And so, of course, in the rest of the world, scarcity rules.BARTIROMO: John, did you want to jump in?JOHN LONSKI, MANAGING DIRECTOR AND CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S: Well, all I have to say is let's keep things in perspective. We're talking about $300 billion worth of tariffs coming in. Actually, $300 billion worth of Chinese imports, 10 percent. There's only $30 billion. $30 billion is less than a drop in a bucket for a more than $20 trillion economy.BARTIROMO: All right, you're not concerned. You're not concerned about this.LONSKI: I'm not especially worried about this. We've had this issue around for a long time but we're still growing. We're still expanding the economy. It's hurting in the margin. It's maybe costing us a quarter of a -- of a percentage point in terms of economic growth but that's still not enough to push us into a recession.MCDOWELL: But I will quote from just really quickly.BARTIROMO: Yes, go ahead.MCDOWELL: The issue is uncertainty.BARTIROMO: Yes, for sure.MCDOWELL: Uncertainty, to quote an individual in the Wall Street Journal today, uncertainty is the enemy of long-term investment decisions. That ultimately is what is hurt. It's hard to quantify, might be qualitative, nevertheless, it is a worry.BARTIROMO: Which is why we're going to focus on CapEx this program to see where it goes from here. Burt, it's good to see you. Thank you.FLICKINGER: Always great to team up.BARTIROMO: Riley, thank you so much for weighing in.WALTERS: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Burt Flickinger and Riley Walters joining us.Coming up, jobs in America, the July jobs numbers are out in under an hour. We have all hands on deck on that.Then, Major League discipline, baseball teaching the Reds and the Pirates a real lesson, the punishments coming up, stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Major League Baseball ruling with a heavy hand after a base brawl at the Reds, Pirates game you remember. Cheryl Casone with the details, Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: I want to show the video again because that's always fun, Maria. Good morning again. Major League Baseball handing out eight suspensions after Tuesday's massive brawl between the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Cincinnati Reds. Here it goes again. It stand in part from Pirates pitcher Keone Kela throwing a pitch near a player's head. Later, Reds reliever Amir Garrett charged the Pirates' dugout. That when it got dirty. Kela suspended 10 games, Garrett suspended eight games, Yasiel Puig three games. Puig was traded to Cleveland right around the time that the brawl broke out. There are no connection as we know it. And those are your headlines, Maria.BARTIROMO: All right, thank you so much, Cheryl.CASONE: You bet.BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, we had a big week as you know, this week here, we had stories international as well as domestic. Take a look at the top moments from the program this week.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. JOHN BARRASSO (R-WY): If it weren't for President Trump, China would never even be at the table. We know that they cheat. We know that they manipulate their currency. We know they steal intellectual property and trade secrets. That is their business model. If it weren't for the tariffs and President Trump, they wouldn't even be discussing this.PETER NAVARRO, DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF TRADE AND MANUFACTURING: The tariffs are good, tariffs are raising the revenues, they're helping to fund our steel and aluminum industries, they're helping get China to the negotiate.BARTIROMO: How much was revenue --NAVARRO: Do you think -- do you think China would be at the negotiating table right now?BARTIROMO: No, i don't.NAVARRO: Oh yes, so tariffs in the China case worked beautifully.MARK MORGAN, ACTING COMMISSIONER, CBP: This administration has made this happen because really, the crisis that we have on our southwest border, it's not a United States crisis only. It's a regional crisis. So this is about Mexico and Guatemala --BARTIROMO: That's a good point.MORGAN: -- stepping up to address this crisis in a regional way.JOHN BOLTON, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR TO THE U.S.: Iran has been a state sponsor of terrorism since listed by Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. This is a fundamentally illegitimate regime. Zarif is the mouth piece of the regime. He's Iran's equivalent of P.T. Barnum. You know, there's a sucker born every minute and he's found suckers in the United States and Europe. He got him to agree to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. He's not a diplomat. He's a con man. He's a show. He's a grifter.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have to be realistic. Voters want change. But they want change that's achievable and they want change that's going to be achieved without messing up the economy.JAMES HOFFA JR., GENERAL PRESIDENT, INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF TEAMSTERS: They want to hear about what are we going to do. What are we going to do about the minimum wage? What are we going to do about having healthcare for people that don't have healthcare? What are we going to do about retirement security, people that have worked hard and played by the rules? Those are the type of kitchen table issues that I would like to see these debates focus on.PETER MORICI, PROFESSOR EMERITUS, UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND: I mean, going back to the `60s when I was a kid in school, there were people who would try to become financially independent of their parents or at least claim independence to max their financial aid. This is a different wrinkle. You sign over custody to a poorer relative.I think we need to say that this is wrong but also to look at it in the context of the recent admissions scandal and ask why are parents going to such extremes and I think the answer is the way colleges and universities treat them. Frankly, very cynically.MCDOWELL: Investors are Veruca Salt. I want it and I want it now. They wanted reassurances that you were going to get a series of rate cuts.CASONE: A young boy loses it when Monopoly teaches him a really hard lesson about life and money.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Where's all your money gone, Bobby?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Taxes. It's the worst part of the game.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is what?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Taxes.CASONE: We feel your pain, honey. The now viral post first went up on Reddit. Many on social media clearly relating to the kids woes, expressing sympathy for his big losses. And you know what, we should add here Maria that, you know, this is actually the way you play Monopoly if you play it in the correct way and there is an income tax.BARTIROMO: (INAUDIBLE) I never paid taxes.CASONE: Then well, you're cheating.BARTIROMO: Come on.CASONE: That's you know, there is an income if you played the game in the real way, you're supposed to. There's an income tax hit on the boardBARTIROMO: Evel Pie's latest culinary masterpiece, goat cheese pie is topped with fried grasshoppers. You can get a slice for $5.50. The Evel Knievel-themed restaurant also boast a rattlesnake sausage creation.No, no, just don't go, don't do it.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. So where is the beef? Not here. Burger King announcing the plant based Impossible Whopper will appear nationally on its menus this month. Critics quick to warn plant based meat alternatives may not be as healthy as you think.Joining us right now to give us the final word is Dr. Mikhail Varshavski, also known as Dr. Mike. Dr. Mike, great to see you.DR. MIKHAIL VARSHAVSKI, PHYSICIAN, FAMILY MEDICINE: Good to see you.BARTIROMO: We want to ask you about the nutritional value of these meatless burgers. What do you say?VARSHAVSKI: Well, I like to think about these burgers as a whole. So first of all, I think they're great for the environment. If we can reduce animal consumption that's going to be a win right away because we reduce animal emissions. Great, I love that.However, from the nutritional aspect, this is still an indulgence. This is a processed food. This is a v -- this is a junk food, it just happens to be a vegetarian or vegan junk food. We have to be aware of that because there's high sodium content, still high saturated fat content, high calorie content.So people need to be aware of this effect that we talk about in medicine called the halo effect where you think a food is healthy just because it's labelled a health food. Meatless burgers are still not a health food. This is an indulgence. This is a snack. It's a processed food. It's not something I generally recommend.BARTIROMO: And you knew this? You knew this already, Dagen?MCDOWELL: Yes, it is -- it's fast food.VARSHAVSKI: Yes, exactly.MCDOWELL: And if you don't normally eat fast food and you start eating fast food simply because it's vegan, well, you're probably going to gain weight and might be a little puffy from the sodium content.BARTIROMO: Well, most people don't realize the calories in some vegan food. I mean, you're talking about like things like avocado. And you know, that has high fat and high calorie.VARSHAVSKI: Well, the trick to all these meatless burgers is that they want them to taste like real meat in order to convert to traditional meat eaters. When they do that, they add processed chemicals to them, they add high sodium content to them. Because if something doesn't taste salty, it doesn't taste like real meat.MCDOWELL: All right, so just to clear up something. No vegan burger or food is going to taste like the meat alternative.VARSHAVSKI: Yes.MCDOWELL: The goal is always for it to have the same bite and toothiness of the real version versus the vegan version. So does an Impossible Burger eat like a meat burger? It actually does, in terms of the mouth feel of it and they use a lot of fat in it.VARSHAVSKI: Yes, they do.MCDOWELL: They use things like coconut oil to replace the animal fats that are in it. So again, it's tasty and you're not killing an animal to eat it but it's not going to make you lose weight.BARTIROMO: If you're doing this to lose weight, you really need to understand this.VARSHAVSKI: This isn't necessarily a diet issue, this is more of a risk reduction. Like if you're eating three burgers a week and you want to reduce your animal intake, please, have a meatless burger, reduce it.MCDOWELL: It could have --VARSHAVSKI: But ideally, I want to just get people off of eating junk food. Its whole foods that are going to get you healthy.MCDOWELL: It could help cardio -- your cardiovascular health, right? If you (INAUDIBLE)VARSHAVSKI: Well, I mean, it's tricky because ideally if someone already has some cardiovascular vent, we tell them to lower their saturated fat intake. And if they're going to be eating these meatless burgers with a lot of coconut oil, that's high in saturated fat. Not something we advise.COURTNEY: I'm so glad you're talking about this though because I think there is this misconception. I don't think people realize that there is that much fat in it. But how does it compare to like a veggie burger, which I know obviously doesn't taste like meat but is that a healthier option?BARTIROMO: Real vegetables.VARSHAVSKI: Generally, yes, veggie burgers tend to have lower amounts of saturated fat, less sodium in them because they're not trying to emulate this meat, actual meat burgers.Look, if we need to convert people, this is a great way to do it, it's going to help the environment, cool. But we just have to really be aware of this halo effect that we don't think, oh, this is a healthy food so I'm just going to eat two meatless burgers a day, because it's healthy. No, that's not the case.BARTIROMO: Then I'll eat potato chips.VARSHAVSKI: Yes, exactly.MCDOWELL: But at least it's not excluding vegans from all of these restaurants. I think that that's hugely beneficial. But by the way, in terms of veggie burgers, you ever eaten like a beet burger, it's like mush in your mouth? The worst.BARTIROMO: Beet burger.MCDOWELL: Beet, and it's like red, it looks like -- I don't know. It looks like road kill.VARSHAVSKI: I actually did a full meatless burger taste test on my YouTube channel where I blindfolded myself and tried to compare it to regular meat.BARTIROMO: Oh, cool.VARSHAVSKI: And what I found was some of these really do trick you. Some of them they add beet juice to make them even feel like they're bleeding, like an animal product.MCDOWELL: The Impossible Burger is the best one, I think.BARTIROMO: That's amazing.VARSHAVSKI: It depends on your taste buds.BARTIROMO: Thank you for your advice. Actually, you know what, I have another question for you.VARSHAVSKI: Yes.BARTIROMO: So, but we've got to jump. So I'm going to -- let's do it on Instagram. We're going to do an Instagram live.VARSHAVSKI: Let's do it, I love that.BARTIROMO: We'll do it during the commercial break, next. Go to Instagram. Dr. Mikhail Varshavski. We'll be right back.Load-Date: August 2, 2019End of Document

Anomali Threat Research Team Discovers BITTER APT Phishing Campaign Targeting People's Republic of China Government Agencies; Threat Actors May Be Stealing Credentials from Agency Officials, Conducting EspionageGlobeNewswireAugust 8, 2019 Thursday 3:28 PM PTCopyright 2019 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: COMPANY ANNOUNCEMENT; TRADE SHOWLength: 500 wordsBodyLAS VEGAS, Aug.  08, 2019  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BLACK HAT   Anomali, a leader in intelligence-driven cybersecurity solutions, today published its latest research report: Suspected BITTER APT Continues Targeting Government of China and Chinese Organizations. The Anomali Threat Research Team discovered this new phishing attack leveraging spoof sites that appear to be designed to steal email credentials from target victims within the government of the People's Republic of China. Although the attackers' exact motivation is unknown, it is logical to conclude that this is an espionage campaign. By stealing email credentials, and accessing internal email content, it would be possible for infiltrators to gain insight into decisions being made within the target organizations. Once in, threat actors could also gain access to sensitive information. Attack victims are members of staff for the organizations being targeted. Most of the agencies being phished relate to economic trade, defense, aviation, and foreign relations. This suggests that the attackers are likely to be an actor or group operating under a mandate to understand China's international goals. China-based CERT 360 has previously reported on related indicators being attributed to BITTER APT. This group is known to operate out of a South Asian country and is a suspected Indian APT in open source reporting. BITTER APT campaigns primarily target China, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia historically.Phishing DefenseAlthough the attack identified is targeting officials within the government of the People's Republic of China, it is important for all organizations to understand that threat actors use the same methods and techniques to target the public and private sectors. Organizations at risk of being targeted in the manner observed should take several basic precautionary steps. This includes having security controls in place that integrate threat intelligence about active attacks, defense-in-depth protections including firewalls, and regular security training for employees that includes anti-phishing education. To learn more about Anomali and how hundreds of enterprises use it to reduce risk, visit us on the exhibitor floor at Black Hat USA 2019, #1114. Twitter: https://twitter.com/AnomaliLinkedIn:            https://www.linkedin.com/company/anomali/Blog:            https://www.anomali.com/blogAbout AnomaliAnomali® detects adversaries and tells you who they are.

Muslims in China's most oppressed, closed-off region are turning to China's version of Gen Z favorite TikTok to communicate with the worldBusiness Insider USAugust 25, 2019 Sunday 06:06 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1394 wordsByline: ama@businessinsider.com,  (Alexandra Ma)Highlight: Dozens of Uighurs in Xinjiang are using Douyin to tell the outside world about their plight. This is their first contact with the outside world.BodyDouyin• Uighurs in Xinjiang, the most oppressed and closed-off region in China, are using popular video-sharing app Douyin to tell the outside world about their plight.• Douyin is the Chinese version of TikTok, the video-sharing app popular among Generation Z. They're both owned by Bytedance, a Chinese company.• Dozens of videos appear to show Uighurs in front of old photos of their family members with footage edited to show themselves crying or gesturing.• It appears that this is the first time Uighurs physically in Xinjiang have been able to communicate with the outside world. • They're doing so at great risk, as China forbids them from making any contact with anyone outside the region.• Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.Muslims in the most oppressed and closed-off region in China are using the country's version of TikTok, the video-sharing app popular among Generation Z, to tell the world about the government's abuse.Dozens of people from the Uighur ethnic minority have in recent weeks posted edited videos of themselves on Douyin, the video platform, appearing to memorialize their missing family and friends.The videos, which between 10 and 20 seconds long, follow the same formula: An old photo placed as the backdrop, and the person making the video editing themselves into it. Many of the posts are geotagged with locations in Xinjiang.None of them are saying anything - they're crying or making other silent gestures instead.One woman, shown in front of an old photo of four men, is holding up four fingers - a gesture that could refer to the four people in the photo, four family members who might be missing, or simply to death. The Mandarin Chinese pronunciation of "four" (sì) is similar to that of "death" (si).Though the people in the videos don't say anything, "the message is very clear," Uighur-American activist Bahram Sintash told Business Insider. "They miss their family members."Sintash's father, a prominent Uighur scholar, has been missing for at least a year.Tweet Embed: //twitter.com/mims/statuses/1163044421010644993?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw This brave #Uyghur           #Muslim girl, still resides in            #Xinjiang aka            #EastTurkestan is indicating that four of her relatives are in            #China's            #ConcentrationCamps.

They are also forbidden from talking to journalists, according to foreign reporters who have been to the region."Before, Uighurs overseas spread messages about Xinjiang on social media, but no one realized Uighurs in the region could do it too," Sintash told Business Insider.Many of these videos have since been deleted by Chinese censors, The Wall Street Journal reported, but many people have already downloaded the clips and shared them on other social media platforms. It's not clear where the people in the videos are now.Sintash, for instance, has been collecting the Douyin videos and posting them on his Instagram page, @SadUyghurs. Arslan Hidayat, another Australian-Uighur activist based in Turkey, has published 29 videos in a            Twitter thread.Read more: Chilling undercover footage taken inside China's most oppressive region shows it's virtually impossible to escape the paranoid police stateTweet Embed: //twitter.com/mims/statuses/1163838784032690176?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw Clip 23Witness Testimonials coming right out of #Xinjiang aka            #EastTurkestan.

It could be that Douyin is their only portal to the outside world.Facebook, Twitter, and Google's services are banned in China, and authorities are known to closely monitor the popular WeChat messaging app."This is the most massive information coming out of our homeland these days, because China's government has blocked [everything else]," Uighur-American activist Rushan Abbas told Business Insider, referring to Xinjiang. "We have never got information like this before. They [the Uighurs in Xinjiang] are trying everything they can."Many social media platforms in China - including Douyin - are required by law to delete any content unsavory to Chinese authorities, the Journal reported. Chinese authorities have also punished social media companies for failing to censor enough content in the past.A representative for Bytedance, Douyin's parent company, has not yet responded to Business Insider's request to comment on the videos.TikTok/Business InsiderDouyin and TikTok - which are particularly popular among Generation Z - are both owned by Bytedance, but the Chinese and international versions            operate separately. This means TikTok users can't access Douyin videos, and vice versa.However, many former Chinese residents still have the app on their phones or have downloaded it via the Chinese app store, making it possible for them to watch and download the clips. Earlier this year Business Interview interviewed a Uighur man living in Turkey who lost his family in 2016, but found his son in a Chinese propaganda video on Douyin this January.Read more: This man's family vanished in China's most oppressed region. The next time he saw his son was 2 years later, in a Chinese propaganda video.Courtesy of Bahram Sintash; Courtesy of Rushan Abbas; Samantha Lee/Business InsiderActivists are worried that the people in the videos will now get arrested or detained."They know that they may disappear and they may end up in a concentration camp," Abbas told Business Insider, referring to the prison-like camps where Chinese authorities have detained up to 1.5 million Uighurs.Beijing refers to them, euphemistically, as "re-education camps." It claimed last month that it had released most detainees, but has provided no significant evidence of this.Abbas's own sister, Gulshan, was disappeared from her home in Urumqi, Xinjiang, last September after Rushan publicly criticized China's human-rights record at an            event in Washington, DC."I know that the Chinese government may retaliate against those people who put up their faces and pictures of their loved ones, and shared those videos with the world," Abbas said. "It makes me sad to see those desperate faces," she continued. "At the same time it makes me so worried for these people, knowing what happened to my sister and the reason why she was abducted."• Read more about the Uighurs:• The White House quietly appointed a Uighur-American to the National Security Council, which could rattle Beijing and make a US-China trade deal even less likely• Relatives of China's oppressed Muslim minority are getting blocked online by their own family members, who are terrified to even tell them how bad their lives are• Jailing Muslims, burning Bibles, and forcing monks to wave the national flag: How Xi Jinping is attacking religion in China• 14 seconds of undercover footage reveals the shadowy, sinister reality of China's 21st-century police stateNOW WATCH: A new underwater memorial honors US military veterans and serves as an artificial reef to preserve marine lifeSee Also:• These are the 9 nuclear-armed countries and the 31 allies they've vowed to defend• Trump's new Pentagon's chief says the US is testing once-banned missiles to 'deter Chinese bad behavior'• The US just entered a great-power arms race in a big way - and Russia and China are panickingSEE ALSO: Inside the rise of TikTok, the video-sharing app with 1 billion downloads owned by a massive Chinese internet companyLoad-Date: August 25, 2019End of Document

China bets on dialogue with US and will not retaliate furtherCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 29, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1018 wordsBody       DREAMSTIMEEXPANSIONThe Government of China has expressed opposition to an escalation of the trade war with the United States, as well as its willingness to resolve the differences between the two countries through dialogue, stressing that Beijing's response to the latest tariff barrage unloaded by Washington "enough," which sets aside fears of further Chinese reprisals following the tightening of protectionist measures that the US will implement starting Sunday."China has already indicated its position," China's Ministry of Commerce spokesman Gao Feng said at a press conference. "We are resolutely opposed to the escalation of the trade war and are ready to solve the problem through consultation and cooperation in a calm attitude," he added.The Chinese official has pointed out that an escalation of the trade war is not conducive to China, or to the United States, or to global interests" and may even have disastrous consequences for the world.""If someone wants to force the decoupling of China and the US, the result will harm others, not only will it seriously harm the interests of businesses and individuals, but it will also threaten the security of the global supply chain and endanger trade and the global economy," the official said.In this regard, Gao Feng has confirmed by being questioned about the telephone contacts that Donald Trump revealed on Monday during the G7 summit that "economic and trade teams on both sides have always maintained effective communication.""Today, the most important thing is to create the necessary conditions for the two sides to continue consultations," he said.The trade crisis between the two largest world economies reached new levels of tension on Friday, after China announced the imposition, from 1 September, of additional tariffs of between 5% and 10% on 5,078 products us from $75 billion (67,732 million euros) in response to the latest protectionist measures announced from Washington.The Chinese counterattack satiated the anger of the US president, who on the same day announced through his profile on the social network Twitter that "the remaining $300 billion of goods and products from China, which were subject to 10% tariffs from September 1, they will now be taxed at 15%."In fact, the US Trade Representative's Office has already carried out the red tape to impose from 1 September and on 15 December this additional tariff of 15% on a list of Chinese products worth 300 billion EUR 270,746 million, up from 10% initially planned.The document contends that following the US announcement of the imposition of tariffs on $300 billion on Chinese imports from September 1," China responded by announcing new tariffs on US products since September 1 "."In short, instead of addressing the underlying problems, China increased tariffs and adopted or threatened additional retaliation to further protect its identified irrational actions, policies and practices, resulting in further damage to the economy of the AMERICA," he says.On the other hand, the spokesman for China's Ministry of Commerce has stepped on the concerns expressed by international companies with a presence in the Asian country with the implementation of the Corporate Social Credit System (SCSC), which will be completely inforce in 2020, with which Beijing intends to control the access of foreign companies to the gigantic Chinese market by allocating positive and negative points."The Chinese government has strengthened the construction of the corporate social credit system to create a more standardized, fair, transparent and predictable legal trading environment," said Gao Feng, noting that China will effectively protect secrets companies' intellectual property rights."All market players will be treated equally and no discriminatory practices will be adopted against foreign-funded enterprises (...) For companies that are legally eligible, there is no need to worry," he said.The European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, the lobby that defends the interests of European firms operating in China, has warned that the implementation in China of SCSC "could mean the life or death of companies".The social credit system is part of the chinese government's profound changes in access to the Asian giant's market to ensure that only companies proving to be reliable can operate in the country.Thus, through positive and negative scores on specific issues such as taxes, customs, environmental protection and product quality, the new system evaluates the behaviour of companies."China's Corporate Social Credit System is any government's most concerted attempt to impose a self-regulating market, and could mean the life or death of individual companies," said J.G. Wuttke, president of the Chamber of Commerce European Union in China.According to the European business lobby, the new system covers virtually every aspect of a company's business in China, stating that a multinational is subject in the country to some 30 regulatory ratings and compliance records, which are calculated function of a set of requirements. "In total, a multinational can be qualified according to about 300 requirements," he says.Market participants who violate these requirements will receive negative ratings and, in the most serious cases, will be included in a "blacklist". This way, the more negative scores a company has, the more restrictions on its business activities it will experience.These restrictions are not simply limited to fines, but also include higher inspection fees and specific audits, the exclusion of preferential policies (tax subsidies and refunds), or restrictions on government procurement and the worst-case scenario can prevent a company from investing and participating in the Chinese market until it regains its credit and is removed from the list.The lifting of physical and administrative barriers to access to the Chinese market can be explained, at least in part, by Beijing's growing confidence "in its ability to influence companies, both foreign and Chinese, in a more nuanced manner", the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China.Load-Date: August 30, 2019End of Document

HOUSE PASSES KING AMENDMENT TARGETING CHINA'S ABUSIVE SURVEILLANCE STATEStates News ServiceJuly 12, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 781 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, D.C. BodyThe following information was released by the office of Iowa Rep. Steve King:"U.S. policy, including defense policy, should by no measure assist, intentionally or unintentionally, the growth of China's surveillance."Washington, D.C.- Congressman Steve King releases these remarks following House passage of an amendment he offered to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that requires the Department of Defense to analyze China's growing surveillance state to determine the threat it poses to American security interests. King's amendment is now included within the House version of the NDAA legislation, which itself passed the House of Representatives on a nearly party-line vote of 220-197 this afternoon."I am encouraged that my amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for fiscal year passed the House of Representatives by voice vote on July 11th, 2019. This important amendment requires the 'Annual Report on Military and Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of China' to include an assessment of (1) China's expansion of its surveillance state; (2) Any correlation of such expansion with its oppression of its citizens and its threat to United States national security interests around the world; and (3) An overview of the extent to which such surveillance corresponds to the overall respect, or lack thereof, for human rights.This matter is one that I have long been attuned to and concerned about, ultimately leading me to draft and introduce the 'Protect American IPR Act', which is H.R. 902 this session, and seeks to stop Chinese theft of U.S. intellectual property through duties on Chinese merchandise. For this reason, I have been encouraged to see President Trump prioritizing the Chinese stealing of American intellectual property.Mass and unabated government surveillance does not only offend individual liberties; in the hands of an authoritarian government, it poses the Orwellian threat of the government always watching, and ultimately using this ability, made possible to an unprecedented extent by modern technology, to spy on, steal from, intimidate and persecute not only those it views as "political enemies" and "threats", but anyone it deems as expedient.This Orwellian threat is becoming a reality, perhaps nowhere more so than in China, where the government vigorously pursues a national video surveillance network. The affinity of the Chinese government to control its population in part by mass monitoring is not a new phenomenon, but advancing technology makes its prospects more frightening every day for those within and outside of the Mainland.One internet privacy expert warns, "What China is doing here is selectively breeding its population to select against the trait of critical, independent thinking". Since China is a neighbor to many and more importantly an actor on the world stage, that erosion will not simply negatively impact the Chinese, it will spreadit arguably has already. A world with continually less critical, independent thought is a prospect to tremble at.It is my strong belief that U.S. policy, including defense policy, should by no measure assist, intentionally or unintentionally, the growth of China's surveillance. Instead, it should discourage the expansion of the Chinese government into the rest of the world, while at the same time encouraging greater human rights for the Chinese people, including expectant mothers and Christians and other religious minorities.I have heard from many individuals who warn against China's rapid expansion and influence into the rest of the world, including Africa and Central America, our nation's own backyard. Although the government-connected interests bring economic promise (and exploitation) to the developing world, they also bring the Chinese surveillance state with them. To counter this very real and growing threat, we need to first understand its scope, its impact for individuals in China as well as those around the world, and the extent to which it threatens the U.S. national security interests."The text of King's House passed NDAA amendment may be read here.Congressman King has also introduced legislation (HR 902) that is designed to provide redress to the holders of US intellectual property who have been victimized by Chinese theft. King's legislation directs the President to impose duties on merchandise from China in an amount equivalent to the estimated annual loss of revenue to holders of U.S. intellectual property rights. The revenue raised by the imposition of duties on Chinese merchandise will be proportionally distributed to provide compensation to holders of United States intellectual property rights.Load-Date: July 13, 2019End of Document

Last week the UN Human Rights Office accused Hong Kong's police of excessive harshness in dealing with the protesters.The rap echoes news last week that at least 10 pop stars from mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, had pledged their allegiance to Beijing and the one-China policy.Read more: An adorable video shows a Hong Kong child leading streams of protesters in a chant: 'Hong Kong people, keep going!'Protests first arose in March as response to a bill that would have permitted China to extradite Hong Kong residents to mainland China.Twitter/CGTNThe bill was stalled, but protests have evolved into a wider pro-democracy movement which has resulted in multiple clashes between police and protesters. On August 12, Beijing strongly condemned the protests, accusing "radical Hong Kong protesters" of engaging in "deranged" acts of violence.Twitter/CGTNYang Guang, a spokesman for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, said protesters attacked and injured police officers in clashes over the weekend and called for swift punishment "without leniency, without mercy."Chinese paramilitary forces - members of the People's Armed Police - was recently seen massing at a sports stadium in Shenzhen, just minutes from Hong Kong, where they are training for crowd and riot control.Here are the lyrics to Chengdu Revolution's song:[In English]Hey, democracy!Why you always hiding somewhere so hard to see?So many counterfeits copying,So I guess you must be some kind of luxury.Once I heard you be found in the Middle East,people were throwing bombs across the city streets.If that's what you want, sorry I can't agree,get those foreign armies outta town then we can talk about it.Now you be found in Hong Kong,I start to think.Who found you? who are you?Who's hiding behind the scene?All I see is a beautiful dream turning to nightmare.Can I say hi there?Hong Kong they all liars.

US, China revive trade talks with low hopes for progressAssociated Press InternationalJuly 29, 2019 Monday 10:37 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 1199 wordsByline: By JOE McDONALD, AP Business WriterDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - Two months after U.S.-Chinese talks aimed at ending a tariff war broke down, both sides are trying to temper hopes for a breakthrough when negotiations resume Tuesday on an array of disputes that has grown to include tension over China's tech giant Huawei.Rhetoric has hardened despite the June agreement by Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping to revive efforts to end the costly fight over China's technology ambitions and trade surplus."I don't know if they're going to make a deal," Trump said Friday. "Maybe they will, maybe they won't. I don't care." He repeated his claim that the United States is prospering by "taking in tens of billions of dollars" from his tariff hikes on Chinese products. In reality, those are paid by U.S. companies and consumers who buy Chinese goods.U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer are due to meet Tuesday and Wednesday in Shanghai with a delegation led by China's economy czar, Vice Premier Liu He.Chinese leaders are resisting U.S. pressure to roll back plans for government-led development of industry leaders in robotics, artificial intelligence and other technologies. Washington complains those efforts depend on stealing or pressuring foreign companies to hand over technology. Some American officials worry the U.S. is losing its lead.For their part, American negotiators have resisted Beijing's demand that they remove all punitive tariffs immediately. Washington wants to keep some in place to ensure China keeps its promises."The same issues that caused the talks to break down are still there," said Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics."Neither side seems any closer to offering major concessions," said Evans-Pritchard. "It's very hard to see how they can reach a deal this time if they were unable to do that in March."U.S. priorities include "industrial policy issues such as intellectual property rights, forced technology transfer and subsidies for (Chinese) state-owned enterprises," said Jeff Moon, a former U.S. diplomat and trade official who specialized in China. "Enforcing any agreements is also a top priority."Economists are warning that with both sides still far apart, the truce is fragile.After talks broke down in May, the Trump administration imposed curbs on U.S. technology sales to Huawei, the biggest global maker of network gear for phone companies and the No. 2 smartphone brand. U.S. officials view Huawei as a national security threat and warn that its equipment could be used for cyberespionage.Beijing retaliated by announcing it would create its own list of "unreliable entities" subject to unspecified controls. Authorities have yet to announce which companies might be targeted.On the eve of the talks, the Chinese government accused Washington on Monday of "arrogance and selfishness" after Trump pressed for the World Trade Organization to stop allowing Beijing and other governments to receive more lenient treatment as developing economies.Trump told Lighthizer in a memo Friday the he wants the WTO to prevent member governments from claiming developing country status if their economies do not need beneficial treatment. Developing countries are allowed more time to open their economies and more leeway to subsidize exports.China needs that status to "achieve real trade fairness," said a foreign ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying.The Trump administration's remarks "have further exposed its wayward arrogance and selfishness," Hua said.Trump has suggested he would consider easing up on Huawei if it meant getting a better trade deal."Trump - in his eagerness to find negotiating leverage - linked national security and trade with regard to Huawei to create a new bargaining chip," Moon said. Members of Congress from both parties likely would object to any concessions on Huawei.The tariff hikes are battering exporters on both sides and disrupting trade in goods from soybeans to medical devices. China's imports of American goods fell 31.4% in June from a year ago while exports to the United States fell 7.8%.Mnuchin is usually upbeat in public about the talks. But he tried to temper hopes when he announced plans for the Shanghai meeting, telling broadcaster CNBC that negotiators face "a lot of issues" and he expects to hold more talks, probably in Washington."China and the United States will face tough negotiations. The gap between their current positions is very big," said the Global Times, published by the ruling Communist Party newspaper People's Daily.Washington "still hopes to force Chinese concessions," the newspaper said. It rejected "destructive surgery on China's economic system" and called on Washington "not to deny the legitimacy of China's demands."China agreed earlier to narrow its multibillion-dollar trade surplus with the United States by purchasing more American soybeans, natural gas and other exports. But it revoked that pledge after one of Trump's tariff hikes last year.Chinese leaders have grown more skittish, saying any agreement must be "balanced," reflecting frustration that American officials would portray the talks as a victory for Washington, with China bearing the costs."If the responsibilities all come from China, it is not an agreement but a surrender," said Tu Xinquan, director of the China Institute of International Trade and Economics.Moon, who runs the China Moon Strategies consultancy, dismissed Beijing's call for balance as "an excuse to object to reforming even the most protectionist aspects of China's trade policy."Trump's demands for changes in Chinese industrial policy strike at the heart of a state-led development model the ruling Communist Party sees as a path to prosperity and greater global influence.The decision to add Huawei Technologies Ltd. to a U.S. "entity list" that limits exports threatens China's first global tech brand.Huawei, which reported $105 billion in sales in 2018, relies heavily on U.S. components and technology. Its founder said losing access to them could cut its projected revenue by $30 billion over the next two years.That has fueled Communist Party suspicions Washington's wants to "contain" China, making it harder for Xi to offer concessions, Evans-Pritchard said.The trade fight takes place against a backdrop of tensions over China's strategic ambitions.Last week, Beijing accused Washington of undermining global stability after a U.S. warship sailed through the strait that separates the mainland from Taiwan, the self-ruled island Beijing claims as its territory.China's government made a new promise to buy American farm goods after Trump agreed ahead of his June meeting with Xi to allow some sales to Huawei.Trump later accused Beijing of backtracking, saying on Twitter, "China is letting us down."Beijing tried to mollify Trump last week by announcing Chinese companies were ready to negotiate with American suppliers of agricultural products.Asked whether U.S. curbs on Huawei must be lifted for trade talks to make progress, a government spokesman, Gao Feng, called on Washington to "stop using erroneous government measures to suppress Chinese enterprises."___Paul Wiseman and Zeke Miller in Washington contributed.Load-Date: July 30, 2019End of Document

House Passes King Amendment Targeting China's Abusive Surveillance StateTargeted News ServiceJuly 12, 2019 Friday 7:00 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 777 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyRep. Steve King, R-Iowa, issued the following news release:Congressman Steve King releases these remarks following House passage of an amendment he offered to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that requires the Department of Defense to analyze China's growing surveillance state to determine the threat it poses to American security interests. King's amendment is now included within the House version of the NDAA legislation, which itself passed the House of Representatives on a nearly party-line vote of 220-197 this afternoon."I am encouraged that my amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for fiscal year passed the House of Representatives by voice vote on July 11th, 2019. This important amendment requires the 'Annual Report on Military and Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of China' to include an assessment of (1) China's expansion of its surveillance state; (2) Any correlation of such expansion with its oppression of its citizens and its threat to United States national security interests around the world; and (3) An overview of the extent to which such surveillance corresponds to the overall respect, or lack thereof, for human rights.This matter is one that I have long been attuned to and concerned about, ultimately leading me to draft and introduce the 'Protect American IPR Act', which is H.R. 902 this session, and seeks to stop Chinese theft of U.S. intellectual property through duties on Chinese merchandise. For this reason, I have been encouraged to see President Trump prioritizing the Chinese stealing of American intellectual property.Mass and unabated government surveillance does not only offend individual liberties; in the hands of an authoritarian government, it poses the Orwellian threat of the government always watching, and ultimately using this ability, made possible to an unprecedented extent by modern technology, to spy on, steal from, intimidate and persecute not only those it views as "political enemies" and "threats", but anyone it deems as expedient.This Orwellian threat is becoming a reality, perhaps nowhere more so than in China, where the government vigorously pursues a national video surveillance network. The affinity of the Chinese government to control its population in part by mass monitoring is not a new phenomenon, but advancing technology makes its prospects more frightening every day for those within and outside of the Mainland.One internet privacy expert warns, "What China is doing here is selectively breeding its population to select against the trait of critical, independent thinking". Since China is a neighbor to many and more importantly an actor on the world stage, that erosion will not simply negatively impact the Chinese, it will spread--it arguably has already. A world with continually less critical, independent thought is a prospect to tremble at.It is my strong belief that U.S. policy, including defense policy, should by no measure assist, intentionally or unintentionally, the growth of China's surveillance. Instead, it should discourage the expansion of the Chinese government into the rest of the world, while at the same time encouraging greater human rights for the Chinese people, including expectant mothers and Christians and other religious minorities.I have heard from many individuals who warn against China's rapid expansion and influence into the rest of the world, including Africa and Central America, our nation's own backyard. Although the government-connected interests bring economic promise (and exploitation) to the developing world, they also bring the Chinese surveillance state with them. To counter this very real and growing threat, we need to first understand its scope, its impact for individuals in China as well as those around the world, and the extent to which it threatens the U.S. national security interests."The text of King's House passed NDAA amendment may be read here (https://steveking.house.gov/sites/steveking.house.gov/files/KINGIA062%20NDAA%20Amendment.pdf).Congressman King has also introduced legislation (HR 902) that is designed to provide redress to the holders of US intellectual property who have been victimized by Chinese theft. King's legislation directs the President to impose duties on merchandise from China in an amount equivalent to the estimated annual loss of revenue to holders of U.S. intellectual property rights. The revenue raised by the imposition of duties on Chinese merchandise will be proportionally distributed to provide compensation to holders of United States intellectual property rights.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6787972 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: July 13, 2019End of Document

PROSECUTORS IN CHINA'S SICHUAN PIN 'ILLEGAL BUSINESS" CHARGE ON EARLY RAIN PASTORStates News ServiceJuly 18, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 808 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Authorities in the southwestern Chinese province of Sichuan are investigating Early Rain Covenant Church pastor Wang Yi on charges of "incitement to subvert state power" and "illegal business activities."Wang, who founded the church, was detained by police in Sichuan's provincial capital Chengdu on Dec. 14, 2018 on suspicion of "incitement to subvert state power," alongside dozens of church members in a raid that prompted an international outcry.But while the majority of those detained in the wake of the crackdown have since been released, Wang remains behind bars, even though the statutory investigation period on his case has lapsed, his attorney said in a post to Facebook.The pastor has also had a charge added to his sheet, of "running an illegal business," lawyer Zhang Peihong said.Zhang said the authorities recently turned down a request for a meeting with his client, who has lost weight while in detention, but whose mental state is stable.Repeated calls to Zhang's cell phone rang unanswered on Thursday .A local Christian who asked for anonymity said the "illegal business" charge is likely due to the fact that there is scant evidence to support the subversion charge."They want to charge Pastor Wang Yi with inciting subversion, but even they know that this isn't a very persuasive accusation," the person said. "So they are hoping for a breakthrough using economic [crimes]."Some church members who detained in raids on Dec. 9 and 10 and later released said the police had beaten them, and one detainee described being tied to a chair and deprived of water and food for 24 hours, rights groups reported at the time.According to the New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW), the authorities also ransacked and sealed Early Rain Covenant Church's properties, including offices, a kindergarten, a seminary, and a Bible college, and searched the homes of many of its members.Police also forced church members to sign a pledge not to attend the church again, while the church's accounts on China's social media platform WeChat were removed, it said.Heavy surveillanceAround half of the church's original membership remain under close surveillance by police, according to a Christian surnamed Li."There's nothing we can do," Li said. "Any more than about five or six people gathered together will attract attention ... and if they find you, you will be detained.""Around 50 to 60 percent of Early Rain members are currently under surveillance right now," she said. "Their phones and [social media accounts on] WeChat are being monitored."Church elders Li Yingqiang and Zhang Defu are also under criminal detention on charges of "picking quarrels and stirring up trouble," and "running an illegal business."Wang Yi had earlier published an essay critical of the government's tight control over religion, and calling on China's Christians to resist and peacefully disobey new rules issued by the ruling Chinese Communist Party severely restricting the activities of religious organizations.Xu Yonghai, an elder of the Beijing Protestant house church Christian Saints Love Fellowship, said the Chinese government is increasingly using trumped-up "illegal business" charges to target Christian organizations."This charge makes no sense, because there are no business activities," Xu said. "All the Bibles are given away for nothing. A lot of churches give away Bibles that aren't official publications, so there's no business being run here at all.""A lot of house churches photocopy materials and hand it out for free; who makes money from printing the Bible?" he said.Wang, 46, founded the Early Rain Covenant church in 2008 after several years of political activism that saw him named as "one of the most influential public intellectuals" by the Southern Weekend newspaper in 2004.A graduate the Sichuan University Law School, Wang went on to teach at Chengdu University. He also founded an online forum to study progress in China towards constitutional government.The ruling Chinese Communist Party, which embraces atheism, exercises tight controls over any form of religious practice among its citizens.China is home to an estimated 68 million Protestants, of whom 23 million worship in state-affiliated churches, and some nine million Catholics, 5.7 million of whom are in state-sponsored organizations.The administration of President Xi Jinping regards Christianity as a dangerous foreign import, with officials warning last year against the "infiltration of Western hostile forces" in the form of religion.A crackdown on Protestant churches in the eastern province of Zhejiang has widened and intensified to other regions of China during the past year, church members have told RFA.Reported by Qiao Long for RFA's Mandarin Service.

Chinese pop stars publicly back Beijing on Hong KongAssociated Press InternationalAugust 19, 2019 Monday 12:39 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 919 wordsByline: By JUWON PARK, Associated PressDateline: HONG KONG BodyHONG KONG (AP) - At least eight pop stars from mainland China and one each from Taiwan and Hong Kong are publicly stating their support for Beijing's one-China policy, eliciting a mixture of disappointment and understanding from fans.Many of the statements came after protesters opposed to Beijing's growing influence over semi-autonomous Hong Kong removed a Chinese flag and tossed it into Victoria Harbour earlier this month.Lay Zhang, Jackson Wang, Lai Kuan-lin and Victoria Song were among the K-pop singers who recently uploaded a Chinese flag and declared themselves as "one of 1.4 billion guardians of the Chinese flag" on their official Weibo social media accounts. Wang is from Hong Kong and Lai is from Taiwan.Some see the public pronouncements as the latest examples of how celebrities and companies feel pressured to toe the line politically in the important Chinese market. Yet they also coincide with a surge in patriotism among young Chinese raised on a steady diet of pro-Communist Party messaging.Song and Zhang, a member of popular group EXO, have shown their Chinese pride on Instagram, in Song's case by uploading an image of the Chinese flag last week with the caption "Hong Kong is part of China forever." Such posts would only be seen by their international fans because Instagram, like most Western social media sites, is blocked by the ruling Chinese Communist Party's censors.For over a decade, South Korean entertainment agencies have been grooming Chinese singers to be part of their Korean pop, or K-pop, bands in an attempt to win over the massive mainland Chinese market. Only a few made it to a much-coveted debut. But a number of Chinese K-pop stars - citing unfair treatment - left their K-pop groups to pursue lucrative solo careers in mainland China.K-pop fans reacted swiftly to the avowals of allegiance to China. Some called it shameful, while others were more understanding.Erika Ng, a 26-year-old Hong Kong fan of Jackson Wang, was not surprised by his statement. She said he "values the China market more than the Hong Kong market" because of his large presence in the mainland.Wang, a member of the group Got7, used to carry a Hong Kong flag and wear a hat with the city's symbol, a bauhinia flower. Lately, he has been carrying a Chinese flag on his concert tour and was wearing a China flag hoodie in his music video.Ellyn Bukvich, a 26-year-old American who has been an EXO fan for five years, said many young fans will probably support Zhang and his message because of his status as a K-pop idol."It's spreading propaganda and it's very effective," Bukvich said.The one-China policy maintains that there is only one Chinese government, and it is a key diplomatic point accepted by most nations in the world, including the U.S. It is mostly aimed at the democratic island of Taiwan, which Beijing sees as a breakaway province to be reunited with the mainland by force if necessary.In the case of Hong Kong, a former British colony handed back to Chinese control in 1997, Beijing maintains a "one country, two systems" policy in which the city is guaranteed greater freedoms than those on the mainland until 2047.China's government and entirely state-controlled media have consistently portrayed the Hong Kong protest movement as an effort by criminals trying to split the territory from China, backed by hostile foreigners.International brands - from fashion companies to airlines - have been compelled to make public apologies for perceived breaches of that policy, such as listing Taiwan and Hong Kong as separate countries on their websites or on T-shirts.Zhang terminated his partnership with Samsung Electronics last week, accusing the South Korean mobile giant of damaging China's "sovereignty and territorial integrity."The statement in a Weibo post was prompted by Samsung having separate language options for users in Hong Kong, China and Taiwan on its global website. Both Hong Kong and Taiwan use traditional Chinese characters instead of the simplified ones used in mainland China, and Hong Kong also has English as an official language. Samsung declined to comment on whether it will continue to provide different language options for Taiwan and Hong Kong.It can be difficult to know whether loyalty vows to Beijing are heartfelt or for commercial reasons. The past is littered with examples of celebrities, both Chinese and foreign, who saw their business in China destroyed after the party objected to a statement or an action.In 2016, Taiwanese K-pop star Chou Tzu-yu made a public apology for waving the Taiwanese flag while appearing on a South Korean television show. A Chinese vilification campaign against her led to a backlash among some Taiwanese, who at the time were in the midst of a presidential election eventually won by Tsai Ing-wen, who is despised by Beijing for her pro-independence stance.Public support for Beijing hasn't been limited to pop stars.Liu Yifei, the Chinese-born star of Disney's upcoming live-action version of the film "Mulan," weighed in on the situation in Hong Kong, where protesters have accused police of abuses."I support the Hong Kong police," Liu, a naturalized U.S. citizen, wrote on her Weibo account. "You can all attack me now. What a shame for Hong Kong."Some questioned her motives, wondering if the post was calculated to ensure her film is released widely in China - the world's largest film market. Among Hong Kong protesters, there were swift calls for a boycott of the film when it is released next year.Load-Date: August 20, 2019End of Document

A military crackdown in Hong Kong would backfire on China's economyCNN WireAugust 6, 2019 Tuesday 7:29 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1097 wordsByline: Analysis by Ben Westcott, CNNDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  The idea of China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) on the streets of Hong Kong seemed unthinkable just a few weeks ago. Now it is being considered a possibility.As Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests grow in frequency and intensity, the commander of the city's PLA garrison spoke about the demonstrations for the first time last week, saying that violence "should not be tolerated." Since then Hong Kong has witnessed another five consecutive days of mass protests, which have shut down stores, disrupted air travel and led to clashes between police and demonstrators. The Hong Kong stock market had its worst day in months on Monday. At a press conference on Tuesday, spokesman for China's Hong Kong and Macau Office said the local government and police were "fully capable" of handling the protests.But he said the city was being plunged into a "dangerous abyss," warning "those who play with fire will perish by it."While there has been no indication yet that Beijing is planning to deploy troops to restore order, the fear of PLA intervention has spread through the city and triggered memories of the brutal 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown.But a decision to put PLA boots on Hong Kong streets would be "unimaginably detrimental" to the city and its economy, said Willy Lam, adjunct professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. The stock market would likely crash, followed by the housing market. A mass exodus could follow. Hong Kong's government is legally allowed to request help from the PLA garrison of more than 6,000 soldiers if public order in the city spirals out of control. But given Hong Kong's close ties to mainland China, a decision to deploy them could ricochet through the entire country at a time when the world's second biggest economy is already vulnerable because of the trade war with the United States."Even 100 soldiers in the central business district, if they suddenly appeared on the front page of all major newspapers, it would have a very chilling impact on multinational companies based in Hong Kong," Lam said.Hong Kong's special statusThe former British colony was handed back to Beijing in 1997 but is now run under its own special system of laws that give it greater economic and social freedoms than mainland Chinese cities.That has helped protect Hong Kong's reputation as one of the world's most important financial hubs. It is considered a safe and stable place where foreign companies and investors can operate. Many multinational companies come to Hong Kong to do business in China, while Chinese companies use its stock market to raise capital.Chinese tech giant Alibaba is even mulling a $20 billion secondary listing in Hong Kong after its hugely successful New York listing in 2014. Hong Kong's special status has massively benefited the Chinese economy. It gives the country a way to accept huge investment and commerce from international companies without completely opening its market.In 2016, 61% of China's foreign direct investment, or $82 billion, came through Hong Kong, according to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.But the large protests --- which have attracted millions of people --- have disrupted the city. In June, when the biggest protests started, Hong Kong's retail sales fell 6.7%, according to Chinese state media.Singapore beckons Hong Kong's stock market, the fifth largest in the world by market capitalization, would likely drop sharply as soon as the PLA appeared. That could wipe billions off the value of companies.And given the serious damage to the city's reputation as a place where businesses are more or less free to operate without Beijing's interference, it isn't clear when or if the stock market would recover.In the face of that kind of instability, corporations would begin to reconsider their investment in the city, said Lam, the Hong Kong politics expert. Companies could look to relocate major operations."They wouldn't close their operation in Hong Kong entirely but would move substantial parts to Singapore and make it their regional headquarters," he said. "Large numbers of Hong Kong residents from the middle class ... backgrounds might start emigrating to English-speaking countries."Evidence of an exodus from the city would likely crash Hong Kong's property market, too.That's before any knock-on effects on the Chinese economy --- which has already been slowing --- from the loss of Hong Kong's economic vibrancy and international standing.Some US politicians have even suggested they'd push for an official re-evaluation of Hong Kong's "most-favored-nation" trade status with the United States if the situation grew too dire. That special status gives countries certain trade advantages, including lower tariffs on imported goods, according to the US government.A bipartisan group of US senators introduced the "Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act" in June, which requires an annual check that Hong Kong is autonomous enough "to justify special treatment."Diplomatic falloutPresident Donald Trump said Thursday that he would leave any problems in Hong Kong to the Chinese government. "That's between Hong Kong and that's between China, because Hong Kong is a part of China ... they don't need advice," he told reporters outside the White House.But foreign governments would pay very close attention to any PLA deployment. Partly due to its status as a global financial hub, Hong Kong is a major destination for expatriates from across the world.Hundreds of thousands of citizens of Australia, France, the United Kingdom and the United States could be affected by a crackdown in Hong Kong."The diplomatic and reputational hit to China would be huge if there's another Tiananmen-like incident, because it would be broadcast and live-tweeted to the world," said Ben Bland, research fellow at Sydney's Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank.When the PLA was deployed to the streets of Beijing in 1989 to clear pro-democracy protesters, leading to many deaths, the international community quickly condemned the military action.But Bland said the reaction globally could be even more chilly if the PLA moved again to crack down in Hong Kong."We're in a much more bitter era of entrenched competition between the US and China in particular, as well as China and other Western powers," he said."It would underline for a lot of people that it's almost impossible to do business with China and even live with China."CNN Business' Sherisse Pham contributed to this report.TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

China-Israel trade and investment relations questionedCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 23, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1379 wordsBodyEl Financiero/Leon OpalínTrade relations between China and Israel were established in 1992, started with a bilateral exchange of $50 million, in 2017 totaled 13.1 billion: imports from China from Israel 4.2 billion and exports from Israel to China 8,900 millions; these figures do not include diamond transactions and transactions with Hong Kong. In 2018, Israel's exports to China accounted for 5.5% of Israel's total foreign sales and imports from that country accounted for 5.5% of its total purchases; last year China became Israel's second trading partner, after the US and outperforming the European Union.Israel's economy is very open, facilitating trade and investment with third nations; trade accounts for almost 60.0% of its GDP ($400 billion); in Israel there is no exchange control, corporate capitals and profits can be freely repatriated with the authorization of the Central Bank. However, overall export growth in Israel, 2.2% in 2018, compared to 11.2% of imports, led to a 43.0% increase in trade deficit that year; the strength of the shekel, the national currency, presents a major challenge for shipments from Israel abroad to increase at a higher rate; The dynamic advance in domestic demand also drives imports to the significant increase in basic prices acquired on the international market.Israel's trade deficit of more than $10 billion in 2018 was partially offset by the surplus in the balance of services, including the trade imbalance narrowed to 5.7 billion.In this context, it is noteworthy that more and more companies in Israel are participating in China's broad market. For its part, Israel acquires from China a growing number of goods with high technological value; in 2018, 12.0% of the investments received by Israeli "startups" were from China, several of these investments have been strategic for Israel's development. According to the IVC Research Center, which analyzes business information in Israel's high-tech sector, Chinese investments in Israel have tripled in the last 5 years. Over the past two decades, Israel's economy has stood out as one of the world's leading players in technological development: aeronautics, electronics, telecommunications, software and biotechnology, mainly contributing about 40.0% of the world's GDP; in this regard, it is clear that China "wants to take advantage of the Extraordinary Advance in Technology and Innovation of the Israelis."China's direct investment in Israel reached $16 billion in 2016, with estimates that in the near future it could surpass that of the U.S. as the main source of this type of investment. However, Israeli experts in the field are skeptical that China will significantly increase its share of Israel's economy by virtue of China 's reputation for non-respecting third-party intellectual property laws'; although Israel's Foreign Ministry says Israel's economic relations with China are welcome and should be expanded for the benefit of its economy, security and government officials have alerted them to the risks of investment China not only in Israel, but throughout the region. Government officials justify seeing China's investment with a more critical eye to preserve the country's independence and security and not damage trade relations with the U.S., especially in light of America's growing trade war with China.The Head of the Israel Security Service, (shinbet), Argo Argaman,noted at the start of the year that China's influence in Israel carries risks, especially with its investments in strategic infrastructure and large companies, in particular to Chinese companies that are already building the new port of Haifa and Ashdot and the Tel Aviv city light rail.In 2015 Israel signed an agreement with the Shanghai International Port group that will control the new operations of the New Port of Haifa, it will be for 25 years, starting in 2021. In Haifa, joint exercises are usually anchored and conducted with Israel, the ships of the U.S. Sixth Fleet. The civilian port is being built about 300 km south of the Fifth Squadron of Russia base in the Syrian port of Tartus. In some way, China will turn the new port of Haifa into a kind of military base, which they do not have in the Middle East and increase their espionage capacity.In 2000, Israel signed a $2 billion contract with China for China to acquire the falcon aircraft, but the U.S. lountook Israel to cancel it because the aircraft had military technology; Israel had to pay China a $350 million fine. For the U.S., China's relationship with Israel is not just a trade or investment problem, but a geopolitical issue, the U.S. is afraid that Israel will become the backdoor by which China can acquire knowledge that in the U.S. would not be easy to obtain because of re existing gulons. The Pentagon is very concerned that artificial intelligence knowledge acquired by Chinese companies through civil investments or licensing agreements could lead to a new generation of chinese advanced weapons that would threaten U.S. troops and their allies. In China there is no real private sector, all companies are directly or indirectly controlled by the government.Chinese intelligence is interested in obtaining political, military, scientific and economic information from Israel. Israel has not been immune to Chinese piracy that has penetrated Israeli defense manufacturers and stolen secrets from its more advanced weapons systems. In this regard, among other concerns, is China's close relationship with Iran, which mainly affects both Israel and the US security interests.Israel is obliged to take care of its bilateral relationship with the United States, which emerged from its proclamation as a state in 1948 and which has a privileged character in the areas of defense, security, advanced technology, finance and trade. This relationship has allowed Israel to maintain a decisive military advantage over its regional enemies. In 2016, both nations signed a military assistance package that grants Israel $38 billion to improve its fighter jets, the mobility of its ground forces, and its missile defense system over the next decade.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has already warned Israel that the U.S. would stop sharing "sensitive intelligence data, if it does not react to the threat posed by expanding its cooperation with China. In this regard, it cannot be ruled out that some of Israel's contracts with China must be terminated. Misail Savarts, an Israeli political scientist and journalist, believes that there will be different projects israel will have to cancel on China "if the U.S. continues to push hard," U.S. political, economic and military support has always been more important to Israel than the cooperation with China. Israel will be needed to strengthen control over China's assets "because china's capital should not be allowed to penetrate the Israeli market too much."Israel has already been monitoring foreign investment, particularly Chinese investment, in defenceChina enter in tenders for the Israel Defense Forces. The Finance Ministry also blocked attempts by Chinese companies to buy Clal and Phoenix, two major pension funds to prevent hundreds of billions of dollars and the future of more than a million Israelis from "being at the mercy of the Chinese government" .The energy sector must also be closely monitored by the Government of Israel because China could become a big customer of its gas, with the inherent risk of dependence on China. U.S. Deputy Energy Secretary Dan Brovillett urged Israel to proceed cautiously by enabling Chinese investments in critical infrastructure, which pose not only a threat to Israelis but to the world, their motives "are not pure we have seen in the Middle East and in Africa in particular." Journalist William Galston in turn mentioned "that doing business with China is not the same as doing business with a democracy."Israel needs to bear in mind that the U.S. Senate has criticized it for its growing ties to China; The Trump administration has asked Israel for assurances that China cannot use its projects in Israel to improve its strategic position.The creation of a foreign investment regulator has been continuously in Israel's security cabinet for more than a year; it is urgent to create it." Load-Date: July 23, 2019End of Document

Senate Armed Services Subcommittee Issues Testimony From U.S. Southern CommandTargeted News ServiceJuly 9, 2019 Tuesday 6:20 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 3330 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Senate Armed Services subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities issued the following testimony by Adm. Craig S. Faller, commander of the U.S. Southern Command, at a hearing on implementation of the National Defense Strategy in the U.S. Southern Command area of responsibility:"Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today. I have been in command of U.S. Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) for nearly seven months. In that time I have traveled frequently throughout our area of responsibility, meeting with counterparts and learning about this vital, dynamic part of the world--our neighborhood, the Western Hemisphere."I've been inspired by the many strengths and opportunities of our hemisphere: our cultural and economic ties are historic and enduring. Our relationships are firmly rooted in common interests and the shared values of democracy, sovereignty, human rights, and rule of law. The most disturbing insight, however, has been the degree to which External State Actors (ESAs)--China, Russia, and to a lesser extent, Iran, and North Korea--have expanded their access and influence in our neighborhood. Each actor engages in a wide array of concerning, potentially destabilizing activities, blurring the lines of what constitutes a traditional "military threat" through economic coercion, the systematic stealing of technology, pernicious disinformation campaigns, and malicious cyber activity. With every inroad they make, they gain additional opportunities to interfere with our security relationships, undermine our efforts to reinforce international norms, and potentially hold our interests at risk."As the National Defense Strategy recognizes, the principal problem facing the Department of Defense is interstate strategic competition with China and Russia. I believe an important element of this involves competition for values, ideas, and ideals. In Latin America and the Caribbean, this competition is also taking place in parallel with another competition: one between legitimate governance and illegitimate power wielded by transnational criminal organizations and violent extremist organizations. These groups threaten citizen safety, regional security, and the national security of the United States and our allies and partners. This region is the largest source of illicit drugs and illegal migrants to the United States. Rule of law is under constant assault by illicit networks that engage in bribery, coercion, and violence that disrupt legitimate economic opportunities. Their illegal activities in turn provide fertile ground for ESAs--particularly China and Russia--who capitalize on the opportunities provided by weak institutions and corruption to expand their influence. We see this most acutely in Venezuela, where Russia contributes to propping up the corrupt Maduro regime in return for increased access and leverage, but this practice is widespread. Enormous sums of Chinese cash, coupled with murky conditions on loans and business deals, have the potential to exacerbate the region's corruption problem."Where threats are transregional, multi-domain, and global--like ESAs--the United States must renew focus on our neighbors and our shared Western Hemisphere neighborhood."Our strong partnerships, rooted in shared values, provide us with an advantage that no competitor can match. Continuing to increase security and stability in this hemisphere will expand opportunities for legitimate trade and investment for the United States and our allies and partners. Working with our partners to address shared challenges and threats--including weak governance, corruption, transnational criminal organizations, and the flow of illicit drugs--not only increases the security of our homeland, it decreases the ability of malign actors to exploit this region at the expense of our shared interests."I look forward to discussing the nature of ESA activity in detail, how we're working with partners to address them, and what we need to maintain our competitive edge."China. China poses a significant long-term threat. While the military problems it poses are most acute in the Indo-Pacific region, China has nonetheless turned its attention to the Western Hemisphere, quietly accumulating unprecedented levels of influence and leverage."China is now inside our own neighborhood seeking to displace the United States as the partner of choice and weaken the commitment of our partners to the rule of law and democracy."Economic engagement. China's increasing access is enabled by economics. As in other parts of the world, China is adept at leveraging its economic instruments of power to achieve its strategic interests, often in ways that can undermine the autonomy of countries: corrupt practices, non-transparent and excessive loans, restrictions on market economies, and potential loss of control of natural resources. China's aim is to become the region's largest investor and creditor."China plans to increase trade with the region to $500 billion by 2025. With 19 nations in the region now participating in the One Belt One Road Initiative and pledges of at least $150 billion in loans, Beijing is translating this economic heft into political influence. It is the single largest creditor of the Maduro regime, saddling the Venezuelan people with more than $60 billion in debt and providing financial lifelines that have helped keep Maduro in power."Access. On the maritime front, China has significantly increased its naval deployments to the region, increasing its regional port calls by 70% over the last five years. Chinese companies currently have over 50 active port projects in the hemisphere, and planned investments will more than double the amount of ports where China has a presence. In the future, China could use its control of deep water ports in the Western Hemisphere to support global military deployments."Particularly concerning is China's effort to court Panama and exert control over key infrastructure associated with the Panama Canal. Hong Kong-based company Hutchison Whampoa operates ports on either end of the Panama Canal, and the Chinese government has aggressively invested in Panama's infrastructure, security, and telecommunications systems."China recently completed three infrastructure projects valued at $1 billion, and is slated to complete five more projects this year worth over $2.5 billion."Data protection. China's telecommunications investments and access to space tracking facilities in the hemisphere place military operations, intellectual property, and private data at risk. Chinese firms like Huawei and ZTE have aggressively penetrated the region with telecommunication projects in 16 countries, providing the backbone of commercial and government communication systems for most of the region. As we've seen elsewhere, Huawei's 5G systems presents significant national security concerns. Because of the intimate relationship between Chinese businesses and China's National Intelligence Law,1 we have significant concerns that any data transiting China or processed by Chinese companies is at risk to access by the Chinese government. If governments in Latin America and the Caribbean continue to gravitate toward using Chinese information systems, our ability and willingness to share information over compromised networks is likely to suffer."Surveillance technology and authoritarian systems. China is also increasing sales of its surveillance technology through its "Smart and Safe Cities" initiative. What seems like a good idea--technology to help improve safety in crime-ridden areas, for example--may come with substantial hidden costs. Citizens living in democracies in the Western Hemisphere could potentially have their entire digital identity under the surveillance of an authoritarian government. Beijing has a long track record of controlling information and suppressing dissent within China, and is now exporting these tools to the region's authoritarian leaders, as we've seen in Venezuela with the new "fatherland" card--created by ZTE--that Maduro uses to monitor citizens and dole out scant resources to his loyalists.2"Security cooperation. China uses weapons sales and donations and security services' training (similar to our IMET program) to improve security cooperation and offer an alternative to U.S. military training. It has donated equipment to our partners in the region and provided anti-riot gear the Maduro regime uses to suppress protests in Venezuela. Additionally, China's "no strings attached" approach to security cooperation and economic relationships presents a challenge to Inter-American values of democracy, sovereignty, human rights, and the rule of law."Unlike the United States and our allies, the Chinese government places no demands on their partners to implement governance reforms, protect human rights, strengthen institutional accountability, or play by the established rules. China has zero interest in advancing these values; instead, it often attempts to undermine them as part of its long-term strategic goals that include support in international fora and access to mineral wealth."Sovereignty threats. China undercuts regional sovereignty and international norms through the widespread practice of illegal fishing in the exclusive economic zones (EEZs) of countries such as Argentina, Ecuador, and Chile. When our partners have attempted to enforce rule of law, Chinese flagged vessels have responded aggressively, endangering the lives of sailors and coast guardsmen in the region. Although it has pledged to designate all variants of fentanyl controlled substances, China's capacity and will to stop illicit shipments has been uneven. The vast majority of fentanyl flowing into the United States still originates in China, with many of the precursor chemicals needed to produce fentanyl illegally trafficked into Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean via regional drug dealers and corrupt Chinese businessmen."Russia. In contrast to China's long-term strategic approach, Russia seeks to be more of a "spoiler" in the region by attempting to disrupt or undermine U.S. engagement. Russia seeks to sow disunity and distrust, propping up autocratic regimes in Cuba, Bolivia, Venezuela, and Nicaragua, which are counter to democracy and U.S. interests."Disinformation. Moscow continues to use Latin America and the Caribbean to spread disinformation. As we've seen elsewhere in the world, Russia floods the internet, social media, and television outlets with original and reproduced propaganda, using RT-TV and Sputnik Mundo to employ a "fog of falsehood" designed to disorient audiences. These state-run media outlets allow Russia to discredit, slant, or outright fabricate stories about the United States, our partners and allies, and our role in the region. Russia also supports it authoritarian cronies through propaganda and other information-related tools, providing positive media coverage of its autocratic allies, papering over repression and socioeconomic inequity in Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua."Shows-of-force. Russia's deployment of two nuclear capable bombers to the Western Hemisphere last year, and its most recent deployment of its most advanced warship (an ADM GORSHKOV-class frigate) are intended as shows of force to the United States. While aimed at us and the region, this message is also aimed at Russia's domestic audience, as part of a broader effort to distract from internal issues and endemic corruption. In addition to its regular deployment of intelligence collection ships, Russia has also deployed underwater research ships to Latin America capable of mapping undersea cables--information it could use to cut critical lines of communication during a future crisis."Security cooperation. Latin America and the Caribbean is a major market for Russian arms sales, and Moscow continues to make inroads into traditionally US-dominated training activities. Since 2009, Russia has sold nearly $9 billion in military equipment to Venezuela, including combat aircraft, tanks and Surface-to-Air-Missile systems (SAMS). In March, Russia inaugurated a helicopter training center that can train up to 300 Venezuelans on Russian-made aircraft, allowing the Venezuelan military to increase its combat readiness. Since 2012, security officials from nearly all Central and South American countries have received Russian CN training. These engagements, combined with Russia's Counter Transnational Organized Crime Training Center (CTOC) in Nicaragua, potentially provide Moscow with a regional platform to recruit intelligence sources and collect information."Support to authoritarianism. Russia uses the sanctuary of its robust relationships with traditional allies--Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela--to gain a foothold close to our homeland, and enable destabilizing activities by like-minded, authoritarian governments. Russia has successfully pursued simplified port access agreements in Nicaragua, and is establishing joint space projects with partners in the region, such as Cuba, which it could eventually leverage for counter-space purposes in the event of a global conflict. The Cubans and the Russians remain the main foreign supporters of the Maduro regime, with both malign actors providing security advisers and Cuba embedding numerous personnel in Venezuela's armed forces and intelligence services. As tensions increase with Russia in Europe, Moscow may leverage these longstanding partnerships to maintain asymmetric options, including forward deploying military personnel or assets."Iran. Iran remains the most significant state sponsor of terrorism around the world. Iran has looked to reenergize its outreach in Latin America and the Caribbean in recent years. The Iranian Threat Network, to include Lebanese Hezbollah, maintains an established logistical, facilitating, fundraising and operational presence in this region that can be quickly leveraged with little or no warning in a contingency. Many of these Hezbollah networks cache weapons and raise funds, often via charitable donations, remittances, and sometimes through illicit means, such as unsanctioned drug trafficking and money laundering. Last September, Brazil arrested a Hezbollah financier in the tri-border area near Paraguay and Argentina, and in recent years Paraguay, Peru, and Bolivia have arrested multiple Hezbollah-linked suspects. Having a footprint in the region also allows Iran to collect intelligence and conduct contingency planning for possible retaliatory attacks against U.S. or Western interests."North Korea. Although not as significant a threat as other ESAs, we remain concerned that Pyongyang could use its small presence in the region to collect intelligence or conduct contingency planning. Given its efforts to generate revenue and history of working with supporters like Cuba to circumvent sanctions, North Korea is likely engaged in some form of illicit activity in Latin America."Outcompeting ESAs. Outcompeting China and countering other ESAs requires a whole-of-government approach, of which the military plays a small but important role. Strong partnerships--enabled by engagements and presence, intelligence and information exchanges, and education and training--are our primary bulwark against the influence of malign actors in the hemisphere and are bolstered by our work together on military professionalism."Engagements and presence. We have to be on the playing field to compete. The same presence that strengthens our partnerships sends a powerful signal to Russia, China, and others that the United States is committed to the region and to the security of our neighborhood. Key leader engagements, high-profile visits, multinational exercises with visible U.S. presence, and our wide array of security cooperation, training, and capacity-building demonstrate meaningful U.S. commitment. We appreciate efforts by the Congress to recognize the need for consistent presence and focused attention on this hemisphere. In recent years, Congress has generously provided funding for additional air and maritime platforms, as well as intelligence capabilities that enable USSOUTHCOM to strengthen our partnerships throughout the region. During my recent posture hearings before the Senate and House Armed Services Committees, I witnessed bipartisan support for reinvigorating our relationships within our neighborhood and USSOUTHCOM is postured to work side-by-side with our partners to advance the security of this hemisphere against all competitors."Information &#38; intelligence sharing. For our part, we are increasing cooperation with partners to better understand, expose, and counter the malign activities of Russia, China, Iran, and their authoritarian allies. We are also working more closely with other U.S. combatant commands and the Joint Staff to ensure that globally integrated plans and operations are informed by threats and opportunities in this hemisphere, as well as continuously improving the quality, frequency, and depth of our intelligence exchanges."Education and training. Additionally, our work with partners to reinforce the hemisphere's substantial, but incomplete, progress in human rights is even more critical in light of Russia and China's own disregard for human rights. USSOUTHCOM's Human Rights Initiative--which just celebrated its 20th anniversary--has conducted more than 200 human rights engagements that have enhanced the ability of partner nations to build professional forces that have legitimacy in the eyes of their populations."As I have discussed in previous testimony, the Department of State's security assistance programs--like International Military Education and Training (IMET) and Foreign Military Financing (FMF)--are strategic game changers. Education and training for partner nation personnel facilitate mutual understanding of our values, doctrine, and cultures, while building life-long friendships that enable strong partnerships despite political shifts or changeovers. This understanding allows us to operate with our partners more effectively, while strengthening shared values. Since 2009, IMET has provided opportunities for over 55,000 students from the region to attend schools like the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation (WHINSEC), the Inter-American Air Force Academy (IAAFA), and the Inter-American Defense College (IADC). While China and Russia have made inroads in equipment sales, our partners still prefer U.S. equipment, which offers the "total package" approach that includes training, maintenance, and sustainment. Just like U.S. military-to-military partnerships, U.S. equipment is built to last. We also appreciate the support of Congress on our security cooperation programs that enable us to build these partnerships.Conclusion"Chairwoman Ernst, Members: I'll end with a final observation. External State Actors offer the region many things (not all of them benign), but the United States takes on the hard challenges--helping our partners develop leaders, agencies, and institutions. Our partners in the region want to work with us, train with us, learn from us, and fight alongside us."They share our vision of a safe, prosperous, and secure neighborhood. The right, focused and modest investments in this hemisphere yield a solid rate of return for the United States, in the form of capable partners that contribute to our shared security, and reduced opportunities for inroads by External State Actors. Thank you."* * *Footnotes:1 China's National Intelligence Law provides that "any organization or citizen shall support, assist, and cooperate with state intelligence work in accordance with the law, and maintain the secrecy of all knowledge of national intelligence work."2 Assistant Secretary of State Kimberly Brier, Remarks on China's New Road in the Americas: Beyond Silk &#38; Silver, April 26, 2019.[Category: JED][TheHill]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6784072 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: July 10, 2019End of Document

Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, July 17th. Your top stories right now, 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.Big technology under fire this morning, Facebook's proposed crypto currency came under attack yesterday on the Hill and the conversation continues as lawmakers demand more regulation of tech giants, Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple, questioning if they need to even be broken up.Markets this morning are flat, take a look at futures indicating a higher opening for the broader averages. Now we're looking better here, but it's been back and forth in negative and positive territory.DOW futures up 15, SMP futures up two points and the NASDAQ futures up by 10. Yesterday the record run took a pause, take a look at the market's performance at the close yesterday where the DOW is down 23, S&P was down 10 points and the NASDAQ lower by 35.In Europe this morning, markets are edging lower, take a look. FT 100 down 17, (inaudible) in Paris down eight and the DAX index in Germany lower by 17. In Asia overnight trade fears drove markets down across the board, it was a fractional move.There is China trade uncertainty continuing, President Trump saying that there is still a long way to go before a deal happens between the U.S. and China. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross joined me earlier this morning saying that U.S. enforcement capability of any agreement made is a big ticket to any deal.Earnings to focus on Wall Street this morning, Back of America beat on earnings and revenue, take a look at the stocks. This morning profits rising on loan growth, meanwhile in the pre-market, Abiave (ph) is down a fraction at $28.95, but IBM and Netflix are higher.They are reporting after the bell tonight, and as you can see the numbers are higher going into those reports. Netflix up $1.63, that's one half of one percent. We'll bring you the analysis coming up before those numbers come out.Then Beyond Meat lifting Blue Apron, the addition of the meat substitute cooking up big numbers for the food delivery services, I'll tell you about their partnership. All those stories coming up this Wednesday morning and joining me to break it all down CFRA Investment Strategist Lindsey Bell, former Home Depot CEO and Chrysler CEO Bob Nardelli, and former Ohio state senator, minority leader and American University School of Public Affairs executive in residence Capri Cafaro.Thanks so much for joining us this morning. Good to see everybody.ROBERT NARDELLI, FORMER CEO, HOME DEPOT: Been a great two hours.BARTIROMO: Yes, it's been a lot happening because it's always a busy period when earnings are coming out and we're right now at the beginning of the second quarter reporting season, Lindsey.LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA: Right and the numbers have been coming out pretty good, 85 percent of companies have reported to date have beat on the bottom line, 75 percent beating on the top line.Sales estimates by the way going into the quarter, 3.7 percent top line growth was the expectation, which is pretty low. It's a big deceleration from the last several quarters and I think that could be a big surprise, it's the upside which some benefits.BARTIROMO: But the analysts are looking for a decline in earnings for this quarter, right?BELL: Yes, looking for a decline of two percent.BARTIROMO: But you're a little more positive than the consensus.BELL: Right, so the consensus estimate is for a decline of two percent, I think we're going to come in better than that. They always come in better than that. So I think we'll see about two to 2.5 percent positive growth for the second quarter.Third quarter has come down to just under a one percentage point decline, that'll probably see more pressure. And then the fourth quarter, we're looking for almost seven percent earnings growth, which definitely I think is a little bit out of whack right now.BARTIROMO: So a nice bounce back by the end of the year. Joining the conversation this morning, Georgia Senator David Perdue is here. We will talk with Senator Perdue momentarily. Equity International founder and chairman and real estate billionaire investor Sam Zell joining us as well and the host of "Varney & Co." Stuart Varney weighing in also.Don't miss a moment of it, we've got a big hour right now. And we kick an hour off right here with big tech on the hill this morning, executives from Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook, all grilled in the House and Senate yesterday.Blake Burman is live at the White House this morning with more. Blake, good morning to you.BLAKE BURMAN, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Maria, good morning to you as well. It's not going to end there, because here we go again for Facebook later today as that company will get the chance once again to try to defend its plans to get into the crypto currency space as the head of Calibra will appear before the House Financial Services Committee later today. Yesterday that project drew immense scrutiny from members of the Senate Banking Committee, for example the Democratic senator from Ohio, Sherrod Brown, says that he's concerned it could become the next uncontrollable house fire for that company.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. SHERROD BROWN (D-OH): Facebook is dangerous. Now, Facebook might now intend to be dangerous, but surely they don't respect the power of the technologies they are playing with. Like a toddler who has gotten his hands on a book of matches, Facebook has burned down the House over and over and called every arson a learning experience.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURMAN: The Senate Judiciary Committee also raised it's concerned with the major tech companies about issues of censorship and anti-trust. Google said that it competes for searches with Yelp, Amazon, and Travelocity while Facebook noted Snapchat but lawmakers were skeptical.[08:05:00](BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MATT PERAULT, HEAD OF GLOBAL POLICY DEVELOPMENT, FACEBOOK: Many of our competitors are sitting here at this table with me.REP. HANK JOHNSON (D), G.A.: I think you're in a unique chair, in a unique position among those who are seated at the table.PERAULT: There may not be an identical competitor to Facebook.JOHNSON: Well I'd like to - off line I'd like to get a list from you so that I can do some shopping around myself.(END VIDEO CLIP)Maria, Yesterday President Trump also threw his support behind the idea from the billionaire tech investor Peter Thiel that the FBI and the CIA should investigate Google to see whether or not that company has been infiltrated by Chinese intelligence.In a statement yesterday, Google said it does not work with the Chinese military. Maria.BARTIROMO: All right, Blake, thank you so much. Blake Burman with the latest there. Joining me right now is Georgia senator, a member of the Senate Budget, Banking and Armed Services Committees David Perdue.Senator Perdue, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thanks for being here.SEN. DAVID PERDUE (R-GA): Morning, Maria.BARTIROMO: So can you really say that flat out, we do not work with the Chinese military when in fact the company is working with Chinese companies, state owned companies, the Chinese government.And isn't their number one priority their military?PERDUE: Well I lived over there, Maria, I've worked in China as one of your guests has - Mr. Nardelli there over the last few decades. And I can tell you this, if you work with any Chinese company, you're working with the Chinese government.I mean they are so vertically integrated, I spent a day with Jack Ma at Alibaba last year and you can see that the data and all of the things that they're working on are all, you know, vertically integrated with the PLA as well as the government.So I don't - I don't think any U.S. company can say that they're not working with the Chinese government unless they've done the study and review to make sure they're not doing that.BARTIROMO: Well especially since Bob Nardelli, the Chinese military is the priority of the Chinese government. You know, I mentioned civil military fusion a minute ago, and that is because any innovation that comes into the Chinese government, first it is tested if it's going to work in the military because they're main goal is to be the number one superpower militarily.PERDUE: Yes there's no question. I mean the senator said it right, any time we went over to China, you're always going to Beijing, you're always meeting with the government first if you want to, you know, invest in a business, if you want to create a business.The senator knows that extremely well from his experience also. So it's totally transparent. I mean you're dealing with the government to deal with any business over there, whether we were making cars or whether we're selling locomotives or power systems, you're dealing with the government.BARTIROMO: But once you understand that, Senator, you have to come up with another way to understand how the U.S. is going to work with China, right? I mean like this trade deal, the president commented that a deal with China is not any time soon, it's going to take a long time in terms of getting this done.So how should we look at China given the fact that they want to beat us in everything, including becoming the number one superpower?PERDUE: Well two things, Maria, and if you look at the made in China 2025, the Chinese mentality is such, it goes all the way back to Confucius and General Sun Tzu that they don't tell you what they're going to do unless they've decided that you don't have the wherewithal or the will to stop them.And that's why I have to give President Trump all the credit in the world, the first president in the last five that has done anything to stand up and ask for a level playing field.What President Trump is asking for is to stop stealing our technology, stop the forcing of technology comply with the WTO, give us equal access and stop the cyber war. I mean it's as simple as that. But it's going to take a while to negotiate on this.BARTIROMO: The Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross was on with us earlier, here's what he said about that just a few minutes ago.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Is it fair to say it's probably a long time before we actually see deals here? What do you think, Secretary, where are we?WILBUR ROSS, COMMERCE SECRETARY, TRUMP ADMINISTRATION: The fundamental question now though is will they go back to the point where we were before they change their mind and backtracked on some of the understandings that had been reached.BARTIROMO: Do you have any optimism or encouragement that they are planning to stop the theft of I.P.? Isn't that one of the big ticket items? Real quick.ROSS: Well the big ticket items are the structural reforms, the theft of I.P., the unlevel playing field and procurement, the subsidies, all those. But there's another in some ways even bigger issue and that is what is the U.S. enforcement capability in the event that they violate the agreements.BARTIROMO: Right.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: So, the enforcement has been talked about. You've mentioned that as well, Senator. I got to get your take real quick before we leave this trade conversation because we want to get to the budget. Do you think USMCA is going to come to the floor?PERDUE: Well I certainly hope so. It's certainly a dramatic improvement over NAFTA. Both sides, if it went to floor of the House we think it would pass right now, we knew it would pass the Senate.BARTIROMO: Yes, but what if it doesn't? Do we have plan B sir?PERDUE: Well, not right now. I mean it's up to Nancy Pelosi. I mean the Speaker needs to put this on the floor. The American people really want this deal.BARTIROMO: Capri.CAPRI CAFARO, FBN ANCHOR: Senator, Capri Cafaro here.[08:10:00]CAFARO: And I want to get your take on what's happening with the budget negotiations between Speaker Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin. I understand that you are not in favor of a potential one-year continuing resolution, but it seems to me that we might be on a collision course here.We have Democrats that look to be unwilling to either have a short-term deal or cut spending, and we have, you know, obviously the end of the fiscal year looming - September 30 - and we have - we're coming up against the potential of having to raise the debt ceiling. So what do you see happening here? And speaking of plan Bs, you know, do - is there a plan B if we can't get a deal on the budget and we try to avoid a CR?PERDUE: Capri, thank you. That's the question of the day here. Look, I am very encouraged that Secretary Mnuchin and Speaker Pelosi are dealing one-on-one. That was a breakthrough a week ago. They've made great progress. I'm hopeful that we're very close right now on the numbers.Look, this is what's at stake here. If we go to a one-year CR, the military is devastated. We've done it 186 times over the last 45 years since the Budget Act was put into place in '74. It's a draconian impact. It causes expenses in military to go up dramatically.So the small differences that we have right now in domestic spending and in military spending are small in comparison to the increases costs this will cause the military over the next decade.Now, here's the other thing that's ridiculous about this. We're talking about $1.3 trillion on the discretionary party of the budget. We spend $4.6 trillion in the federal government. It's time that we start dealing with the mandatory expenses of social security, Medicare and Medicaid, pension benefits of federal employees, and the interest on the debt that's gone up dramatically over the last two years.BELL: Senator, Lindsey Bell here. Just on that point, the budget deficit, we've had a deficit for a very long time going back to the 1960s. There's only been two times where we've had a surplus. It was the late 60s and then late 90's and early 2000s. Does the deficit even matter at this point?PERDUE: Well, of course it matters at $22 trillion. There's $60 trillion of sovereign debt in the world. We're 5 percent of the world's population. We have one-third of the sovereign debt. You know, I think it's about 20 percent of the sovereign debt out there today is at negative interest rates, Lindsey, as you guys know, so this is a period of time with four balance sheets of central banks at the largest they've ever been,It's a very concerning time right now. It's an uncharted terriority, but I can tell you this. The bond markets are not going to continue to support this sort of explosive growth in our debt. We've added $450 billion of interest expenses in the last two years in the nine Fed fund rate increases. And so, it's time that we deal with it, and we can deal with it. The resources are here to do it. We don't have to cut social security, but we can save social security who's trust fund goes to zero in 14 years and Medicare's trust fund goes to zero in 7 years.Look, we can't hide from this any longer. That crisis is rushing at us like a freight train right now. Thanks for the question, Lindsay.BARTIROMO: And you think you can save them. Your op-ed in The Defense Times say that the U.S. military is going to pay the price if no budget deal is reached at a time when you've got all these new threats across the world, right?PERDUE: Well, that's exactly right. China doesn't have this problem, Russia doesn't have this problem, and right now China's spending - if you adjust for purchasing power parity, they're spending about the same amount as we are on their military.And so, right now we can't afford to do this to the military. Last year was the first time in a decade, Maria, that we actually got the government's funding for the military without having news of continuing resolution. It causes expenses to go up dramatically. Recap, rationalization, and also readiness, it just destroys those efforts that we're trying to rebuild the military right now.BARTIROMO: Yes. Senator, it's great to have you on the program. Thanks so much.PERDUE: Thanks.BARTIROMO: Senator David Perdue joining us there in Washington. Coming up, going above and beyond, another restaurant giving the green light on the Beyond Meat burger. Where you can find the new meatless menu coming up. And then the world's wealthiest, Bill Gates knocked off his post as the world's second richest person in the world. We will tell you who snagged his spot coming up. Back in a minute.(COMMERICAL BREAK)[08:15:00]BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens has passed away. Cheryl Casone with headlines now. Cheyrl -CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS HOST: That's right, Maria. A statement from the Supreme Court says that Stevens died of complications from a stroke. The Navy veteran was appointed by President Gerald Ford back in 1975. He served through 2010.President Trump offered condolences saying, quote, "his passion for the law and for our country will not soon be forgotten. He was known for his humbleness and his faith in the law." Justice Stevens was 99-years-old.Well, investors are watching Bank of America this morning after the company reported record second quarter earnings. What a report. Net income from consumer banking climbed 13 percent. Consumer banking loans rose 6 percent. Adjusted revenue coming in at $23.23 billion. CEO Brian Moynihan said that they are seeing solid consumer activity across the board. There are the estimates and there are the actual numbers for Bank of America.Well, LVMH's billionaire boss, Bernard Arnault is - Arnault - excuse me - is now the world's second richest person. The Bloomberg Billionaires Index showed a jumped in LVMH shares, and that pushed Arnault's net worth to $108 billion. Yes, with a B. That puts him ahead of Microsoft Co-Founder, Bill Gates, by more than $200 million. Arnault has added nearly $40 billion to his fortune this year alone. Not bad, Maria.BARTIROMO: Big numbers there, Cheryl.CASONE: Good lord, $108 billion. I can't even imagine where I'd be -BARTIROMO: Yes.CASONE: - but it'd be somewhere sunny.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: Coming up, the rise of the meatless menu - Beyond Meat burgers launching new restaurants nationwide today. We'll tell you where you can find them. That's coming up. And then Prime problems, why Amazon is seeing a spike in cancelled accounts following its annual shopping event next up right here.[08:20:00]BARTIROMO: Prime problems -- the number of Amazon users canceling their prime accounts are spiking following the retail giant's annual shopping event. New data from search intelligence firm, CAPTIFY reveals people signed up for Amazon Prime to browse deals then immediately canceled their membership. Meanwhile CEO Jeff Bezos posted this picture of himself standing on Amazon's spheres after the two-day event thanking Prime members and Amazon workers. There he is. What a great two days it must have been as these sale days become more prevalent. Bob, your take on Amazon right now.NARDELLI: It is like having a Black Friday in the middle of the year.BARTIROMO: Yes.NARDELLI: And I'm not surprised. I mean when I was at Home Depot, we'd sell a ton of TVs before the Super Bowl. It's amazing how many of them didn't work after Super Bowl.BARTIROMO: How funny.NARDELLI: They would come back. So people would take advantage of it. It doesn't involve anything to sign up, they get the deals and then why continue. You know it's a small fee but why continue?BARTIROMO: Well and all these other retailers are having to compete too.NARDELLI: They are.BELL: You know Walmart, Target, everyone jumping in on this deal, and it's kind of interesting because it is moving some of the sales more to the middle of the year instead of being that fourth quarter as you know, heavy weighted towards revenue.CAFARO: Do we know much Amazon Prime profits actually make up for the totality of how much Amazon makes when you think about the general, sort of, retail cycle where people make so much of their money around the holidays for example. Is this shifting that?CAFARO: Yes.NARDELLI: It's a lot. I mean even if you look at Costco they make it more on membership is what provides the profitability for Costco than actually the retail sales. It's an interesting model.BARTIROMO: How about the rise of the meatless menu Beyond Meat burgers launching nearly 4,000 Tim Horton's restaurants across country this morning. It comes as Blue Apron stock soared yesterday after announcing a partnership with Beyond Meat. Obviously Blue Apron has gotten killed recently but it was up 35 percent on this deal. The whole meal subscription company up on -- on doing a deal with Tim Horton. As you can see, the stock had a great day.BELL: Well yes, the Blue Apron thing is pretty interesting. I mean they've had to do a lot to kind of really make themselves relevant and build their customer base back up so they're doing all these different deals. I think Weight Watchers, they have a deal with too so they had to do stocks but their stock was under.CAFARO: Well they were one of the first in the marketplace when it came to these, you know, meal kit subscription boxes. Blue Apron was one of the first.[08:25:00]They're out there and now there is so much more competition with Plated and even things like Purple Carrot which is specific for vegan and vegetarian so I don't - I don't think it surprising that Blue Apron as well as some of these other fast-food chains that are having to compete with many fast casual restaurants that you know can deliver more healthy product that I think is more friendly to today's consumer trends so I think .NARDELLI: Yes, I'm not a big user of it. I don't .BARTIROMO: Do you eat - that's what I was going to say.CAFARO: Me neither.BARTIROMO: But does it taste good? I like the veggie burgers but I think some of these burgers, it's - it's less vegetable and some chemical. So that's the only thing I'm - I'm ..BELL: Right and the calorie count is still the same. I mean I like meat so I'm going to just go ahead and have a beef burger.NARDELLI: A beef burger.CAFARO: If you're going to go for it, go for it.NARDELLI: Five Guys and a burger right?BARTIROMO: We're going to talk real estate when we come back. We are awaiting the June housing starts and building permits data that's going to come out momentarily. We'll have the numbers after the break and then we'll get into real estate. Then Ion Earnings streaming Netflix and tech giant IBM set to report after the bell tonight everything you need to know coming up. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Wednesday morning everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, July 17. Your top stories right now just before 8:30 a.m. on the East coast. Breaking news on housing. We are awaiting housing starts and building permits for the month of June. We'll have the numbers as soon as they hit the tape and we're taking a look at the housing market and where it is headed now. As we await the numbers take a look at futures that are pretty much at the high of the morning with the Dow futures up 16 points, the NASDAQ up 11.25 and the S&P 500 futures up 2 points right now. After yesterday's record run took a pause, yesterday markets were lower across the board with the Dow down 23, the S&P down 10 and the NASDAQ lower by 35.In Europe this morning, the European indices right now are lower across the board. As you see the FQ 100 down 14, the CAC down 9 and the DAX index lower by 20 points.[08:30:00]In Asia overnight, trade fears drove markets there as well lower. As you can see, fractional losses, but pretty much across the board. President Trump says there is still a long way to go for a deal with China. Commerce Secretary, Wilbur Ross, telling me this morning that structural reform's needed - are needed and U.S. enforcement capabilities important to have any deal across the finish line.Building permits are out and they are $1.22 million. That is below the $1.300 million we were expecting. Once the starts are also a little lower than the estimates. Let's get right to Lauren Simonetti. She's got the breaking news right now on housing starts and building permits. Lauren -LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN HOST: Both numbers weaker than expected, Maria. Housing starts coming in at $1.253 million for the month of June. The expectation was for $1.261 million, so that's a decline of 0.9 percent month-over-month.You gave the permits number. I will put some perspective behind it. The expectation was 1.3 million. 1.22 million units was the number, so both of these for June weaker than expected. Is the housing market going to continue to be a drag on economic growth? We're looking at a 30-year fixed rate mortgage of 3.75 percent. That National Association of Home Builders relatively confident, and the thinking is as mortgage rates continue to move lower maybe this will boost some of the optimism we can be seeing in the housing market, but right now this report worse than expected.I'm also seeing that the May numbers were revised it looks like a little bit to the - a little bit higher, but I will continue to look into that for you. Maria -BARTIROMO: OK. All right, we'll get back to you -SIMONETTI: Yes.BARTIROMO: - as you see any new information in those numbers (ph), Lauren. Thank you so much. No real impact on markets this morning, but joining me right now to talk more about housing and real estate in general is Equity Group Investments Founder, Chairman, and real estate billionaire investor, Sam Zell. Sam, great to see you.SAM ZELL, EQUITY GROUP INVESTMENTS FOUDNER AND CHAIRMAN: Good morning, Maria. How are you?BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. What was your reaction? I know this is just a month and it's residential, but your take on what we're seeing in the housing market today?ZELL: Well, I think that, you know, the housing market today reflects the fact that people are reticent to commit. People are reticent to take long- term responsibilities. They're also, you know, particularly in the starter home side affected by student debts and other debts that make their ability to effect purchase and put down a down payment more of a challenge.Having said that, $1.22 million - I mean, you know, $1.22 million versus $1.3 million is hardly anything worth jumping up and down about it, and I know you guys are in the business of -BARTIROMO: Yes.ZELL: - in effect making news -BARTIROMO: Tick-by-tick, but yes, you're right.ZELL: - yes, but the reality is overall it's not either a disaster or a success.BARTIROMO: What do you want to say about the office market right now? In terms of commercial real estate, how would you characterize it?ZELL: I think the office market today is in a very unique place. The creation of all of these, for lack of a better word, temporary office facilities I think has weakened - dramatically weakened the credit of the office-building business.You know, the reason people invested in office buildings was because it gave them long-term credit exposure and effectively were leasing and creating enormous percentage of office space to non-credit tenants that sooner or later is going to be a very difficult scenario to deal with.BARTIROMO: Well, how do - how do rates fit in to all of this? I mean, mortgage REITs raised $6.2 billion in equity to increase their investment portfolios last year according to The Journal, and you've got - I know mortgage rates having come off the lows.ZELL: Well, but the fact that they raised whatever it is, $6 trillion in mortgages, frankly, you know, all that means is that they're easily providing refinancing capability for the industry. So I don't think we're looking at a shortage of capital, but I also don't see any significant positive, and I see a lot of supply coming on.BARTIROMO: A lot of supply coming on. Well, that's -ZELL: Yes.BARTIROMO: - something to focus on. What's your take, broadly speaking, of the backdrop in terms of the economy right now?[08:35:00]We're having this conversation every day about the Federal Reserve.ZELL: Yes.BARTIROMO: Now we're preparing for a rate cut in two weeks - July 31. It could be as high as 50 basis points according to Rick Rieder from BlackRock who was with me last week. Characterize the backdrop for us.ZELL: Well, I think that, you know, we're looking at an environment that is very puzzling for everybody. I'm very involved in real estate, but I'm also involved in a lot of other areas, and I've been studying them, looking for signs that the game's changing, the game's over, et cetera, et cetera and not seeing it.BARTIROMO: You can't find them.ZELL: And when we had a couple of, you know, bad employment reports and then we had a good one. You know, we had one of our companies, you know, six months ago alerted me that, gee, what looks like future bookings are going to be down. And I said, "aha, we finally - you know, finally got the sign."(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: Right.ZELL: And then I had lunch with the CEO last weekend. He said, "oh, everything is terrific. That was just a blip and we don't -"BARTIROMO: Unbelievable.ZELL: So you know, everybody would like to know what the answer is.BARTIROMO: Yes.ZELL: I'm the first one to tell you I don't know.BARTIROMO: So what happens when the Fed cuts rates in two weeks?ZELL: Nothing.BARTIROMO: Does it - does it stimulate the market in any way? Does it stimulate the housing market?ZELL: No. I think that the biggest thing that cutting rates will do - I mean, look. Rates are preposterously low.BARTIROMO: Right. What happens when more room - do they have to do anything frankly?ZELL: So - well, but what is - what is lowering rates below the inflation rate do? Not a lot of good stuff.BARTIROMO: Yes.ZELL: And generally speaking, I'm not a big fan of very low rates. I think very low rates discourage decision making. And our economy is predicated on a sense of urgency. We achieve things because we have a sense of urgency. When a cost of capital is as low as it's been, that sense of urgency disappears and the overall economy, it doesn't jump. It frankly weakens.BARTIROMO: It's a good point that sense of urgency moves people to action, right?ZELL: Yes, well you've got to make a decision.BARTIROMO: Sorry, right.ZELL: If you don't - if you can afford not to make a decision, you got another option.BARTIROMO: Right. You can stay with cash (ph).ZELL: Now, when the cost of capital is 10, you look at your watch every minute and say, "I better make a decision."BARTIROMO: Yes.ZELL: When the cost of capital is 2, "I'll wait till tomorrow."BARTIROMO: I have time.ZELL: Time.BARTIROMO: Yes.ZELL: And that, you know, ripples out throughout the whole economy.BARTIROMO: You've been allocating capital in interesting ways away from real estate in waste industry, certainly international, so how do you want to allocate capital? What can you tell our viewers about what you see in, for example, the emerging markets or in Europe right now?ZELL: Well, I have not been an investor in Europe for a long time. I'm still not an investor in Europe. You know, when you are an investor, you're basically gauging future demand. You know, will there be demand for what I'm investing in and maybe superior demand allowing price to go up?BARTIROMO: Well, zero percent a hard time growing (ph). No growing.ZELL: To say the - well, great cheese, great wine, great castles.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: Right, right.ZELL: You know, I mean, I go there on vacation. It's wonderful.BARTIROMO: But you're not going to be putting money there?ZELL: But I can't find anybody there who wants to work. So yes, we've stayed out of Europe. I mean, look at where they're - I think there's 30 some odd countries in the E.U. 17 of them have negative demographic growth. Well, if the number of people - BARTIROMO: Wow.ZELL: - at the end of the year is less in more than half of the E.U., where is the demand going to come from?BARTIROMO: That's a really good way of putting it actually.ZELL: I mean, I don't know how to explain it in any other way.BARTIROMO: Do -ZELL: Outside of Europe, you know, the siren of the emerging markets is always there because it may not be profitable, but there's growth, and every optimist believes that if there's growth you can figure a way to profitability. I'd say my own experience has been that we've been very successful and very unsuccessful using the same standards for investment, so it's a challenge, but the fact that there's growth means that at least if you get the methodology right you've got the engine to make that valuable.[08:40:00]BARTIROMO: You - let me take you back to the U.S. because -ZELL: Yes.BARTIROMO: - you've invested in the waste industry.ZELL: Yes.BARTIROMO: Tell me where the growth is there.ZELL: Well, I mean, let's put it a different way. You know, the answer is that there may be lowering of demand in a lot of other areas, but I think trash is probably at the bottom of the list. I think that, you know, we're very - we're the largest provider of waste energy facilities I think in the world -BARTIROMO: Wow.ZELL: - where we're - basically our raw material is trash. And the amount of trash decreasing and landfills are being eliminated, so I'm just a supply-demand situation. It's an arena worth playing.BARTIROMO: You know, in the face of all of this while you're looking for growth and investing alongside that and you've got an economy that feels good, there's this infighting going on in Washington, and it looks like -ZELL: You noticed?BARITORMO: Yes. It looks like 2020 in this upcoming election is being set up as capitalism versus socialism, President Trump versus these progressive Democrats. The House voted to pass a resolution condemning President Trump's recent tweets singling out four congresswomen that measured on largely along party lines with only four Republicans joining democratic colleagues.The singled-out Democrats, of course, they're referred to as The Squad. They weighed in on a feud with President Trump and their relationship with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Watch this. They were on a competitive network. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)REP. RASHIDA TLAIB (D), M.I.: I'm dealing with the biggest bully I've ever had to deal with in my lifetime and trying to push back on that and trying to do the job that we all have been sent here to do which is centered around the people at home. This is a distraction.REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D), N.Y.: Our teams are in communication. Our chiefs are -UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: But shouldn't it be a face-to-face? I want to know if you are speaking -TLAIB: She's the new member, not the Speaker.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No, but -TLAIB: She has every right to sit down with her in any moment, any time with any of us. She is Speaker of the House. She can ask for a meeting to sit down with us for clarification.(END VIDEOCLIP)BARITROMO: Well, she wants - Nancy Pelosi wants clarification. Instead, these four women are just tweeting it or talking about it and bringing all of the dirty laundry out into the public.ZELL: Well, one of them was just talking about the fact that she's never been bullied as much in her whole life -BARTIROMO: Yes, I don't know - I didn't understand -ZELL: - and all I know is that these four women represent bullying. So and we've got a situation that's relatively out of control. We have a president who I think would do better if he was a little more restrained. I think we have congressman who are not showing the respect to the office of the presidency. Forget about the fact they may or may not agree with this specific presidency.This same group of people 10 years ago had there been the same accusations about Bill Clinton as an example, where were they?BARTIROMO: Yes.ZELL: There wasn't anybody, you know, taking the other side then. So I think we have a dysfunctional situation. There is no - there is not right answer. There is no wrong answer. Everybody needs to stop focusing on being victims and stop - and start focusing on how do we make America work better for everybody.BARTIROMO: As a businessman looking for the right policies to move things forward and actually see growth, the policies so far have worked in terms of the economic policies.ZELL: I think the economic policies have been - have produced very positive results so far -BARTIROMO: And yet -ZELL: - despite all the noise.BARTIROMO: - The Squad won't admit that. I mean, The Squad wants Medicare for all. They all, you know, the Green New Deal, et cetera.ZELL: They've proposed a whole bunch of ideas, and none of those ideas have come with a balance sheet explaining how they're going to finance it. So until somebody comes up with ideas that are financeable and potentially viable, it's hard to, other than if you're reporter, waste a lot of time on those subjects.BARTIROMO: Have you decided as a business person who you're going to get behind in the 2020 election?ZELL: No. I don't - it - this particular stage that is not high on my list -BARTIROMO: Yes.ZELL: - of things I need to worry about.BARTIROMO: Well, we'll see. This is - the socialist conversation is pretty scary frankly.ZELL: Yes, I mean, I - you know, what was it, Margaret Thatcher who said that, you know, when I asked when socialism will end her answer was when you run out of other people with money to spend.BARTIROMO: Exactly. Sam, thank you.ZELL: My pleasure.BARTIROMO: Sam Zell will be my special guest this weekend on Wall Street. We'll be right back. Stay with us.[08:45:00](COMMERICAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We're going to show you the tweet that President Trump just put out. He just wrote this. "Big rally tonight in Greenville, North Carolina. Lots of great things to tell you about including the fact that our economy is the best it has every been. Best employment and stock market numbers ever. I'll talk also about people who love and hate our country - mostly love." Tonight at 7 p.m. the president has another rally in Greenville, North Carolina.Meanwhile this, a new survey is shedding light on the financial woes of millennials. Joining me now, the host of Varney & Company, Stuart Varney, to weigh in on that. Good morning Stu.STUART VARNEY, VARNEY & COMPANY HOST: Maria, I'm not going to go on a rant about the younger generation.(LAUGTHER)I will never say, "get off my lawn." I simply report this to you.BARTIROMO: OK.VARNEY: TD Ameritrade says that one in five millennials, 20 percent of millennials, expect to be financially reliant on their parents into their 30s, OK. How about that? No, I'm not going to say these youngsters today. I'm not going to say that because, I mean, I can understand you got student loans around your neck and it's very hard to get a mortgage these days, so I do understand.My point here is now we can understand why free stuff is so attractive to the millennial generation. After all, if you're getting free stuff from your parents way into your 30s, why don't you get free college and free medical care from Uncle Bernie? You can understand why it's attractive.I think that this attitude towards money on the part of the parents has influenced millennials politics. One last one, Maria.BARTIROMO: Yes.VARNEY: Most of the parents in the survey found it embarrassing if their children stay on the parental payroll past the age of 27, so it's our fault. That's what I'm saying.[08:50:00]BARTIROMO: All this free stuff, Stu. Is there any conversation about who will pay for it?VARNEY: No, of course not. Good lord. Do you ask your parents where they got the money from when they donate to you? No, you don't ask about that, so they're not.BARITROMO: There you go. Stuart, now you'll have a lot more about that in 10 minutes. We will see you then.VARNEY: Sure will. You got it.BARTIROMO: Varney & Company begins top of the hour, 9 a.m. Eastern right after Mornings With Maria joins Stuart next. But first, we are watching earnings, streaming giant Netflix and tech giant IBM will report after the bell tonight. We're going to take you live to the trading floor for a preview of the numbers and tell you what to look at for when those numbers are released, back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, Netflix is the story we're talking about tomorrow. It's reporting earnings after the bell tonight. Gerri Willis on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with some details. Gerri, good morning to you.GERRI WILLIS, FBN ANCHOR: Good morning to you Maria. That's right, Netflix shares trading higher here, expectations for earning .56 cents a share revenues, expected to come in at 4.93 billion. That will be after the bell tonight. The big worry here what everybody's watching of course are subscribers. The company has all ready said that they will have five million new subscribers, that is a slow down. And the big worry of course here is that the company is losing ground against an increasing long list of competitors, including Disney, Hulu, Amazon Prime, you name it. Apple, Warner, NBC Universal lots of people coming into that category. Meanwhile, IBM will also be out after the bell, expecting to come at $3.07 a share, $19.16 billion in revenue, that's the expectation. Shares are higher here, they have had several quarters of declining revenue. Watch for that revenue line, that is a critical thing. The company's betting on that red hate acquisition to fuel results. They all ready have a multi-billion dollar deal with AT&T after the red hat acquisition. We'll be watching how well they do in the hybrid crowd - cloud that is, Maria back to you.[08:55:00]BARTIROMO: All right Gerri, thanks so much. We'll be watching as well. Gerri Willis there. Speaking of Netflix, the streaming wars are on and your sons have a new series debuting on Amazon.NARDELLI: They do, thanks Maria, yes we'll be premiering it at Comicon Friday and Saturday night. We got a panel also, but more importantly it will also open up on Amazon Prime Friday night.We're excited about being with Jeff on Amazon Prime streaming content.BARTIROMO: So your sons are directors, this is Michael and Tim Nardelli.NARDELLI: Yes, directors, actors, editors.BARTIROMO: That's fantastic. You must be very proud.NARDELLI: You know, it's - I'm very proud of both the boys.BARTIROMO: The series is called "Dark Web". Have you seen it?NARDELLI: I have, it's an eight part episode, so if you want to binge, you can do that starting Friday night. But it's a wonderful series. Obviously I'm very, very, very proud of both sons.BARTIROMO: Isn't that great? We could look at the streaming wars from your side which is - your sons' side and that is as content creators.NARDELLI: Yes.BARTIROMO: So we'll be watching. "Dark Web", check it out. We'll take a break, when we come back, final thoughts from this all star panel. Stay with us.Welcome back, it's going to be a lower opening this morning. Let's get some final thoughts from this all star panel, Lindsey Bell.BELL: Well I'm looking for second half outlooks, because I think there's going to be some pressure as these companies report and we get through second quarter earnings. So I think Q2 is going to be great, second half be weary.BARTIROMO: It's all about the guidance. Bob.NARDELLI: Yes, great content today, a lot of the guests talking about a strong economy, very encouraging to all of us, particularly consumers and investors.BARTIROMO: It's pretty incredible how many people still see a very strong economy, even with the rate cut happening in two weeks.NARDELLI: Yes, a lot of great work by the administration.BARTIROMO: Bob. Capri.CAFARO: I just want to say thank you for the opportunity to spend some time - spend three hours with all of you and I've learned a lot in the last three hours and certainly will be continuing to keep my eye peeled on the trade issues in Washington.BARTIROMO: All right, that's what we're concentrating on as well. Lindsey Bell, Bob Nardelli, Capri Cafaro, thanks very much for joining us. Have a great day everybody, "Varney & Co." begins right now. Stuart take it away.VARNEY: Yes it does, good morning, Maria and good morning everyone. OK so headline.[09:00:00]Load-Date: July 17, 2019End of Document

Analysis / China aims to lead 5G technology and 4th Industrial RevolutionCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 21, 2019 WednesdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 928 wordsBody   By: Victor Alvarez R. / Davgla Rodríguez A.@victoralvarezr/@davroalvarez  The Guiyang InternationalBig DataExhibition was held in China's Guizhou    Province in May  2019.In recent years, this region has experienced a great expansion and has attracted numerous technology firms that have settled there to locate its gigantic computer servers. Guizhou is transforming into China's Big Data Valley, competing with America's legendary Silicon Valley.The Chinese government attaches great importance to the development of the big data industry and for the age of 6 has managed to position this increasingly crowded and successful exhibition internationally. In April 2019, a month before the International Big Data Exhibition, the government fostered an alliance between Huawei and  China Unicom - China's second largest cell phone   operator    -, to launch the 5G tests in seven cities, which were joined by 50 other technology companies. Today, more than 200 members are expanding coverage of this technology to 33 other cities.     FromTen years ago, Huawei, the globalleader in telecommunications, has invested $2 billion in the development of 5Gtechnology. Today it has its own operating system for its cell phones, Hongmeng, which  is compatible with Android apps.El 5G will change the world  .5G technology has become a powerful driving force in China's national development strategy. It willnot only bring greater connectivity and speed, but an economic and social revolution.The Chinese government has licensed China Telecom, China Mobile, China Unicom and China Broadcasting Network for commercial use and have these large corporations complement their capabilities and resources to advance the development of a next-generation information infrastructure. Its fast and secure connection will provide opportunities to drive the growth of China's digital economy. It will even allow technological revitalization in traditional industries that were in decline.The new internet will change everything from virtual reality in 3D, to automation and autonomous driving, to the dissemination of home automation as a set of technologies applied to the control and intelligent automation of housing to achieve a efficient use of energy as well as cordless control of the home.In a few years radical innovations will be common in homes, companies and institutions that now seem to us to be science-fiction, such as remote-controlled surgical operations and virtual reality television broadcasts thanks to the stability of 5G wireless connections.A long and patient path to technological learningSince economic reforms initiated in 1979, China has been through a long process of technological learning. From being a country questioned for copying products and processes from others to compete with low-quality and low-priced products, based on its own learning process it has made scientific and technological advances that have allowed it to reach thetechnological frontier in many sectors where it now exceeds the products and processes it previously copied.The Chinese government offers tax and financial incentives for investment in science and technology, subsidizes cutting-edge industrial investment, and advances the creation of 15 innovation centres to be opened in 2020, amounting to 40 centres by 2025. The development of state-of-the-art technologies through intensive investment in scientific research and technological development is making China one of the most patent-pending countries.Gone are the times to copy, henceforth China intends to invent, innovate and patent to lead the 4th Industrial Revolution (4RI). Key sectors for China include biotechnology, genetic engineering, nanotechnologies, neurotechnologies, robots, drones, 3-D printers, artificial intelligence, energy storage, smart grids and the Internet of Things or interconnection appliances and physical objects over the internet.The4th   Industrial RevolutionIn the economic sphere, China coexists and competes with the Western world. Economic rivalry with the West has spurred growing changes in the structure of its economy and prepared it to make the most of the 4RI that is radically changing the means of production through innovation, automation, artificial intelligence and smart factories.The Chinese Government has selected ten sectors in which it intends to be at the international forefront of technological development, these are: new advanced information technology, automated machine tools and robotics, aerospace and equipment aeronautical equipment, maritime equipment and high-tech ships, modern rail transport equipment for the New SilkRoad, electric car and other vehicles and equipment with new forms of energy, alternative energy equipment and renewables, agricultural equipment, development of new materials, biopharmaceuticals and advanced medical products.In the heat of the 4RI underway, production and service automation is happening at high speed and will impact global geopolitical security. The convergence of computational, digital, physical and biological technologies will, as never before, affect the labour market, types of work, university careers, new sources of wealth, income distribution, power ranking economic and even American military supremacy. All of this largely explains the U.S. government's trade war against China, whose undercover goal is to disrupt, hinder and stop China's relentless advance and consolidation as the leading powerhouse of 5G technology and the 4RI and have to consolidate it as the new powerglobal economic stake.      Load-Date: September 2, 2019End of Document

China has made major progress on air pollution. Wuhan protests show there's still a long way to goCNN WireJuly 11, 2019 Thursday 2:16 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1064 wordsByline: Analysis by James Griffiths, CNNDateline: HONG KONG (CNN) BodyHONG KONG (CNN) --  When world leaders arrive in Beijing, the city typically lays on beautiful blue skies. It's a sign of the Chinese capital's ability to control its notorious smog when it needs to. It's also indicative of the progress China has made in tackling air pollution in recent years, both by shutting down and upgrading elderly factories and passing new restrictions to tackle emissions. That's seen Beijing fall out of the top 100 most-polluted cities in Asia in recent years, with overall pollution levels 10% lower across Chinese cities between 2017 and 2018, according to a report by Greenpeace and AirVisual. Shanghai, the country's largest city and financial capital, has also made environmental advances, such as adopting stringent recycling regulations. At 146 globally on the AirVisual list, Wuhan, in northeastern China, is not among China's most polluted cities, but residents aren't taking any chances. Recent weeks have seen major protests there -- in themselves a rarity in China -- over plans for a new garbage incineration plant.Holding banners with slogans such as "we don't want to be poisoned, we just need a breath of fresh air," thousands of people took to the city's streets over two weeks in June and July calling for the suspension of plans to build the plant. "We are fearful that the plant is too close to residence area," one protester in the city of 10 million people told state media. Others expressed concern that emissions could worsen air pollution and harm residents' health. Local officials were apparently surprised by the scale and size of the protests, which came after several similar waste plants were reportedly found to be giving off dangerous emissions. Photos and videos shared on social media showed large crowds marching in the streets near where the plant was to be built, and police arresting numerous protesters. The government has since suspended building of the plant, which locals said had halted protests, but a heavy police presence remains in the city where the situation is tense. Smoggy successSince 2008, China's government has expended a huge amount of energy and money in addressing the country's air quality problems. And in 2014, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang declared a "war on pollution," which he described as "nature's red-light warning against the model of inefficient and blind development." While China's smog issues are nowhere near solved -- the country is still home to a large number of urban hubs battling air pollution issues -- there are signs of improvement. Neighboring India, meanwhile, now has a far worse problem on its hands, with 22 of the 30 most polluted cities, according to the Greenpeace/AirVisual report. That's partly because the Indian government has not faced significant civil unrest around this issue. Public pressure has been the driving force of pollution policy in China, and it shows no sign of letting up. In 2016, protesters took to the streets of Chengdu wearing face masks to demand action to tackle smog, while other demonstrations have targeted power and chemical plants in Sichuan, Jiangsu and Heilongjiang provinces in recent years. Only worker unrest, which has remained a pervasive problem, is a more consistent cause of mass action. But the government faces an uneasy balancing act: it needs to handle the public's environmental concerns, while avoiding taking action that would slow growth, all the time dealing with an economy that has grown rapidly and often without the safety and emissions standards people are now demanding. Ordinary Chinese people, however, are painfully aware that the central government can issue all the enlightened policies it wants, but that does not mean they will be implemented locally, or escape being undermined by corruption and vested interests.Pollution protestsDespite considerable progress, there remains geographic divide in environmental standards in China. Of the top 20 cities with the worst air in China, almost all are in central or western China, with only one, Xuzhou in Jiangsu province, on the wealthy east coast. The cities are generally located in poorer and less developed region than China's main coastal hubs -- this leaves them more vulnerable to the type of corruption and corner cutting that prevents regulations being fully implemented.According to Caixin, a leading Chinese investigative magazine, "glaring falsifications and outright corruption persist in some of China's fundamental environmental monitoring data." Citing government reports and whistleblowers, Caixin said the privatization of environmental testing operations since 2015 had led to "chaos," with testing not carried out, done poorly, or companies purchasing bills of good health when they should have failed checks. Around the same time that report was released, the government announced investigations into more than 12,000 officials and 18,000 companies for lax enforcement or abuse of environmental standards.This could explain why protesters, such as those in Wuhan, are unwilling to believe officials when they say plants will meet modern safety and emissions standards. In a rare state media report on the Wuhan protests, tabloid Global Times said that part of the issue "was related to insufficient communication between the government and the public.""Analysts also noted that emissions monitoring along with a lack of transparency in sharing emissions data with the public helped stir complaints," the paper said. The Chinese government is highly sensitive to the threat of protests like those in Wuhan, with the shadow of the 1989 Tiananmen massacre looming large. Calls for collective action are among the most censored subjects online, and people organizing protests or working for civil society groups can face harassment and imprisonment. But while people may be willing to put political concerns aside for the sake of economic growth, they are not prepared to take risks with their children's health for GDP. The government knows this and has made a concerted effort to reduce air pollution. For many, however, particularly those far from the capital, not enough is being done. And in Wuhan thousands showed they would rather defy police batons and potential imprisonment than choke on bad air.CNN's Nanlin Fang contributed reporting from Beijing. TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

International Federation of Journalists: China - Wife of Australian Writer Blocked From Leaving BeijingTargeted News ServiceJuly 15, 2019 Monday 7:13 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 532 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: BRUSSELS, Belgium BodyThe International Federation of Journalists issued the following news release:The wife of a detained Chinese-Australian writer has been interrogated by Chinese officials and denied from leaving China. The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) urges Chinese authorities to respect individual's rights and requests the Australian government to do more on the case.According to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), Yuan Xiaoliang, the wife of a former Chinese government official and turned author, Yang Hengjun, was taken by a group of Chinese Ministry of State Security officers on the morning of July 7. Ms Yuan had been preparing to speak to the broadcaster before scheduled plans to leave the country when she was detained. She was reportedly questioned for two hours and denied from leaving the country.Earlier this year Ms Yuan's husband, Yang Hengjun, was reported missing during a visit to China as he attempted to board a flight from Guanzhou to Shanghai on January 19. He has since been held for nearly six months without access to a lawyer. According to the ABC, Mr Yang had previously criticized the Chinese regime and pointed this to be the reason for his detainment.Yang Hengjun is allegedly being held on "suspicion of endangering national security" and is understood to be held in "residential detention", though his location, health and circumstances remain unknown.Ms Yuan has repeatedly urged the Australian government to pay more attention to the rights of its citizens. The writer's wife had been hiding in a village fearing government retaliation and was scheduled to speak to the ABC the day she was detained. Her lawyer Rob Stary called on the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs for assistance, but said officials declined to provide consular assistance on the basis that she was Australian permanent resident, not a citizen. Ms Yuan is apparently now safe.On April 9, the Media Entertainment &#38; Arts Alliance (MEAA) sent a letter to the Chinese embassy and to the Australian Foreign Affairs Minister, Marise Payne, raising concerns that Yang was being deprived of his human rights, without trial or access to legal counsel, as well as being denied access to his family. MEAA said Mr Yang is a journalist member and "respected author and online journalist and blogger."MEAA said: "His interrogation and secret detention, casts a shadow over the working relationship of Australian journalists in China and calls into question their being able to perform their journalistic duties in safety and without harassment or intimidation from authorities."The IFJ said: "Yuan Xiaoliang's denial to leave China and her husband, Yang Hengjun's ongoing detention without charge is a serious violation of human rights and the longer it continues will create pressure for the Chinese authorities and China's image abroad. Ms Yuan has also tried in desperation to speak to the media about her concerns for her husband and the lack of action by Australian authorities on the matter. We strongly urge the Australian government to exercise every effort to secure the release of the couple back to Australia."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6790526 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: July 16, 2019End of Document

THE AGE OF DIGITAL GEOPOLITICS & PROXY WAR BETWEEN US AND CHINAIPS - Inter Press ServiceJuly 29, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 IPS - Inter Press Service/Global Information NetworkLength: 1253 wordsByline: Annegret Bendiek, Nadine Godehardt, David SchulzeDateline: BERLIN, Jul 29 2019 BodyThe geopolitical significance of key digital technologies now takes centre stage in a new global conflict between the US and China. The dispute over the Chinese technology group Huawei exemplifies this situation.Â The US government perceives the Chinese telecom equipment provider as the Trojan horse of a hostile regime that stands for fundamentally different values. That's why the US insists to show China its limits. But this extends far beyond a traditional American 'containment' approach. Instead, the US now pursues an 'up to here and no further' policy towards China.We can detect this in an entire series of recent decisions. They include the signing of President Donald Trump's executive order on 15 May 2019 to secure information and communication technology and service supply chains; adding Huawei to the sanctions list of the US Department of Commerce on 16 May; and including four more Chinese companies in the supercomputer industry on 21 June.This basically amounts to an embargo on Chinese companies in the area of critical key technologies. The Chinese government strongly objects to such protectionist measures and interprets the exclusion from the US market as a hostile act directed primarily against its economically and technologically successful development.As a result, the confrontation between the US and China over Huawei has taken on a strongly geopolitical dimension. It's emblematic of a fundamental break with the underlying rationale of a market economy and shows how foreign policy is deliberately conducted by economic pressures.To many, the convergence of markets no longer appears to be an opportunity for prosperity, but increasingly looms as a threat to public safety. Digital geopolitics is on the rise.What's digital geopolitics?The notion of digital geopolitics brings together two opposing trends in international politics. On the one hand, digitalÂ geopoliticsÂ is based on the power politics of territorial units - for example, nation states such as the US and China or regional actors such as the European Union.On the other hand,Â digitalÂ geopolitics involves decentralised transnational networks that consist of the connectivity between non-state actors and multinational companies, platforms, hubs, content and infrastructures, extending beyond politically fixed territorial units.Neither of these developments is new, but they are often discussed separately. What's new, however, is the increasing entanglement of these two trends, as is seen in the case of Huawei. This also reveals how power and order increasingly lie at the heart of digital geopolitics. Therefore, they require particular attention on our part.The EU is well aware of its economic and technological dependence on China. For the EU, as for Europe as a whole, there's the danger of being crushed between the two superpowers. European trade, economy, and production chains are inextricably connected to both Chinese and US technologies.Unlike the US, however, Europe already has Huawei technology installed in its 4G mobile networks. In the future, this will most likely also be the case for the expansion of the 5G network.The EU's connectivity policy for Asia, released in September 2018, includes the goal of building constructive and fair EU relations with China. However, in March 2019, the EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Federica Mogherini, published a strategy paper that unexpectedly revealed areas of tension within the relationship.Although China is still seen as a partner for cooperation and negotiation, the EU explicitly classifies the country as an economic competitor and system rival.The EU is dependent on ChinaUnaffected by this sceptical assessment of the relationship - a perception also supported by the difficult negotiations between European leaders and China at the EU-China summit in April 2019 - certain member states are independently seeking closer contact with Beijing.In March 2019, Italy was the first of the G7 countries to sign a Memorandum of Understanding to participate in the New Silk Road project (Belt and Road Initiative, or BRI). Thus, the Italian government has circumvented the attempt of other large member states to negotiate participation in the BRI initiative as a European bloc, rather than bilaterally.The EU is well aware of its economic and technological dependence on China. Industrial policy, market access and data protection are central conflict lines in EU-China relations. However, the EU has recently decided against excluding Chinese companies from the internal market.China has been deemed culpable for a multitude of cyber espionage incidents against European information and communication structures. Nevertheless, the close security cooperation with the US, including NATO, could lead to economic decoupling.The bottom line is that Europe's reconciliation of interests with China can only be successful across the EU and not across the individual member states.The military use of 5G mobile networks or cyber sabotage incidents against digital infrastructures in Europe would provide significant momentum for pursuing strategic autonomy vis-Ã -vis China.In extreme circumstances, such a scenario could lead to a global, technological form of trench warfare, in which any social and technical vulnerability would be avoided because of it might be a potential gateway to security risks. A world economic crisis and massive global arms race would be the result.Divide and ruleIf, in the areas of cybersecurity and Industry 4.0, the EU fails to establish lasting cooperative structures to build security and trust with China, then a second, equally negative, scenario of a worldwide 'collapse of digital commons' seems plausible.Global challenges such as securing social peace and creating social justice under the (labour) conditions of digitisation are not addressed in this scenario. The EU also continues to accuse the Chinese authorities of pursuing an industrial policy that systematically promotes national subsidies to private and state enterprises to give their own producers a competitive advantage at the global level.Conversely, Chinese companies and direct investment in Europe have an easy time because of technological dependencies. Member states are still pursuing only the idea of a 'Europe of independent nations,' while the single market is becoming the site of a technological proxy war between the US and China.Political action is focused solely on cyber defence. Similar to the global financial crisis, the inability to regulate engenders political irresponsibility.Prosperity and stability on a regional and global scale are crucially dependent on adherence to common minimum standards in IT security, norms regarding states' conduct in cyberspace and the development of joint mechanisms.In this context, it seems necessary to have strategically relevant foreign and security policy objectives in a comprehensive digital policy, especially at the EU level with regard to China. This can also be negotiated within the framework of the new EU connectivity strategy with China and other Asian partner countries.The bottom line is that Europe's reconciliation of interests with China can only be successful across the EU and not across the individual member states. The EU with its Digital Single Market can, as Wolfgang KleinwÃ¤chter writes in theÂ Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, set an example of a 'global multi-stakeholder pact for the protection of the public core of the Internet.'Load-Date: July 30, 2019End of Document

Good morning, everyone, thanks for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, it is Thursday, July 18th, your top stories right now, just before 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast.President Trump takes on the left last night, in a big way. At his rally last night, he slammed the squad and also weighed in on the economy. We've got all the highlights from the rally last night, from President Trump.Netflix is losing subscribers, the first decline in the United States in nearly a decade, the stock taking a bit hit this morning, it is down 11 percent. Futures also lower, take a look at the futures, indicating a lower opening for the broader averages today, Dow Industrials down better than 50 points, as we await another big group of earnings.Morgan Stanley, the one to watch this morning, ahead of the opening bell, we've got all the numbers and full analysis, getting you ready for the earnings period.Then U.S.-China trade talk trouble, reports this morning that disagreements over Huawei are bringing the negotiations to a halt. MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.And we've got a big show this morning, coming up, my exclusive interview with Kentucky senator and Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, this morning, the CEO of SAP, Bill McDermott, exclusive this morning, to talk business of cloud storage, reporting earnings this morning, as well, we've got a sense of Europe, and the co-founder of Home Depot, NYU Langone Health, Board of Trustees member, Ken Langone, on healthcare in America, don't miss a moment of it. We've got a big show this morning.Joining the conversation this morning is FOX Business Network's Jackie DeAngelis, RealClearPolitics co-founder and president, Tom Bevan, and PWC Partner Mitch Roschelle, great to see everybody this morning.JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT: Good morning.MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC: Good morning.TOM BEVAN, CO-FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT, REALCLEARPOLITICS: Good morning.BARTIROMO: So, big news, over the China talks, according to the Wall Street Journal, it was Huawei and issues around Huawei that kept these talks to a halt.BEVAN: Yes.ROSCHELLE: I'm not surprised, I mean, clearly, it's a -- it's a fulcrum issue in the negotiations and their only leverage right now is to keep bringing it in because if you couple those things together, you can't move forward, and the president wants to move forward as quick as he can.BARTIROMO: And that came up last night. The president sounding off at the rally last night, he was in full campaign mode during the rally in North Carolina, discussing a wide range of issues, including the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, the four congresswomen known as, the squad. He talked about 2020 and the economy.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Leaders coming from other countries, prime ministers, presidents, kings, queens, dictators, sometimes, I hate to say it, dictators, and they all start off by saying, Mr. President, I'd like to congratulate you on the incredible economy that you've created, the greatest anywhere in the world, by far.The leading voices of the Democrat Party are left-wing extremists, who reject everything our nation stands for. Omar has a history of launching vicious anti-Semitic screams.CROWD: Send her back! Send her back! Send her back! Send her back!TRUMP: And Tlaib also used the F-word to describe the presidency and your president, that's not nice, even for me. Representative Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez, she's conducted outrageous attacks against men and women of law enforcement.So, Representative Ayanna Pressley, she thinks that people with the same skin color, all need to think the same. And tonight, I have a suggestion for the hate-filled extremists, who are constantly trying to tear our country down. They'd never have anything good to say. That's why I say hey, if they don't like it, let them leave, let them leave, let them leave.A vote for any Democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of the American dream, frankly, the destruction of our country.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: And the crowd is going wild. This -- it's getting -- this is getting deeper, this divide, Tom.BEVAN: You know, there's been this discussion over whether this was a calculated move on Trump's part or not to, sort of, start this configuration with his tweet on Sunday. Whether it was or whether it wasn't, it's amazing how this has blossomed into the framework for 2020. He's leaning into it, the Democrats and the squad are also leaning into it.And so, this is the battleground over which is going to be fun. Now, Trump has, sort of, reframed it, instead of go back, it's like, you know, if you're -- if you don't like America, you can leave, that issue is going to resonate with a lot of folks around the country. It's now an issue.The elections now, it's about socialism versus capitalism, but it's also about patriotism. Do you love this country? And Trump obviously feels this is -- feels this is a winner for him. And so, we're going to see more and more of this as the campaign goes on.BARTIROMO: How about -- how about this Republican who's trying to unseat AOC, which I thought was a great businesswoman and Jamaican immigrant, Scherie Murray, now running to unseat AOC in her own district.BEVAN: Yes.BARTIROMO: Does she have a shot, I mean --BEVAN: Well, no. but, I mean, it's a tough district for Republicans running, but again, you know, AOC won with -- won her primary with 14 percent of the vote. She'll get a challenger now, but it's a heavily Democratic district.ROSCHELLE: The issue is, can this candidate bring up the Amazon situation and rally people in New York about all those lost jobs, because AOC's got DNA at the crime scene in terms of Amazon taking off.BARTIROMO: That's a good point. Yes, that's true. And that is all those jobs.ROSCHELLE: All those jobs --BARTIROMO: A lot of people --ROSCHELLE: Overlapping the Congressional district.BARTIROMO: And then there's Netflix earnings, the stock is down big, this morning, down 10-1/2 percent, the streaming giant lost a significant number of subscribers in the U.S., first time, in nearly a decade. The company is blaming the downward trend on its lack of second-quarter content. The stock is coming down fast this morning, heavy volume, Jackie.DEANGELIS: Yes. And, you know, I'm not really surprised by this, there was going to be a point where there was saturation, more competition in the field too. And, you know, the whole idea of cutting the cord was that your bill should be cheaper, if you're subscribing to every single service, they'll probably end up not being cheaper.So, I think, people are, sort of, on to that, and they're really going for content right now, and there's a lot more to choose from.BARTIROMO: It's a lot more to choose from. And then you've got, sort of, the behemoth, like a Disney, coming out, and then pulling content from Netflix.DEANGELIS: Absolutely. And that's going to be certainly an issue as you move forward. And users are really going to look at each service and say, where am I getting the most value from the content that I'm getting? And they're going to start to, sort of, switch and adjust and look at their bills in that regard.BARTIROMO: Markets are lower --ROSCHELLE: I see the viewers have a finite wallet that they're going to pay for subscriptions, and Netflix is just content. And some of the other providers are a little less content but all of the other stuff that's, sort of, on broadcast or on cable, so you're competing for that.And then you also have satellite radio, then you also have music streaming services, how much do Americans and people around the world want to pay? And I think they're bumping up against the saturation point.BARTIROMO: That's a good point. You're right. It's a lot out there. Meanwhile, markets are down this morning, the China trade story, hitting a roadblock and mentioned at the top of the show. The two sides reportedly at odds over Chinese telecom giant, Huawei, as a number of foreign buyers of U.S. homes drops by half, over the last two years.Huawei is really taking a hit here, as a result of this blacklist. And, you know, I've had Andy Purdy on a number of times, chief security officer at Huawei, and he says look, we are not an arm of the Chinese government, not at all. Well, if they're not an arm of the Chinese government, why is the Chinese government so interested in Huawei?ROSCHELLE: Why they pulled into the negotiations.DEANGELIS: Exactly.BARTIROMO: Why is this a major point for the -- for the trade?ROSCHELLE: And the other thing that people lose sight of is, look at all the chip makers who do business with them who are actually, sort of, on the sidelines right now, so it's sort of a bigger issue than just that one company because it runs across the entire ecosystem of chips and semiconductors and the like.BEVAN: But -- and even with Mike Pompeo, I mean, the U.S. government's position is -- this is -- they are an arm of the Chinese government, and this is a serious national security threat. And so, we're going to have to see how the Commerce Department works through these licenses exemptions, if they can do enough on limited basis to get this trade deal back on track.BARTIROMO: Secretary Pompeo has said, basically, this is a situation where the Chinese government can decide, well, let's dictate what goes on, wherever the Huawei chips are, and if all the data is going right back to Beijing, they have the ability to do that.We've known that there are have been open doors, back doors, they're called, in a number of the Huawei infrastructure. They found it in Italy, in the Vodafone situation. They found it in Africa, whereas the data is going directly back to Beijing.BEVAN: It's a huge deal.DEANGELIS: it's a serious issue. And I think it's an interest to the Chinese government, Mitch, as you said, to try to stall this conversation and they're just never going step up to the plate and admit to exactly what's going on, and that's part of the problem.BARTIROMO: All these stories really important this morning. We're going to talk about that. Plus, votes on the floor, Congress bringing two major debates to that table, one, concerning contempt, the other, articles of impeachment. We've got all the results this morning.Plus, get the fan out, summer is heating up, we've got the fan right here on the set, millions of Americans bracing for a triple-digit weekend, when will it break, later this hour, all that, on the other side of this break. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. House Democrats putting more pressure on the Trump administration with a controversial vote, Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now, Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: That's right, Maria. The Democratic-controlled House voted to hold Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, in contempt, for failing to comply with subpoenas. Secretary Ross was on with Maria yesterday, here is what he said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WILBUR ROSS, COMMERCE SECRETARY OF THE UNITED STATES: It is just more political theater and it doesn't really have any substance and basis. We produce to the committee over 14,000 pages of documents. What's an issue here is about a dozen documents, roughly 15 pages, all of which the courts didn't find necessary to make their conclusion.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Well, the Justice Department released a statement saying "this vote is nothing more than a political stunt."Well, the world's most notorious drug lord could pay for the U.S. border wall. A federal judge ordered Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman to spend the rest of his life behind bars, plus 30 years, possibly, in the nation's most secure prison in Colorado.The drug kingpin was also ordered to handover nearly $13 billion of his drug money to the United States. Well, Republican senators Ted Cruz and Ben Sasse are proposing that that cash be used to fund the U.S.-Mexico border wall. Their bill is called the El Chapo Act.And there is this, calm being restored in Puerto Rico, after a night of heated demonstrations and protests, police fired teargas and rubber bullets at these protesters that were heading to the governor's mansion there.Demonstrators are calling for the resignation of Governor Ricardo Rossello, after the release of hundreds of pages of private messages in which he allegedly (INAUDIBLE) misogynistic language, your headlines, Maria.BARTIROMO: All right, thank you so much, Cheryl, incredible stories there. Jackie?DEANGELIS: Just on the El Chapo story, look, drug trafficking is part of the problem, and if we could use that money in a positive way, I think it certainly would help. It's funny and we all chuckled a little bit, but --BARTIROMO: It's a good idea.DEANGELIS: Yes, absolutely.BARTIROMO: What else could you use that money for?DEANGELIS: You could use it for a lot of different things. Certainly, securing that border is what the president wants to do right now, and it's in the interest of the country.BARTIROMO: Yes, I agree with you. All right, we'll take a short break. When we come back, U.S.-China trade tensions, talks were brought to a standstill, what's holding things up, later this hour, wait until you see what the Wall Street Journal is reporting this morning.And then flame on, SpaceX's newest spacecraft malfunctions on takeoff, the amazing video when we come back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Futures are lower this morning, take a look, Dow Futures indicating a decline of better than 40 points at the start of trading this morning, S&P Futures down 3, and the NASDAQ Futures lower by 18.Some nervousness over the China story, the president talking about the trade deficit with China and taking a shot at former vice president, Joe Biden, at that rally last night, in North Carolina, watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: The European Union is terrible to us on trade, terrible. Frankly, they're as tough, or tougher than China. With China, $507 billion, you looked over these for many, many years, they've been taken. And guys like Biden, say, oh, we'd stop that, well, he was there eight years, we'd stop that. No, Trump is stopping it. Trump is stopping it.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal this morning is reporting that U.S.-China trade talks are stuck, they have stalled over questions about Huawei. Last month, I spoke with Huawei's chief security officer, Andy Purdy, about the connection between Huawei and the Chinese government.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: We have spoken a lot about the relationship between Huawei and the Chinese government, if there's not a direct link between the Chinese government and Huawei, why would the Chinese government want this ban lifted so much?ANDY PURDY, CHIEF SECURITY OFFICER, HUAWEI: We do not want and we do not speak for the Chinese government, and they don't speak for us. We still welcome the opportunity to talk directly with U.S. government to work out these proven risk-mitigation measures.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is the global economics editor with the Wall Street Journal, Jon Hilsenrath, and Jon, if the Chinese government tested Huawei, we want this particular data, send it asap, under law in China, they have to do so.JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL: Right, and that's at the heart of what's holding up U.S. trade talks with China right now. You know, U.S. national security officials want Huawei to be a separate issue, to not have anything to do with our trade negotiations.They see it as a national security issue and not a trade issue. The president, when he met with President Xi, a month or so ago, agreed that the U.S. would resume some sales to Huawei, but we're kind of stuck right now, in negotiations of who can sell to Huawei and who can't, and whether companies will get licenses from the U.S. to do that.BARTIROMO: Yes, you wonder if this is just going to keep playing out and impacting markets, I mean, do we need to see some resolution here, because what is the resolution that the U.S. government and Secretary Pompeo, President Trump have been very clear in terms of the national security risks around Huawei.HILSENRATH: Well, you know, I think the markets are getting used to the idea that this is going to be a long and drawn-out process. You know, it's striking to me what happened when the president talked about putting tariffs on Mexico, a couple of months ago, the markets reeled, people started worrying about the U.S. economy slowing down, the Federal Reserve changes its view on interest rates.You're not seeing that kind of reaction to these simmering trade disputes with China. I think, when it comes to China, we are in it for the long haul and investors are getting used to that idea.BARTIROMO: Yes, we want to mix it up with the panel, but let me turn to the Fed. Before we do that, the Fed reported yesterday that the U.S. economy grew at a modest rate in recent weeks, even with ongoing trade uncertainty, Jon, the Central Bank widely expected to cut rates at the end of the month. Are you looking for a quarter point or half a point on July 31?HILSENRATH: Well, you know, it looks like it would be a quarter point, you know, some of the argument for cutting rates has dissipated in the last few weeks. The economy looks pretty strong right now, the consumer spending data that have come out, you know, have been pretty robust.So, you know, if the Fed was worried about the economy significantly slowing, that's got to be off the table. The main arguments for the Fed, cutting rates, one is, we talked about all of this time -- this all the time on your show, the inverted yield curve, long-term interest rates are lower than short-term interest rates, that's a sign of low inflation and slowdown in the economy.And the Fed wants to reverse that, so I think that's one of the main reasons why they'll probably do something in July, but it's just going to be a trim, it's not going to be a full shave.ROSCHELLE: Jon, good morning, it's Mitch, one of the things that I was really waiting for with hot anticipation was the Beige Book, which came out yesterday. And when you look at it, and the Beige Book is a good indication because it really pans the country, it was generally optimistic, there were --HILSENRATH: Yes.ROSCHELLE: -- pockets, what's your take on whether or not there are nuggets on the Beige Book, because Chairman Powell referenced, waiting for it as well, but that's going to influence any decisions on their part.HILSENRATH: Yes, I mean, I guess -- I guess you and Jay Powell were both hot in anticipation for that.ROSCHELLE: I have nothing else to do at 2:00 in the afternoon, Jon.BARTIROMO: You've got -- you've got to get out a little more.ROSCHELLE: It's really hot out, I decide to stay in the office and read --HILSENRATH: You know, I think -- I think it was a positive report. The Fed does look at anecdotal comments on the economy, and it supports the idea that, you know, we're not hitting a wall. The growth is slowing this year.You know, we were in that three percent terrain last year, looks like we are closer to two percent this year, but, you know, as I said, the consumer is going pretty strong. Business investment, you know, might have lost a little bit of an edge because of all of these trade uncertainties but, you know, this month, the economy --This expansion has become the longest expansion on record, and there's just nothing in the data that says that's about to end. And that's an important issue over the Fed. Jay Powell and here, you know, his interests are aligned with President Trump's, he said his main -- his main objective right now is to keep this expansion going as long as it can.And the data suggests that this expansion is still going. And, you know, for the president, that's the most important thing too, if he wants to get re-elected, he's got to keep growth going and keep the unemployment rate low.You know, coming back to interest rates, I think the Fed might trim, but it's just to steady -- to steady things, they're not in any kind of emergency mode right now.DEANGELIS: And they're not in emergency mode, Jon, it's Jackie DeAngelis. I'm wondering if they don't trim that 25 basis points, is the market going to react really negatively?HILSENRATH: Well, you know, I think it's market conditions that are really driving the Fed right now, so, you know, I agree with you, I think that Jay Powell has, on several occasions now, really gotten expectations up for something in July.If he doesn't follow through, stocks will probably sell off, you know. And then they're very focused on the bond market, there's this puzzle, why are long-term interest rates lower than short-term interest rates?In the past, that's been a dangerous signal and they just want to work their way out of that, and trimming short-term interest rates is the easiest way to do that.BEVAN: Jon, it's Tom Bevan, back to President Trump and China, he raised the prospect of slapping an additional $325 billion in tariffs on China, what are the prospects of that, how real is that, and what might that do?HILSENRATH: Well, you know, right now, it looks like they are in -- they are in a stalemate, you know, they're talking about talking, but they're not really (INAUDIBLE) because of this Huawei issue that we (INAUDIBLE)I think the president, in his heart of hearts, he's made very clear, he likes tariffs, he thinks they're an effective way to fight back against the Chinese and other trade partners, and he also sees it as a source of revenue at a time when we are heading toward trillion-dollar budget deficits, so I think he is prepared to go in and raise them if he doesn't see the kind of progress that he wants. Right now, we are not seeing that progress.BARTIROMO: All right, we'll leave it there, Jon, great to talk with you as always.HILSENRATH: OK.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much.HILSENRATH: Thanks a lot.BARTIROMO: Have a good day, Jon Hilsenrath, Journal there, joining us. Coming up, chewing up the FaceApp, lawmakers warning that the popular Russian app could be a security risk, why they're urging people not to use it, and then, the big business of the cloud, SAP CEO Bill McDermott, joins me next to discuss technology growth and China trade, an exclusive on his earnings, coming up.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Thursdays morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, July 18th, your top stories right now, just before 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.Earnings in focus this morning, UnitedHealthcare raising its profit forecast after beating expectations. Morgan Stanley, the next big one to watch ahead of the opening bell this morning. We'll have the numbers and full analysis, coming up.Netflix is losing subscribers in the U.S. This is the first decline in the U.S. in nearly a decade. We are looking at Netflix stock trading down almost 11 percent this morning. That's just about 11 percent.Futures meanwhile, indicating a lower opening for the broader averages. Take a look at the Dow. Dow Futures down 40 points, S&P Futures down three. And the Nasdaq Future is lower by 17.Yesterday, stocks fell as earnings season exposed some weakness in growth outlooks for some companies, people are wondering what the growth looks like in the second half of the year. We're looking at a decline of 115 points this morning on the Dow Industrial, and the energy stocks were the biggest drags yesterday. Yesterday, the S&P was down about 20 and the Nasdaq lower by 37.Global markets this morning look like this. The FT-100 is down 30 points. The CAC Quarante in Paris lower by 20, and the DAX Index in Germany down 92.In Asia overnight, trade fears continuing to drive markets down there as well. As you see, the Nikkei average in Japan down two percent. Overall, the Shanghai Composite down better than one percent.South Korea's Central Bank lowering its interest rate for the first time in three years, cutting its growth forecast for the year as well.Bracing for a dangerous heatwave. Many areas of the United States set to hit triple digits this weekend. Got the forecast coming up.And then, this FaceApp security concerns. Lawmakers are calling for an investigation into the popular Russian developed app. Concerns about what happens to your data.Plus, a setback for SpaceX to tell you about the Starhopper starship bursting into flames during testing. All those stories coming up this morning.But first, our top story this half an hour. The big business of technology and cloud computing. SAP reporting earnings overnight. The company reported revenue of $7.4 billion and cloud revenue of one $1.93 billion. That is up 40 percent from a year earlier.Joining me right now is the CEO of SAP, Bill McDermott in this exclusive. And Bill, it is always a pleasure to see you.BILL MCDERMOTT, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, SYSTEMS APPLICATIONS AND PRODUCTS IN DATA PROCESSING: Good morning. Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. It characterized the quarter for us. I know the cloud business is important at SAP.MCDERMOTT: Sure.BARTIROMO: And it's obviously incredibly important for business in general.MCDERMOTT: Yes, we had a triple-digit growth quarter in terms of all dimensions. Cloud was up 40 percent. Our software and cloud business was in double digits. Our operating income and total revenue was up in double digits. So, we like those triple-doubles, you know, when things come in strong.Overall, the business is in really good shape, and we're excited to have a command performance in the back end of the year.BARTIROMO: What do you expecting for the second half? Does all this expectation that things are going to slow down quite a bit?MCDERMOTT: What's interesting, I was actually in China with -- and a meeting with Premier Li, when the whole G20 was going on in Japan. And clearly, in Asia, you do see some supply chain dislocations.So, for example, there are companies that are moving their manufacturing out of China to places like Vietnam, Malaysia, and even Mexico, to avoid this tariff scenario. So, there is some global trade dislocation out there. And what we see at SAP, when that happens you can have some decisions postponed as decision-makers say, wow, now I have to go build somewhere else.So I'm in a new regulatory environment. I have different compliance concerns, I have different supply chain manufacturing, and that whole value chain comes into big a bill and materials. So, we tend to do better, believe it or not in times of changes and uncertainties. So, we're looking for a very strong second half.BARTIROMO: Have you seen an impact from the tariff situation on your company?MCDERMOTT: Our company has not experienced it, it's our customers that are experiencing it. And primarily, you're seeing this in China, and you're seeing this in other parts of Asia as the business is now moving from China in some regards. So, we have like 70 million businesses you got to keep in mind in China.But if large companies start moving, manufacturing, and changing their supply chains to avoid the tariffs and they're going to other places. That is going to form a very interesting dynamic in Asia.It will be a software opportunity for us. But it'll also be very challenging I think in China and in the region in general, there'll be a lot of change.BARTIROMO: So, what are you expecting in terms of growth overall. I mean, Europe has had a hard time generating any growth. You're the largest technology company, most valuable in Europe. What do you seeing in Europe right now?MCDERMOTT: Our business is unique. We have a very unique brand position in Europe. And digital transformation is at a fevered pitch. If you talk to any CEO, they're very, very careful about how they invest. But they know they have to invest in digital transformation.So, in Europe, what you're seeing now is not just the idea of operating the company's better, they know they have to connect with experiences. So, how do I connect my employees, my products to my customers? And how do I create mass customization at scale, so I can offer personalized services to my consumers? Otherwise, you're going to lose market share and you're not going to grow.So, we have new solutions new innovation to accommodate that in any part of the world. That's why we're growing double digits in Europe and nobody else is.BARTIROMO: Do you -- do you see the impact of this worry over the slowdown in Europe from your customers?MCDERMOTT: No.BARTIROMO: Do you -- how are bookings looking in the future?MCDERMOTT: Yes. So, our bookings on as you look at our bookings whether it's pipeline for our core software business or pipeline for our cloud business, we rigorously manage this. The pipelines are excellent. And that's why I have in a resolute way reiterated our full-year guidance today.So, we're aware the challenges out there and the dynamics, and more than ever our customers need SAP to lead them through this change.BARTIROMO: But look at this competitive environment that you're facing in the cloud business. You're collaborating with Microsoft and Adobe to take on salesforce. If you've got Oracle and Microsoft partnering up, how is this impacting?MCDERMOTT: Yes, well, we have a way of handling our own business. So, we have the SAP cloud franchise. So, we can put everything we do in the cloud and we can offer our customers a white-glove service, and we'll do it all for them.But, we recognize that it's an open ecosystem. So, if our customers are teaming up with Microsoft, that's great. We're teamed up with Microsoft, we have embraced the hyper-scale and model, they have accepted our reference architecture, and the SAP cloud platform is the connecting tissue that puts all of this together.So, I'm happy if Microsoft and Adobe team up with SAP to accommodate an open data initiative for our customers. I'm also happy to partner with the hyper scalars if that's in the interest of the customer.So, we'll get good business, good partnerships, and continue to grow the company in double digits in the second half and beyond.BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, you've got Amazon.MCDERMOTT: Yes.BARTIROMO: AWS also wanting a piece of all of this.MCDERMOTT: Sure. Absolutely, and that's why we have to be open and embrace the hyper scalars and the ecosystem as the market-leading business software company. We have to go where the customer wants us to go.And I care deeply about our shareholders and making sure we deliver our promises. That's why today, I'm super excited to get in front of our whole company and rev it all up for the second half to get the job done command performance.BARTIROMO: You are so good at that. You really get everybody excited and I'm sure it's going to be great. Let me ask you about Elliott Management portfolio, SAP becoming a recent addition to the activist investor.MCDERMOTT: Yes.BARTIROMO: How does that change your thinking in terms of where the company goes now?MCDERMOTT: Elliott Management is a very fine investor and an advisor, and I am excited to have them into the SAP stock. What Elliott wanted, and what all of our investors want is they want SAP to take the operating margin performance of the company and improve it 500 basis points between now and 2023.So, Elliott Management, like many other investors wanted that, and I am going to make sure that they get it. So, that combined with cloud gross margins which is another reason, Maria, that we're very interested in embracing the hyper scalars. Because we can with their infrastructure provide a higher margin performance to our shareholders.So, this embrace strategy actually drives margins and delivers greater value for our shareholders.BARTIROMO: And are you able to take customers from Oracle increased market share?MCDERMOTT: It's so easy. You know, one of the things we did this quarter is we improved our cloud gross margins by four percentage points. One of the ways we did that is by getting our company off Oracle. It's no secret that we made some bold moves in the acquisition realm.BARTIROMO: Right.MCDERMOTT: And the companies we acquired were running Oracle's database in some of the cases. We're now taking that out, putting the best database of the 21st century in SAP HANA. And as we do that, we're going to take a $100 million in cost out of the equation.Not only run better, not only help customers but do it at a much lower cost. So --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: That's what -- that's what all the analysts are talking about. Because of those acquisitions, you're able to take market share from Oracle.MCDERMOTT: Yes.BARTIROMO: And grow margins that's like you just said.MCDERMOTT: Absolutely. I mean, look, S/4HANA, which is the signature ERP system in the economy today.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDERMOTT: It is whipping everybody in the entire software industry. So, if we can do that really well, continue the growth trajectory on the cloud, improve our margins as we said we would.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDERMOTT: And have a command performance in the second half and beyond. SAP is one of those unique, rare franchises that going to continue to grow, and grow, and grow.BARTIROMO: That's terrific, Bill. Let me ask you about technology and overall regulation, which is what a lot of people are expecting. Amazon is now facing antitrust investigation in the E.U. over the company's role in selling its products and marketplace operations, executives from Facebook, Google, Amazon, Apple, faced a grilling on the Capitol Hill this week.Last month, I spoke with President Trump and asked him about regulating the technology industry. And I thought that was interesting what he said. He said, "You know, you probably going to see legislation before competition." Listen to this.MCDERMOTT: Yes, sure.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP (via telephone): Twitter is just terrible what they do. They don't let you get the word. I've had so many people come to me, "Sir, I can't join you on Twitter." I see what's happening. 100 percent.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: So, do you -- would you rather see competition or do you want to see legislation coming down to actually --TRUMP: But you may need legislation in order to create competition.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Do you want to see legislation for tech, how do you see this, this bigger hand from government now?MCDERMOTT: Well, I believe strongly that you have to protect the consumers and the privacy of their data. Which is why SAP has always said, the data is the customers' data, it's not SAP's data.We were the first company in the world to be recognized by the British Standards Institute for protecting the data of customers and their consumers. We happen to be the best in the world at it. So --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Is it -- Is it going to impact you if you see actual regulation?MCDERMOTT: Absolutely not. In fact, we are one of the dynamic leaders. You know, one of our great partner is Apple, and Tim Cook and I were on the stage together recently in Orlando, just saying this very clearly. The data is the customers' data, you to protect the data.So, we have been doing that from the very beginning, companies that also do that are our friends and our partners. And I do think this is going to become one of the really important things in the new economy.BARTIROMO: Now, so you are expecting regulation of some sort?MCDERMOTT: I'm saying it's entire -- it's entirely possible, and it's understandable. You have to make sure that the consumer is protected, there's no doubt about that. You know, we have a very big focus as you know on experience management.And this idea of an omnichannel, e-commerce world, and the data of all those consumers, whether it's the social interactions or actually transactional volume as they buy things. You know, companies need to understand.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDERMOTT: That data is the consumers', not yours. And only can you use that if you're given the permission to do so, and it's in the best interest of the consumer, not you. So, I'm all in favor of doing the right thing for customers and their consumers.BARTIROMO: All right, we will leave it there. I know that we just heard about stimulus in Europe. Do you want to see a rate cut from the fed in two weeks?MCDERMOTT: Look, I think that there's -- you know, a lot of attention right now on doing the rate cut.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDERMOTT: And I would like to see it because the American economy is doing very well, I don't think anybody can argue that. But we also have a very, very interesting trade environment right now.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDERMOTT: So, why not pump it up a little bit?BARTIROMO: So, it's really the --(CROSSTALK)MCDERMOTT: And give business that infusion of confidence and drive shareholder value. I'm in for it.BARTIROMO: Bill, it's good to see you.MCDERMOTT: Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much.MCDERMOTT: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Bill McDermott is a CEO at SAP. Coming up, it is hot, hot, hot. Millions of Americans braising for a blistering weekend. How to beat the heat, coming up.And then deploying Baby Shark.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Why one Florida City is hoping the hit song? We'll take a bite out of crime. Details when we come back. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We have breaking news right now. Iranian state television is reporting that the Iran revolutionary guard has seized a foreign tanker with 12 crew members accused of smuggling oil. This is just hitting the tape now. The report says that fuel was being smuggled by Iranians to foreign customers and was intercepted in the straits of Hormuz. Oil right now is up three quarters of a percent, 57.19, the last trade on light sweet crude.Meanwhile this, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is seeing red over FaceApp. Cheryl Casone on headlines now, Cheryl.CASONE: Yes, it's a very popular app, Maria. Senator Schumer is calling on the FBI now to investigate whether data shared on this app -- which if you don't know about it, makes people's photos look either older or younger, could fall into the hands of the Russia government. It's really gone viral. The Russian company that developed FaceApp has denied that any user data is actually transferred to Russia, we shall see.All right. We are watching Dow components this morning. United Health raised their earnings guidance for the entire year 2019. They also reported better than expected earnings, they beat on both the top and the bottom line. The stock up, as you can see, one and a quarter percent on premarket. IBM's latest results beating expectation but revenue slipped for fourth straight quarter. They are working to grow the cloud business, but still you can see a little bit of pressure on big blue this morning.Also, this, San Francisco making changes. They have pulled proposed IPO from the November ballot. The measure would have increased taxes on companies that enter the public market like Uber, like Lyft, those companies are based in San Francisco. Opponents were arguing that the plan was too broad and would've unintentionally hit stock-based compensation of all companies that are based in the city. San Francisco (INAUDIBLE) for the similar tax measure on the 2020 ballot, so stay tuned -- it's not over.And then there's this. A SpaceX setback in its quest to send humans into space. The company's Starhopper rocket erupted into a fire ball during testing. The rocket was a prototype of a much larger one that SpaceX is hoping to use to send people to Mars. Right now, they're investigating the cause of that very fiery explosion as you can see on your screen, Maria.BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl, we'll keep watching that. And of course, this breaking news from Iran, coming up, earnings are on tap. We're waiting on Morgan Stanley, that's the big name reporting this morning before the opening bell. The numbers as soon as they hit the tape and reaction, and then get the fan out. Summer is heating up, millions of Americans bracing for a triple digit weather weekend, when will it break? Later this hour. We'll take a look. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Headline across America this morning. The Atlanta Journal Constitution reports: "Deeper findings: glitch leaves thousands of drivers with suspended licenses." A computer error reportedly to blame for a burp in the system, that resulted in thousands of unsuspecting drivers out on the road with bad licenses. (INAUDIBLE) County officials admitting that about 2,000 old and previously processed records were sent to the state by accident, but not every case resulted in a driver's license suspension.The San Francisco Chronicle writes: "Berkeley becomes the first U.S. city to ban natural gas in new homes." The city council unanimously voting to OK the move to ban gas from new low-rise residential buildings, that begins January 1. The natural gas ordinance requires all new single-family homes, town homes and small apartment buildings to have electric infrastructure.Florida Sun Sentinel this morning reports continuous loop of baby shark in hopes of deterring homeless from camping in and out water front park.BARTIROMO: Ask any parent of a young child. This may very well do the trick. Officials in West Palm Beach hoping that the blaring baby shark and raining tacos all night long will keep the homeless away. They admit this is only a temporary fix and are working on a permanent solution. It's funny.ROSCHELLE: It's going to work.(CROSSTALK)ROSCHELLE: As a father of young kids, it's going to work. Yes.BARTIROMO: Yes? OK.ROSCHELLE: Yes, genius idea.BARTIROMO: Well, I'll tell you, San Francisco has gotten really incredible in terms of the homelessness there, by the way. Well, there is very hot and dangerous temperatures moving across much of the country this morning. Fox News Senior Meteorologist Janice Dean is live in the Fox Weather Center this morning. Janice, give us the news.JANICE DEAN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL METEOROLOGIST: Oh my gosh, Maria, it's going to be hot for millions of people today through the weekend where we have heat warnings for millions of folks where it's going to feel well over 101- degrees for the next several days. So, dangerous heat. We want to make sure everyone is taking care of everyone -- the kids, bring your pets inside, take care of the elderly as well.So, temperatures well into the 90s for all of these big cities including New York City, including Boston. These are high temperatures but with the heat index, it's going to feel well over 100-degrees for so many people. So, here's today across the Central U.S., I mean, flirting with 108, 110- degrees over portions of the Midwest and the Central U.S. and then moving up towards the East Coast this weekend. That's where we're really going to see the heat across New York City up towards Boston, even New England.And that could cause some power outage concerns, so know where your cooling centers are, all right. That's going to be a big deal. Wear light-weight clothing, light-colored clothing, but I'm telling everyone to stay indoors in the air-conditioning, drink plenty of water, and again, watch your kids. Don't leave kids or your pets in a hot car, all right, very dangerous -- potentially deadly.There is your forecast today, so hazy hot and humid. We're into the dog days of summer, 94 in Houston, 85 in New York but that heat is moving northwards, so it's going to get up towards the northeast by week's end into the weekend. And then we have the threat for some severe thunderstorms across portions to have northeast back through the upper Midwest. But again, Maria, the big story is the heat; the good news for the northeast is it will break next week, but the weekend is going to be really, really warm and potentially dangerous.BARTIROMO: OK, we will get ready for it. Got to manage it. Janice, thank you. Janice Dean at the weather center. Still ahead, my exclusive interview with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell reacting to President Trump's speech last night and a lot more.

IS HUAWEI A NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT?States News ServiceJuly 19, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1327 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: PHILADELPHIA, Penn. BodyThe following information was released by the University of Pennsylvania:For people who don't know, what is Huawei?Huawei is a Chinese company that manufactures telecommunications equipment. Their primary product lines are smartphones and base stations that telephone networks use to connect smartphones to the network.Can I walk into a Best Buy and purchase a Huawei product?In most other countries, you could. Huawei has some smartphone devices which are available to consumers. Just like a Samsung Galaxy, Huawei has devices that compete with other smartphone devices. Cybersecurity allegations led Huawei to pull out of the U.S. smartphone market in 2018.What hit the news recently is pushback related to 5G technology. Can you explain what the sentiment of anxiety would be over Huawei being involved in 5G development in the U.S.?Wireless networks rely on base stations located on cellular towers to provide the radio connections to get to your smartphone. Historically, base stations have been manufactured by a number of different providers, including European companies such as Ericsson and Nokia. Huawei has long been a significant player in this business, and it has emphasized developing base stations for 5G more than any other company. Consequently, they are widely regarded as having a technological lead in this area. The concern is that a manufacturing company can design security vulnerabilities and backdoors into a system that can allow either that company, or some other actor, to compromise that system's security. The UK did a recent study with Huawei's technology, and they did find some evidence of such vulnerabilities.So, when you say 'actor' you mean the Chinese government?Well, it can be any actor, but the concern with Huawei is that the government will exploit vulnerabilities. The reality is that Chinese companies cooperate heavily with the government. And in addition, the Chinese government is widely thought to exercise considerable influence over Huawei.So, they have ownership. This isn't speculative?Huawei is controlled by its Representatives' Commission, which is elected by its shareholders. Huawei is 99 percent owned by its employees, although Chinese legal limits on the number of shareholders a limited liability company can have requires that they register their shares through a trade union committee. The trade union reports up to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, which is controlled by the Communist Party of China. Many observers have raised concerns that this structure allows the Chinese government to exercise significant influence over Huawei.Which is why lawmakers are so concerned with having them involved with 5G development?Correct.What is the lay of the land right now with how this is being handled? There's a sort of ban, right?It's actually not a ban. On May 15, the administration placed Huawei on a list of companies indicted for exporting goods and services to Iran without Treasury Department approval. Anyone who wants to export critical technology to a company on that list must get a license from the Commerce Department before doing so. It's a pretty major step the U.S. government can use to prevent technology from going to Huawei. Many U.S. companies have curtailed or suspended their business dealing with Huawei as a result.The most interesting recent news happened at the G20 summit on June 29. Following discussions with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Donald Trump said that he would relax those restrictions.Was there a reason offered why?The administration is characterizing it as an attempt to ease tensions in the ongoing trade war. The administration has received substantial criticism for this action, primarily because it offered this concession without requiring any tangible return commitments from the Chinese. In fact, the Trump Administration started to walk back a little bit of the rhetoric that it released at the G20.Do we need Huawei to develop these networks?At this point, Huawei's 5G equipment is cheaper than those offered by any other provider. Despite that fact, all of the major U.S. providers have not incorporated Huawei technology into their networks, but having to use more expensive technology raises the cost of deploying 5G. Smaller U.S. providers have deployed Huawei technology, and many major European carriers have done the same. And the U.S. has been pressuring these providers and countries to begin disengaging from Huawei technology, and one of the criticisms of the current change in U.S. policy is it waters down the message we've been sending to our allies.How are our allies treating this? Are they accepting Huawei tech?They are trying to split the baby. They have authorized the use of Huawei tech for non-critical systems, but are preventing it from being used for critical systems. Many technologists have questioned whether that distinction will solve the security problems many people perceive.If we accepted their technology and took advantage of the cheaper costs to develop infrastructure, what is the worst-case scenario?The worst-case scenario is that Huawei will have built in latent vulnerabilities that are hard or impossible to detect, and that during times of crisis they would have access to information that the U.S. government would like to remain confidential.At this point, where is public opinion?What's interesting is public opinion probably is being swallowed up in the larger debate around the trade war with China. People applaud the decision to stand up to and play hardball with China. U.S. companies would like equal access to China's market, would like protection of intellectual property, would like the Chinese government to wind down ownership stakes in companies and allow its currency to float at market rates. All of those things are probably benefitted by the larger trade initiative being engaged by the Trump Administration. On the other hand, China has responded by dropping reciprocal tariffs on U.S. goods, which has hurt the agricultural sector. Huawei is also a major customer of many large U.S. tech companies, who would be harmed by a long-term ban on selling to Huawei.If you had to place a bet, how do you see this all shaking out?My guess is the Huawei issue will be settled in a larger context of the trade dispute with China. It will be one piece in a much larger game.There have been suggestions the U.S. should build its own 5G network, which most observers find baffling, given the current budget constraints facing the U.S. and the reality that private companies are already investing heavily in 5G. My guess is, unless the U.S. is really willing to play hardball and ban the use of Huawei altogether, they are going to come to some intermediate compromise. The big worry, or the big hope of people watching this, is that the U.S. gets something substantial in return, in terms of fundamental structural reforms to the Chinese economy.The other possible lingering question is what does it do to our relationship with allies. There are a number of allies with whom we collaborate with very closely that continue to use Huawei equipment. The question is whether we will begin withholding information from them we'd otherwise share, out of concern in so doing we'd be allowing that information to be compromised to the Chinese or other actors.Anything to add?Cybersecurity and trade present a very difficult issue. But at the same time, what I would say is this is going to be a very delicate balance for the U.S. to strike. On the one hand, cybersecurity is a serious problem that must be taken seriously. On the other hand, the U.S. frequently accuses the Chinese government of favoring Chinese companies over U.S. companies. The problem is differentiating legitimate cybersecurity concerns from contrived claims that are simply pretexts for trade protectionism. Unfortunately, debates over which is actually true can be very contentious and more indeterminate than we would like.Load-Date: July 24, 2019End of Document

Twitter shuts Chinese accounts targeting Hong Kong protestsAssociated Press Financial WireAugust 20, 2019 Tuesday 1:25 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: WASHINGTON DATELINELength: 903 wordsByline: By TAMI ABDOLLAH, Associated PressDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) - Twitter said it has suspended more than 200,000 accounts that it believes were part of a Chinese government influence campaign targeting the protest movement in Hong Kong.The company also said Monday it will ban ads from state-backed media companies, expanding a prohibition it first applied in 2017 to two Russian entities.Both measures are part of what a senior company official portrayed in an interview as a broader effort to curb malicious political activity on a popular platform that has been criticized for enabling election interference around the world and for accepting money for ads that amount to propaganda by state-run media organizations.The accounts were suspended for violating the social networking platform's terms of service and "because we think this is not how people can come to Twitter to get informed," the official said in an interview with The Associated Press.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of security concerns, said the Chinese activity was reported to the FBI, which investigated Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election through social media.After being notified by Twitter and conducting its own investigation, Facebook said Monday that it has also removed seven pages, three groups and five accounts, including some portraying protesters as cockroaches and terrorists.The Chinese government said Tuesday it wasn't aware of the allegations.Facebook, which is more widely used in Hong Kong, does not release data on such state-backed influence operations. Neither does it ban ads from state-owned media companies."We continue to look at our policies as they relate to state-owned media," a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement to the AP. "We're also taking a closer look at ads that have been raised to us to determine if they violate our policies."Twitter traced the Hong Kong campaign to two fake Chinese and English Twitter accounts that pretended to be news organizations based in Hong Kong, where pro-democracy demonstrators have taken to the streets since early June calling for full democracy and an inquiry into what they say is police violence against protesters.The Chinese language account, @HKpoliticalnew, and the English account, @ctcc507, pushed tweets depicting protesters as violent criminals in a campaign aimed at influencing public opinion around the world. One of those accounts was tied to a suspended Facebook account that went by the same moniker: HKpoliticalnew.An additional 936 core accounts Twitter believes originated from within China attempted to sow political discord in Hong Kong by undermining the protest movement's legitimacy and political positions.About 200,000 more automated Twitter accounts amplified the messages, engaging with the core accounts in the network. Few tweeted more than once, the official said, mostly because Twitter quickly caught many of them.The Twitter official said the investigation remains ongoing and there could be further disclosures.Though Twitter, Facebook and most other foreign social media platforms are banned in China, they're available in semiautonomous Hong Kong.At a daily briefing Tuesday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said he was "not aware" of the allegations of fake accounts, but added that Chinese people had the right to "express their opinions about" the situation in Hong Kong.The free speech organization PEN America welcomed the tech companies' actions and urged them to do more."China's government has denied its citizens access to global outlets for communication. That they now turn around and stealthily unleash a campaign of disinformation on the very same platforms represents a new height of hypocrisy," chief executive Suzanne Nossel said in a statement.The Twitter campaign reflects that the Chinese government has studied the role of social media in mass movements and fears the Hong Kong protests could spark wider unrest, said James Lewis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies."This is standard Chinese practice domestically, and we know that after 2016 they studied what the Russians did in the U.S. carefully," Lewis said. "So it sounds like this is the first time they're deploying their new toy."Twitter has sought to more aggressively monitor its network for malicious political activity since the 2016 presidential election and to be more transparent about its investigations, publicly releasing data about state-backed influence operations since October so others can evaluate it, the official said."We're not only telling the public this happened, we're also putting the data out there so people can study it for themselves," the official said.As for state-backed media organizations, they are still allowed to use Twitter, but are no longer allowed to pay for ads, which show up regardless of whether you have elected to follow the group's tweet.Twitter declined to provide a list of what it considers state-backed media organizations, but a representative said it may consider doing so in the future. In 2017, Twitter specifically announced it would ban Russia-based RT and Sputnik from advertising on its platform.___Follow Tami Abdollah on Twitter at https://twitter.com/latams___Associated Press writer Chris Bodeen in Beijing contributed to this report.___This story has been corrected to attribute PEN America statement to the chief executive, not the spokesman.Load-Date: August 21, 2019End of Document

China expels Wall Street Journal reporter following report on President Xi Jinping's cousinCNN WireAugust 30, 2019 Friday 2:03 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 419 wordsByline: By Steven Jiang, CNN BusinessDateline: BEIJING (CNN Business) BodyBEIJING (CNN Business) --  The Wall Street Journal's publisher confirmed Friday that Chinese authorities have declined to renew one of its reporters' press credentials, effectively expelling him from the country, following an investigative story he worked on about a cousin of Chinese President Xi Jinping.Beijing-based reporter Chun Han Wong was the co-author of a report published in the Journal last month that detailed alleged involvement of Xi's cousin in high-stakes gambling and potential money laundering in Australia.When asked about Wong's effective expulsion, the Chinese government insisted that it handles foreign journalists' press credentials in accordance with law."We are firmly opposed to the malicious smearing and attacks against China by certain foreign journalists, who are not welcome in China," the Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement Friday. "At the same time, we will facilitate newsgathering work that complies with laws and regulations for foreign journalists in China."The Journal reported Friday on Wong's removal from China, linking Beijing's decision to his story last month."Mr. Xi's private life and that of his relatives are considered sensitive by Chinese authorities," the Journal said in its story. "Prior to publication, (foreign) ministry officials urged the Journal not to publish and warned of unspecified consequences."Journal publisher Dow Jones said it would "continue to look into the matter."Wong, a Singaporean national, began working in Beijing for the Journal in 2014 and his credentials had been approved annually until this time, according to the newspaper.The Foreign Correspondents' Club of China (FCCC) protested the decision, saying in a statement that it "condemns in the strongest possible terms the use of visa non-renewal as a form of punishment.""Expulsions of journalists from China amount to an extreme attempt by Chinese authorities to punish news organizations that conduct factual work that does not cast the country or its leadership in a flattering light," the statement said. "Such treatment of foreign correspondents run completely counter to Chinese claims that it supports openness and inclusiveness. Such actions should raise further concerns as China prepares to host major global events, such as the Winter Olympics in 2022."Wong is the sixth journalist to be forced out of China under such circumstances since 2013, according to the FCCC statement.TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Hong Kong protesters destroyed 'smart' lampposts because they fear China is spying on themBusiness Insider USAugust 26, 2019 Monday 03:25 PM GMTCopyright 2019 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 565 wordsByline: eioanes@businessinsider.com,  (Ellen Ioanes)Highlight: During a weekend of volatile protests in Hong Kong, activists damaged the city's "smart" lampposts out of fear of their surveillance cameras.BodyThomas Peter / REUTERS• Protesters in Hong Kong targeted the city's "smart lampposts" during weekend protests over fears that they were being used to spy on them.• The lampposts, which were installed in July, feature WiFi networks, cameras to monitor traffic, and sensors to track air quality. The Hong Kong government has said that the lampposts do not have facial recognition technology.• Visit Business Insider's home page for more stories. Pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong capped off a volatile weekend of protests by targeting the city's "smart" lampposts, which they fear the Chinese government is using to spy on them.The lampposts, the first 50 of which were installed in June, are part of a smart-city initiative and have sensors and CCTV cameras to monitor illegal waste dumping sites and traffic data, including license plate numbers, the South China Morning Post reported in July.Protesters expressed concern that the lampposts, which are also 5G WiFi hubs, were being used by the Chinese government for surveillance on the ongoing protests. Hong Kong's government has said that the devices do not have facial recognition technology and no data will be shared with third parties, such as the Beijing government. Read more: Protester is called Hong Kong's 'tank man' for standing between crowd and police aiming gunsHowever, with public trust in the government at a low as protests continue for the third month, protesters demanded that the lampposts be removed, with some going so far as to vandalize or completely destroy the devices. The 50 lampposts currently constructed were intended to be the first of 400; however, as the Hong Kong Free Press reported, TickTack Technology Limited, the tech company that provides parts for the lamppost, will cease cooperation with the Hong Kong government after they said their staff members were threatened.The company stressed that it has no relationship with the mainland government, but protesters were wary that the smart lampposts were connected to the mainland firm Shanghai Sensi, which provided one of the systems for lighting the lampposts. "We understand that disputes in society over the past few months led the public to be cautious and mistrustful towards some technology," TickTack Technology said in a statement. The company also said it hoped its withdrawal would calm fears and defuse the tension between protesters and the government, the Hong Kong Free Press reported. China's government is notorious for using technology like facial recognition to spy on its citizens, with the most egregious example being the country's ethnic Uighur population. The Chinese government has created a virtual police state for Uighurs in Xinjiang, using facial recognition and human intelligence to identify Uighurs to send to indoctrination camps and monitor them after they are released. NOW WATCH: A new underwater memorial honors US military veterans and serves as an artificial reef to preserve marine lifeSee Also:• Hong Kong protesters are forming a human chain 30 years after the Baltic Way democracy protests• Mitch McConnell slams China over Hong Kong, threatens a global confrontation that could tank the finance hub• A worker at Britain's consulate in Hong Kong went missing in China, and his girlfriend is blaming BeijingSEE ALSO: China's military power may surpass the US's faster than you think, thanks to 6 shrewd strategiesLoad-Date: August 26, 2019End of Document

China knows what it wants, the U.S. doesn't yetCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 15, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 599 wordsBodyJul 15. (Dow Jones) -- In its trade negotiations with China, the United States has all the advantages. The country buys more from China than vice versa, it is also the only supplier of numerous technologies that are critical in many industrial areas and evokes more loyalty from the rest of the world.But China has a powerful advantage: a well-defined goal. Although its negotiating priorities change, for decades its objective has been the same: to move steadily on the scale of economic development and to remain a single-party state.The U.S. ban from providing key supplies to Huawei Technologies was an existential threat to the next stage of that development, as it was competing globally in the world's most advanced technologies.Therefore, when President Xi Jinping met with President Trump on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan, recently, his main condition for resuming negotiations was to cancel such a ban, which was partially annulled always and when that doesn't undermine American security.U.S. leaders, for their part, have long been divided over whether or not they should treat China as a partner who can be manipulated or as a rival who should be ostracized. The Trump administration itself is divided, and the president's recent decision to give Huawei a temporary respite has left the end as murky as ever.China joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001 to discipline its inefficient state-owned enterprises, ensure access to foreign capital markets, and foster export-led growth. In addition to an undervalued Chinese currency, WTO membership attracted a wealth of foreign capital and experience that made China the world's manufacturing plant.This led to growing Chinese trade surpluses and growing frictions with the United States. Beijing addressed these tensions by allowing its currency, the yuan, to rise in value. His priorities then went from attracting foreign investment and export-led growth to growing large domestic companies.So, despite China's trade surplus starting to decline as part of domestic production, Western companies faced more restricted access to the Chinese market and pressure to transfer technology and knowledge to their Chinese rivals .China is now embroiled in a tariff dispute over US efforts to end such discriminatory treatment. However, their priorities have evolved again, from protecting their large domestic companies at home to promoting world-class businesses in the most advanced industries, from energy-efficient cars to artificial intelligence."The Chinese still protect their domestic market a lot, but what they see as more worthy of protection has changed over time and has risen in the market as their technology ambitions have grown," said Scott Kennedy of the Center for Strategic and International Studies .Huawei is not just any company; is the world's leading provider of the world's leading technology, fifth-generation telecommunications networks and a considerable source of national pride.Huawei, the State ZTE and State Grid, the monopoly of the"strategic tools to drive China's advance on the technology ladder," said Derek Scissors of the American Enterprise Institute. "They are central entities in [Xi's] strategy to drive China's development."The U.S. campaign against Huawei began as a national security issue based on the company's potential to become a means of spying for the Chinese government. Now, an integral part of the broader debate on how to deal with China.Translated by Luis Felipe CedilloEdited by Eduardo GarcíaCopyright © 2019 Dow Jones &Company;, Inc.

Rubio, Shaheen Urge TSP Board to Reverse Decision to Steer Federal Retirement Savings to ChinaTargeted News ServiceAugust 26, 2019 Monday 7:51 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1468 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: MIAMI, Florida BodySen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, issued the following news release:U.S. Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), members of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, today urged Michael Kennedy, the Chairman of the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB), to reverse a short sighted-decision to mirror the MSCI All Country World ex-U.S. Investable Market Index (ACWI ex-US IMI). This decision will expose nearly $50 billion in retirement assets of federal government employees, including members of the U.S. Armed Forces, to severe and undisclosed material risks associated with many of the Chinese companies listed on the MSCI ACWI ex-US IMI. If implemented, the decision will effectively use these retirement savings to fund the Chinese government and Communist Party's efforts to undermine U.S. economic and national security. The letter requests responses to questions posed no later than September 6, 2019.The full text of the letter is below.Dear Chairman Kennedy:We write to urge the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB) to reverse its November 2017 decision to change the Thrift Savings Plan's International Stock Fund (TSP's I Fund) to mirror the MSCI All Country World ex-U.S. Investable Market Index (ACWI ex-US IMI). The FRTIB's decision to track this MSCI index constitutes a decision to invest in China-based companies, including many firms that are involved in the Chinese Government's military, espionage, human rights abuses, and "Made in China 2025" industrial policy, and therefore poses fundamental questions about the Board's statutory and fiduciary responsibilities to American public servants who invest in federal retirement plans. This change, which is expected to be implemented next year, will expose nearly $50 billion in retirement assets of federal government employees, including members of the U.S. Armed Forces, to severe and undisclosed material risks associated with many of the Chinese companies listed on this MSCI index.On November 28, 2017, representatives from Aon Hewitt Investment Consulting, Inc., presented FRTIB Board Members with the Benchmark Study for the Thrift Savings Plan. Although this presentation--which was given the same day as the Board adopted the motion to change the I Fund to mirror the MSCI ACWI ex U.S. IMI--addressed issues related to general market exposure, liquidity, and transaction costs, there is no evidence that due diligence related to national security, human rights, or financial transparency was ever performed. This is surprising given not only that China received the third-most investment on a per-nation basis within the MSCI ACWI ex-US IMI as of July 31, 2019, at 7.56 percent of the index's total assets, but also that MSCI Inc. has recently begun to increase the weight of China A shares, stocks traded on mainland China exchanges in Renminbi, on its indexes. In fact, the notes from that meeting clearly state that "the primary concern with the MSCI All Country World ex-U.S. Investable Market Index in the past was the lack of maturation of some of the emerging markets."It is well known that the Chinese Government uses state-owned and state-directed enterprises to control production, compete in global markets, and serve the Chinese Communist Party's military, political, and economic goals. Many of these Chinese companies may soon receive investments directly from the paychecks of members of the U.S. Armed Services and other federal government employees because of your decision. Indeed, the MSCI ACWI ex-US IMI lists among its constituents many Chinese issuers that pose national security, human rights, and financial disclosure risks. We have listed a few illustrative examples of these risks below.- On national security. The MSCI ACWI ex-US IMI or its sub-indexes have included AviChina Industry &#38; Technology Ltd., the listing company for the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) and its numerous subsidiaries that develop manned aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles, missiles, and other weapons systems for the People's Liberation Army Air Force, People's Liberation Army Naval Air Force, and People's Liberation Army Rocket Force. AVIC is a state-owned entity that the U.S. Trade Representative has called "the sole domestic supplier of military aircraft to the People's Liberation Army (PLA)." This firm and its subsidiaries were the subjects of repeated sanctions for proliferation activities related to the Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act and other statutes.The index or its sub-indexes have also included China Mobile Ltd., a Chinese state-owned enterprise that the Federal Communications Commission unanimously voted to bar from entering the U.S. market in May 2019 due to national security concerns. The FCC noted China Mobile poses "substantial and unacceptable national security and law enforcement risks," citing how "China Mobile is subject to exploitation, influence, and control by the Chinese government".- On human rights. This MSCI index or its sub-indexes has also included Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology (Hikvision), a state-run technology firm with tens of thousands of surveillance cameras throughout the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region that support the Chinese Government's detainment of over one million Uighur Muslims and other ethnic and religious minorities.

RUBIO, SHAHEEN URGE TSP BOARD TO REVERSE DECISION TO STEER FEDERAL RETIREMENT SAVINGS TO CHINAStates News ServiceAugust 26, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 1457 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: MIAMI, Fla. BodyThe following information was released by Florida Senator Marco Rubio:U.S. Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), members of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, today urged Michael Kennedy, the Chairman of the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB), to reverse a short sighted-decision to mirror the MSCI All Country World ex-U.S. Investable Market Index (ACWI ex-US IMI). This decision will expose nearly $50 billion in retirement assets of federal government employees, including members of the U.S. Armed Forces, to severe and undisclosed material risks associated with many of the Chinese companies listed on the MSCI ACWI ex-US IMI. If implemented, the decision will effectively use these retirement savings to fund the Chinese government and Communist Party's efforts to undermine U.S. economic and national security. The letter requests responses to questions posed no later than September 6, 2019.The full text of the letter is below.Dear Chairman Kennedy:We write to urge the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB) to reverse its November 2017 decision to change the Thrift Savings Plan's International Stock Fund (TSP's I Fund) to mirror the MSCI All Country World ex-U.S. Investable Market Index (ACWI ex-US IMI). The FRTIB's decision to track this MSCI index constitutes a decision to invest in China-based companies, including many firms that are involved in the Chinese Government's military, espionage, human rights abuses, and "Made in China 2025" industrial policy, and therefore poses fundamental questions about the Board's statutory and fiduciary responsibilities to American public servants who invest in federal retirement plans. This change, which is expected to be implemented next year, will expose nearly $50 billion in retirement assets of federal government employees, including members of the U.S. Armed Forces, to severe and undisclosed material risks associated with many of the Chinese companies listed on this MSCI index.On November 28, 2017, representatives from Aon Hewitt Investment Consulting, Inc., presented FRTIB Board Members with the Benchmark Study for the Thrift Savings Plan. Although this presentationwhich was given the same day as the Board adopted the motion to change the I Fund to mirror the MSCI ACWI ex U.S. IMIaddressed issues related to general market exposure, liquidity, and transaction costs, there is no evidence that due diligence related to national security, human rights, or financial transparency was ever performed. This is surprising given not only that China received the third-most investment on a per-nation basis within the MSCI ACWI ex-US IMI as of July 31, 2019, at 7.56 percent of the index's total assets, but also that MSCI Inc. has recently begun to increase the weight of China A shares, stocks traded on mainland China exchanges in Renminbi, on its indexes. In fact, the notes from that meeting clearly state that "the primary concern with the MSCI All Country World ex-U.S. Investable Market Index in the past was the lack of maturation of some of the emerging markets."It is well known that the Chinese Government uses state-owned and state-directed enterprises to control production, compete in global markets, and serve the Chinese Communist Party's military, political, and economic goals. Many of these Chinese companies may soon receive investments directly from the paychecks of members of the U.S. Armed Services and other federal government employees because of your decision. Indeed, the MSCI ACWI ex-US IMI lists among its constituents many Chinese issuers that pose national security, human rights, and financial disclosure risks. We have listed a few illustrative examples of these risks below.On national security. The MSCI ACWI ex-US IMI or its sub-indexes have included AviChina Industry and Technology Ltd., the listing company for the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) and its numerous subsidiaries that develop manned aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles, missiles, and other weapons systems for the People's Liberation Army Air Force, People's Liberation Army Naval Air Force, and People's Liberation Army Rocket Force. AVIC is a state-owned entity that the U.S. Trade Representative has called "the sole domestic supplier of military aircraft to the People's Liberation Army (PLA)." This firm and its subsidiaries were the subjects of repeated sanctions for proliferation activities related to the Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act and other statutes.The index or its sub-indexes have also included China Mobile Ltd., a Chinese state-owned enterprise that the Federal Communications Commission unanimously voted to bar from entering the U.S. market in May 2019 due to national security concerns. The FCC noted China Mobile poses "substantial and unacceptable national security and law enforcement risks," citing how "China Mobile is subject to exploitation, influence, and control by the Chinese government".On human rights. This MSCI index or its sub-indexes has also included Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology (Hikvision), a state-run technology firm with tens of thousands of surveillance cameras throughout the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region that support the Chinese Government's detainment of over one million Uighur Muslims and other ethnic and religious minorities. Constituent entities of Hikvision's controlling shareholder, the China Electronics Technology Group Corporation, were added to the U.S. Commerce Department's Entity List in August 2018 for "acting contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States." Moreover, the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (Public Law 115-874) prohibits the U.S. federal government from procuring equipment from Hikvisionalong with ZTE Corporation, which also has been in this MSCI index or sub-indexeseffective August 13, 2019, and will ban federal contracts with companies using Hikvision's equipment or services beginning in August 2020.On financial disclosure. The dangers of fraud and deceit are well-documented for companies listed on Chinese exchanges, which are not transparent or subject to the disclosure requirements that American companies must abide by. For example, in April 2019, Kangmei Pharmaceutical Co., a Chinese company that has been included in this MSCI index or its sub-indexes, admitted to falsely overstating the value of its cash holdings by $4.4 billion. Moreover, Ruihua, China's second-largest domestic accounting firm and the client of multiple Chinese firms in the MSCI indexes, was implicated in a scandal over the quality of its audits.In order to fully inform Congress of the risks that you have considered in making this decision, we respectfully ask that you answer the questions below by September 6, 2019.(1) What criteria were used to identify and evaluate the suitability of a new index for the I Fund, and to what extent was due diligence related to security, human rights, and financial transparency performed by the Board?

Twitter cracks down on state media after unveiling Chinese campaign against Hong Kong protestersCNN WireAugust 20, 2019 Tuesday 9:54 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 650 wordsByline: By Donie O'Sullivan, CNN BusinessDateline: NEW YORK (CNN Business) BodyNEW YORK (CNN Business) --  Twitter will no longer accept advertisements from state-controlled media outlets, the company announced Monday, hours after it joined with Facebook to take down a covert Chinese social media campaign that sought to undermine pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. "We want to protect healthy discourse and open conversation," Twitter said in a statement posted on its website.Twitter said the new policy would only apply to "news media entities that are either financially or editorially controlled by the state." While state media cannot pay for advertisements that would amplify their message, they will be allowed to continue posting on the platform. Twitter said the new restrictions do not apply to outlets funded by taxpayers, or independent public broadcasters. The new policy was announced shortly after Twitter said it had identified a network of more than 900 accounts originating in China that "were deliberately and specifically attempting to sow political discord in Hong Kong, including undermining the legitimacy and political positions of the protest movement." Some accounts called protesters "cockroaches" or compared them to Islamic State terrorists. The offending accounts have been taken down from Twitter and Facebook.It also came after BuzzFeed News and others reported that media outlets in China, most of which are funded by the state and tightly controlled by authorities in Beijing, had been buying advertisements on Facebook and Twitter that portrayed the protests negatively."Although the people behind this activity attempted to conceal their identities, our investigation found links to individuals associated with the Chinese government," Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook's head of cybersecurity policy, wrote in a blog post. Beijing responded on Tuesday. Geng Shuang, a spokesman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told reporters that "people will have their own judgments about what is happening in Hong Kong, and what the truth is.""I think it is reasonable that Chinese media use overseas social media to communicate with local people, to tell stories about China, to introduce Chinese policies," he said.This is the first time tech companies have pointed the finger at Beijing for covert efforts to influence messaging around the Hong Kong protests. Pro-democracy demonstrators have massed throughout Hong Kong for 11 consecutive weekends.An account that was titled "Dream News" tweeted about the demonstrators, "We don't want you radical people in Hong Kong. Just get out of here!"The accounts posted in multiple languages and at least some of them appeared to target American audiences. One account, that was set up more than 10 years ago, said in its Twitter bio, "Conservative News from the USA and Abroad. #Catholic Defender of the Constitution of the United States." The account claimed to support President Donald Trump.Other accounts also purported to be operated by people in the United States, listing locations like Chicago and Long Beach, California.Twitter initially identified the network and shared details about the accounts with Facebook. Then, Facebook identified about a dozen pages, accounts and groups that were tied to the operation.The Facebook pages were followed by about 15,000 accounts, the company said.Twitter said many of the accounts accessed its platform using virtual private networks because Twitter is blocked in China.China, of course, is not alone in using social media to spread unrest. Covert campaigns have been tied to Russia and Iran, among other countries.In 2018 the US Department of Justice brought charges against a Kremlin-linked troll group that posed as American on social media in the run-up to the 2016 US presidential election.---- Joshua Berlinger, Steven Jiang and Nanlin Fang contributed to this report.TM & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Thousands of protesters return to Hong Kong streets despite growing warnings from ChinaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 18, 2019 SundayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 567 wordsBodyThousands of demonstrators, mostly dressed in black, have begun concentrating on a park in central Hong Kong on Sunday, despite growing warnings from China in the eleventh week of protests against the island's government. The march, which is expected to be massive, was convened by the Civil Front for Human Rights, a non-violent organization responsible for the June and July rallies involving hundreds of thousands of people. "Sunday's march should once again bring together a million people. The Hong Kong people cannot be defeated," pro-democracy Deputy Claudia Mo said on Facebook.Police approved this demonstration in a large park in the former British colony, but forbade protesters from parading through the streets of the city. This type of ban has been almost systematically ignored by protesters in recent weeks, leading to clashes with law enforcement. The authorities justify their decision in increasingly recurrent acts of violence, for example against police stations. The protest movement does not recede, despite the arrest of more than 700 people in more than two months of demonstrations.Born in June to reject a controversial bill authorizing extraditions to mainland China, the mobilization has since expanded its demands to demand, for example, true universal suffrage, amid fear of a China's growing meddling. This is the worst political crisis since it ceased to be a British colony in 1997. Beijing has raised the tone in recent weeks, calling the protesters' most violent actions "almost terrorists." In addition, in recent days the Chinese government began moving military units to Shenzhen, the Chinese city across the border, less than 40 kilometres away from the former British colony.Saturday's demonstrations began with a march of thousands of teachers under torrential rain to support the pro-democracy movement, largely driven by young militants. In the afternoon, a larger crowd gathered to march to Hung Hom and To Kwa Wan, two popular port neighborhoods frequented by mainland Chinese tourists. Some protesters went to the offices of the Federation of Trade Unions, a pro-Beijing organization. There they painted graffiti on the building's facade and threw eggs.Pro-democracy activists defied police in the Mong Kok neighborhood of the New Territories (north), where several clashes took place in recent weeks. They blocked routes and targeted their laser beams at riot police, which they charged at them.In a sample of the division in the city, thousands of government supporters also concentrated Saturday afternoon in a park to criticize the pro-democracy movement and support the police. This pro-government mobilization ended without incident shortly before the night.Pro-democracy demonstrations last Monday and Tuesday paralyzed Hong Kong Airport, one of the most important in the world. On the second day of mobilization at the airport, a group of radicalized protesters assaulted two men they accused of being Chinese spies. China's propaganda, in the wake of the aggressions, and the state media published a deluge of articles, images and videos about violence in the protests. They also disseminated images of Chinese soldiers and armored vehicles on the other side of the border in Shenzhen. The United States warned China that a military intervention would be a mistake, and experts believe it would be an economic and image disaster for the Asian giant.Load-Date: August 19, 2019End of Document

The S&P 500 is up 1.0%, which is comparable to the gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.0%), Nasdaq Composite (+1.1%), and Russell 2000 (+0.9%).Interestingly, the positive bias comes despite China's Foreign Ministry spokesman denying knowledge of any such calls, Chinese press downplaying the significance of Mr. Trump's claim, and the fact that trade talks were already scheduled for September. Today's advance also follows President Trump's declaration after Friday's close that he will raise the tariff rates on $525 billion of Chinese imports.The latter sent U.S. futures sharply lower in overnight action, but the market has since latched onto some hopeful thinking that the two sides can still work together to narrow their trade differences. China's Vice Premier said Beijing is willing to resolve their dispute through "calm" negotiations, which was a sentiment President Trump reciprocated at the G7 meeting in France earlier today.At this juncture, all 11 S&P 500 sectors are trading higher, including 1.2% gains in the communication services, information technology, and consumer staples sectors. Strikingly, the trade-sensitive materials sector (+0.4%) is trailing the pack.In corporate news, Bristol-Myers (BMY 48.05, +1.47, +3.2%) sold Celgene's (CELG 96.85, +2.85, +3.0%) blockbuster psoriasis drug Otezla to Amgen (AMGN 204.91, +5.80, +2.9%) for $13.4 billion in cash. TechnipFMC (FTI 24.57, +1.47, +6.4%), which is an energy component in the S&P 500, announced it will split into two publicly traded companies.Target (TGT 105.08, +1.59, +1.5%) and Walt Disney (DIS 134.00, +2.33, +1.8%), meanwhile, announced a collaboration to bring the Disney Store to select Target stores starting Oct. 4.Elsewhere, the overnight rally in the U.S. Treasury market has dissipated, leaving yields slightly higher. The 2-yr yield is up two basis points to 1.54%, and the 10-yr yield is up one basis point to 1.53% after falling to 1.45% in overnight action.Today's economic data was limited to the release of the July report for Durable Goods Orders:Durable goods orders increased 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus +1.2%) following a downwardly revised 1.8% increase (from 2.0%) in June. Excluding transportation, durable goods orders decreased 0.4% (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%) following a downwardly revised 0.8% increase (from 1.2%) in June.The key takeaway from the report is that orders for nondefense capital goods, excluding aircraft -- a proxy for business investment -- increased 0.4% in July on the heels of a 0.9% increase in June. Shipments, though, dropped 0.7%, which is a component that will factor into Q3 GDP forecasts. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1945/854. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1953/1036.12:25 ETDow +296.43 at 25925.31, Nasdaq +97.24 at 7849.03, S&P +31.20 at 2878.31[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 1.1%, and the tech-sensitive Nasdaq is up 1.2%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows Apple (AAPL 206.34, +3.69, +1.8%) leading the group higher with a gain near 2%.

The transaction is expected to be structured as a spin-off of TechnipFMC's Onshore/Offshore segment to be headquartered in Paris, France.Overseas, the major European indices closed on a higher note. Germany's DAX increased 0.4% and France's CAC increased 0.5%. UK's FTSE was closed for holiday. The Europe Stoxx 600 finished flat.11:30 ETDow +220.91 at 25849.79, Nasdaq +74.95 at 7826.74, S&P +23.14 at 2870.25[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have come up from earlier lows and now trade near their opening levels.

The S&P 500 energy sector (+0.6%) is among today's laggards, although it still holds a decent gain.Despite the higher start in equities, U.S. Treasuries are still seeing some demand, albeit much less than overnight activity. Currently, the yield on the benchmark 10-yr note is down one basis point to 1.51%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.3% to 97.95.10:55 ETDow +163.70 at 25792.58, Nasdaq +59.88 at 7811.67, S&P +16.82 at 2863.93[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 (+0.6%) continues to hold its positive posture while President Trump and France's President Macron hold a joint press conference at the G-7 summit in France.President Trump has reiterated his stance that China wants to make a trade deal and believes they are sincere about trade negotiations. Mr. Macron has said that he will work on a multilateral basis to find a solution to a digital tax, hoping to end the tax once international agreement is reached.Separately, Target (TGT 105.11, +1.62, +1.6%) and Walt Disney (DIS 133.60, +1.93, +1.5%) announced a retail collaboration to bring the Disney Store within select Target stores starting Oct. 4. with 40 additional locations opening by October 2020.10:30 ETDow +105.35 at 25734.23, Nasdaq +40.34 at 7792.13, S&P +10.39 at 2857.5[BRIEFING.COM] The stock market has come down from opening highs, leaving the S&P 500 with a current gain of 0.5%.The positive bias formed overnight after President Trump (from the G-7 summit in France) said that China called saying it wants to restart trade talks. Futures erased all losses and turned higher on those comments, which didn't provide the market anything it didn't already know. Trade talks were already planned for September.The market may have been relieved to hear that those talks were still in order despite President Trump announcing that he will increase the tariff rates on goods imported from China. Chinese press quickly downplayed the significance of Mr. Trump's comments, while the Vice Premier said Beijing would like to resolve the dispute through "calm" negotiations.09:55 ETDow +188.09 at 25816.97, Nasdaq +61.14 at 7812.93, S&P +19.48 at 2866.59[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades higher by 0.7%, and the Russell 2000 trades higher by 0.8%.Some corporate news today includes Celgene (CELG 97.37, +3.38, +3.6%) selling the worldwide rights of Otezla to Amgen (AMGN 203.63, +4.57, +2.3%) for $13.4 billion in cash. Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY 48.51, +1.92, +4.1%), which agreed to merge with Celgene, confirmed the deal to divest Otezla.Separately, shares of Apple (AAPL 205.92, +3.29, +1.6%) are providing solid support for today's rebound attempt.09:40 ETDow +239.59 at 25868.47, Nasdaq +71.84 at 7823.63, S&P +24.53 at 2871.64[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages begin the session rebounding from a steep sell-off on Friday following upbeat trade comments from President Trump. The S&P 500 is up 0.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.9%, and the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.9%.An early look inside the S&P 500 shows all 11 sectors trading higher with gains ranging from 0.6% (real estate) to 1.1% (information technology).U.S. Treasuries are little changed but are well off their highs from overnight action. The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.52%, and the 10-yr yield is up one basis point to 1.53%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.4% to 97.98.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +82.40.The stock market is indicated to open higher after futures turned sharply higher on President Trump's assertion that China called to restart trade talks. The S&P 500 futures trade 29 points, or 1.0%, above fair value.The market, however, already knew that talks were planned for September. The Chinese press also quickly downplayed the significance of the president's remarks. To be fair, though, there might have been some uncertainty if those trade talks would still be happening after President Trump announced after Friday's close that he will increase the tariff rates on goods imported from China.Regardless of what the market knew (or has yet to know), the U.S. Treasury market has reacted strongly to the news. The benchmark 10-yr note yield is currently up two basis points to 1.54% after falling to 1.45% in overnight action.08:50 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: +23.90. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +82.40.The S&P 500 futures trade 24 points, or 0.8%, above fair value.Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region started the week on a defensive note as investors reacted to a ratcheting up of the trade tension between the U.S. and China. After the close on Friday, President Trump said the tariff rate on the existing $250 billion tranche of Chinese goods would rise to 30% from 25%, effective October 1, and that the tariff rate on the newest $300 billion tranche of Chinese goods would increase to 15% from 10%.

In addition, China's Global Times editor, who is often viewed as a spokesman for the Chinese government, toned down the significance of the president's statement.

Attention quickly shifted to trade, however, after China announced tariffs on $75 billion of goods imported from the U.S on Sept. 1 and Dec. 15, which are the same dates the U.S. has planned for its tariffs on China. The tariff rate will range from 5-10%, including a separate 5-25% on autos and auto parts starting Dec. 15.Modest selling ensued, but stocks quickly recouped losses after Mr. Powell reiterated comments that upheld the market's view for further economic stimulus. The day had barely begun, though, and President Trump took to Twitter to lash out against both the Fed Chair and China. Stocks fell noticeably on the president's declaration that companies find alternatives to China.A steady broad-based retreat transpired during the day amid worries that escalated trade tensions will exacerbate slowing global growth and, by extension, affect corporate earnings. All 11 S&P 500 sectors finished in negative territory, which saw the energy (-3.4%) and information technology (-3.3%) sectors losing over 3%. The utilities sector (-1.1%) declined the least.Shares of Apple (AAPL 202.64, -9.82) fell 4.6% and other trade-sensitive areas like the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-4.4%) and Dow Jones Transportation Average (-3.3%) also posted steep losses. Shares of Foot Locker (FL 34.00, -7.93, -18.9%) plunged nearly 20% after the company missed top and bottom-line estimates.Amid the uncertainty and growth concerns, investors flocked to safe-haven assets like gold ($1537.25/oz, +$28.75, +1.9%), the Japanese yen, and U.S. Treasuries. In addition, expectations for further downside in equities contributed to a 17.8% spike in the CBOE Volatility Index (19.65, +2.97).The 2-yr yield dropped seven basis points to 1.53%, and the 10-yr yield dropped eight basis points to 1.53%. The U.S. Dollar Index fell 0.5% to 97.73. WTI crude fell 2.0%, or $1.12, to $54.16/bbl.President Trump also indicated he would officially respond to Beijing's actions in the afternoon. No response was announced by session's close, which may have contributed to some reservations to step into the action during the day.Friday's economic data was limited to New Home Sales for July:New home sales declined 12.8% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 635,000 (Briefing.com consensus 645,000) from an upwardly revised 728,000 (from 646,000) in June. New home sales were up 4.3% yr/yr.The key takeaway from the report is that there was a big upward revision for June, yet there was no follow-through in July despite low mortgage rates and lower median sales prices. Sales were down big in three of the four regions and the total number of new homes sold was still below the originally reported 646,000 increase for June.Looking ahead, investors will receive Durable Goods Orders for July on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +16.8% YTDS&P 500 +13.6% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +9.9% YTDRussell 2000 +8.2% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 402/2352. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 478/2602.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: August 26, 2019End of Document

The S&P 500 is up 1.0%, which is comparable to the gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.0%), Nasdaq Composite (+1.1%), and Russell 2000 (+0.9%).Interestingly, the positive bias comes despite China's Foreign Ministry spokesman denying knowledge of any such calls, Chinese press downplaying the significance of Mr. Trump's claim, and the fact that trade talks were already scheduled for September. Today's advance also follows President Trump's declaration after Friday's close that he will raise the tariff rates on $525 billion of Chinese imports.The latter sent U.S. futures sharply lower in overnight action, but the market has since latched onto some hopeful thinking that the two sides can still work together to narrow their trade differences. China's Vice Premier said Beijing is willing to resolve their dispute through "calm" negotiations, which was a sentiment President Trump reciprocated at the G7 meeting in France earlier today.At this juncture, all 11 S&P 500 sectors are trading higher, including 1.2% gains in the communication services, information technology, and consumer staples sectors. Strikingly, the trade-sensitive materials sector (+0.4%) is trailing the pack.In corporate news, Bristol-Myers (BMY 48.05, +1.47, +3.2%) sold Celgene's (CELG 96.85, +2.85, +3.0%) blockbuster psoriasis drug Otezla to Amgen (AMGN 204.91, +5.80, +2.9%) for $13.4 billion in cash. TechnipFMC (FTI 24.57, +1.47, +6.4%), which is an energy component in the S&P 500, announced it will split into two publicly traded companies.Target (TGT 105.08, +1.59, +1.5%) and Walt Disney (DIS 134.00, +2.33, +1.8%), meanwhile, announced a collaboration to bring the Disney Store to select Target stores starting Oct. 4.Elsewhere, the overnight rally in the U.S. Treasury market has dissipated, leaving yields slightly higher. The 2-yr yield is up two basis points to 1.54%, and the 10-yr yield is up one basis point to 1.53% after falling to 1.45% in overnight action.Today's economic data was limited to the release of the July report for Durable Goods Orders:Durable goods orders increased 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus +1.2%) following a downwardly revised 1.8% increase (from 2.0%) in June. Excluding transportation, durable goods orders decreased 0.4% (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%) following a downwardly revised 0.8% increase (from 1.2%) in June.The key takeaway from the report is that orders for nondefense capital goods, excluding aircraft -- a proxy for business investment -- increased 0.4% in July on the heels of a 0.9% increase in June. Shipments, though, dropped 0.7%, which is a component that will factor into Q3 GDP forecasts. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1945/854. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1953/1036.12:25 ETDow +296.43 at 25925.31, Nasdaq +97.24 at 7849.03, S&P +31.20 at 2878.31[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 1.1%, and the tech-sensitive Nasdaq is up 1.2%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows Apple (AAPL 206.34, +3.69, +1.8%) leading the group higher with a gain near 2%.

The transaction is expected to be structured as a spin-off of TechnipFMC's Onshore/Offshore segment to be headquartered in Paris, France.Overseas, the major European indices closed on a higher note. Germany's DAX increased 0.4% and France's CAC increased 0.5%. UK's FTSE was closed for holiday. The Europe Stoxx 600 finished flat.11:30 ETDow +220.91 at 25849.79, Nasdaq +74.95 at 7826.74, S&P +23.14 at 2870.25[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have come up from earlier lows and now trade near their opening levels. The S&P 500 is up 0.8%, the Dow is up 0.8%, and the Nasdaq is up 0.9%.Looking at energy, oil prices ($54.45/bbl, +$0.28, +0.5%) have come down from prior highs. The S&P 500 energy sector (+0.6%) is among today's laggards, although it still holds a decent gain.Despite the higher start in equities, U.S. Treasuries are still seeing some demand, albeit much less than overnight activity. Currently, the yield on the benchmark 10-yr note is down one basis point to 1.51%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.3% to 97.95.10:55 ETDow +163.70 at 25792.58, Nasdaq +59.88 at 7811.67, S&P +16.82 at 2863.93[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 (+0.6%) continues to hold its positive posture while President Trump and France's President Macron hold a joint press conference at the G-7 summit in France.President Trump has reiterated his stance that China wants to make a trade deal and believes they are sincere about trade negotiations. Mr. Macron has said that he will work on a multilateral basis to find a solution to a digital tax, hoping to end the tax once international agreement is reached.Separately, Target (TGT 105.11, +1.62, +1.6%) and Walt Disney (DIS 133.60, +1.93, +1.5%) announced a retail collaboration to bring the Disney Store within select Target stores starting Oct. 4. with 40 additional locations opening by October 2020.10:30 ETDow +105.35 at 25734.23, Nasdaq +40.34 at 7792.13, S&P +10.39 at 2857.5[BRIEFING.COM] The stock market has come down from opening highs, leaving the S&P 500 with a current gain of 0.5%.The positive bias formed overnight after President Trump (from the G-7 summit in France) said that China called saying it wants to restart trade talks. Futures erased all losses and turned higher on those comments, which didn't provide the market anything it didn't already know. Trade talks were already planned for September.The market may have been relieved to hear that those talks were still in order despite President Trump announcing that he will increase the tariff rates on goods imported from China. Chinese press quickly downplayed the significance of Mr. Trump's comments, while the Vice Premier said Beijing would like to resolve the dispute through "calm" negotiations.09:55 ETDow +188.09 at 25816.97, Nasdaq +61.14 at 7812.93, S&P +19.48 at 2866.59[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades higher by 0.7%, and the Russell 2000 trades higher by 0.8%.Some corporate news today includes Celgene (CELG 97.37, +3.38, +3.6%) selling the worldwide rights of Otezla to Amgen (AMGN 203.63, +4.57, +2.3%) for $13.4 billion in cash.

The Chinese press also quickly downplayed the significance of the president's remarks.

China said it is willing to resolve the trade dispute through "calm negotiations." President Trump said today that China called U.S. officials Sunday to say they want to re-start the trade talks.

Attention quickly shifted to trade, however, after China announced tariffs on $75 billion of goods imported from the U.S on Sept. 1 and Dec. 15, which are the same dates the U.S. has planned for its tariffs on China. The tariff rate will range from 5-10%, including a separate 5-25% on autos and auto parts starting Dec. 15.Modest selling ensued, but stocks quickly recouped losses after Mr. Powell reiterated comments that upheld the market's view for further economic stimulus. The day had barely begun, though, and President Trump took to Twitter to lash out against both the Fed Chair and China. Stocks fell noticeably on the president's declaration that companies find alternatives to China.A steady broad-based retreat transpired during the day amid worries that escalated trade tensions will exacerbate slowing global growth and, by extension, affect corporate earnings. All 11 S&P 500 sectors finished in negative territory, which saw the energy (-3.4%) and information technology (-3.3%) sectors losing over 3%. The utilities sector (-1.1%) declined the least.Shares of Apple (AAPL 202.64, -9.82) fell 4.6% and other trade-sensitive areas like the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-4.4%) and Dow Jones Transportation Average (-3.3%) also posted steep losses. Shares of Foot Locker (FL 34.00, -7.93, -18.9%) plunged nearly 20% after the company missed top and bottom-line estimates.Amid the uncertainty and growth concerns, investors flocked to safe-haven assets like gold ($1537.25/oz, +$28.75, +1.9%), the Japanese yen, and U.S. Treasuries. In addition, expectations for further downside in equities contributed to a 17.8% spike in the CBOE Volatility Index (19.65, +2.97).The 2-yr yield dropped seven basis points to 1.53%, and the 10-yr yield dropped eight basis points to 1.53%. The U.S. Dollar Index fell 0.5% to 97.73. WTI crude fell 2.0%, or $1.12, to $54.16/bbl.President Trump also indicated he would officially respond to Beijing's actions in the afternoon. No response was announced by session's close, which may have contributed to some reservations to step into the action during the day.Friday's economic data was limited to New Home Sales for July:New home sales declined 12.8% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 635,000 (Briefing.com consensus 645,000) from an upwardly revised 728,000 (from 646,000) in June. New home sales were up 4.3% yr/yr.The key takeaway from the report is that there was a big upward revision for June, yet there was no follow-through in July despite low mortgage rates and lower median sales prices. Sales were down big in three of the four regions and the total number of new homes sold was still below the originally reported 646,000 increase for June.Looking ahead, investors will receive Durable Goods Orders for July on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +16.8% YTDS&P 500 +13.6% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +9.9% YTDRussell 2000 +8.2% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 402/2352. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 478/2602.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: August 26, 2019End of Document

The S&P 500 is up 1.0%, which is comparable to the gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.0%), Nasdaq Composite (+1.1%), and Russell 2000 (+0.9%).Interestingly, the positive bias comes despite China's Foreign Ministry spokesman denying knowledge of any such calls, Chinese press downplaying the significance of Mr. Trump's claim, and the fact that trade talks were already scheduled for September. Today's advance also follows President Trump's declaration after Friday's close that he will raise the tariff rates on $525 billion of Chinese imports.The latter sent U.S. futures sharply lower in overnight action, but the market has since latched onto some hopeful thinking that the two sides can still work together to narrow their trade differences. China's Vice Premier said Beijing is willing to resolve their dispute through "calm" negotiations, which was a sentiment President Trump reciprocated at the G7 meeting in France earlier today.At this juncture, all 11 S&P 500 sectors are trading higher, including 1.2% gains in the communication services, information technology, and consumer staples sectors. Strikingly, the trade-sensitive materials sector (+0.4%) is trailing the pack.In corporate news, Bristol-Myers (BMY 48.05, +1.47, +3.2%) sold Celgene's (CELG 96.85, +2.85, +3.0%) blockbuster psoriasis drug Otezla to Amgen (AMGN 204.91, +5.80, +2.9%) for $13.4 billion in cash. TechnipFMC (FTI 24.57, +1.47, +6.4%), which is an energy component in the S&P 500, announced it will split into two publicly traded companies.Target (TGT 105.08, +1.59, +1.5%) and Walt Disney (DIS 134.00, +2.33, +1.8%), meanwhile, announced a collaboration to bring the Disney Store to select Target stores starting Oct. 4.Elsewhere, the overnight rally in the U.S. Treasury market has dissipated, leaving yields slightly higher. The 2-yr yield is up two basis points to 1.54%, and the 10-yr yield is up one basis point to 1.53% after falling to 1.45% in overnight action.Today's economic data was limited to the release of the July report for Durable Goods Orders:Durable goods orders increased 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus +1.2%) following a downwardly revised 1.8% increase (from 2.0%) in June. Excluding transportation, durable goods orders decreased 0.4% (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%) following a downwardly revised 0.8% increase (from 1.2%) in June.The key takeaway from the report is that orders for nondefense capital goods, excluding aircraft -- a proxy for business investment -- increased 0.4% in July on the heels of a 0.9% increase in June. Shipments, though, dropped 0.7%, which is a component that will factor into Q3 GDP forecasts. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1945/854. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1953/1036.12:25 ETDow +296.43 at 25925.31, Nasdaq +97.24 at 7849.03, S&P +31.20 at 2878.31[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 1.1%, and the tech-sensitive Nasdaq is up 1.2%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows Apple (AAPL 206.34, +3.69, +1.8%) leading the group higher with a gain near 2%. Facebook (FB 179.63, +1.88, +1.1%), Amazon (AMZN 1761.58, +11.96, +0.7%), Netflix (NFLX 294.67, +3.23, +1.1%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1165.00, +13.89, +1.2%) follow suit with decent gains.Fellow mega-cap stock Microsoft (MFST 135.38, +1.99) is up 1.5%.11:55 ETDow +186.76 at 25815.64, Nasdaq +66.95 at 7818.74, S&P +20.23 at 2867.34[BRIEFING.COM] The market continues to trade sideways with the S&P 500 currently up 0.7%.TechnipFMC (FTI 23.44, halted), which is a component of the S&P 500 energy sector, recently announced it will separate into two independent, publicly traded companies. The transaction is expected to be structured as a spin-off of TechnipFMC's Onshore/Offshore segment to be headquartered in Paris, France.Overseas, the major European indices closed on a higher note. Germany's DAX increased 0.4% and France's CAC increased 0.5%. UK's FTSE was closed for holiday. The Europe Stoxx 600 finished flat.11:30 ETDow +220.91 at 25849.79, Nasdaq +74.95 at 7826.74, S&P +23.14 at 2870.25[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have come up from earlier lows and now trade near their opening levels. The S&P 500 is up 0.8%, the Dow is up 0.8%, and the Nasdaq is up 0.9%.Looking at energy, oil prices ($54.45/bbl, +$0.28, +0.5%) have come down from prior highs. The S&P 500 energy sector (+0.6%) is among today's laggards, although it still holds a decent gain.Despite the higher start in equities, U.S. Treasuries are still seeing some demand, albeit much less than overnight activity. Currently, the yield on the benchmark 10-yr note is down one basis point to 1.51%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.3% to 97.95.10:55 ETDow +163.70 at 25792.58, Nasdaq +59.88 at 7811.67, S&P +16.82 at 2863.93[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 (+0.6%) continues to hold its positive posture while President Trump and France's President Macron hold a joint press conference at the G-7 summit in France.President Trump has reiterated his stance that China wants to make a trade deal and believes they are sincere about trade negotiations. Mr. Macron has said that he will work on a multilateral basis to find a solution to a digital tax, hoping to end the tax once international agreement is reached.Separately, Target (TGT 105.11, +1.62, +1.6%) and Walt Disney (DIS 133.60, +1.93, +1.5%) announced a retail collaboration to bring the Disney Store within select Target stores starting Oct. 4. with 40 additional locations opening by October 2020.10:30 ETDow +105.35 at 25734.23, Nasdaq +40.34 at 7792.13, S&P +10.39 at 2857.5[BRIEFING.COM] The stock market has come down from opening highs, leaving the S&P 500 with a current gain of 0.5%.The positive bias formed overnight after President Trump (from the G-7 summit in France) said that China called saying it wants to restart trade talks. Futures erased all losses and turned higher on those comments, which didn't provide the market anything it didn't already know. Trade talks were already planned for September.The market may have been relieved to hear that those talks were still in order despite President Trump announcing that he will increase the tariff rates on goods imported from China. Chinese press quickly downplayed the significance of Mr. Trump's comments, while the Vice Premier said Beijing would like to resolve the dispute through "calm" negotiations.09:55 ETDow +188.09 at 25816.97, Nasdaq +61.14 at 7812.93, S&P +19.48 at 2866.59[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades higher by 0.7%, and the Russell 2000 trades higher by 0.8%.Some corporate news today includes Celgene (CELG 97.37, +3.38, +3.6%) selling the worldwide rights of Otezla to Amgen (AMGN 203.63, +4.57, +2.3%) for $13.4 billion in cash. Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY 48.51, +1.92, +4.1%), which agreed to merge with Celgene, confirmed the deal to divest Otezla.Separately, shares of Apple (AAPL 205.92, +3.29, +1.6%) are providing solid support for today's rebound attempt.09:40 ETDow +239.59 at 25868.47, Nasdaq +71.84 at 7823.63, S&P +24.53 at 2871.64[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages begin the session rebounding from a steep sell-off on Friday following upbeat trade comments from President Trump.

The S&P 500 futures trade 29 points, or 1.0%, above fair value.The market, however, already knew that talks were planned for September. The Chinese press also quickly downplayed the significance of the president's remarks. To be fair, though, there might have been some uncertainty if those trade talks would still be happening after President Trump announced after Friday's close that he will increase the tariff rates on goods imported from China.Regardless of what the market knew (or has yet to know), the U.S. Treasury market has reacted strongly to the news.

Attention quickly shifted to trade, however, after China announced tariffs on $75 billion of goods imported from the U.S on Sept. 1 and Dec. 15, which are the same dates the U.S. has planned for its tariffs on China. The tariff rate will range from 5-10%, including a separate 5-25% on autos and auto parts starting Dec. 15.Modest selling ensued, but stocks quickly recouped losses after Mr. Powell reiterated comments that upheld the market's view for further economic stimulus. The day had barely begun, though, and President Trump took to Twitter to lash out against both the Fed Chair and China. Stocks fell noticeably on the president's declaration that companies find alternatives to China.A steady broad-based retreat transpired during the day amid worries that escalated trade tensions will exacerbate slowing global growth and, by extension, affect corporate earnings. All 11 S&P 500 sectors finished in negative territory, which saw the energy (-3.4%) and information technology (-3.3%) sectors losing over 3%. The utilities sector (-1.1%) declined the least.Shares of Apple (AAPL 202.64, -9.82) fell 4.6% and other trade-sensitive areas like the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-4.4%) and Dow Jones Transportation Average (-3.3%) also posted steep losses. Shares of Foot Locker (FL 34.00, -7.93, -18.9%) plunged nearly 20% after the company missed top and bottom-line estimates.Amid the uncertainty and growth concerns, investors flocked to safe-haven assets like gold ($1537.25/oz, +$28.75, +1.9%), the Japanese yen, and U.S. Treasuries. In addition, expectations for further downside in equities contributed to a 17.8% spike in the CBOE Volatility Index (19.65, +2.97).The 2-yr yield dropped seven basis points to 1.53%, and the 10-yr yield dropped eight basis points to 1.53%. The U.S. Dollar Index fell 0.5% to 97.73. WTI crude fell 2.0%, or $1.12, to $54.16/bbl.President Trump also indicated he would officially respond to Beijing's actions in the afternoon. No response was announced by session's close, which may have contributed to some reservations to step into the action during the day.Friday's economic data was limited to New Home Sales for July:New home sales declined 12.8% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 635,000 (Briefing.com consensus 645,000) from an upwardly revised 728,000 (from 646,000) in June. New home sales were up 4.3% yr/yr.The key takeaway from the report is that there was a big upward revision for June, yet there was no follow-through in July despite low mortgage rates and lower median sales prices. Sales were down big in three of the four regions and the total number of new homes sold was still below the originally reported 646,000 increase for June.Looking ahead, investors will receive Durable Goods Orders for July on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +16.8% YTDS&P 500 +13.6% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +9.9% YTDRussell 2000 +8.2% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 402/2352. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 478/2602.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: August 26, 2019End of Document

The S&P 500 is up 1.0%, which is comparable to the gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.0%), Nasdaq Composite (+1.1%), and Russell 2000 (+0.9%).Interestingly, the positive bias comes despite China's Foreign Ministry spokesman denying knowledge of any such calls, Chinese press downplaying the significance of Mr. Trump's claim, and the fact that trade talks were already scheduled for September. Today's advance also follows President Trump's declaration after Friday's close that he will raise the tariff rates on $525 billion of Chinese imports.The latter sent U.S. futures sharply lower in overnight action, but the market has since latched onto some hopeful thinking that the two sides can still work together to narrow their trade differences. China's Vice Premier said Beijing is willing to resolve their dispute through "calm" negotiations, which was a sentiment President Trump reciprocated at the G7 meeting in France earlier today.At this juncture, all 11 S&P 500 sectors are trading higher, including 1.2% gains in the communication services, information technology, and consumer staples sectors. Strikingly, the trade-sensitive materials sector (+0.4%) is trailing the pack.In corporate news, Bristol-Myers (BMY 48.05, +1.47, +3.2%) sold Celgene's (CELG 96.85, +2.85, +3.0%) blockbuster psoriasis drug Otezla to Amgen (AMGN 204.91, +5.80, +2.9%) for $13.4 billion in cash. TechnipFMC (FTI 24.57, +1.47, +6.4%), which is an energy component in the S&P 500, announced it will split into two publicly traded companies.Target (TGT 105.08, +1.59, +1.5%) and Walt Disney (DIS 134.00, +2.33, +1.8%), meanwhile, announced a collaboration to bring the Disney Store to select Target stores starting Oct. 4.Elsewhere, the overnight rally in the U.S. Treasury market has dissipated, leaving yields slightly higher. The 2-yr yield is up two basis points to 1.54%, and the 10-yr yield is up one basis point to 1.53% after falling to 1.45% in overnight action.Today's economic data was limited to the release of the July report for Durable Goods Orders:Durable goods orders increased 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus +1.2%) following a downwardly revised 1.8% increase (from 2.0%) in June. Excluding transportation, durable goods orders decreased 0.4% (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%) following a downwardly revised 0.8% increase (from 1.2%) in June.The key takeaway from the report is that orders for nondefense capital goods, excluding aircraft -- a proxy for business investment -- increased 0.4% in July on the heels of a 0.9% increase in June. Shipments, though, dropped 0.7%, which is a component that will factor into Q3 GDP forecasts. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1945/854. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1953/1036.12:25 ETDow +296.43 at 25925.31, Nasdaq +97.24 at 7849.03, S&P +31.20 at 2878.31[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 1.1%, and the tech-sensitive Nasdaq is up 1.2%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows Apple (AAPL 206.34, +3.69, +1.8%) leading the group higher with a gain near 2%. Facebook (FB 179.63, +1.88, +1.1%), Amazon (AMZN 1761.58, +11.96, +0.7%), Netflix (NFLX 294.67, +3.23, +1.1%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1165.00, +13.89, +1.2%) follow suit with decent gains.Fellow mega-cap stock Microsoft (MFST 135.38, +1.99) is up 1.5%.11:55 ETDow +186.76 at 25815.64, Nasdaq +66.95 at 7818.74, S&P +20.23 at 2867.34[BRIEFING.COM] The market continues to trade sideways with the S&P 500 currently up 0.7%.TechnipFMC (FTI 23.44, halted), which is a component of the S&P 500 energy sector, recently announced it will separate into two independent, publicly traded companies. The transaction is expected to be structured as a spin-off of TechnipFMC's Onshore/Offshore segment to be headquartered in Paris, France.Overseas, the major European indices closed on a higher note. Germany's DAX increased 0.4% and France's CAC increased 0.5%. UK's FTSE was closed for holiday. The Europe Stoxx 600 finished flat.11:30 ETDow +220.91 at 25849.79, Nasdaq +74.95 at 7826.74, S&P +23.14 at 2870.25[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have come up from earlier lows and now trade near their opening levels. The S&P 500 is up 0.8%, the Dow is up 0.8%, and the Nasdaq is up 0.9%.Looking at energy, oil prices ($54.45/bbl, +$0.28, +0.5%) have come down from prior highs. The S&P 500 energy sector (+0.6%) is among today's laggards, although it still holds a decent gain.Despite the higher start in equities, U.S. Treasuries are still seeing some demand, albeit much less than overnight activity. Currently, the yield on the benchmark 10-yr note is down one basis point to 1.51%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.3% to 97.95.10:55 ETDow +163.70 at 25792.58, Nasdaq +59.88 at 7811.67, S&P +16.82 at 2863.93[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 (+0.6%) continues to hold its positive posture while President Trump and France's President Macron hold a joint press conference at the G-7 summit in France.President Trump has reiterated his stance that China wants to make a trade deal and believes they are sincere about trade negotiations. Mr. Macron has said that he will work on a multilateral basis to find a solution to a digital tax, hoping to end the tax once international agreement is reached.Separately, Target (TGT 105.11, +1.62, +1.6%) and Walt Disney (DIS 133.60, +1.93, +1.5%) announced a retail collaboration to bring the Disney Store within select Target stores starting Oct. 4. with 40 additional locations opening by October 2020.10:30 ETDow +105.35 at 25734.23, Nasdaq +40.34 at 7792.13, S&P +10.39 at 2857.5[BRIEFING.COM] The stock market has come down from opening highs, leaving the S&P 500 with a current gain of 0.5%.The positive bias formed overnight after President Trump (from the G-7 summit in France) said that China called saying it wants to restart trade talks. Futures erased all losses and turned higher on those comments, which didn't provide the market anything it didn't already know. Trade talks were already planned for September.The market may have been relieved to hear that those talks were still in order despite President Trump announcing that he will increase the tariff rates on goods imported from China. Chinese press quickly downplayed the significance of Mr. Trump's comments, while the Vice Premier said Beijing would like to resolve the dispute through "calm" negotiations.09:55 ETDow +188.09 at 25816.97, Nasdaq +61.14 at 7812.93, S&P +19.48 at 2866.59[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades higher by 0.7%, and the Russell 2000 trades higher by 0.8%.Some corporate news today includes Celgene (CELG 97.37, +3.38, +3.6%) selling the worldwide rights of Otezla to Amgen (AMGN 203.63, +4.57, +2.3%) for $13.4 billion in cash. Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY 48.51, +1.92, +4.1%), which agreed to merge with Celgene, confirmed the deal to divest Otezla.Separately, shares of Apple (AAPL 205.92, +3.29, +1.6%) are providing solid support for today's rebound attempt.09:40 ETDow +239.59 at 25868.47, Nasdaq +71.84 at 7823.63, S&P +24.53 at 2871.64[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages begin the session rebounding from a steep sell-off on Friday following upbeat trade comments from President Trump. The S&P 500 is up 0.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.9%, and the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.9%.An early look inside the S&P 500 shows all 11 sectors trading higher with gains ranging from 0.6% (real estate) to 1.1% (information technology).U.S. Treasuries are little changed but are well off their highs from overnight action. The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.52%, and the 10-yr yield is up one basis point to 1.53%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.4% to 97.98.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +82.40.The stock market is indicated to open higher after futures turned sharply higher on President Trump's assertion that China called to restart trade talks. The S&P 500 futures trade 29 points, or 1.0%, above fair value.The market, however, already knew that talks were planned for September. The Chinese press also quickly downplayed the significance of the president's remarks. To be fair, though, there might have been some uncertainty if those trade talks would still be happening after President Trump announced after Friday's close that he will increase the tariff rates on goods imported from China.Regardless of what the market knew (or has yet to know), the U.S. Treasury market has reacted strongly to the news.

After the close on Friday, President Trump said the tariff rate on the existing $250 billion tranche of Chinese goods would rise to 30% from 25%, effective October 1, and that the tariff rate on the newest $300 billion tranche of Chinese goods would increase to 15% from 10%. China said it is willing to resolve the trade dispute through "calm negotiations." President Trump said today that China called U.S. officials Sunday to say they want to re-start the trade talks. This news helped turn the negative tide in the futures market, yet this call was reportedly already scheduled.

Specifically, the current 25% tariff rate on $250 billion of goods will be raised to 30% on Oct. 1, and the 10% tariff rate on $300 billion of goods scheduled to be imposed on Sept. 1 and Dec. 15 will be raised to 15%.It should be noted that trade talks were already planned for September. In addition, China's Global Times editor, who is often viewed as a spokesman for the Chinese government, toned down the significance of the president's statement.

Attention quickly shifted to trade, however, after China announced tariffs on $75 billion of goods imported from the U.S on Sept. 1 and Dec. 15, which are the same dates the U.S. has planned for its tariffs on China. The tariff rate will range from 5-10%, including a separate 5-25% on autos and auto parts starting Dec. 15.Modest selling ensued, but stocks quickly recouped losses after Mr. Powell reiterated comments that upheld the market's view for further economic stimulus. The day had barely begun, though, and President Trump took to Twitter to lash out against both the Fed Chair and China. Stocks fell noticeably on the president's declaration that companies find alternatives to China.A steady broad-based retreat transpired during the day amid worries that escalated trade tensions will exacerbate slowing global growth and, by extension, affect corporate earnings. All 11 S&P 500 sectors finished in negative territory, which saw the energy (-3.4%) and information technology (-3.3%) sectors losing over 3%. The utilities sector (-1.1%) declined the least.Shares of Apple (AAPL 202.64, -9.82) fell 4.6% and other trade-sensitive areas like the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-4.4%) and Dow Jones Transportation Average (-3.3%) also posted steep losses. Shares of Foot Locker (FL 34.00, -7.93, -18.9%) plunged nearly 20% after the company missed top and bottom-line estimates.Amid the uncertainty and growth concerns, investors flocked to safe-haven assets like gold ($1537.25/oz, +$28.75, +1.9%), the Japanese yen, and U.S. Treasuries. In addition, expectations for further downside in equities contributed to a 17.8% spike in the CBOE Volatility Index (19.65, +2.97).The 2-yr yield dropped seven basis points to 1.53%, and the 10-yr yield dropped eight basis points to 1.53%. The U.S. Dollar Index fell 0.5% to 97.73. WTI crude fell 2.0%, or $1.12, to $54.16/bbl.President Trump also indicated he would officially respond to Beijing's actions in the afternoon. No response was announced by session's close, which may have contributed to some reservations to step into the action during the day.Friday's economic data was limited to New Home Sales for July:New home sales declined 12.8% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 635,000 (Briefing.com consensus 645,000) from an upwardly revised 728,000 (from 646,000) in June. New home sales were up 4.3% yr/yr.The key takeaway from the report is that there was a big upward revision for June, yet there was no follow-through in July despite low mortgage rates and lower median sales prices. Sales were down big in three of the four regions and the total number of new homes sold was still below the originally reported 646,000 increase for June.Looking ahead, investors will receive Durable Goods Orders for July on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +16.8% YTDS&P 500 +13.6% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +9.9% YTDRussell 2000 +8.2% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 402/2352. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 478/2602.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: August 26, 2019End of Document

For its part, FTI sits higher after announcing its intention to split into two publicly traded companies, DISH gains in reaction to a Raymond James upgrade, and CTL moves up helped by broader strength in the tech and telecom sectors.Conversely, Victoria's Secret owner L Brands (LB 16.87, -0.66, -3.76%) sits at the bottom of the index.14:00 ETDow +200.60 at 25829.48, Nasdaq +78.57 at 7830.36, S&P +23.01 at 2870.12[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have trickled slightly lower in the last half hour, though the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite still holds gains above 1.0%.Gold futures settled $0.40 lower (-0.03%) to $1,537.20/oz on Monday; the yellow metal showed gains of 1.8% at one point this morning, but gave up its advance as the broader market pushed higher in reaction to trade talk comments.The U.S. Dollar Index gains just over 0.4% to 98.04 on Monday.13:30 ETDow +236.83 at 25865.71, Nasdaq +85.01 at 7836.8, S&P +26.31 at 2873.42[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages still stand higher across the board to this point Monday, little changed in the last half hour.Garnering a decent recovery from Friday's sell off, Dow Jones Industrial Average components like Apple (AAPL 206.27, +3.63, +1.79%), Nike (NKE 81.88, +1.44, +1.79%), and Walt Disney (DIS 133.90, +2.23, +1.69%) drive today's upside.Conversely, American Express (AXP 117.84, +0.08, +0.07%), though still in positive territory, slightly underperforms the broader advance.The DJIA now sits just 3.72% lower on the month vs 5.68% from a little over a week ago.12:55 ETDow +253.09 at 25881.97, Nasdaq +84.36 at 7836.15, S&P +26.79 at 2873.9[BRIEFING.COM] The stock market begins the week rebounding from last week's decline after President Trump said China called to express interest in restarting trade talks. The S&P 500 is up 1.0%, which is comparable to the gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.0%), Nasdaq Composite (+1.1%), and Russell 2000 (+0.9%).Interestingly, the positive bias comes despite China's Foreign Ministry spokesman denying knowledge of any such calls, Chinese press downplaying the significance of Mr. Trump's claim, and the fact that trade talks were already scheduled for September. Today's advance also follows President Trump's declaration after Friday's close that he will raise the tariff rates on $525 billion of Chinese imports.The latter sent U.S. futures sharply lower in overnight action, but the market has since latched onto some hopeful thinking that the two sides can still work together to narrow their trade differences. China's Vice Premier said Beijing is willing to resolve their dispute through "calm" negotiations, which was a sentiment President Trump reciprocated at the G7 meeting in France earlier today.At this juncture, all 11 S&P 500 sectors are trading higher, including 1.2% gains in the communication services, information technology, and consumer staples sectors. Strikingly, the trade-sensitive materials sector (+0.4%) is trailing the pack.In corporate news, Bristol-Myers (BMY 48.05, +1.47, +3.2%) sold Celgene's (CELG 96.85, +2.85, +3.0%) blockbuster psoriasis drug Otezla to Amgen (AMGN 204.91, +5.80, +2.9%) for $13.4 billion in cash. TechnipFMC (FTI 24.57, +1.47, +6.4%), which is an energy component in the S&P 500, announced it will split into two publicly traded companies.Target (TGT 105.08, +1.59, +1.5%) and Walt Disney (DIS 134.00, +2.33, +1.8%), meanwhile, announced a collaboration to bring the Disney Store to select Target stores starting Oct. 4.Elsewhere, the overnight rally in the U.S. Treasury market has dissipated, leaving yields slightly higher. The 2-yr yield is up two basis points to 1.54%, and the 10-yr yield is up one basis point to 1.53% after falling to 1.45% in overnight action.Today's economic data was limited to the release of the July report for Durable Goods Orders:Durable goods orders increased 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus +1.2%) following a downwardly revised 1.8% increase (from 2.0%) in June. Excluding transportation, durable goods orders decreased 0.4% (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%) following a downwardly revised 0.8% increase (from 1.2%) in June.The key takeaway from the report is that orders for nondefense capital goods, excluding aircraft -- a proxy for business investment -- increased 0.4% in July on the heels of a 0.9% increase in June. Shipments, though, dropped 0.7%, which is a component that will factor into Q3 GDP forecasts. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1945/854. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1953/1036.12:25 ETDow +296.43 at 25925.31, Nasdaq +97.24 at 7849.03, S&P +31.20 at 2878.31[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 1.1%, and the tech-sensitive Nasdaq is up 1.2%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows Apple (AAPL 206.34, +3.69, +1.8%) leading the group higher with a gain near 2%. Facebook (FB 179.63, +1.88, +1.1%), Amazon (AMZN 1761.58, +11.96, +0.7%), Netflix (NFLX 294.67, +3.23, +1.1%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1165.00, +13.89, +1.2%) follow suit with decent gains.Fellow mega-cap stock Microsoft (MFST 135.38, +1.99) is up 1.5%.11:55 ETDow +186.76 at 25815.64, Nasdaq +66.95 at 7818.74, S&P +20.23 at 2867.34[BRIEFING.COM] The market continues to trade sideways with the S&P 500 currently up 0.7%.TechnipFMC (FTI 23.44, halted), which is a component of the S&P 500 energy sector, recently announced it will separate into two independent, publicly traded companies. The transaction is expected to be structured as a spin-off of TechnipFMC's Onshore/Offshore segment to be headquartered in Paris, France.Overseas, the major European indices closed on a higher note. Germany's DAX increased 0.4% and France's CAC increased 0.5%. UK's FTSE was closed for holiday. The Europe Stoxx 600 finished flat.11:30 ETDow +220.91 at 25849.79, Nasdaq +74.95 at 7826.74, S&P +23.14 at 2870.25[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have come up from earlier lows and now trade near their opening levels. The S&P 500 is up 0.8%, the Dow is up 0.8%, and the Nasdaq is up 0.9%.Looking at energy, oil prices ($54.45/bbl, +$0.28, +0.5%) have come down from prior highs. The S&P 500 energy sector (+0.6%) is among today's laggards, although it still holds a decent gain.Despite the higher start in equities, U.S. Treasuries are still seeing some demand, albeit much less than overnight activity. Currently, the yield on the benchmark 10-yr note is down one basis point to 1.51%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.3% to 97.95.10:55 ETDow +163.70 at 25792.58, Nasdaq +59.88 at 7811.67, S&P +16.82 at 2863.93[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 (+0.6%) continues to hold its positive posture while President Trump and France's President Macron hold a joint press conference at the G-7 summit in France.President Trump has reiterated his stance that China wants to make a trade deal and believes they are sincere about trade negotiations. Mr. Macron has said that he will work on a multilateral basis to find a solution to a digital tax, hoping to end the tax once international agreement is reached.Separately, Target (TGT 105.11, +1.62, +1.6%) and Walt Disney (DIS 133.60, +1.93, +1.5%) announced a retail collaboration to bring the Disney Store within select Target stores starting Oct. 4. with 40 additional locations opening by October 2020.10:30 ETDow +105.35 at 25734.23, Nasdaq +40.34 at 7792.13, S&P +10.39 at 2857.5[BRIEFING.COM] The stock market has come down from opening highs, leaving the S&P 500 with a current gain of 0.5%.The positive bias formed overnight after President Trump (from the G-7 summit in France) said that China called saying it wants to restart trade talks. Futures erased all losses and turned higher on those comments, which didn't provide the market anything it didn't already know. Trade talks were already planned for September.The market may have been relieved to hear that those talks were still in order despite President Trump announcing that he will increase the tariff rates on goods imported from China. Chinese press quickly downplayed the significance of Mr. Trump's comments, while the Vice Premier said Beijing would like to resolve the dispute through "calm" negotiations.09:55 ETDow +188.09 at 25816.97, Nasdaq +61.14 at 7812.93, S&P +19.48 at 2866.59[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades higher by 0.7%, and the Russell 2000 trades higher by 0.8%.Some corporate news today includes Celgene (CELG 97.37, +3.38, +3.6%) selling the worldwide rights of Otezla to Amgen (AMGN 203.63, +4.57, +2.3%) for $13.4 billion in cash. Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY 48.51, +1.92, +4.1%), which agreed to merge with Celgene, confirmed the deal to divest Otezla.Separately, shares of Apple (AAPL 205.92, +3.29, +1.6%) are providing solid support for today's rebound attempt.09:40 ETDow +239.59 at 25868.47, Nasdaq +71.84 at 7823.63, S&P +24.53 at 2871.64[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages begin the session rebounding from a steep sell-off on Friday following upbeat trade comments from President Trump. The S&P 500 is up 0.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.9%, and the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.9%.An early look inside the S&P 500 shows all 11 sectors trading higher with gains ranging from 0.6% (real estate) to 1.1% (information technology).U.S. Treasuries are little changed but are well off their highs from overnight action. The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.52%, and the 10-yr yield is up one basis point to 1.53%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.4% to 97.98. WTI crude is up 1.6% to $55.05/bbl.09:15 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: +29.10. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +82.40.The stock market is indicated to open higher after futures turned sharply higher on President Trump's assertion that China called to restart trade talks. The S&P 500 futures trade 29 points, or 1.0%, above fair value.The market, however, already knew that talks were planned for September. The Chinese press also quickly downplayed the significance of the president's remarks. To be fair, though, there might have been some uncertainty if those trade talks would still be happening after President Trump announced after Friday's close that he will increase the tariff rates on goods imported from China.Regardless of what the market knew (or has yet to know), the U.S. Treasury market has reacted strongly to the news.

After the close on Friday, President Trump said the tariff rate on the existing $250 billion tranche of Chinese goods would rise to 30% from 25%, effective October 1, and that the tariff rate on the newest $300 billion tranche of Chinese goods would increase to 15% from 10%. China said it is willing to resolve the trade dispute through "calm negotiations." President Trump said today that China called U.S. officials Sunday to say they want to re-start the trade talks. This news helped turn the negative tide in the futures market, yet this call was reportedly already scheduled.

The trade battle between the U.S. and China overshadowed the G7 meeting in France over the weekend and all else on the macro front. In Europe, Italy is still dealing with political uncertainty as the 5-Star and Democratic parties have been unable yet to agree on a new leader.

The S&P 500 futures trade 26 points, or 0.9%, above fair value after trading as low as 1.3% below fair value last evening.Futures opened lower in response to President Trump announcing after Friday's close that he will raise the tariff rates on goods imported from China. Specifically, the current 25% tariff rate on $250 billion of goods will be raised to 30% on Oct. 1, and the 10% tariff rate on $300 billion of goods scheduled to be imposed on Sept. 1 and Dec. 15 will be raised to 15%.It should be noted that trade talks were already planned for September. In addition, China's Global Times editor, who is often viewed as a spokesman for the Chinese government, toned down the significance of the president's statement. China's Vice Premier Liu He said on Monday Beijing is willing to resolve the trade dispute through "calm negotiations."Today's economic data will be limited to Durable Goods Orders for July (Briefing.com consensus 1.2%) at 8:30 a.m. ET.U.S. Treasuries have sold off from prior levels amid the turnaround in equity futures, although Treasuries are still up modestly.

Attention quickly shifted to trade, however, after China announced tariffs on $75 billion of goods imported from the U.S on Sept. 1 and Dec. 15, which are the same dates the U.S. has planned for its tariffs on China. The tariff rate will range from 5-10%, including a separate 5-25% on autos and auto parts starting Dec. 15.Modest selling ensued, but stocks quickly recouped losses after Mr. Powell reiterated comments that upheld the market's view for further economic stimulus. The day had barely begun, though, and President Trump took to Twitter to lash out against both the Fed Chair and China. Stocks fell noticeably on the president's declaration that companies find alternatives to China.A steady broad-based retreat transpired during the day amid worries that escalated trade tensions will exacerbate slowing global growth and, by extension, affect corporate earnings. All 11 S&P 500 sectors finished in negative territory, which saw the energy (-3.4%) and information technology (-3.3%) sectors losing over 3%. The utilities sector (-1.1%) declined the least.Shares of Apple (AAPL 202.64, -9.82) fell 4.6% and other trade-sensitive areas like the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-4.4%) and Dow Jones Transportation Average (-3.3%) also posted steep losses. Shares of Foot Locker (FL 34.00, -7.93, -18.9%) plunged nearly 20% after the company missed top and bottom-line estimates.Amid the uncertainty and growth concerns, investors flocked to safe-haven assets like gold ($1537.25/oz, +$28.75, +1.9%), the Japanese yen, and U.S. Treasuries. In addition, expectations for further downside in equities contributed to a 17.8% spike in the CBOE Volatility Index (19.65, +2.97).The 2-yr yield dropped seven basis points to 1.53%, and the 10-yr yield dropped eight basis points to 1.53%. The U.S. Dollar Index fell 0.5% to 97.73. WTI crude fell 2.0%, or $1.12, to $54.16/bbl.President Trump also indicated he would officially respond to Beijing's actions in the afternoon. No response was announced by session's close, which may have contributed to some reservations to step into the action during the day.Friday's economic data was limited to New Home Sales for July:New home sales declined 12.8% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 635,000 (Briefing.com consensus 645,000) from an upwardly revised 728,000 (from 646,000) in June. New home sales were up 4.3% yr/yr.The key takeaway from the report is that there was a big upward revision for June, yet there was no follow-through in July despite low mortgage rates and lower median sales prices. Sales were down big in three of the four regions and the total number of new homes sold was still below the originally reported 646,000 increase for June.Looking ahead, investors will receive Durable Goods Orders for July on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +16.8% YTDS&P 500 +13.6% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +9.9% YTDRussell 2000 +8.2% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 402/2352. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 478/2602.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: August 26, 2019End of Document

For its part, FTI sits higher after announcing its intention to split into two publicly traded companies, DISH gains in reaction to a Raymond James upgrade, and CTL moves up helped by broader strength in the tech and telecom sectors.Conversely, Victoria's Secret owner L Brands (LB 16.87, -0.66, -3.76%) sits at the bottom of the index.14:00 ETDow +200.60 at 25829.48, Nasdaq +78.57 at 7830.36, S&P +23.01 at 2870.12[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have trickled slightly lower in the last half hour, though the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite still holds gains above 1.0%.Gold futures settled $0.40 lower (-0.03%) to $1,537.20/oz on Monday; the yellow metal showed gains of 1.8% at one point this morning, but gave up its advance as the broader market pushed higher in reaction to trade talk comments.The U.S. Dollar Index gains just over 0.4% to 98.04 on Monday.13:30 ETDow +236.83 at 25865.71, Nasdaq +85.01 at 7836.8, S&P +26.31 at 2873.42[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages still stand higher across the board to this point Monday, little changed in the last half hour.Garnering a decent recovery from Friday's sell off, Dow Jones Industrial Average components like Apple (AAPL 206.27, +3.63, +1.79%), Nike (NKE 81.88, +1.44, +1.79%), and Walt Disney (DIS 133.90, +2.23, +1.69%) drive today's upside.Conversely, American Express (AXP 117.84, +0.08, +0.07%), though still in positive territory, slightly underperforms the broader advance.The DJIA now sits just 3.72% lower on the month vs 5.68% from a little over a week ago.12:55 ETDow +253.09 at 25881.97, Nasdaq +84.36 at 7836.15, S&P +26.79 at 2873.9[BRIEFING.COM] The stock market begins the week rebounding from last week's decline after President Trump said China called to express interest in restarting trade talks. The S&P 500 is up 1.0%, which is comparable to the gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.0%), Nasdaq Composite (+1.1%), and Russell 2000 (+0.9%).Interestingly, the positive bias comes despite China's Foreign Ministry spokesman denying knowledge of any such calls, Chinese press downplaying the significance of Mr. Trump's claim, and the fact that trade talks were already scheduled for September. Today's advance also follows President Trump's declaration after Friday's close that he will raise the tariff rates on $525 billion of Chinese imports.The latter sent U.S. futures sharply lower in overnight action, but the market has since latched onto some hopeful thinking that the two sides can still work together to narrow their trade differences. China's Vice Premier said Beijing is willing to resolve their dispute through "calm" negotiations, which was a sentiment President Trump reciprocated at the G7 meeting in France earlier today.At this juncture, all 11 S&P 500 sectors are trading higher, including 1.2% gains in the communication services, information technology, and consumer staples sectors. Strikingly, the trade-sensitive materials sector (+0.4%) is trailing the pack.In corporate news, Bristol-Myers (BMY 48.05, +1.47, +3.2%) sold Celgene's (CELG 96.85, +2.85, +3.0%) blockbuster psoriasis drug Otezla to Amgen (AMGN 204.91, +5.80, +2.9%) for $13.4 billion in cash. TechnipFMC (FTI 24.57, +1.47, +6.4%), which is an energy component in the S&P 500, announced it will split into two publicly traded companies.Target (TGT 105.08, +1.59, +1.5%) and Walt Disney (DIS 134.00, +2.33, +1.8%), meanwhile, announced a collaboration to bring the Disney Store to select Target stores starting Oct. 4.Elsewhere, the overnight rally in the U.S. Treasury market has dissipated, leaving yields slightly higher. The 2-yr yield is up two basis points to 1.54%, and the 10-yr yield is up one basis point to 1.53% after falling to 1.45% in overnight action.Today's economic data was limited to the release of the July report for Durable Goods Orders:Durable goods orders increased 2.1% (Briefing.com consensus +1.2%) following a downwardly revised 1.8% increase (from 2.0%) in June. Excluding transportation, durable goods orders decreased 0.4% (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%) following a downwardly revised 0.8% increase (from 1.2%) in June.The key takeaway from the report is that orders for nondefense capital goods, excluding aircraft -- a proxy for business investment -- increased 0.4% in July on the heels of a 0.9% increase in June. Shipments, though, dropped 0.7%, which is a component that will factor into Q3 GDP forecasts. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1945/854. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1953/1036.12:25 ETDow +296.43 at 25925.31, Nasdaq +97.24 at 7849.03, S&P +31.20 at 2878.31[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 1.1%, and the tech-sensitive Nasdaq is up 1.2%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows Apple (AAPL 206.34, +3.69, +1.8%) leading the group higher with a gain near 2%. Facebook (FB 179.63, +1.88, +1.1%), Amazon (AMZN 1761.58, +11.96, +0.7%), Netflix (NFLX 294.67, +3.23, +1.1%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1165.00, +13.89, +1.2%) follow suit with decent gains.Fellow mega-cap stock Microsoft (MFST 135.38, +1.99) is up 1.5%.11:55 ETDow +186.76 at 25815.64, Nasdaq +66.95 at 7818.74, S&P +20.23 at 2867.34[BRIEFING.COM] The market continues to trade sideways with the S&P 500 currently up 0.7%.TechnipFMC (FTI 23.44, halted), which is a component of the S&P 500 energy sector, recently announced it will separate into two independent, publicly traded companies. The transaction is expected to be structured as a spin-off of TechnipFMC's Onshore/Offshore segment to be headquartered in Paris, France.Overseas, the major European indices closed on a higher note. Germany's DAX increased 0.4% and France's CAC increased 0.5%. UK's FTSE was closed for holiday. The Europe Stoxx 600 finished flat.11:30 ETDow +220.91 at 25849.79, Nasdaq +74.95 at 7826.74, S&P +23.14 at 2870.25[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have come up from earlier lows and now trade near their opening levels. The S&P 500 is up 0.8%, the Dow is up 0.8%, and the Nasdaq is up 0.9%.Looking at energy, oil prices ($54.45/bbl, +$0.28, +0.5%) have come down from prior highs. The S&P 500 energy sector (+0.6%) is among today's laggards, although it still holds a decent gain.Despite the higher start in equities, U.S. Treasuries are still seeing some demand, albeit much less than overnight activity. Currently, the yield on the benchmark 10-yr note is down one basis point to 1.51%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.3% to 97.95.10:55 ETDow +163.70 at 25792.58, Nasdaq +59.88 at 7811.67, S&P +16.82 at 2863.93[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 (+0.6%) continues to hold its positive posture while President Trump and France's President Macron hold a joint press conference at the G-7 summit in France.President Trump has reiterated his stance that China wants to make a trade deal and believes they are sincere about trade negotiations. Mr. Macron has said that he will work on a multilateral basis to find a solution to a digital tax, hoping to end the tax once international agreement is reached.Separately, Target (TGT 105.11, +1.62, +1.6%) and Walt Disney (DIS 133.60, +1.93, +1.5%) announced a retail collaboration to bring the Disney Store within select Target stores starting Oct. 4. with 40 additional locations opening by October 2020.10:30 ETDow +105.35 at 25734.23, Nasdaq +40.34 at 7792.13, S&P +10.39 at 2857.5[BRIEFING.COM] The stock market has come down from opening highs, leaving the S&P 500 with a current gain of 0.5%.The positive bias formed overnight after President Trump (from the G-7 summit in France) said that China called saying it wants to restart trade talks. Futures erased all losses and turned higher on those comments, which didn't provide the market anything it didn't already know. Trade talks were already planned for September.The market may have been relieved to hear that those talks were still in order despite President Trump announcing that he will increase the tariff rates on goods imported from China. Chinese press quickly downplayed the significance of Mr. Trump's comments, while the Vice Premier said Beijing would like to resolve the dispute through "calm" negotiations.09:55 ETDow +188.09 at 25816.97, Nasdaq +61.14 at 7812.93, S&P +19.48 at 2866.59[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 currently trades higher by 0.7%, and the Russell 2000 trades higher by 0.8%.Some corporate news today includes Celgene (CELG 97.37, +3.38, +3.6%) selling the worldwide rights of Otezla to Amgen (AMGN 203.63, +4.57, +2.3%) for $13.4 billion in cash. Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY 48.51, +1.92, +4.1%), which agreed to merge with Celgene, confirmed the deal to divest Otezla.Separately, shares of Apple (AAPL 205.92, +3.29, +1.6%) are providing solid support for today's rebound attempt.09:40 ETDow +239.59 at 25868.47, Nasdaq +71.84 at 7823.63, S&P +24.53 at 2871.64[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages begin the session rebounding from a steep sell-off on Friday following upbeat trade comments from President Trump. The S&P 500 is up 0.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.9%, and the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.9%.An early look inside the S&P 500 shows all 11 sectors trading higher with gains ranging from 0.6% (real estate) to 1.1% (information technology).U.S. Treasuries are little changed but are well off their highs from overnight action. The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.52%, and the 10-yr yield is up one basis point to 1.53%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.4% to 97.98.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +82.40.The stock market is indicated to open higher after futures turned sharply higher on President Trump's assertion that China called to restart trade talks. The S&P 500 futures trade 29 points, or 1.0%, above fair value.The market, however, already knew that talks were planned for September. The Chinese press also quickly downplayed the significance of the president's remarks. To be fair, though, there might have been some uncertainty if those trade talks would still be happening after President Trump announced after Friday's close that he will increase the tariff rates on goods imported from China.Regardless of what the market knew (or has yet to know), the U.S. Treasury market has reacted strongly to the news.

After the close on Friday, President Trump said the tariff rate on the existing $250 billion tranche of Chinese goods would rise to 30% from 25%, effective October 1, and that the tariff rate on the newest $300 billion tranche of Chinese goods would increase to 15% from 10%. China said it is willing to resolve the trade dispute through "calm negotiations." President Trump said today that China called U.S. officials Sunday to say they want to re-start the trade talks. This news helped turn the negative tide in the futures market, yet this call was reportedly already scheduled.

Specifically, the current 25% tariff rate on $250 billion of goods will be raised to 30% on Oct. 1, and the 10% tariff rate on $300 billion of goods scheduled to be imposed on Sept. 1 and Dec. 15 will be raised to 15%.It should be noted that trade talks were already planned for September. In addition, China's Global Times editor, who is often viewed as a spokesman for the Chinese government, toned down the significance of the president's statement. China's Vice Premier Liu He said on Monday Beijing is willing to resolve the trade dispute through "calm negotiations."Today's economic data will be limited to Durable Goods Orders for July (Briefing.com consensus 1.2%) at 8:30 a.m. ET.U.S. Treasuries have sold off from prior levels amid the turnaround in equity futures, although Treasuries are still up modestly.

Attention quickly shifted to trade, however, after China announced tariffs on $75 billion of goods imported from the U.S on Sept. 1 and Dec. 15, which are the same dates the U.S. has planned for its tariffs on China. The tariff rate will range from 5-10%, including a separate 5-25% on autos and auto parts starting Dec. 15.Modest selling ensued, but stocks quickly recouped losses after Mr. Powell reiterated comments that upheld the market's view for further economic stimulus. The day had barely begun, though, and President Trump took to Twitter to lash out against both the Fed Chair and China. Stocks fell noticeably on the president's declaration that companies find alternatives to China.A steady broad-based retreat transpired during the day amid worries that escalated trade tensions will exacerbate slowing global growth and, by extension, affect corporate earnings. All 11 S&P 500 sectors finished in negative territory, which saw the energy (-3.4%) and information technology (-3.3%) sectors losing over 3%. The utilities sector (-1.1%) declined the least.Shares of Apple (AAPL 202.64, -9.82) fell 4.6% and other trade-sensitive areas like the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-4.4%) and Dow Jones Transportation Average (-3.3%) also posted steep losses. Shares of Foot Locker (FL 34.00, -7.93, -18.9%) plunged nearly 20% after the company missed top and bottom-line estimates.Amid the uncertainty and growth concerns, investors flocked to safe-haven assets like gold ($1537.25/oz, +$28.75, +1.9%), the Japanese yen, and U.S. Treasuries. In addition, expectations for further downside in equities contributed to a 17.8% spike in the CBOE Volatility Index (19.65, +2.97).The 2-yr yield dropped seven basis points to 1.53%, and the 10-yr yield dropped eight basis points to 1.53%. The U.S. Dollar Index fell 0.5% to 97.73. WTI crude fell 2.0%, or $1.12, to $54.16/bbl.President Trump also indicated he would officially respond to Beijing's actions in the afternoon. No response was announced by session's close, which may have contributed to some reservations to step into the action during the day.Friday's economic data was limited to New Home Sales for July:New home sales declined 12.8% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 635,000 (Briefing.com consensus 645,000) from an upwardly revised 728,000 (from 646,000) in June. New home sales were up 4.3% yr/yr.The key takeaway from the report is that there was a big upward revision for June, yet there was no follow-through in July despite low mortgage rates and lower median sales prices. Sales were down big in three of the four regions and the total number of new homes sold was still below the originally reported 646,000 increase for June.Looking ahead, investors will receive Durable Goods Orders for July on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +16.8% YTDS&P 500 +13.6% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +9.9% YTDRussell 2000 +8.2% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 402/2352. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 478/2602.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: August 26, 2019End of Document

Origin Agritech Entered Collaboration Agreement with Biotechnology Research Institute of Chinese Academy of Agriculture Sciences to Speed up Commercialization of GM Traits in ChinaPR NewswireAugust 27, 2019 Tuesday 8:00 AM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1012 wordsDateline: BEIJING, Aug. 27, 2019 BodyPR Newswire Origin Agritech Ltd. (NASDAQ: SEED) (the "Company" or "Origin"), an agriculture technology and rural e-commerce company, today announced that the Company has entered into a collaboration agreement with Biotechnology Research Institute (BRI) of Chinese Academy of Agriculture Sciences (CAAS) to speed up the commercialization of genetically modified insect resistance and glyphosate tolerance corn traits in China. CAAS is a national, integrative agricultural scientific research organization in China with responsibility for carrying out both basic and applied research, as well as research into new technologies impacting agriculture. BRI of CAAS is the only public, non-profit institution focusing on the frontiers of both basic and applied research of agro-biotechnology in China. The Key Laboratory of Agricultural Genomics, Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) and the Center for Biosafety Assessment of GMOs are affiliated with BRI.Over the years, Origin has been cooperating with CAAS in developing various GM traits, including a double stacked corn trait for insect resistance and glyphosate tolerance traits. The double stacked corn trait protects corn from both insect damage and glyphosate spray, and hence can improve crop yield significantly. This double stacked trait has passed most of the multi-phase biosafety approval processes and is in the final stage of commercialization approval for biosafety certification.The new collaboration agreement deepens our cooperation with BRI and mainly focuses on related research for commercialization of the double stacked corn trait of insect resistance and glyphosate tolerance. Origin and BRI will join together to apply for government sponsored funds and share research facilities and capabilities, as well as the potential benefits. Both Origin and BRI will also work together to promote the commercialization of the stacked corn trait, which Origin has been developing based on the fundamental research from CAAS.According to the "Thirteenth Five Year State Science and Technology Innovative Plan" published by the Chinese government in 2016, the Chinese government has set a target for the commercialization of corn seed GMO technologies during the central government's Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, which ends in 2020.About Origin Agritech LimitedOrigin Agritech Limited, founded in 1997 and headquartered in Zhong-Guan-Cun (ZGC) Life Science Park in Beijing, is China's leading agricultural technology and a rural social e-commerce company, expanding in mid-2018 from crop seed breeding and genetic improvement business to be a leading technology developer in new rural e-commerce platform and Blockchain technologies. In crop seed biotechnologies, Origin Agritech's phytase corn was the first transgenic corn to receive the Bio-Safety Certificate from China's Ministry of Agriculture.

I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo, it's Monday, July 15th, your top stories at 6:00 a.m. Eastern.Markets poised for a higher open, looking to push to new all-time highs, this following a record setting week for the Dow, NASDAQ and S&P 500, all three major market gauges, rising to new highs on Friday, the S&P 500 closing above 3,000 for the very first time.Investors have their eyes on earnings. Second quarter earnings season kicks into high gear this week, big banks reporting will kick off with Citi, this morning. We've got everything that you need to know.Barry still dumping massive amount of rain, the storm hitting land as the hurricane causing damage and disrupting oil production of the Gulf of Mexico, now downgraded to a tropical depression, but still a danger as it heads north. We have a live report from on thte ground.High-tech threat, millionaire Peter Thiel is reportedly calling for an investigation into Google, over its work with China, what these allegations could mean going forward. MORNINGS WITH MARIA starts right now.A big show coming up this morning and every morning, I'm going to be speaking with Mark Short, the vice president's chief of staff, acting director for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Ken Cuccinelli, and Rafferty Capital Market's chief financial strategist, Dick Bove, you don't want to miss any of those gentlemen or any of the fantastic people from FOX Business who are coming up.Joining the conversation this morning, FOX Business' Deirdre Bolton, speaking of fantastic, PWC partner, Mitch Roschelle, and Cleary Strategies president, former White House correspondent, Ronica Cleary, welcome one and all. Mitch, I know you've been crunching numbers all weekend other than going to the Home Depot.MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC: I was at Home Depot --MCDOWELL: Mitch made a selfie from the Home Depot and so we'll talk.ROSCHELLE: I am not boycotting Home Depot --MCDOWELL: No.ROSCHELLE: -- to be clear.MCDOWELL: Thank goodness. But let's talk about markets and earnings.DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: I was like, I want to know what he's building, but I guess we'll get to that later.MCDOWELL: He's probably fixing a faucet.BOLTON: OK.MCDOWELL: Let's not get crazy. Let's talk about the markets and the record-breaking run last week. Futures are pointing to a higher open, a 28-point gain on the Dow Futures, gains across the board after all three major market gauges finished in record territory on Friday.Second quarter earnings season kicks off in about two hours, when Citi reports. President Trump, tweeting on the economy last night, we're doing great, economically, as a country, number one, despite the Feds antiquated policy on rates and tightening, much room to grow.So Mitch, let's start with -- again, the Feds are getting ready to cut interest rates based on all indications. So that's not tightening. But let's talk about earnings season, what do you expect, because again, rip -- to, quote Maria, "a rip roaring market" but you have earnings are expected to come in negative for this quarter.Last quarter, same -- I mean, for the second quarter, and negative even in the third quarter based on expectations right now.ROSCHELLE: Clearly, the good news is the Fed potentially making money more easy, but the bad news is, estimates for the second quarter are down three percent, and that was the estimate for the first quarter, as well, and then came in almost flat, so they may be a little (INAUDIBLE) the sandbagging going on by Corporate America.But there are 80 in the S&P 500 that are indicating that, perhaps, the earnings will be disappointing the guidance that they've already given.So, it's strange that the market is as enthusiastic, right now, going into earnings season, I think what market participants know is, the fact of the matter is the back end of the (INAUDIBLE) will be stronger and maybe some of these companies are going to beat expectations as they normally do, about 80 percent of the S&P 500 tends to beat expectations.So, I think baked into the pricing right now, is the fact that earnings are going to be very slow.MCDOWELL: Yes, because they were negative in the first quarter, down three-tenths of one percent. The expectation for the second quarter is three percent decline.ROSCHELLE: Right, which is the exact expectation for the first quarter when they came in down --MCDOWELL: But still negative, and the expectation for the third quarter is negative nine-tenths of a percent, so almost one percent, so we are officially looking at an earnings recession which the GDP numbers on corporate profits have already told us that based on the fourth quarter and first quarter.ROSCHELLE: The one thing to remember that last year was an aberration because of the benefit of the lower tax corporate tax rates. So we are comparing this year to much different last year.BOLTON: (INAUDIBLE) and there are a lot of people who when you look at, like, P.E. ratio, right, for all of these companies saying we're not really sure that its earnings growth that is driving the stock market higher. It's the fact that debt has been so cheap.I'm actually watching -- Reuters came out with a report yesterday, saying that U.S. companies may be able to do business with Huawei, so I know that's giving a little support, that's not confirmed, that's just one news organization that has it, but that's giving a little support to tech this morning.MCDOWELL: There's a report out that we're going to get it to later this hour, about Huawei cutting jobs here in the United States, so again, that's the --BOLTON: As a result of being blacklisted.MCDOWELL: Right, exactly. So that's part of the trade tensions with China and the United States because it it's all part of one thing. BlackRock Global Fixed Income chief investment officer, Rick Rieder, was on Maria Bartiromo's Wall Street, weighing in on these markets. Listen to this. I'll get your reaction.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: We heard a little Jay Powell, the Fed, we heard some ECB, we've got the minutes there. What's your reaction?RICK RIEDER, CIO, BLACKROCK GLOBAL FIXED INCOME: It was a huge week. I think we were going to go down actually last two weeks, we're (INAUDIBLE) when you think about after the trade agreement, we can debate agreement or not, but it was after that, then you had Powell, you know, the ECB, and the Christine Lagarde news is a very big piece of news.You know, I think the ECB is going to be more aggressive going forward. Markets have certainly started to react to that. And by the way, the CPI report, you know, we don't think inflation is moving that much higher, but it's nice to see that now, all of a sudden, there's a bit of pricing power that companies for the equity market.You know, I thought it was pretty interesting that, you know, you had a bit more inflation or the people saying oh my God, that's going to be hard for the Fed, not really. That the Fed is going to keep moving because they're worried about global growth.Companies have pricing power and you're seeing some places like used cars are a bit better, apparels are a bit better, the places that have been really been tough. It's pretty good news. So yes, you know, if you take the last two weeks, pretty good set of developments for the markets.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: Speaking of global growth, we found out this morning, that China is experiencing a pretty serious economic slowdown, the report out was that the economy in China grew at 6.2 percent in the second quarter, it sounds awesome, but it's the slowest rates since, at least, 1992, so the slowest rate on record.The president's policy, this tough trade policy, the terror fight is taking a toll on the Chinese economy. Ronica, ultimately, that weighs on the U.S.RONICA CLEARY, PRESIDENT, CLEARY STRATEGIES: It does. And this is where the president will have to really test the loyalty of his supporters. I hate to put everything in a context of an election because we shouldn't be making decisions based on --MCDOWELL: That's the real house.CLEARY: Yes, exactly, but at the end of the day, people have to be willing to, you know, have this long-term understanding of the fact that this is going to take a while and there's going to be some pain before there would be potentially any gain, but when you hear people on the ground, talking about the president's policies with tariffs and trade, a lot of Trump supporters say they're willing take the pain, because China is too powerful. They're willing to go through this.MCDOWELL: And Mitch, a sign that this is working, the story in the Journal, is one of the top stories in the paper, manufactures are moving their supply chains out of China. That this is part of the strategy, it's not just that, finally, you have a president standing up, getting tough, and manufactures are saying and -- American companies are saying, you know what?This is -- this is going to be a sea-change, just to name a few of them. Crocs, YETI Coolers, Roomba and GoPro, furniture maker Lovesac, will make 60 percent of its furniture in China, down from 75 percent, a lot of that is going to Vietnam.ROSCHELLE: What's really interesting is -- and I've spoken to a lot of business leaders and I've asked them about tariffs and supply chain and they were really reluctant to start shifting around where they make stuff, but what's interesting is not the tariffs, per se, it's the uncertainty regarding whether then not they'll be in.And what they want the certainty, and if they can find certainty in Indonesia or in Malaysia or in India or in Vietnam, then they're going to shift there. The problem is, it's a very long process. You just can't pick up and move a factory and define a vender in that local jurisdiction that you can trust, is a challenge.MCDOWELL: And it depends on how complicated the products are that are manufactured, the more complicated the product, the harder it is to move it out of China, because the way that they're manufacturing, so --ROSCHELLE: Right.MCDOWELL: Top notch, quite frankly.ROSCHELLE: And one of those things that's happening --BOLTON: And cheap, right? I mean, that's really is what is cheap.ROSCHELLE: And cost is the big thing. The reason why they're not bringing them back here is they just can't replace the labor cost. It's a night and day.MCDOWELL: Well, let's stay on China, investigating Google, this is -- that's what billionaire investor, Peter Thiel, reportedly says that the FBI and CIA should be doing as a result of a tech giant's work with the Chinese military.Again, this is something -- this is fight that President Trump has taken on to call out China, again, its military aggression, its desire to essentially dominate the entire world.BOLTON: Yes, and I think what Peter Thiel is saying, we'll have the U.S. military, but you will work with China, and this is based on his view of a project that Google was doing as having a censored search engine in China.So, I'm not -- you know, I think the implication is that it could have military implications. I'm not sure it's a direct line, but Peter Thiel certainly, you know, he likes to cause a rift in the waters every now and then and this time is no different.MCDOWELL: Yes, I think him speaking at the Republican convention again. He was --(CROSSTALK)BOLTON: Yes, I mean, and he's very, obviously, disruptive. But yes, we'll see what this does to Google stock today.ROSCHELLE: I think, looking at big tech is something that's probably bipartisan if both sides of the aisle could agree upon what they don't like about big tech. But the fact of the matter is (INAUDIBLE) to many candidates on the -- on the campaign trail. They're attacking big business and it's big tech that's part of the big business.MCDOWELL: Yes, and to bring it full circle, big tech is one of the areas that people are very concerned about in terms of the earnings growth there, and -- in terms of they've been -- as the Journal calls them the (INAUDIBLE) of the stock market's run in recent years and a decline in margins for the sector, as it's widely expected, threatens to change that.BOLTON: Yes, that's been leaning -- tech has been leading this rally right for the past 18 months, so it's true with all of these concerns that doesn't bode well if tax slows down. I don't see the replacement sector, right?MCDOWELL: We've got retail sales coming out later this week, right? For the last -- for the -- not -- for May, they were up half of one percent.ROSCHELLE: And they revised previous months up. I think retail sales are going to be strong if you want to -- you heard it here first (INAUDIBLE)MCDOWELL: Prime Day.ROSCHELLE: Prime Day is today.MCDOWELL: Prime Day today. Hey, I've got a free bag at Whole Foods yesterday.BOLTON: Yes, I know, wasn't that the best? All of a sudden, wow, somebody gives me a free bag? I'm overly enthusiastic about this.MCDOWELL: I had a long conversation with the cashier who helped me about what it was like to work there.BOLTON: Is that right? Positive? Negative?MCDOWELL: Well, they have health insurance and dental --BOLTON: OK.MCDOWELL: -- and 401(k). You know, in this day and age, if you get dental insurance, it's pretty good. She said --BOLTON: That's great.MCDOWELL: And she likes it better than her previous job at Walgreens.BOLTON; OK.MCDOWELL: And she gets paid more. So there you go.BOLTON: Wow. That sounds like --MCDOWELL: And a 401(k) plan.CLEARY: And free bags for everyone.BOLTON: It was just one day only, made my Sunday.MCDOWELL: You find in New York, it's not -- it's not the company that people work for, it's the people that they have to deal with, the customers, not the corporation.Coming up, Louisiana under water, a clean-up from Tropical Storm Barry begins today as flood waters start to recede there, but threat is not over yet, we have the latest. Plus, Huawei struggled, the Chinese telecom giant planning massive layoffs here in the U.S., the fallout from the blacklist, straight ahead.MCDOWELL: Iran, offering to negotiate with the United States under one condition, Cheryl Casone has the details. Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: That's right, Dagen, good morning. Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, said in a televised speech yesterday that Iran is willing to talk with the U.S. but only if sanctions are lifted.Iran recently begun surpassing uranium enrichment limits set, back in the 2015 deal, but they said that these moves can be reversed if given enough economic incentives. In an interview with the Washington Post, Secretary of State Pompeo dismissed Rouhani's idea.Well, financier Jeffrey Epstein due back in court today for a bail hearing as several more women claimed they were abused by Epstein when they were minors. The convicted sex offender has offered to put up his $77 million- dollar Manhattan apartment and his private jet as collateral to guarantee that he'll show up for trial on federal sex trafficking charges.Federal prosecutors, though, they're opposing his bail. They charge that Epstein pay $350,000 to buy the silence of potential witnesses.Well, major layoffs reportedly are coming to Huawei here in the United States. Wall Street Journal is reporting that hundreds of people could be let go after the Trump administration blacklisted the company. These job cuts expected to affect Huawei's research and developments (INAUDIBLE) which has labs in California, Texas, and Washington state. And those are your headlines, Dagen.MCDOWELL: Thank you so much, Cheryl. And I'll tease the story that you have coming up, de Blasio must go. New York City fell into a blackout, and this dude was in Iowa, managing the crisis from Iowa. So, I know it's a New York story, but he is running for the Democratic nomination, we're going to talk about that coming up.CASONE: I can't wait.MCDOWELL: Yes.CASONE: I love --MCDOWELL: People are really angry.CASONE: I can't even start, yes.MCDOWELL: Yes.CASONE: We'll have that in a bit.MCDOWELL: You know what? You need to make the trains run on time to keep the lights on. That's pretty much the, you know, the basic elements of your job. And this guy can't even do that. And then we'll take you down south. Thank you, Cheryl.Extreme weather in the south, Tropical Storm Barry leaves much of Louisiana underwater and it's taking a toll on gulf oil production, what it means about prices at the pump as they rise, plus, Amazon Prime Day, how a strike could impact you.MCDOWELL: Tornado and flash flood warnings are threatening the gulf coast as water start to recede in Louisiana. Thousands remain in the dark with tropical depression Barry, slowly moving inland. FOX News' Casey Stegall is live in New Orleans with an update for everybody, hey Casey.CASEY STEGALL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey Dagen, good to see you. Fifty one thousand customers around the state of Louisiana, still remain without power this morning. Although, the number is going in the right direction, considering the energy company here says that service to about 188,000 customers has already been restored.Nearly 4,000 energy crews are out and about putting up new poles and lines, working to get everyone back online as soon as possible. Meantime, as you said, the recovery has already started in some of the lower lying parishes that took on water.Look at this video out of Grand Isle, Louisiana, it's just south of here, where the U.S. coast guard says it is inspecting the waterways to make sure that they are safe for boat traffic to resume. That is a huge fishing spot down there and shrimping spot, a lot of boats in and out. Louisiana's governor saying he is grateful Barry did not pack as big of a punch as they were thinking.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN BEL EDWARDS (D), GOVERNOR OF LOUISIANA: Obviously, Barry has been an extremely slow-moving storm that from its very inception, has behaved differently than other storms, other tornadoes that we have experienced.That being said, I, for one, am extremely grateful that the forecast did rains and flooding, did not materialize.(END VIDEO CLIP)STEGALL: Meantime, flights are slowly starting to resume at New Orleans international airport today, last night, Delta Airlines started bringing in aircraft and trying to get flights going. Bus services are supposed to resume today here, in New Orleans.So, no doubt this thing is starting to lift up into Arkansas now creating problems for people up there, but right now, New Orleans really breathing a collective sigh of relief this morning, Dagen.MCDOWELL: Casey, thank you so much for that, Casey Stegall in New Orleans. Meantime, oil production in the Gulf of Mexico taking a hit as Tropical Storm Barry makes its way through the region, tropical depression causing a 73 percent shutdown of production there.Joining us now, Price Futures Group, Phil Flynn, good to see you, Phil, as always, this production --PHIL FLYNN, ENERGY MARKET ANALYST, PRICE FUTURES GROUP: Good morning.MCDOWELL: -- can get back up pretty quickly, assuming there's not any damage.FLYNN: It really can. And we're already seeing that some of the ExxonMobil and a couple of the other companies are already out there, restarting production. And it's almost amazing to me when you consider the fact of what they had to do to get all of these people off these platforms that are out in the Gulf of Mexico safely.Get the production out of harm's way, moving things around, and immediately after the storm, almost within, you know, 24 hours or 48 hours, they'll be back to full production. It's just amazing.ROSCHELLE: Hey, good morning, Phil, it's Mitch Roschelle. Where is the, sort of, state of play of supply and demand of oil, not just the domestic supply that we have, but also if you look at it more globally.FLYNN: You know, globally, if you listen to the International Energy Agency, they're saying that there's plenty of supply to go around, in fact, they're predicting by 2020, an international oil glut. But that prediction really comes with a really negative outlook for the global economy.You know, they're looking at some short-term data, telling us that they think that demand growth is going to, you know, stop because of U.S.-China trade war. I don't think they're taking into consideration all the stimulus we're seeing around the globe.We saw that in the Chinese economic data this morning, for example, with the GDP, even though that was weak, we're starting to see the stimulus start to kick in with retail sales industrial production, that's good for oil demand.MCDOWELL: What about prices for gasoline at the pump? What do you expect to happen there? Because again, the problem in the U.S. has been, for months, really getting the crude oil to the refineries and the pipeline capacity in some way right, Phil?FLYNN: It really has been. I mean, you know, the U.S. is producing a record amount of oil, but are we doing it very efficiently, are we able to get it to where it needs to be? We need to build more pipelines in this country, not only for oil, but for natural gas to really reflect a growing demanding.From the storm, you know we've seen prices nationally go up about $0.04 a gallon since the storm began. I assume that we're going to start to give that back when the production comes back on. But keep in mind, you know, U.S. gasoline demand is stellar right now, it's near all-time highs, and that's good news, because it's reflecting a very strong U.S. economy.BOLTON: Phil, I know (INAUDIBLE) there are some new emission standards that are meant to come online, is this going to change? I've heard some analysts say, in the next six months, the energy market is going to be very different because of these. Do you agree?FLYNN: I do agree. This maritime standard for diesel fuel is really going to have a major impact, and the industry has been trying to get prepared for this for the last couple of years. It reminds me of when they initially took sulfur out of heating oil, and diesel fuel.It was a process. It meant higher prices, tighter supplies. Prices will be higher because of this. The question is, by how much? The refiners are doing a great job trying to keep that not too much, but I assume it's going to be, at least, $0.10 a gallon.MCDOWELL: Phil, real quick, what about the East Coast impact on gasoline prices because of that refinery fire in Pennsylvania?FLYNN: Yes. Thank you, Europe, you sent us all your gasoline. You sent us your barrels, thank you. Europe saw a great opportunity here. They were sent every gallon of gasoline they could. If hey, we're not selling it over here, send it to the U.S. And, you know, they saw that Statue of Liberty with a flag, saying we need gasoline, and they sent them tankers right away.MCDOWELL: That's called trade. That's why we like --FLYNN: It's great. I love them.MCDOWELL: -- open free trade. Because they're there if they've got the excess supply, they're there when we need it. Phil, thank you so much.FLYNN: Thank you.MCDOWELL: Great to see you, you have a fantastic week, hopefully we'll see you before the --FLYNN: You too.MCDOWELL: -- end of it. Coming up, 2020 outlook, a new poll shows President Trump losing in head-to-head matchups against top Democratic candidates, plus lights out, a blackout leaves parts of New York City in the dark. J. Lo's concert at the garden had to stop. Yes, why some say this is it, over, Dunzo, out, for Mayor Bill de Blasio.MCDOWELL: Welcome back. I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Monday, July 15th. Your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.Markets poised for a higher open, look into a push to new all-time highs. This after a record-setting week for the Dow, Nasdaq, and S&P 500 gains across the board. Record closes for all. The S&P 500 closing above 3,000 for the very first time.Investors have their eyes on quarterly earnings. Second quarter earnings season kicks off this morning with really -- with Citigroup. We have the numbers and we'll tell you everything you need to know.In Europe, we have buying in England and Germany a slight loss on the CAC Quarante in France. And in Asia overnight, the Nikkei was closed for a holiday. Gains in Shanghai and in Hong Kong as well. More signs of a slowdown in China, however. The economy, they are growing at -- yes, it's strong, 6.2 percent in the second quarter. That was the slowest rate since at least 1992.Moving on, Amazon Prime Day is here as consumers shop for deals, some workers in Minnesota are protesting the retail giant.And lights out in New York City. A massive blackout over the weekend bringing business to halt. Broadway shows could not go on. Broadway was dark. Parts of the city were dark and the mayor was in Iowa. The calls for him to resign.And high tech threat, billionaire Peter Thiel reportedly calling for an investigation into Google over its work with China. What these allegations could mean for the tech company?And Bitcoin plunging. The cryptocurrency diving more than 10 percent over the weekend. Briefly trading below 10,000. This following last week's comments were President Trump saying that he is not a fan of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.To your top story this half-hour. 20/20 vision, new head-to-head general election polls from NBC News and The Wall Street Journal show that top Democrats beat President Trump in 2020.The president trailing former Vice President Joe Biden 51 to 42 percent in a head-to-head with Senator Bernie Sanders. The president doesn't fare much better. Trailing Sanders 50 percent to 43. The president also losing in polls to Senators Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris.Joining me now, CampusReform.org media director Cabot Phillips. Cabot, what did these mean at this point in the cycle if anything, these head-to- head matchups?CABOT PHILLIPS, CAMPUS REFORM: Yes, they don't mean as much as I think a lot of the Democrats would like them to mean. I'd like to remind people in 2016 at this point, Jeb Bush was the clear favorite. He was going to be the nominee, all the polling said it had to be so. Clearly didn't work out that way. The bottom line is a lot of Americans when asked on the phone, who are you going to support might say, "Well, I don't like Donald Trump, he's a little mean for me.I'm going to support the Democrat. But the bottom line is we know from history people vote with their pocketbooks. They vote based on how the economy is doing and when it gets down to them in the polling booth and they actually see record wage growth, where they see unemployment plunging when they see 16-year high confidence from consumers or in this country.They are not going to want to fundamentally reshape the economy, and that's what the Democrats are promising. I think that's a mistake for the Democrat Party because people see the economy thriving under President Trump's leadership whether they like him or not. And I think, ultimately, barring some kind of economic step back that's -- you know, unforeseen, I think, he's going to cruise to re-election.CLEARY: Cabot, you know, it's interesting you talk about mistakes. I think there is a mistake in the focus that people put on these things like polling. There's a lack of attention put on the economy.And also the idea that polling a candidate like Joe Biden today versus who Joe Biden may be forced to be by the time we get to the end of this primary being pushed further and further to the left, so much still has the potential to change. But, where will President Trump be pushed over this time?PHILLIPS: Well, I think the Democrats are going to try and push him on things that aren't the issues. They know that if it comes down to the issues, our country is doing very well. And right now, on the debate stage, they're making the mistake of saying the economy is not working for anyone. People are not happy with how what's going. We're going to come in and fundamentally reshape the way things are going.That might work if the economy was not working, but the fact is the vast majority of Americans saw attacks got under the tax proposal by the Republicans. Vast majority people seeing their wages grow and they're looking around and this doomsday picture being painted by the Democrat Party is not being matched up with the results they're seeing. And I think that is a misplaying of the Democrat hand.And again, I think as the campaign goes on, the Democrats are going to beat each other up on the debate stage. And also, they're going to be pushed further left. So, a lot of these more moderate candidates they might have a higher approval rating right now from average voters. They're going to realize that a lot of these candidates are more extreme than they think because the debate is going to inevitably draw people further to the left in an attempt to win the primary.MCDOWELL: Right, raise your hand if you want to take away private insurance for 180 million Americans.PHILLIPS: Yes.MCDOWELL: We saw Elizabeth Warren do that and I said then, it will come back to haunt her in the -- in the coming months even as the Democrats gear upstart voting in January. But I want to ask Mitch Rochelle about the economy given the length of the expansion Mitch, longer than a decade, the longest on record, can the economy keep growing at a modest pace, decent pace into next year?Because we have a tendency to focus on the bat like any signs that might say weakness. But from 35,000 feet, it still looks really solid which you've been talking about.ROSCHELLE: I would say that since two-thirds to 75 percent of the economy in any given quarter comes from the consumer. And the consumer still fundamentally strong, and the consumers stimulated with low-interest rates. Business investment is not overly robust but it's strong enough. And then, government investment is the last piece. There's nothing in that equation that looks like it's really retreating.So, even if the economy grows at the sort of that new normal of one percent dish, it's still going to continue to grow and not contract. So, we're not going to see a recession, I don't think.MCDOWELL: I want to move on to the president on Twitter over the weekend. President Trump taking aim at far left progressive House members, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, tweeting this. "So interesting to see progressive Democrat congresswomen who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt, and inept anywhere in the world if they even have a functioning government at all.Now, loudly and viciously telling the people of the United States, the greatest and most powerful nation on earth, how our government is to be run. Why don't they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime- infested places from which they claim? Then come back and show us how it is done. These places need your help badly, you can't leave fast enough. I'm sure that Nancy Pelosi would be very happy to quickly work out free travel arrangements."Cabot called by many, particularly those on the left, racist. Nancy Pelosi said that, that was xenophobic, these comments. But it just seems like the Democrats with the fight between the four individuals who we assume that the president was referring to, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. That he basically to use the term that the Wall Street Journal editorial board uses, he belly-flopped into a situation where he did not need to be.PHILLIPS: Yes, I think that's absolutely the case. There are plenty of times where people get riled up for no reason over tweets on President Trump. This is not one of those times. I think people have every reason to be upset with this kind of rhetoric.The fact is if you're an American citizen immigrated here, you don't have anywhere else, you need to go back to if you disagree with people on policies. This is your home now, and I think this is an unforced error from the president, there's absolutely a conversation to be had about why we shouldn't be embracing policies that have failed in other countries.But to say that someone you disagree with should go back, there -- every bit as American, if you're a citizen, you're an American there's nowhere you need to go back just because you might disagree with people.I think this is an unforced error. It's not what the Republican Party is about, and I think President Trump is helping to unite people against him at a time when the Democrat Party has been especially -- there's been a lot of infighting, I think, now he's given them an easy target this was an unforced error on his part. And I do think that this was a mistake that people do have a right to be upset about.MCDOWELL: And I just add one thing that we assume that the reference was to -- as I said, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, and Ilhan Omar. Ilhan Omar is the only one of those women born outside of the United States. And these were -- this was a Democratic Party that was essentially eating itself and destroying itself.And the president, again, to use that word, belly-flopped right into the middle of it, and said something that was offensive to many Americans.PHILLIPS: And in 2020, the Democrats do not want to make this campaign about the issues. Their rhetoric has been while the Republican Party's anti-immigrant, the Republican Party's instance if they don't care about you. And this makes it easy for them to try to paint that picture which isn't true.But again, if this is true, if this campaign is about the issues in 2020, Democrats lose every single time. That's why they don't want to make it about these. They don't want to make it about tax reform, they want to make it about tweets like this.MCDOWELL: Yes.PHILLIPS: And I think it's an unforced error that is -- that is not necessary.MCDOWELL: Right, the president just united the Democrats when they were destroying each other. He just united the Democrats and every liberal voter in this country. Thank you, Cabot. Good to see you. Cabot PhillipsPHILLIPS: Appreciate it.MCDOWELL: Amazon workers on strike during the company's annual Prime Day. Cheryl Casone has the details coming up. Hey, Cheryl.CASONE: Yes, hey, Dagen, we're going to do it right now. Amazon workers in Minnesota using this major sales day today. At the company to call for higher pay and better working conditions. And there's a lot of potential revenue riding on Prime Day.Amazon sold over $100 million products during last year's holiday. One market research firm predicts 250 competing retailers including Wal-Mart, Target, and eBay are also going to be put in items on sale. Let's pick it back Wal-Mart started at their sale, yesterday. Amazon, though, is slightly higher in the pre-market.Well, Gilead Sciences is increasing at stake in a biotech firm, Galapagos. The Wall Street Journal reports that Gilead is going to pay more than $5 billion to boost its ownership stake to as much as 30 percent. The company going to get two seats on Galapagos's board of directors as part of that deal as it's structured.Now, there is this. The U.S. Air Force has issued a warning against a Facebook group that plans to storm a major military base. More than 400,000 people have joined a Facebook event page to storm Area 51 in Nevada in September. To get secret information about aliens and UFOs.The military says, the U.S. Air Force already stands ready to protect America and its assets. Correct me if I'm wrong, I think that Facebook event was a joke in the beginning. And that was 40,000 people on the darn page. Good luck with that folks. Back to you.MCDOWELL: Yes, feel like I'm not getting arrested.CASONE: Have fun in jail because you -- all those UFOs that are Area 51 already.MCDOWELL: And the -- and the, the desert in that part of the country is very, very unforgiving, I will say that.ROSCHELLE: And then, September is pretty darn hot too. So --MCDOWELL: Yes, indeed. But we did love an alien hunter.CLEARY: Right.MCDOWELL: Roswell new -- I have a Roswell, New Mexico t-shirt.BOLTON: I do sometimes think like the people protecting us, you know, like this is the kind of stuff that they deal with all the time, right?MCDOWELL: Yes.BOLTON: These are all the things we don't know.MCDOWELL: Exactly. Coming out, left in the dark. Parts of New York City suffering from a major power outage over the weekend. And now, there are calls for Mayor Bill de Blasio to get out, next.Plus, Bitcoin's Tomball, it's under pressure this morning as more questions come up about regulating cryptocurrencies. More when we come back.MCDOWELL: Headlines across America this morning, the New York Times says: "Blackout Con Edison apologizes but offers clues about root cause." Con-Ed apologizing for the Saturday outage that left at least 72,000 customers in the dark. Officials with Con-Ed saying there was a significant electrical transmission disturbance and the outage was not caused by demand. The New York Post editorial board also calling for the removal of Mayor Bill de Blasio; he was campaigning in Iowa when the power went out. Yes.The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel writes fewer people are smoking cigarettes so state tax revenue is down, now Wisconsin will tax e-cigs. The state collected over $100 million less in cigarette taxes last year compared to 2010. As a result, lawmakers passed $0.5 per milliliter tax on e- cigarettes fluid. The new tax is projected to bring in about $5.5 million over the next two years.The State reporting Taco Bell releases new menu item with South Carolina heat. The chain releasing two new dishes that incorporate the Carolina Reaper Pepper, declared the spiciest pepper in the world back in 2013. You can get Stake Reaper Ranch Fries or Stake Reaper Ranch Burrito at participating locations. I doubt that there's much reaper in those dishes because you would not be able to eat them. But what do you make --UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You'll keep asking for glasses of milk every other bite, right?CLEARY: People would be suing Taco Bell, it's too hot. Crazy.MCDOWELL: I know somebody said -- I think it was Jason (INAUDIBLE), the musician, said that his wife grew some reapers and went and went at the back and just took a bite one. Grew some reapers in the backyard and took a big bite to one. I want to talk about really quickly -- just when you think that this mayor can't get any worse, he's in Iowa when the power goes out. I think the J.Lo show at Madison Square Garden had to stop at mid- show.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Apparently, she's going to do another one so that her fans (INAUDIBLE) suffering too much. But I think as a New Yorker, when you're riding in the subways and it's raining and your subway car, you know, we knew a while ago that he wasn't exactly on it.MCDOWELL: Never underestimate the ego and self-delusion of a politician, that this man think; he can't even get the trains to run on time and clean the streets in New York City.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Or be rain-free. I'm interested in rain-free subway car.MCDOWELL: This is basically a giant testimony to the failure of government, of bureaucrats and, and lawmakers when it comes to the social safety net in New York. This man has failed every New Yorker.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We're laughing but it's dangerous. I mean, for older people to be stuck in a subway car underground, I mean, there's tons of people who live in high-rises with babies, again, older people -- I mean.MCDOWELL: This man has failed to take care of at-risk children, he's failed to improve the homeless situation despite spending several billion dollars more on the homeless problem, public housing and receivership because people were getting sick in public housing here. Mental illness -- you're talking about a billion dollars that's been spent on mental health - -ROSCHELLE: Our schools.MCDOWELL: On schools here. Again, that's school program had to be shut down because it was a complete failure. Failure. Failure. Failure. And now, blackout.CLEARY: And for all of the things that you're saying about -- the failure to respond properly to a crisis like the blackout, that's the icing on top. We can't forget -- remember that Chris Christie and Obama hug after Sandy and (INAUDIBLE) it was?MCDOWELL: This is about New York City. This is about New York City.CLEARY: But it's the same. This is what people remember. They remember that he's in Iowa. That's what they remember.MCDOWELL: Right. President Trump tweeting on China: "China's second- quarter growth the slowest it's been in more than 27 years. The U.S. tariffs are having a major impact, a major effect on companies wanting to leave China for non-tariffed countries. Thousands of companies are leaving. This is why China wants to make a deal with the U.S. and wishes that it'd not broken the original deal in the first place. In the meantime, we are receiving billions of dollars in tariffs from China with possibly much more to come. These tariffs are paid for by China devaluing and pumping not by the U.S. taxpayer." Mitch, well, if you're paying much -- it's being paid by some -- it's being paid by some American companies.ROSCHELLE: Yes. Absolutely. Tariffs do not get absorbed by a company and then not alter how they do business as a result of the tariff.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Here, we're paying it.ROSCHELLE: It's either passed along to consumer or somehow otherwise eaten up in their system which means they're not paying for something else. They're not going to compromise profitability.MCDOWELL: Coming up, Peter Thiel takes on big tech, why the billionaire investor has said that Google has been compromised by Chinese intelligence agencies. Plus, Bitcoin slides, how criticism of cryptocurrency is driving the digital coin market.MCDOWELL: Big tech in focus. Billionaire tech investor, Peter Thiel, reportedly calling for the FBI and CIA to investigation whether Chinese intelligence has infiltrated Google. Thiel slamming Google for its decision to work with the Chinese military while refusing to renew a contract with the U.S. Department of Defense. Joining me now Disruptive Tech Founder Chief Analyst, Lou Basenese. Lou, good to see you, what do you make of these remarks? Is there a back story that we don't know?LOU BASENESE, FOUNDER, DISRUPTIVE TECH: Look, I mean, think about Huawei. I think there's absolutely a concern here. In today's digital world where we miniaturized chips, how can we not be concerned about foreign governments infiltrating U.S. systems. And with everything online, it's a legitimate threat; it's a question that needs to be asked that Google should be willing to answer and be transparent about.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: When you talk about Google being transparent, I mean, Peter Thiel seems more like he's raising questions, right? He's saying tricky questions: one of which, OK, why isn't google working with the FBI and CIA but is willing to be developing this product with China -- you know, the search engine that could be more or less controlled by the Chinese government and then heavy implication here on military? I mean, is Peter to Dagen's point, does he have an ax to grind with Google?BASENESE: I mean, I don't know that he has an ax to grind with Google but I think he's raising legitimate concerns here. You know, Google has had plans to have a different version of their search engine in China. It was a couple of months ago when they denied there were rumors that they were working on it again and they put those to bed. It sounds like Peter may have information where they're continuing to work on it. And again, we're dealing in a world where things -- the weapons of today are digital, not physical. I think he's raising perfectly legitimate concerns and they should be answered.MCDOWELL: Turning to cryptocurrency, Lou, the SEC is looking at whether Facebook's planned cryptocurrency, Libra, should fall under its oversight. Regulators believe Facebook hasn't provided enough details yet about Libra's technical aspects, like how it regards against money laundering, how much control would be exercised by other companies including PayPal. Bitcoin prices are sliding at the same time, your take on that?BASENESE: Look, I went on-the-record, I think, last week saying I think Libra is going to be a flop, and Bitcoin is in desperate need of going to the French to the front line. Libra represented that opportunity for Bitcoin. But in the wake of what's happening, now all the scrutiny coming on Libra, I just don't think it's going to happen. You know, in the most likely scenario, now, we're going to look at, maybe capital controls put on Facebook for them to launch this, which really turns this cryptocurrency away from everything it's supposed to be. It's supposed to be unregulated, anonymous, so really therefore not much of a cryptocurrency, which is why I think we see bitcoin is trading in high correlation with Libra and that's why we're seeing selloff continue.MCDOWELL: Right, it's just specked of asset at this point, it's like trading, I don't know, rocks. You know, whatever value that these -- that speculators and gamblers want to assign to it, you know.BASENESE: Rocks are more tangible than it, Dagen, come on.MCDOWELL: Yes.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: But Libra was different, right? I mean, it's actually backed by hard assets, government securities -- I mean, you have to have a local bank account on Libra, or at least that was the plan.MCDOWELL: Right, that's the plan but you have Facebook behind it, and they've got black eyes. They've got 50 black eyes in terms of not protecting people's privacy. Lou, thanks so much. Lou Basenese.BASENESE: Thanks, Dagen.MCDOWELL: President Trump tweeting again this time on Democrats, we're going to run out of time because I can't talk fast enough to get through this; we will get to this at the top of the next hour, I promise you that, more of MORNINGS WITH MARIA when we come back.Load-Date: July 15, 2019End of Document

Four big Chinese films have been pulled in a month with barely an explanationCNN.comJuly 21, 2019 Sunday 8:38 PM ESTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: ARTSLength: 1207 wordsByline: Ben Westcott, Steven Jiang and Nanlin Fang, CNNDateline: Hong Kong BodyFour seemingly innocuous big-budget movies have been abruptly pulled from Chinese cinemas in one month, sparking suspicion they fell afoul of the country's strict censors.Censorship of China's film and television has ramped up in recent years, with some films banned for their inclusion of homosexuality, cleavage, hip hop and tattoos.But the four axed films don't appear to touch on any of the typically taboo subjects, leaving cinema-goers puzzled."The Eight Hundred" and "The Hidden Sword" are war films, while "The Last Wish" is a dark comedy about a dying man's desire to lose his virginity. Teen drama "Better Days" revolves around a high-school student who becomes friends with a small-time criminal.Broad, vague reasons were given for the cancellation of any of the movies and the news was met with disappointment online."'Better Days.' 'The Last Wish.' They are all the food that supports my spiritual world. Why did the release of them get canceled?" one Weibo user asked. "What the hell is going on?" another commenter demanded.There are no public figures for how much each of the films cost, but widely-reported estimates put the production budget of "The Eight Hundred" alone at $80 million.CNN has reached out to the films' production companies for comment.An executive in a foreign film studio's China office, who asked to remain anonymous due to the political sensitivity of the topic, said the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1 was an important milestone that could be making the ruling Communist Party's censors nervous.For example, "The Eight Hundred," paints a positive picture of soldiers from the Chinese Nationalist army, holding out nobly against the Japanese. It was also the Nationalists who fought against the Communists during China's Civil War."Of course, it's the 70th anniversary of PRC this year, but there will be something major every year in the foreseeable future," the executive said. "The environment is only going to get worse from here."Death of a blockbusterThe latest controversy began on June 24 with a message posted to the official "Better Days" social media account."After considering the level of completion of 'Better Days' and our market pre-assessments, and following consultations between the production and distribution parties, the film will not be released on June 27. A new release date will be announced at a later time," the statement said.Fans were shocked. The film had been due to release that week.So far, no new release date has been given and the account has since been silent. The day after "Better Days" was pulled, promoters behind "The Eight Hundred" announced on social media that the film wouldn't be releasing on July 5 as planned, adding a new release date would be made public "when decided."It said that after "consulting and discussing (with) every side," screenings of the film were being canceled. Fans were shocked. The film had been due to release that week."After consultation between the production team and other entities, 'The Eight Hundred' will cancel its original July 5 premiere and temporarily vacate the summer release date window. The new release date will be announced at a later time," said a statement posted to the film's social media.It happened again with the "The Hidden Sword," which was pulled just four days ahead of its planned release on July 15. A statement was issued on the film's social media account: "Due to market reasons, the film 'The Hidden Sword' has canceled its original July 19 release. Thank you for your anticipation, your attention and support!"Dark comedy "The Last Wish" then missed its July 18 release date. No statement was put on their official social media but local media said it had been withdrawn for "production reasons."The bizarre spate of cancellations has created uncertainty in the world's fastest-growing film market. China is now second only to the US in terms of box office revenue, and is forecast to overtake America next year with takings of 200 billion yuan ($29 billion.)Just as in America, a successful summer release in China can make millions. China's highest grossing film, patriotic action thriller "Wolf Warrior 2," has made almost $1 billion since its release in July 2017.But China's movie industry operates very differently compared to Hollywood.Until 2018, the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television (SAPPRFT) was tasked with approving all film scripts and could request changes at any point during production or post-production, experts said.However, the Chinese government dismantled SAPPRFT in 2018, and moved its functions directly under the Communist Party's Publicity Department, officially leaving the party in charge of all films and scripts.At the time, Huang Kunming, head of the Publicity Department who is also a member of the Party's decision-making Politburo, said in state-run media Xinhua that the restructuring would strengthen the party's leadership in the sector and would improve both its ideological governing and prosperity.CNN has reached out to the Publicity Department for comment on the four cancellations.Films are often pulled from release, or censored, by the department with no explanation, said Tan See Kam, an associate professor of Film Studies at the University of Macao."(The government) is not obliged to explain or justify its decisions publicly. Coded language like 'technical issues,' and 'market issues' draws attention to actual acts of censorship, while denying the practice," he said. "Film producers, on the other hand, would not make a fuss publicly because this could worsen the situation."For four major films to be censored in one month is unusual, he said.'Nothing is guaranteed'The foreign film company executive said the cancellation of films like "The Eight Hundred" showed how difficult and unpredictable the film industry had become in China."Preparations for that movie began four or five years ago -- and it obviously received approval to be made and was ready to be released," the person said. "But the abrupt cancellation really shows that nothing is guaranteed until a move is actually shown in theaters."The executive said that some companies were deliberately releasing movies quietly, without much publicity, to avoid attracting attention from critics and closer scrutiny from censors after initial approvals.Few companies appear safe from the decision to drop a film.Both "The Eight Hundred" and "The Last Wish" were released by the Huayi Brothers, one of China's largest and most successful production companies. They have also partly produced Western films such as "Warcraft" and "Molly's Game."Macao University film expert Tan said China's growing film industry would suffer if the unpredictable and strict censorship didn't ease up."The problems Huayi Brothers face have implications for the film industry as a whole. If, for the Communist Party, politics must prevail over economics, then, for the market, politics is a hindrance to profit-making," he said.But, with minimal explanation offered by the companies or the government, Chinese film lovers can only wait and see if some of their most highly-anticipated movies ever make it into cinemas.Load-Date: July 29, 2019End of Document

American Association of University Professors Issues Joint Statement on FBI Urging Universities to Monitor Chinese StudentsTargeted News ServiceAugust 12, 2019 Monday 8:22 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 667 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe American Association of University Professors issued the following joint statement with 18 organizations, including ACPA-College Student Educators International, Asian American Unity Coalition, Asian Pacific American Bar Association of Pennsylvania, Asian Pacific Islander American Public Affairs Association, Association for the Study of Higher Education, Association of American Colleges and Universities, Association of University Presses, Chinese American Citizens Alliance, Chinese Biopharmaceutical Association, Defending Rights &#38; Dissent, Foundation for Individual Rights in Education Heterodox Academy, International Society of Political Psychology, National Coalition Against Censorship, OCA - Asian Pacific American Advocates, PEN America, Scholars at Risk and 80-20 Educational Foundation in response to the report that the FBI is urging universities to monitor Chinese students and scholars:"According to recent public reports, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and other government officials have advised some US universities to develop protocols for monitoring students and scholars from Chinese state-affiliated research institutions. This move seemingly stems from growing suspicion that the Chinese government is engaged in espionage of American higher education, with the aim of stealing data and intellectual property. However, this is an area where the government must tread carefully."Some recent incidents suggest concern with the mounting global reach of Beijing's tech-enabled authoritarianism is valid; but calls to monitor individuals solely based on their country of origin violate norms of due process and should raise alarms in a democracy. If there are articulable concerns about specific individuals because of their activities and affiliations, those should be pursued without regard to the individual's country of origin. Disclosure requirements, information sharing and export control enforcement all offer powerful means to protect against intellectual property theft and espionage without resorting to tactics that cast suspicion on potentially hundreds of thousands of students and scholars. Federal agencies need to clarify and specify their concerns, and ensure that their efforts do not trample on individual rights nor on the principle of free and open academic inquiry and exchange."More than 340,000 Chinese students are reportedly studying in the US, as of last year. If not conducted with care, this move risks hampering the future recruitment of talented foreign students and scholars to American shores. This move could also significantly impede the training of new scientists, as well as damage ongoing projects. The pursuit of scientific knowledge should be advanced under conditions of intellectual freedom without political or ideological restrictions."Further, to the extent that China or other governments are utilizing international students and faculty in the United States as a means to carry out spying or to furtively funnel information back to officials at home, such activities infringe upon the academic freedom of those scholars as well as the institutions that host them and must stop. Unless researchers possess a formal and disclosed government affiliation, they must be permitted to pursue their work free from state interference or involvement. Failure to adhere to this principle violates the precepts of academic freedom and threatens global scholarly exchange."China's government is notorious for its aggressive use of surveillance. Efforts by the United States to fend off the global arm of autocracy must not mimic the very tactics it professes to reject. As concern on these matters grows, we advise universities to zealously safeguard their independence--to maintain their commitment to academic freedom, to uphold the principle of due process, and to respect the privacy rights of students and faculty, no matter their national origins."[Category: Education]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6820579 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: August 13, 2019End of Document

CHINA RAISES REWARD FOR INFORMANTS IN TIBETStates News ServiceAugust 8, 2019 ThursdayCopyright 2019 States News ServiceLength: 544 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Chinese authorities in Tibet are offering large cash rewards to informants in a bid to stamp out online activities considered threatening to Beijing's control over the restive Himalayan region, with amounts paid out now tripled over amounts offered last year, sources say.Rewards of 300,000 yuan (U.S. $42,582) are now being promised for information leading to the arrests of social-media users deemed disloyal to China, according to a notice issued on Feb. 28 by three government departments of China's Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR).Behaviors specified as illegal include online activities aimed at "attempting to overthrow [China's] socialist system," "advocating extremism," "destabilizing national security," and "defaming the People's Republic of China," according to the document, a copy of which was obtained by RFA's Tibetan Service.Also banned are online expressions of support for exiled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama's "Middle Way Policy," which calls for greater autonomy for Tibet while acknowledging Beijing's sovereignty over Tibetan areas now part of China.Attempts to send information on conditions in Tibet to foreign contacts will also be severely punished, the document says.Authorities in Tibetan areas of China frequently monitor online discussions and search cellphones for what they consider politically sensitive content, and foreign news broadcasts are heavily restricted.'No space left for anyone'"Under these new regulations, the Chinese government is basically curbing the free flow of online information from within Tibet," Tsering Tsomo, director of the Dharamsala, India-based Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy (TCHRD), told RFA in an interview."And though [the authorities] have linked these regulations to the protection of cybersecurity and national security, in fact they are just another way to keep people uninformed and to bar them from expressing their views," Tsomo said."Raising the amount of the reward to informants from 100,000 yuan in 2018 to 300,000 yuan this year is a threat to citizens who are simply exercising their freedom of expression," Tsomo said.Also speaking to RFA, Sonam Topgyal, a researcher at the Dharamsala-based Tibet Watch, said that similar restrictions on internet activities have already been in force in Tibetan areas of China "for a long time.""These laws have even been implemented in elementary schools in Tibet," Topgyal said, adding, "The Chinese government has left no space for anyone to criticize the government in any way, and has deployed informants within different parts of the Tibetan community."China's roll-out in February of the raised reward amount comes amid the launch of a separate Tibet-wide campaign against organized crime and "black and evil forces" that sources in the region say is being used as an excuse to crack down on Tibetans and has led to mistrust within local communities.The campaign has resulted in the "detention, arrest, and torture of human rights and environmental activists and of ordinary Tibetans promoting the use of the Tibetan language," TCHRD said in a report released in May.Reported by RFA's Tibetan Service.

Senate Banking Committee Issues Testimony From Ex-Treasury Deputy Assistant Secretary DalyTargeted News ServiceJuly 18, 2019 Thursday 6:41 AM  ESTCopyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 4464 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee issued the following testimony by Nova J. Daly, senior public policy advisor at Wiley Rein and ex-deputy assistant secretary of Treasury for investment security, at a hearing entitled "Export Control Reform Implementation: Outside Perspectives":"I am honored to appear before you today and thank you for the opportunity to testify. The views I express today are my own and do not reflect those of my firm, Wiley Rein LLP, nor any client. My views are based on my over 20 years of experience in and outside of government. They include service at the U.S. Treasury Department administering the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States ("CFIUS"), at the National Security Council, on the Senate Finance Committee, and in other positions at the U.S. Department of Commerce, as well as work in the private sector addressing trade, export control, sanctions, foreign investment and multiple national security matters. Again, thank you for the opportunity to testify."My testimony today will address five matters that this Committee is exploring regarding the implementation of U.S. export control reforms, notably those under the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 ("ECRA").1 My presentation:I. Provides an assessment of the current implementation and enforcement of ECRA, including related regulations;II. Describes how the United States may establish controls that address emerging and foundational technologies while preserving domestic innovation;III. Addresses recent designations of Zhongxing Telecommunications Equipment Corporation ("ZTE"), Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. ("Huawei"), and other Chinese technology companies;IV. Discusses whether ECRA-related control structures in the United States will be effective in confronting the challenges raised with respect to China, including the persistent diversion challenges China evokes; andV. Proposes possible legislative or oversight recommendations regarding the topics covered today."Before addressing these matters, I want to applaud this Committee for its work in passing ECRA as well as the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 ("FIRRMA").2 These two pieces of legislation are historic and seminal "course corrections," providing the United States with the ability to address the actions of adversarial powers and persons more adroitly and comprehensively in a world where economic and cyber security and technological leadership are pivotal to core and peripheral U.S. national and economic security considerations as well as global peace and order.I. Assessment of Current Implementation and Enforcement of ECRA, including Related Regulations"In order to appropriately frame this topic, it's important to take account of the accomplishments of this Administration and Congress that have been undertaken to address U.S. economic and national security vulnerabilities. These include the development and passage of ECRA, FIRRMA, provisions within the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 ("NDAA")3, addressing telecommunication and video surveillance vulnerabilities, Section 232 investigations under the authority of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, increased enforcement activities by BIS, and executive orders ("E.O.") on supply chain security4 as well as those that seek to stimulate U.S. manufacturing and job growth. I applaud the leadership of Senator Crapo in this Committee in passing multiple national security legislative actions and oversight, as well as that of Senator Brown, including his proposed bill to safeguard matters impacting economic and national security."As Commerce Secretary Wilber Ross recently noted, "[e]conomic security is essential to national security" and safeguarding our technology "is not easy, since the boundaries between civilian and military technologies become ever more narrow as technologies are increasingly omnipresent."5"The efforts of this Administration, and specifically Secretary Ross and acting Under Secretary for the Bureau of Industry and Security ("BIS") Nazak Nikakhtar are to be greatly lauded and supported. Given the tasks before them6 and the degree of increased vulnerabilities to U.S. technology, infrastructure and innovation, it is critical that additional resources and support be provided to safeguard U.S. national security and ensure the rapid implementation of new programs."Focusing on the implementation of ECRA, on November 19, 2018, BIS issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking ("ANPRM") requesting public comment on identifying 14 categories of "emerging technology." The full list of emerging technologies that BIS identified is available at: https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/11/19/2018-25221/review-of-controls-for-certain-emerging-technologies.7"As BIS relayed, the categories of emerging technology were provided for illustrative purposes and comments to them were not restricted just to those categories. BIS noted further that any controls on identified emerging technologies would not apply broadly to the general categories listed in the ANPRM, but rather on a narrow and meaningful subset of those categories."The ANPRM summarized BIS's objective as follows:"As controls on exports of technology are a key component of the effort to protect sensitive U.S. technology, many sensitive technologies are listed on the Commerce Control List (CCL), often consistent with the lists maintained by the multilateral export control regimes of which the United States is a member. Certain technologies, however, may not yet be listed on the CCL or controlled multilaterally because they are emerging technologies. As such, they have not yet been evaluated for their national security impacts. This advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) seeks public comment on criteria for identifying emerging technologies that are essential to U.S. national security, for example because they have potential conventional weapons, intelligence collection, weapons of mass destruction, or terrorist applications or could provide the United States with a qualitative military or intelligence advantage. Comment on this ANPRM will help inform the interagency process to identify and describe such emerging technologies. This interagency process is anticipated to result in proposed rules for new Export Control Classification Numbers (ECCNs) on the CCL."Commerce does not seek to expand jurisdiction over technologies that are not currently subject to the Export Administration Regulations ("EAR"), such as "fundamental research" described in Sec. 734.8 of the EAR. For purposes of this ANPRM, Commerce does not seek to alter existing controls on technology already specifically described in the CCL. Such controls would generally continue to be addressed through multilateral regimes or interagency reviews."Following the issuance of the ANPRM, I understand that BIS received just over 230 comments and is currently evaluating them and working through an interagency process to identify controls, where warranted."BIS recently announced that an ANPRM for "foundational" technologies will be issued very soon, and that a proposed rule identifying a first subset of controls on "emerging" technologies will be forthcoming as well. Further, BIS has emphasized throughout this regulatory process that the controls that will be implemented will be thoughtful, targeted, and focused on "choke points," as opposed to broad, blanket controls on technologies initially identified in the ANPRM process. BIS has emphasized the critical importance of industry input, and that it is taking into account all of the comments that have been submitted on emerging technologies."BIS has additionally made clear that achieving multilateral controls on these technologies would make the most sense and that the process of identifying and implementing controls on emerging and foundational technologies will be ongoing, consistent with BIS's normal rulemaking approach. Toward that end, it should be noted that as a result of a Wassenaar Plenary in 2018, in May 2019, BIS published a final rule that revises the CCL to implement certain changes made to the Wassenaar Arrangement List of Dual-Use Goods and Technologies maintained and agreed to by governments participating in the Wassenaar Arrangement on Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Goods and Technologies ("Wassenaar Arrangement").8"Taking on this mandate under the ECRA is no small task. In my view, addressing these matters is one of the most critical actions this Administration will undertake, and I believe that good progress is being made given the critical nature of the efforts, the extent of industry input, and the domestic and global impact of BIS's determinations.II. Establishing Controls that Address Emerging and Foundational Technologies While Preserving Domestic Innovation"The establishment of export controls that address emerging and foundational technologies should be a surgical exercise, and as I alluded to earlier, in my view probably one of the most important undertakings affecting U.S. technology innovation and leadership now and well into the future. The task of identifying emerging technologies is necessarily complex because these technologies are currently being developed (hence "emerging") as opposed to more mature technology (e.g., foundational)."The process that BIS should and is undertaking to identify emerging technologies includes an assessment of U.S. innovation in various categories of emerging technologies, the level of maturity of these technologies in the United States and in allied nations, and foreign adversarial uses of these emerging technologies. Once BIS and its interagency partners develop a good understanding of these facts, they can better assess what types of controls, if any, make sense for particular emerging technologies with the goal of ultimately also gaining agreement on multilateral controls."While this task requires an understanding of which technologies are broadly disseminated and which are not, it does not mean that technology which is available outside of the United States should automatically be excluded from targeted unilateral actions to control it, where appropriate."U.S. allies and members of multilateral export control regimes should be willing partners. Ensuring the protection of intellectual property, broader global security and the rule of law creates a platform of trust where innovation can flourish. Without such a platform and without such unity, clearly the United States will need to take certain unilateral actions. It is my hope that where the United States sees a necessity to protect particular emerging and foundational technologies, our allies will step up and work with us. We should all encourage active participation and support by our allies."Currently, the United States has four multilateral regimes for export controls: the Wassenaar Arrangement; the Australia Group; the Nuclear Suppliers Group; and the Missile Technology Control Regime. Through each of these regimes, countries identify the items to control (i.e., products, software, and technology), but the controls must be implemented in national legislation. More specifically, while countries multilaterally agree on controls of specific items, all countries have divergent licensing policies on their exports, some with stringent policies restricting exports, and some with more relaxed policies. This issue can frustrate the purpose of a multilateral regime because companies facing more stringent policies in certain countries cede global market share of the controlled items to companies in countries with more relaxed policies. The resultant pressure on countries to protect market share often leads to an underutilization of export control authority. This is not to mention that the controls themselves are not effective when countries have different licensing policies."I understand that BIS is, however, actively engaging with like-minded partners to establish a working group, at the leadership level, to discuss coordinating policies on emerging technologies so that U.S. policies of control - licensing review - are consistent across countries, and that there is better information-sharing among countries as to what items are being exported to what countries, and what items are facing broader export restrictions. Export controls need to be harmonized if they are to be effective."Addressing controls on emerging and foundational technologies also requires engagement with U.S. companies large and small, the focus of Congress to provide resources and oversight, and frankly a certain degree of patriotism. U.S. companies must be clear eyed in knowing that certain potential "business" partners actually represent the interests of foreign governments who will use their technology and know-how to the economic and military detriment of the United States and our allies."That said, it is important that we have a system where R&#38;D works here in the United States, but also that key technology does not leave our shores, especially where there is a national security/ military nexus. Further, placing appropriate controls on emerging and foundational technologies should be undertaken to address China's "Made in China 2025" initiative. This initiative/plan emphasizes China's priorities for high-tech industries as relayed in the 13th Five Year Plan. The industries that China has identified include: 1) new advanced information technology; 2) automated machine tools &#38; robotics; 3) aerospace and aeronautical equipment; 4) maritime equipment and high-tech shipping; 5) modern rail transport equipment; 6) new-energy vehicles and equipment; 7) power equipment; 8) agricultural equipment; 9) new materials; and 10) biopharma and advanced medical products."Lastly, the identification of emerging and foundational technologies will also impact the work of CFIUS and its Pilot Program mandatory declarations. Prior to the enactment of FIRRMA, CFIUS was essentially a voluntary process, and CFIUS was authorized to review only transactions that could result in foreign control of a U.S. business. However, under FIRRMA and the Pilot Program, CFIUS is now able to review certain non-controlling investments in U.S. critical technology companies, including any acquisition of an equity interest that affords a foreign person with access to specified information or governance rights. Transactions covered under the Pilot Program include any investment in a U.S business engaged in critical technology that operates in one of twenty-seven specifically identified protected industries ("Pilot Program Industries"). If a transaction is covered by the Pilot Program, failure to file a "declaration" or a full CFIUS notice 45 days prior to completion of the transaction could result in civil penalties up to the value of the transaction. Once identified by BIS, emerging and foundational technologies will also be considered critical technologies for the purpose of mandatory CFIUS declarations."While at Treasury running the CFIUS process, I saw first-hand the limitations of the voluntary process where actors acquired new and critical technologies outside of CFIUS's purview. Now with ECRA and FIRRMA, we can better safeguard the loss of our critical technologies (including emerging and foundational technologies) to those who would do harm to our economic and national security. Since my service in government, I have observed an increasing number of transactions involving Chinese parties where the technology at issue could be viewed to present a lower threat, but the actual threat posed by the transaction related to vulnerabilities in the U.S. supply chain. Such vulnerabilities augment the ability of rogue actors to leverage the U.S. supply chain thereby raising national security concerns, including: undercutting direct competitors; eroding the existing U.S. technology of acquired companies; impacting the availability of upstream inputs; and undermining the ability of downstream purchasers and producers to compete."Thus, CFIUS is under increased pressure to evaluate supply chain factors in its analysis and must also account for China's strategy of civil-military integration.9III. The Recent Designations of ZTE, Huawei, and Other Chinese Technology Companies"On May 16, 2019, BIS added Huawei and 68 of its non-U.S. affiliates to the Entity List.10 The U.S. Government did so after determining that there was reasonable cause to believe that Huawei had been involved in activities contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States. The specific activities contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States include those activities alleged in the Department of Justice's public superseding indictment of Huawei, including alleged violations of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act ("IEEPA") and conspiracy to violate IEEPA (by providing prohibited financial services to Iran), and obstruction of justice in connection with the investigation of those alleged sanctions violations. As a result of its placement on the Entity List, the sale or transfer of American commodities, software, or technology to Huawei or its affiliates on the Entity List requires a license issued by BIS, and a license will be presumptively denied. By publicly listing such persons, the Entity List is an important tool to protect U.S. national security and foreign policy interests."Under the President's recent announcement, BIS will be promptly taking action to issue certain additional licenses, to companies that apply, which permit transactions that pose no national security risk, are not contrary to U.S. foreign policy interests, and are used to maintain, service and support: (A) widely-available commodity chipsets and certain electronic integrated circuits; (B) software and tools that are generally available to the public; or (C) operating system software and applications and system services for mobile devices, as well as technology and software necessary to support the operating systems. Other license applications that pose no national security threat and are not contrary to U.S. foreign policy interests will also be promptly considered."Prior to Huawei's designation, BIS also targeted ZTE. In March 2016, ZTE and several of its affiliates were added to the Entity List for their involvement in a scheme to reexport U.S.-controlled items to Iran. ZTE reached a settlement with BIS in March 2017, paying a total of US$1.19 billion in fines, and was subject to a suspended denial order. Having not complied with certain conditions of that settlement, BIS activated the Denial Order on ZTE in April 2018. The import ban has since been lifted as ZTE agreed to a settlement with BIS with significant conditions, including a US$1 billion fine. BIS rightfully took a strong stance against ZTE, imposing unprecedented compliance measures as part of the settlement. These actions demonstrate a robust commitment on the part of the Administration to combat technology-related national security issues. Such efforts were necessary and long overdue."The effort to closely scrutinize and restrict transactions with Chinese entities that pose potential national security risks is not limited to the Administration. Congress, through Section 889 of the NDAA, has effectively banned the federal government from purchasing equipment from Huawei and ZTE, citing them as national security risks. Specifically, Section 889 prohibits federal agencies, federal contractors, and grant or loan recipients from procuring certain "covered telecommunications equipment or services," (equipment and services produced by Huawei and ZTE, and with respect to certain public safety or surveillance applications, Hytera Communications Corporation, Dahua Technology Company, and Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Company) as a "substantial or essential component of any system, or as critical technology as part of any system." Congress clearly believes that taking a strong stance against national security threats is warranted and necessary. We have recently seen a concerted effort from Congress and the Administration to protect U.S. national security against threat actors in the technology and telecommunications sectors. Continued diligence in this area is crucial to protecting U.S. national security moving forward.IV. Effectiveness of ECRA-Related Control Structures in the United States in Confronting the Challenges Raised with Respect to China, including Persistent Diversion Challenges"I believe that the ECRA-related controls will go a long way toward improving U.S. transparency and effectiveness in addressing the challenges related to China and its persistent diversion tactics. We have seen that stronger enforcement and broader application of law under FIRRMA has had an effect. As reported by a number of sources, including the Rhodium group, Chinese investments into the U.S. have been significantly curtailed. This was important given the statistics on Chinese government backed investment happening in our most advanced and innovative companies. The Rhodium group had calculated that, on average, 21 percent of Chinese venture investment in the United States from 2000 through 2017 came from state-owned funds, which are controlled at least in part by the Chinese government. In 2018, that figure surged to 41 percent.11"Also, with the implementation of ECRA and designation of emerging and foundational technologies, U.S. policy makers will be able to better assess the vulnerability of our supply chains and where the U.S. stands in terms of critical technology leadership, including where that leadership has been eroded."However, clearly, we need a "whole of government" defensive strategy where it concerns these national security threats. When China utilizes government actors to hack into U.S. private companies to take proprietary technology and give such information to Chinese companies, the United States must address the issue broadly. Pulling from a recent speech by the U.S. Justice Department, I note: "since 2011, more than 90 percent of the Department's economic espionage prosecutions (i.e., cases alleging trade secret theft by or to benefit a foreign state) involve China, and more than two-thirds of all federal trade secret theft cases during that period have had at least a geographical nexus to China. Some of those cases demonstrate that China is using its intelligence services and their tradecraft to target our private sector's intellectual property."12 Clearly, we must continue to improve our ability to protect U.S. private companies from Chinese nation-state threat actors.V. Possible Legislative or Oversight Recommendations"In closing, I applaud this Committee and this Administration for the hard work to create new and stronger mechanisms to address national security vulnerabilities arising from the loss of critical technologies, military, emerging and foundational. While implementation of ECRA and FIRRMA are underway, there is even more that could be done."We should create additional enforcement tools to better address cyber and intellectual property ("IP") theft. Perhaps an IP "Entities List", similar to USTR's Notorious Markets List. Further we should consider taking additional actions in response to cyber attacks using executive powers. With the full implementation of FIRRMA, foreign government-controlled transactions and transactions involving critical infrastructure should be subject to mandatory filing requirements. We also need additional tools to address overcapacity by foreign state-owned enterprises that are able to enter the U.S. market unimpeded or create global market distortions to the detriment of our producers and U.S. innovation and jobs."Lastly and importantly, the key to ensuring that BIS and other export control agencies are able to carry out their missions and the new responsibilities under ECRA is additional funding and resources. If we are serious about addressing the current and future loss of U.S. emerging and foundational technology, if we want to ensure that the United States continues to be a global leader for innovation, security and freedom, it is critical that such funding and resources is provided."As Secretary Ross said: "we can no longer accept the decline of U.S. industries due to state-supported overcapacity, and the strategic -- often clandestine -- foreign purchases and investments in our most important technology enterprises."13"Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today. I look forward to your questions."* * *Footnotes:1 Subtitle B, Part 1, P.L. 115-2322 Title XVII, P.L. 115-2323 P.L No: 115-2324 E.O. 13873, "Securing the Information and Communications Technology and Services Supply Chain."5 Remarks by U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur L.

China to apply higher tariffs on US agricultural productsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 25, 2019 SundayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 821 wordsBodyThe u.S.-China trade war, which has already been in place for 17 months and counts in the agricultural sector between its battles, saw hostilities escalate yesterday after the Chinese government of Xi Jinping announced the imposition of new tariffs on products Americans that will take effect in a staggered manner, on the 1st of next month and on December 15. The entire complex sojero, maize, wheat, sage and various meat cuts were included in the measure adopted in response to the increased levies provided in early August by the Donald Trump administration.Perhaps the unprecedented fact so far in the conflict was that the Chinese measure proved unforeseen, as there was a first response - the 5th of the current - to the higher US tariffs when from Beijing the Ministry of Commerce announced that firms had been instructed China to stop buying u.S. agricultural products."This time China hit first," was yesterday the most repeated comment among agricultural market operators who, once the news was known (shortly after 8 o'clock local time), sent an inexorable bearish transit for soybean prices, a product that was became a reference to the conflict, on the Chicago Stock Exchange. Several hours later, the premonition was embodied on the slates, with losses close to 1.5% for oleaginous, the value of which fell from $314.53 to $309.84 per tonne, even despite the estimate of Pro Farmer, who calculated a volume of soybeans 2019/ 2020 lower than USDA's estimate (95.17 vs. 100.16 million tonnes, as expanded separately).According to China's Ministry of Commerce, new tariffs on U.S. products will comprise goods of up to $75 billion. From next 1next month, the 25% tariff imposed in July 2018 for U.S. soybean stake in China will be added another 5%. Exports of beef from beef, pigs and birds will be the same fate. Meanwhile, since 15 December, raw soybean oil, maize, wheat and sip will add another 10% to the current 25% tariff. A 10% tax will also be applied to the entry of soybean meal, which until now had not been included in Chinese retaliation.Just as after the news spread the fall in the value of soybeans was a certainty, so was an early rebuttal of Trump through his account on the social network Twitter. "Our country has stupidly lost trillions of dollars to China for many years. They've stolen our intellectual property at the rate of hundreds of billions of dollars a year, and they want to continue. I won't let that happen! We don't need China and, frankly, we'd be much better off without them," the president wrote, nearly two hours after the Chinese announcement.And as usual, tweets happened: "At present, our large American companies are ordered to immediately start looking for an alternative to China, including returning home to make their products in the United States. I'll be responding to China's tariffs this afternoon," Trump said in a preview of what would go on and making it clear that the step taken by China's government was not among its forecasts.Around 18 o'clock local time came Trump's second tweet slab. "China should not have imposed new tariffs on U.S. (politically motivated!) products. As of 1 October, china's $250 billion of goods and products currently taxed at 25% will be taxed at 30%. In addition, the remaining $300 billion of Chinese goods and products, which were taxed from 1 September to 10%, will now be taxed at 15%. Thank you for your attention to this matter!" concluded thepresident of the world's leading power, in his response to the second global economy.A new meeting between U.S. and Chinese negotiators in Washington was scheduled for next month and must now be reformulated, from its content to its meaning. It is worth remembering that after the second truce signed on June 29 in Osaka by Trump and Xi, on July 30, there was a meeting between officials from both countries in Beijing. Just 48 hours later, Trump announced the imposition of a new tariff. With this and many other backgrounds in the dispute, the end of the trade war is a chimera in which few believe, with all the consequences that this entails, not only for those directly involved.Local lookWith a local look, circumcised to agricultural trade, the continuation of the trade war makes the sale of Argentine soybeans to China more attractive. So much so that since the end of July, the FOB value of oilseed in Argentine ports climbed from $339 to $350 per tonne, while the FOB price in the Gulf of Mexico fell from $352.65 to $328.20.According to the cargo report of ships of the Rosario Stock Exchange, between the 21of the current and 28th of next month must leave from Argentine ports 924,717 tons of soybean bean. Increased demand pressure on raw grain will accentuate competition between export and the oil industry, which could help improve the value received by the producer, which was quoted yesterday to $240.Copyright Group of Diaries America - GDA/La Nación/ArgentinaLoad-Date: August 26, 2019End of Document

30 Ways the World Is Taking Bold Climate ActionTheStreet.comJuly 11, 2019 Thursday 6:57 AM EDTCopyright 2019 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 2751 wordsByline: Samanda DorgerHighlight: Here are 30 ways countries around the world are responding to climate change while delivering strong economic growth, sustainability and inclusivity.BodyA changing climate threatens lives and costs businesses, governments and individuals money -- but what if we could save the world and improve economic conditions for everyone?The cost of climate change is staggering. Global economic damage is estimated to be between $54 trillion and $69 trillion by 2100, according to  . Changing weather will harm agriculture, while human life, infrastructure and property are threatened by rising seas and intense storms and wildfires.If you despair, have hope -- there are solutions. In fact, one recent  in Science magazine said that restoring a few billion acres of forest around the world would be a relatively cheap and effective way to tackle the problem. In the image above, volunteers plant young trees in deep mud in a mangrove reforestation project in Samut Sakhon, Thailand.All around the world people are acting, innovating, investing, creating jobs and improving well-being for people through bold action on climate change, according to a report by The Global Commission on the Economy and Climate.We may sit on the brink of a new economic era in which growth is "driven by the interaction between rapid technological innovation, sustainable infrastructure investment, and increased resource productivity," the report says.The commission's report,  , lists big and small ways people are addressing solutions, including pricing carbon, harnessing the power of the private sector, accelerating investment in sustainable infrastructure, and making equitable and just transitions to new models of energy, food and land use, water management, and industry.Based on The New Climate Economy, here are 30 ways countries around the world are responding to climate change while delivering strong economic growth, sustainability and inclusivity.Photo: Sura Nualpradid / Shutterstock1.

In France, a government program has prioritized the use of timber in construction, and in the U.S. the concrete industry share of the critical mid-rise building market has shrunk by at least 10% in the past 10 years, thanks in part to an ambitious initiative by wood industry associations.Photo: Shutterstock14.

Getting More Value from Less WaterChinaIn the Turpan Prefecture of China, water managers turned to satellite remote-sensing to assess evapotranspiration, allowing them to monitor water use and productivity, and reform allocation on the basis of actual consumption. The program focuses on getting more value from less land and water, by shifting from commodity crops like cotton and corn, to higher value melons and grapes. As a result, farmer incomes increased at around 4% above inflation and groundwater decline reduced by almost 170 million cubic meters.Photo: Kylie Nicholson / Shutterstock19.

He said the Federal Bureau of Investigation and CIA needed to ask Google three questions to determine if the tech giant had been compromised by Chinese intelligence, Axios reported.Thiel, who sits on Facebook's board and co-founded PayPal, criticized Google for doing business with China and not the USA military. Earlier this year, General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, made similar comments about the Google decision but didn't specifically use the word treason.Italy seizes missile from far-right extremistsHe added that "we have some idea about what the seized equipment could be used for, but will not speculate". Far-right Interior Minister Matteo Salvini did not comment on the raids."Google is not a patriotic company", he said. "It's more of a direct benefit to the Chinese military". Thiel said, according to news accounts of the event.Thiel also reportedly called for America's top universities to lose their non-profit status.Bloomberg reports his comments focused on artificial intelligence, which Google is developing as part of its DeepMind subsidiary.The conference's four keynote speakers include Thiel, national security advisor John Bolton, white supremacist talk show hostTucker Carlson, and Senator Josh Hawley from Missouri. Thiel secretly financed the lawsuit that bankrupted Gizmodo's former parent company, Gawker Media, back in 2016."There's this very peculiar background where Google is working with the Chinese on Communist government and not with the USA military", Thiel said.Load-Date: July 17, 2019End of Document

Attention quickly shifted to trade, however, after China announced tariffs on $75 billion of goods imported from the U.S on Sept. 1 and Dec. 15, which are the same dates the U.S. has planned for its tariffs on China. The tariff rate will range from 5-10%, including a separate 5-25% on autos and auto parts starting Dec. 15.Modest selling ensued, but stocks quickly recouped losses after Mr. Powell reiterated comments that upheld the market's view for further economic stimulus. The day had barely begun, though, and President Trump took to Twitter to lash out against both the Fed Chair and China. Stocks fell noticeably on the president's declaration that companies find alternatives to China.A steady broad-based retreat transpired during the day amid worries that escalated trade tensions will exacerbate slowing global growth and, by extension, affect corporate earnings. All 11 S&P 500 sectors finished in negative territory, which saw the energy (-3.4%) and information technology (-3.3%) sectors losing over 3%. The utilities sector (-1.1%) declined the least.Shares of Apple (AAPL 202.64, -9.82) fell 4.6% and other trade-sensitive areas like the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-4.4%) and Dow Jones Transportation Average (-3.3%) also posted steep losses. Shares of Foot Locker (FL 34.00, -7.93, -18.9%) plunged nearly 20% after the company missed top and bottom-line estimates.Amid the uncertainty and growth concerns, investors flocked to safe-haven assets like gold ($1537.25/oz, +$28.75, +1.9%), the Japanese yen, and U.S. Treasuries. In addition, expectations for further downside in equities contributed to a 17.8% spike in the CBOE Volatility Index (19.65, +2.97).The 2-yr yield dropped seven basis points to 1.53%, and the 10-yr yield dropped eight basis points to 1.53%. The U.S. Dollar Index fell 0.5% to 97.73. WTI crude fell 2.0%, or $1.12, to $54.16/bbl.President Trump also indicated he would officially respond to Beijing's actions in the afternoon. No response was announced by session's close, which may have contributed to some reservations to step into the action during the day.Friday's economic data was limited to New Home Sales for July:New home sales declined 12.8% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 635,000 (Briefing.com consensus 645,000) from an upwardly revised 728,000 (from 646,000) in June. New home sales were up 4.3% yr/yr.The key takeaway from the report is that there was a big upward revision for June, yet there was no follow-through in July despite low mortgage rates and lower median sales prices. Sales were down big in three of the four regions and the total number of new homes sold was still below the originally reported 646,000 increase for June.Looking ahead, investors will receive Durable Goods Orders for July on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +16.8% YTDS&P 500 +13.6% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +9.9% YTDRussell 2000 +8.2% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 402/2352. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 478/2602.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: August 26, 2019End of Document

Attention quickly shifted to trade, however, after China announced tariffs on $75 billion of goods imported from the U.S on Sept. 1 and Dec. 15, which are the same dates the U.S. has planned for its tariffs on China. The tariff rate will range from 5-10%, including a separate 5-25% on autos and auto parts starting Dec. 15.Modest selling ensued, but stocks quickly recouped losses after Mr. Powell reiterated comments that upheld the market's view for further economic stimulus. The day had barely begun, though, and President Trump took to Twitter to lash out against both the Fed Chair and China. Stocks fell noticeably on the president's declaration that companies find alternatives to China.A steady broad-based retreat transpired during the day amid worries that escalated trade tensions will exacerbate slowing global growth and, by extension, affect corporate earnings. All 11 S&P 500 sectors finished in negative territory, which saw the energy (-3.4%) and information technology (-3.3%) sectors losing over 3%. The utilities sector (-1.1%) declined the least.Shares of Apple (AAPL 202.64, -9.82) fell 4.6% and other trade-sensitive areas like the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-4.4%) and Dow Jones Transportation Average (-3.3%) also posted steep losses. Shares of Foot Locker (FL 34.00, -7.93, -18.9%) plunged nearly 20% after the company missed top and bottom-line estimates.Amid the uncertainty and growth concerns, investors flocked to safe-haven assets like gold ($1537.25/oz, +$28.75, +1.9%), the Japanese yen, and U.S. Treasuries. In addition, expectations for further downside in equities contributed to a 17.8% spike in the CBOE Volatility Index (19.65, +2.97).The 2-yr yield dropped seven basis points to 1.53%, and the 10-yr yield dropped eight basis points to 1.53%. The U.S. Dollar Index fell 0.5% to 97.73. WTI crude fell 2.0%, or $1.12, to $54.16/bbl.President Trump also indicated he would officially respond to Beijing's actions in the afternoon. No response was announced by session's close, which may have contributed to some reservations to step into the action during the day.Friday's economic data was limited to New Home Sales for July:New home sales declined 12.8% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 635,000 (Briefing.com consensus 645,000) from an upwardly revised 728,000 (from 646,000) in June. New home sales were up 4.3% yr/yr.The key takeaway from the report is that there was a big upward revision for June, yet there was no follow-through in July despite low mortgage rates and lower median sales prices. Sales were down big in three of the four regions and the total number of new homes sold was still below the originally reported 646,000 increase for June.Looking ahead, investors will receive Durable Goods Orders for July on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +16.8% YTDS&P 500 +13.6% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +9.9% YTDRussell 2000 +8.2% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 402/2352. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 478/2602.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: August 26, 2019End of Document

"He has been told not to pursue the lunch. My source believes the lunch won't happen at all."Tron and BitTorrent CEO Justin Sun postponed the charity meal with Berkshire Hathaway's billionaire boss last week, blaming a bout of kidney stones. He had planned to turn Buffett, a notorious crypto skeptic, into a true believer. He also offered the same opportunity to Trump."Mr. President, you are misled by fake news," Sun tweeted after Trump attacked bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. "           #Bitcoin &            #Blockchain happens to be the best chance for US! I'd love to invite you to have lunch with crypto leaders along with            @WarrenBuffett on July 25. I guarantee you after this lunch, nobody will know crypto more than you!"Sun appears to be in trouble with the Chinese government. Caixin reported he delayed lunch with Buffett because he was barred from leaving China due to allegations including illegal fundraising, money laundering, and gambling. Sun denied the claims and broadcast a live video showing he was in San Francisco.However, Chinese officials briefly detained several Tron executives then released them after Sun postponed the lunch, according to Bloomberg. Sun also posted a groveling public apology on            Chinese social media, saying he regretted hyping up the lunch, vowed to put China's interests before his own, and promised to retreat from the public eye.Despite his pledge, Sun attended a Tron party with influencers on July 25 - the original date of the Buffett lunch - to celebrate the company's acquisition of BitTorrent a year earlier. BitTorrent creator Bram Cohen soon added to the clouds over Sun by accusing him of not making the final payment for BitTorrent. Sun retweeted a reply from a Tron executive that said the funds in escrow no longer belonged to Sun.Tron didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.NOW WATCH: The US women's national team dominates soccer, but here's why the US men's team sucksSee Also:• These 10 stocks are the most crowded trades• The founder of a $10 billion asset manager that's beating 95% of its peers reveals the single most important attribute he looks for in a company• 'Get out quick': A strategist at $1 trillion Edward Jones explains why bitcoin's 300% rally is not to be trustedSEE ALSO: The crypto whiz kid who bailed on a $4.6 million lunch with Warren Buffett is being accused of stiffing BitTorrent's founderLoad-Date: July 29, 2019End of Document

New Bill Could Produce Rash of China DelistingsThe Deal PipelineJuly 1, 2019 MondayCopyright 2019 The Deal, L.L.C. All Rights ReservedLength: 1161 wordsByline: by Bill MeagherBodyWhile Wall Street has been focused on how tariffs with China might affect the import market, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., has introduced legislation that could impact U.S. shareholders of China-based companies trading on U.S. exchanges.The Equitable Act, an acronym for Ensuring Quality Information and Transparency for Abroad-Based Listing on our Exchanges, would force companies listed in the U.S. to allow the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board access to financial records tied to audits. While the legislation applies to all companies trading in the U.S., Rubio, a longtime China critic, is aiming squarely at the claim by the Chinese government that audit inspections violates its sovereignty and that the details of such inspections are considered state secrets.Both the PCAOB and the Securities and Exchange Commission have tried negotiating access to financials on the ground in China for companies registered and trading in the U.S. But China has declined to allow such inspections.The Equitable Act, also sponsored by Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J.; Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark.; and presidential candidate Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., would give foreign companies three years to come into compliance with U.S. regulators, or face delisting of stocks. Going forward, it would also deny registration in the U.S. to foreign companies who refuse to allow audit access and disqualify companies using audit firms that have told the SEC or PCAOB to go away.This means that companies like e-commerce firm Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (BABA) and technology company Baidu Inc. (BIDU) that went public in the U.S. in large IPOs would need to open their audits to inspection or be delisted. Alibaba is said to be considering a $20 billion offering in Hong Kong.In 2018, there were 33 Chinese companies that went public in the U.S. via IPO, with a total of $9.1 billion in proceeds generated according to Dealogic. Bob McCooey, chairman of Nasdaq Asia-Pacific, told CNBC last month he thought there would be more than 40 IPOs in 2019 by Chinese companies in the U.S.In a note to investors earlier this month, Morgan Stanley advised its clients that the legislation could have a significant impact. "Our early reaction is that this has the potential to cause significant changes in the domain for listing of Chinese firms going forward with the potential for delisting of Chinese firms on U.S. exchanges and relisting elsewhere (most likely Hong Kong)." The report said it was possible the act could affect the listing of as many as 800 Chinese stocks.The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission says there are 156 Chinese companies listed on the largest U.S. exchanges, including 11 state-owned enterprises. Those companies have an aggregate capitalization of $1.2 trillion.In a statement about the legislation earlier this month, Rubio said: "If China-based companies want to list on stock exchanges or access capital markets in the U.S., we should make them comply with American laws. The act makes it clear that there is a price for the Chinese government and Communist Party's disregard for the rules of responsible economic and financial engagement in international capital markets."The issue of China not allowing PCAOB inspections of audits performed on U.S. registered China-based companies is longstanding. In the past, Chinese companies seeking exposure to U.S. capital would use reverse mergers to go public, often using shell companies supplied by dealmaking middlemen.A number of law firms took up the cause of bringing the small companies public and collecting the fees that went with those services. And a group of second- and third-tier investment banks were happy to work as placement agents finding buyers for private placements worth millions.The "China Growth" story enticed investors who saw the Middle Kingdom as the Next Big Thing. Though institutional investors were more cautious, retail investors intrigued by the idea of adding 1.5 billion consumers to a business model were soon investing in coal slurry companies as well as chicken farms.In 2009, 45 Chinese companies went public in the U.S. using reverse mergers, according to PrivateRaise, The Deal's data service that tracks reverse merger transactions. The next year, the number of deals jumped by 80%, with 29 out of 81 transactions including private-investment-in-public-equity issuances. But a rash of accounting frauds in 2011 slowed the wave of Chinese companies making themselves at home in U.S. capital markets. That year just 41 Chinese companies went public in reverse mergers, and only four of those deals included PIPE issuances.In some cases, Chinese companies were keeping two sets of books, one in China and the other showing up in SEC filings. In other cases, the companies themselves were frauds. And the fallout from the scandal and the more than 50 companies bounced from Nasdaq or cited in civil lawsuits by the SEC cost investors an estimated $50 billion.Rubio's legislation could strip the two exchanges of numerous listings, Nasdaq has 171 Chinese companies listed according to its public filings. The Deal asked both exchanges for comment about the legislation and how it would affect the exchanges. The New York Stock Exchange declined to comment.Nasdaq did not return a phone call seeking comment on the Equitable Act.OTC Market Group President and CEO Cromwell Coulson said he thinks it's a good thing that Congress views the senior exchanges as an asset. "I think they are being pragmatic," he said. "They are saying that there is an expectation that companies listed on those exchanges are being audited by PCAOB approved firms. It is a good thing."Given the current political tensions between the Trump administration and China over tariffs, the amplified review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States where China is concerned, as well as the Chinese government's refusal to allow either on the ground audit inspections or export of audit documents, it seems unlikely China would choose to allow U.S. regulators to begin inspections now.Likewise, the political environment in Washington makes this sort of legislation easier to introduce and bring to a vote.Paul Gillis, an accounting professor at Peking University's Guanghua School of Management and a long-time observer of the disagreement between U.S. regulators and the Chinese government, said in a blog post earlier this month that the chances of a settlement from China were even money, or that Rubio's legislation would pass. But Gillis also observed that he didn't think the issue was critical for China and wondered what the U.S. could offer to make a deal happen.While the pipeline for China IPOs seems strong, there are eight special purpose acquisition companies with a focus on getting deals done with a China or Asia focus, according to PrivateRaise.

Bolstered by policies, Chinese graphene market will expectedly sustain growth rates of at least 50% from 2019 to 2025.Chinese graphene market is characterized by the following:• Graphene industry is still in its infancy and graphene is being researched vigorously in all countries, leading to a boom in patent filings. The Chinese government has issued a set of policies supporting the industry, for example, graphene was taken as a priority in the Development Plan for New Materials during the 13th Five-year Plan Period (2016-2020), through which China has led the world in a number of graphene patents and researches. In 2018, graphene patent fillings in the country outnumbered 30,000.• Graphene powder finds most application in China nowadays (Graphene powder is used in battery conductive additives, lithium battery materials and special coatings; graphene film gets utilized for thermally conductive films, flexible displays and sensors.). Taking features like high thermal conductivity and small size into account, graphene film will be increasingly applied in domains such as smartphones, computers and wearable devices, so its market share will rise further.• Use of graphene in a lithium battery is mature enough currently. Over 50% of graphene in China is demanded by lithium batteries. As research goes on and technology advances, the downstream application of graphene will be expanding. Besides its widespread use in anti-corrosion coatings, resins, rubber and battery materials, graphene also plays an ever more important role in emerging industries, for instance, new-generation display devices, big health and advanced manufacturing, with the advent of new products like graphene-based organic photovoltaic (OPV) films.• There are over 300 producers of graphene power and films in China, but most of them are incompetent for large-scale industrial production though their products are mature enough to be put into mass production. Key players include Beijing Moxi Holding Group Co., Ltd., Der Future Science & Technology Holding Group, 2D Carbon (Changzhou) Tech Inc. and The Sixth Element (Changzhou) Materials Technology Co., Ltd., among which Beijing Moxi Holding Group Co., Ltd. boasts the biggest market share, commanding over 20% of the market in 2018.Global and China Graphene Industry Report, 2019-2025 focuses on the following:• Graphene (definition, performance, preparation methods, development course, industrial chain)• Global graphene industry (development status quo, market size, prices, prospects of industrialization, patents, etc.)• China's graphene industry (policy climate, current development, patents, enterprises' forays, etc.)• Upstream (graphite, methane, etc.) and downstream (lithium battery, supercapacitor, transparent electrode, integrated circuit, etc.) markets of graphene, applications of graphene, etc.• 19 foreign and 16 Chinese graphene manufacturers (operation, graphene business, etc.)Key Topics Covered:1 Overview of Graphene Industry1.1 Definition1.2 Performance1.3 Preparation Method1.4 Development History1.5 Development Bottleneck1.6 Industry Chain2 Development of Global Graphene Industry2.1 Status Quo2.2 Market Size2.3 Market Price2.4 Industrialization Prospects2.5 Overview of Patents2.5.1 Total Filings2.5.2 Structure2.5.3 Patent Filings in Major Countries2.5.4 Patent Filings in Major Companies2.6 Competitiveness Analysis3 Development of Chinese Graphene Industry3.1 Policy Environment3.2 Current Situation3.2.1 Graphene Powder3.2.2 Graphene Film3.3 Industrialization Development3.3.1 Industry-University-Research Collaboration3.3.2 Industrial Park3.3.3 Patents3.4 Enterprises' Layout4 Upstream Sectors4.1 Graphite4.2 Others4.2.1 Methane4.2.2 Ethanol5 Downstream Applications5.1 Lithium Battery5.1.1 Graphene Application5.1.2 Market Situation5.2 Supercapacitor5.2.1 Graphene Application5.2.2 Market Situation5.3 Transparent Electrode5.3.1 Graphene Application5.3.2 Market Situation5.4 Integrated Circuit5.5 Others5.5.1 Polyester-based Composites5.5.2 Electrically Conductive Printing Ink5.5.3 Heat Dissipating Material6 Major Global Graphene Manufacturers6.1 Northern Graphite6.1.1 Profile6.1.2 Operation6.1.3 Graphene Business6.2 CVD6.2.1 Profile6.2.2 Operation6.2.3 Graphene Business6.3 Focus Graphite6.3.1 Profile6.3.2 Operation6.3.3 Graphene Business6.4 Lomiko Metals6.4.1 Profile6.4.2 Operation6.4.3 Graphene Business6.5 Applied Graphene Materials6.5.1 Profile6.5.2 Operation6.5.3 Graphene Business6.6 Graphene NanoChem Plc6.6.1 Profile6.6.2 Operation6.6.3 Graphene Business6.7 Haydale Graphene Industries6.7.1 Profile6.7.2 Operation6.7.3 Revenue Structure6.7.4 Graphene Business6.8 Other Enterprises6.8.1 Graphene Laboratories6.8.2 Graphenea6.8.3 Graphene Square6.8.4 Grafoid6.8.5 XG Sciences Inc6.8.6 BGT Materials Limited6.8.7 Angstron Materials6.8.8 Graphenano6.8.9 Vorbeck Materials6.8.10 CambridgeNanosystems6.8.11 GRAPHENEFRONTIERS6.8.12 GraphenePlatform Corp7.

Thanks so much for joining us.I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Thursday, August 8th.Your top stories right now, 7:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast.Markets are higher this morning. Take a look at futures pointing to a higher opening but well off of the highs of the morning.The Dow Jones futures right now up 27 points, losing steam quickly. We had been up about 80 points earlier. S&P futures up 6.5, the Nasdaq futures are up 29 points, a third of a percent.This comes one day after a wild day on Wall Street yesterday -- huge swings, down and up. The Nasdaq and S&P were able to come back from sharp losses earlier in the day to end actually higher. The Dow finishing the day slightly lower after a 2.5 percent plunge earlier in the session. It was down 600 at its worst yesterday.Markets now looking fractionally better.In Europe this morning, take a look at the momentum there, taking a cue from Wall Street. FT 100 up 12 points, CAC 40 in Paris up 62, and the Dax index in Germany higher by 85.In Asia it was higher across the board. We got better than expected trade data out of China overnight. Meanwhile Japan allowing exports of semiconductor manufacturing materials to South Korea.We have another central bank cut. This from the Philippine Central Bank, cutting its key rate by 25 basis points after those three central banks did the same yesterday.Oil, a big story, this morning sliding into bear market territory yesterday. Reports that Saudi Arabia is discussing options with other producers to stem the decline. Oil prices up almost 2 percent right now.Senator Mitch McConnell's Twitter has been locked. Coming up -- how video of protesters shut down his campaign's feed and what AOC has to do with it.More shaming from the left.Plus more big tech privacy issues, reports that Microsoft contractors are listening to Skype calls. This as Instagram dumps a partner after tracking users.All the issues you need to know, coming up.All those stories coming up this Thursday morning. And joining me to break it all down: fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell; Farvahar Partners founder and CEO Omeed Malik is with us this morning; and Fox News contributor, columnist with "The Hill", Liz Peek.Great show so far -- guys.LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: YesBARTIROMO: A lot to talk about. I can't believe how many stories are pointing to more shaming and more, you know, upset over President Trump.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: and Mitch McConnell, it was his campaign Twitter account. They posted video of a mob outside his home, chanting nasty things about him.Twitter shuts that down. That's not ok. But over the weekend, after these shootings, what was trending on Twitter, hashtag Mass Murder Mitch and Massacre Mitch. That was ok?But when you post video of people threatening you outside your home, that gets your own Twitter account shut down? That is the world of insanity that we're living in now when it comes to social media.Google, if you try to find out about mass shootings under President Obama's presidency, if you Google that, it pulls up search queries that involve Trump. It's all Trump information.BARTIROMO: Unbelievable.MCDOWELL: And granted, maybe that's the way the algorithms are working but --BARTIROMO: Yes. But somebody puts the algorithms together. Humans do the algorithms. I mean when is this going to stop and these powerful technology companies be held to account?These companies are more powerful than ever before and they're trying to put their finger on the scale.MCDOWELL: But literally if somebody is harassing me and I take a video of them and put it on Twitter, they're going to shut my account down. They're going to suspend it because that violates their rules. But somebody is allowed to basically cast aspersions at me and use hate speech against me and threaten me on Twitter and that's ok?BARTIROMO: But I don't even understand. I mean you're showing what's actually going on. McConnell's campaign was showing what was actually going on outside of his own home.MCDOWELL: It's called news. That's news.(CROSSTALKING)PEEK: And we haven't heard anything from Twitter about this. I mean generally speaking, they respond when something like this takes place and everybody's angry about it.I'm kind of surprised we haven't seen anything about this from the company. Because they are under fire on this stuff. Everyone knows there's bias.BARTIROMO: This is why we're going to see legislation.OMEED MALIK, FOUNDER & CEO, FARVAHAR PARTNERS: This is one time we can all agree we want more regulation of these big tech companies. They need to be broken up. these are anti-trust issues as well as violating First Amendment issues of free speech as well. This is about a serious --PEEK: Eventually, the broadcasters had to give everyone equal time. And at some point the social media companies are going to be hit with the same kind of thing.MALIK: If they want the best of both worlds.PEEK: That is exactly right.BARTIROMO: Exactly. We've got a big show. Coming up, joining the conversation this morning, the assistant to President Trump for trade and manufacturing policy, Peter Navarro is here to talk China and the Federal Reserve. We are going to talk about the issues around that, trade.And then three-time MLB MVP and 14 time all star, Alex Rodriguez. A-Rod here this morning along. Along with Barstool Sports CEO Erica Nardini. They'll discuss the sports business, podcast, and all things baseball this morning.Don't miss a moment of it. We've got a big show ahead.Our top story this hour is the stock market and all the wild swings we've been seeing. Orts business and all things baseball this morning. We've got a big show ahead.Our top story this hour is the stock market and all the wild swings we've been seeing. Futures set for a higher opening this morning although. We are off of the highs of the morning after stocks snapped back yesterday from sharp losses.Investors ultimately shook off fears from escalating China trade tensions. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq finished slightly higher in a major market reversal yesterday in heavy volume.The Dow erased a 589-point plunge to end the day slightly lower on the session. It fell to a two month low.President Trump slamming the Federal Reserve yesterday for doing more to harm the economy, he says, than China. But says he still has a long way to go with China. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Our country is doing incredibly well. China is not doing well. If you look at the trade situation, China just admitted yesterday that they've been a currency manipulator. First time they've ever been called out.Somebody had to do this with China because they were taking hundreds of billions of dollars a year out of the United States. And somebody had to make a stand.I think the market reaction is anticipated. I would have anticipated. I would have maybe anticipated even more if China was killing us with unfair trade deals. The people that allowed that to happen are a disgrace.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is Wells Fargo senior global equity strategist Scott Wren. Scott -- good to see you this morning. Thanks so much joining us.SCOTT WREN, SENIOR GLOBAL EQUITY STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO: Good morning -- Maria.BARTIROMO: So what do you see here? I mean all these wild swings, a lot of upset and nervousness over China trade and over all these interest rate cuts. Tell us what you want to do as an investor today.WREN: Well, you know, you're right. There's a laundry list of things to worry about. I think really what's been going on is, you know, we had a gigantic run higher up what I would call panic Christmas Eve low. You know, at one point at the high the market was up, the S&P 500 was up almost 29 percent.So, you know, I think it's natural just in any environment when you have a massive rally like that, you know, it could easily cough up a third of it on very little news. So really, we did not trade, at least in the U.S. trading session. We haven't hit the 200-day moving average which is down at 27.90.Now, overnight that level was tested when we were all sleeping but I think what you want to do here, you have to have a forward outlook. And if your forward outlook is constructive, we're looking for modest growth. We're looking for not much inflation.Clearly, the Fed's in an accommodative mood, as is every other major central bank. Valuations are not stretched. So if those are the conditions, what you need to be doing is looking at opportunities to step into stocks.Now, you know, we're less than 5 percent off the all-time record high. We have not had much of a pullback. I mean it feels pretty painful when, you know, you get a 3 percent pullback in one day like we did on Monday.BARTIROMO: Yes.WREN: But what we want our clients to do, we want to lean toward this expansion continuing. So, you know, whether it's the 200-day moving average, whether it's the June low, down at 27.40 somewhere in that zone is a great place to put a toe in the water at the very least. So you know, we're buying industrials, buying consumer discretionary, buying tech.All the things that get clobbered here in the pullback, we don't want our clients getting defensive. So you know, we don't want them in utilities and staples; at least overweight those sectors.So that's kind of our game plan. And I think you have to be patient here. But, you know, when the opportunity arises, you need to step in. You can't hesitate. I mean you've already formed your forward outlook or at least we have. Now, if your forward outlook is not good, well, that's a whole different deal.BARTIROMO: Interesting. Ok.WREN: We're looking for opportunities to buy.PEEK: So Scott -- it does seem -- good morning. It does seem like the United States equities market, stock market is really the only game in town. I mean, you know, there are all kinds of issues, we're all concerned about the Fed fund rate being higher than it should be, et cetera.But honestly for institution that's have to come up with 5, 6, 7 percent returns, where else are they going to go?WREN: That's exactly right, Liz. I mean we are really the only game in town. We've got the most dependable economy. We have a sturdy financial system. And that's why money tends to flow to the U.S.I mean if you're out there looking to buy equities, are you going to buy, you know, eurozone equities? Sure, they might be cheap, but they're cheap for a reason. So I think you're still going to have interest in the U.S.But, you know, all of us have been around for a long time and you know when the 10 year yield's at 170, that's not a good sign. So you have to think about why it's there, safe haven buying, other things. But it's also a reflection of hey just are we in a modest growth, modest inflation environment or is it something worse.So there's a lot going on and I hope we don't see a lot of days like yesterday. I mean, which ended fine, but that kind of volatility -- we're going to see a lot of mini days like yesterday and I think this volatility is not going to go away anytime soon.MALIK: Hi -- Scott. It's Omeed here. Two quick questions for you.One, how much do you think the rise of algorithmic trading has provided an artificial floor for the equity markets? And on a somewhat related note, are you concerned about the lack of liquidity we have in a post-crisis equity market which increases volatility, as you know?WREN: Yes. you know, these algo traders, you know, I'm an old school guy. I mean I was on the floor of the Mercantile Exchange, you know, 30 years ago. And so, you know, I think in terms of humans driving things. They get emotional, they push the sell button and all those kinds of things.Nowadays, you know, certainly a big volume is the machines pushing the button. And I think that if you look at -- it's certainly a big part of the volume. But if you look at places where the market stops and the last few years -- I mean the 200-day moving average, for example, that has really been a good source of resistance at times and support.So I would argue that when you look back at how the market trades, the natural places where humans would be buying or selling, it looks like, you know, that's where these algos are doing the same thing.Now does the speed of the move increase? I think it does. But I think the magnitude of the move, you know, what might normally play out over a few weeks or a month or something, I mean, it might take a day or two, but that is a consideration.You know, when you're running stops, when you're blowing through support, people are piling on quickly. And so, you know, there's some issues to think about there. But overall, you know, they're providing some liquidity and I think really when you look at it, the places where the market settles out are oftentimes if not almost all the time the same places as you would if there were just humans doing the trading, pushing the button so-to- speak.BARTIROMO: All right. You're looking for opportunities. We're going to be watching. You want to buy here.WREN: We are.BARTIROMO: Scott -- good to see you. Thanks so much.WREN: All right. Thanks -- guys.BARTIROMO: Scott Wren joining us from Wells Fargo.Quick break and then the McConnell campaign account locked out of Twitter, we told you why. We're going to tell you more about how that's playing out coming up.And then more privacy concerns -- Microsoft and Instagram tracking consumer data. we're going to tell you all about it when we come back. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.As we reported earlier, Senator Mitch McConnell's campaign account was locked out of Twitter. Lauren Simonetti with more details right now -- Lauren.LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Let's get some more information -- Maria.Twitter says it locked out the account for posting a video of protesters outside his Kentucky home. Twitter says the video violates its "violent threat" policy. Mitch McConnell's campaign manager slamming the company saying this in a statement. Quote, "This is a problem with the speech police in America today. Twitter will allow the words of 'Massacre Mitch' to trend nationally on their platform but locks out our account for posting actual threats against us."Well Twitter says the campaign's account will remain locked until that video of the protesters outside his home is deleted -- Maria.BARTIROMO: How do you justify this?SIMONETTI: He's the victim and his account is locked as a result.BARTIROMO: It's extraordinary.PEEK: It's really staggering really. And I just keep being surprised that Twitter hasn't said anything about it.BARTIROMO: They did. That was the comment. They're going to keep it locked until they delete the video. I mean it's absolutely extraordinary.(CROSSTALKING)PEEK: I can understand their -- anyway.SIMONETTI: I mean comments like "stab him in the heart", that's allowed to live on online but until that video comes down, his campaign account is blocked.BARTIROMO: And let's just underline the fact that this is outside of his home.PEEK: Yes, exactly. They're targeting his home.BARTIROMO: This is outside of Mitch McConnell's home and it's on him to delete the video. Unbelievable.MCDOWELL: And it was ok with Twitter to post say the address of someone on television and basically send mobs to the home and -- but this is not ok.BARTIROMO: Yes. Unbelievable.MCDOWELL: It actually expose -- you know what? If you're protesting and exercising your right to free speech, I would think that you would have the right to film them and post it on a social media platform. But again, clearly the censorship is ok if you're a conservative.BARTIROMO: Yes, exactly. And you know what? We're going to keep hearing commentary and proposals for regulation of this industry because they continue to just do whatever they want to do based on their ideologies and politics.Speaking of politics, on this program yesterday I sat down with 2020 candidate Tulsi Gabbard where she doubled down on her criticism of rival Kamala Harris. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. TULSI GABBARD (D-HI), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You know, what kind of leadership would she bring? And what kind of leader was she as attorney general in California?And it's pointing to the truth and the facts. She claims to be very proud of the record that she had as the attorney general in California.I pointed out some of the huge problems with the kind of leadership that she brought where she claims to be a champion for the people, but instead made decisions that caused more harm, hardship and suffering for people in California. And I gave some of those examples in the debate. She needs to answer to the American people on these facts.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: That was yesterday right here. Omeed -- you are a Tulsi Gabbard supporter. Your reaction. Why did she find it important to take on Kamala Harris?MALIK: Well, I think it was important that her record be examined because it was long overdue. So basically what she's talking about as she mentioned in the debate this is a person who said she is proud of her record. She sent 1,500 people to jail for marijuana offenses from the black and brown community and at the same time she went on a radio show just about two months ago and laughed about how she smokes a joint every once in a while because of her Jamaican heritage.That's the kind of inconsistency that people have come to know about Kamala and it's why her poll numbers are starting to suffer.I mean moreover, she sounds like someone who wants to be everything to everyone and her new healthcare plan demonstrates that. It basically is a hodgepodge of ideas that really doesn't do anything, it could end up signifying nothing.In complete contrast, Tulsi came on your show yesterday and talked about suing Google for $50 million. And we've been talking about how they're targeting conservatives. This is someone on the Democratic side but isn't just doing it because her side is being targeted but she wants to do something that's right for the country. And she is putting country above party.BARTIROMO: Yes. On the healthcare story, Dagen -- first Kamala Harris said she's ok with eliminating 180 million people's healthcare that's currently in place and go for Medicare for all. Then she backtracked it.MCDOWELL: Right. She raised her hand at that first Democratic debate and said I misheard the question. She thought that it mean -- her original answer was that she thought it meant taking away her -- like giving up her private insurance. I can't remember the initial explanation on her part.BARTIROMO: Why would anyone mess with her private --MALIK: Right. Exactly.MCDOWELL: Kamala Harris was a prosecutor and an attorney general. You have to stand up and defend -- on a debate stage you have to defend your record. I don't know how you defend prosecuting parents for truancy which actually happened although nobody went to jail. But again, she was a very aggressive prosecutor. You kind of -- you have to own it and you have to expect people to come after that.PEEK: And it's interesting to me that the only reason we're talking about Kamala Harris, the only reason she got a bump in the polls was she took on Joe Biden. There was a point where she was expected to be the vice presidential candidate for a Biden candidacy. Now maybe it's Tulsi Gabbard.BARTIROMO: Well, she took on Biden and she's very close with the Obamas. So that's interesting.All right. Quick break. And then oil is taking a dive, crude entering bear market territory yesterday. We've got a bounce however this morning. More on that next up.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Stocks are higher, oil prices are rebounding as well after sliding into bear market territory yesterday. Take a look at crude this morning, up 1.75 percent 88 cents higher.The latest Energy Information Administration report shows that stockpiles rose two and-a-half million barrels last week. That was 2.4 million. That's adding to concerns that the U.S.-China trade war could slow growth.Joining us right now is IHS Markit vice chairman, Dan Yergin. Dan -- it's always a pleasure to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.DAN YERGIN, VICE CHAIRMAN, HIS MARKIT: Good morning -- Maria. And good morning everybody.BARTIROMO: Your reaction to what we're seeing in terms of stockpiling and its impact.YERGIN: Well, the reason -- the concern about stockpiling is that that indicates that there's weakness in the world economy and in the U.S. economy. And of course, what also happened is that, you know, the fear of the trade war is really a fear about what happens to global demand for energy because of the weaker global economy.I think this rebound we're seeing in oil prices right now is partly because of what the Saudis and others have indicated they're doing and also the sense that maybe this isn't yet a full-blown currency war.PEEK: Dan -- good morning. Question for you. It seems to me that stockpiling would have actually taken place pretty naturally in an industry that's worried about what's going on with Iran, the Strait of Hormuz, tankers being taken out-of-line, et cetera.I mean wouldn't that have been a reason why people would actualy begin to stockpile oil?YERGIN: Well, I think there are two things to what you said. Certainly, you know, two months ago the oil market was registering fear about the gulf, all these incidents.As of yesterday, we count 532 tankers in and around the Persian Gulf which tells you -- I mean there's a lot of risk there. But I think these stockpiles are the kind of commercial stockpiles as a result of production in the United States or also in terms of not as much gasoline demand as been expected. So I think there's kind of two different things going on there.There's no question that there's still this sense of risk about the Gulf, but right now it's been engulfed by the concerns about a weaker global economy.MALIK: Hi, Daniel -- this is Omeed. A lot has been made about China reducing their rates and its effect on exports. But as you well know, China imports a lot of its commodities and that's going to obviously affect their purchasing power.Could you talk a little about China potentially not having the same purchasing power for its commodities and its impact on oil?YERGIN: Certainly, because oil is priced in dollars and there's no question that China is by far the world's largest market for energy. They import 75 percent of their oil, we import under 15 percent. We're a major oil exporter.And so if their economy weakens, that will affect the demand for energy. That's part of what's in the psychology of the market. But of course as you also point out, they don't want to see at least at this point their currency weaken too much because they have to buy all those commodities and there will be a higher price because the dollar will be stronger.BARTIROMO: Dan, real quick -- o you see the economy slowing substantially this year?YERGIN: Well, I think our numbers show the U.S. economy slowing from almost 3 percent last year to maybe 2.3 percent this year and also a slowing in the global economy because of all the concerns that are out there. So not a recession by any means but a slowing.BARTIROMO: All right. We'll leave it there.Dan -- it's great to see you. Come back soon.YERGIN: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Thanks so much.YERGIN: Thank you. Ok.BARTIROMO: Dan Yergin, IHS.Coming up, the trade dispute with China hitting the American farmer.

Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Thursday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, August 8th. Your top stories right now, 7:31 a.m. on the East Coast.Markets are higher this morning, Futures indicating a gain at the start of trading, although we are off of the highest levels of the morning. Dow Futures up 30 points, S&P Futures up six and the NASDAQ Futures up 32.This on top of a wild day yesterday with huge swings on Wall Street. The NASDAQ and the S&P were able to come back from sharp losses earlier in the day to actually end higher. The Dow finished the day slightly lower. But it was much worse, it was a 2.6 percent plunge, almost 600 points at its worst and then came back to end down 22 points on the Dow.European indices are continuing that momentum today, take a look. We've got the FT-100 in London up 14, CAC Quarante in Paris up 62, and the DAX Index in Germany up 90 points, three quarters of one percent.In Asia overnight it was green across the board. Take a look, Japan allowing exports of semiconductor manufacturing materials to South Korea. We also have another central bank cut, this time from the Philippines and this one was expected. They lowered their key rate by 25 basis points.China with a surprise increase in exports. The July rise of 3.3 percent mostly due to shipments to Europe and Southeast Asia. This as exports to the United States were down 6-1/2 percent as far as imports. What it all means for the future of trade talks, coming up.More big tech privacy issues to tell you about. Reports that Microsoft contractors are listening to Skype calls, and Instagram dumping a partner after tracking users, everything you need to know, coming up.Samsung is announcing new phones, competition for the iPhone, what the company is doing to gain some ground in the battle with Apple.And it's back-to-school time. The big business it means for retailers, plus a look at the -- at the U.S. consumer and how they are being impacted by tariffs.All those stories coming up this Thursday morning. But first, our top stories this half an hour, tariffs and farming, China's imports from the United States fell 19 percent during July. That's an improvement from June when imports were down 31 percent. China says it will suspend imports of U.S. agricultural goods. The U.S. farming industry taking major hits from this ongoing trade impasse.Joining us right now is a farmer, Iowa soybean farmer, Ron Heck. And Ron, it is good to see you this morning. Thank you so much for joining us today.RON HECK, SOYBEAN FARMER, IOWA: Good morning.BARTIROMO: How significant has this impact been to your business, to your farming and what's your take on the recent tariffs?HECK: Overall, U.S. farm profit has been cut in half over the last six years, from a little over $130 billion, down to about $60 billion a year for all farmers. Some sectors have been hit more than others. Soybeans are among the worst. And this is really unprecedented for our -- formerly our number one customer, to have the government issue an order to not buy anymore. It's the height of market interference on their part.BARTIROMO: So what would you like to see done, Ron? Do you want the president to pull back and not -- and not put these tariffs on products?HECK: Oh, this was something that had to be done. China has been doing harm to our agriculture for many, many years. Going back 10 years, they have interfered, restricted with food imports from the U.S. They had entirely shut out corn before they started it on soybeans. Something had to be done.We were facing a shrinking market. We were going to lose that market because of the Chinese government anyway. So the Chinese government has kind of put us in a position where we had not much left to lose and I'm very pleased that our government is in the process of trying to do something about that. And reopening that market for the benefit of U.S. farmers and also for Chinese consumers.MALIK: Hi, Ron. Sorry to hear about the struggles in your area. I was curious if you and your peers are supportive of the ratification of the USMCA which as you know, improves upon NAFTA which may also mitigated bit of this with imports to Mexico which I know is a consumer agricultural products quite significantly from the country.HECK: Oh, absolutely. Mexico, Canada, China, Japan, are our major customers. So the approval of the USMCA is really at the very top of our list. The ag trade benefits everyone in North America.PEEK: Ron, I'm sure you're checking on and following what this means for the Chinese consumer which you mentioned a couple of minutes ago. It seems to me this has to have had an enormous impact on prices that they're paying in China for food, grains, and pork and all the rest of these things. I mean, what do -- what do you see from that or what do you hear from that?HECK: Well, certainly the policies of the Chinese government have made food more expensive in China than it should be. The most recent numbers that I have available are from the OECD, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.Before this latest round of tariff wars, Chinese consumers were already paying more than $160 billion a year more for food because of restrictions. For many years the price of soybeans has been five to $6.00 a bushel more inside of China than it is in the rest of the world.That's harmed our demand and of course hurts the Chinese consumers. And it's why our Chinese customers would like to go back to buying from us because we have a good supply, great quality. We're reliable suppliers and a lower price than what China has internally.MCDOWELL: Ron, it's Dagen McDowell. What about the long-term damage done to the farming community by this? Are you worried about that? Because again, billions of dollars in aid but unless this trade fight is resolved, where does that leave families, frankly?HECK: Yes, the -- we'd much rather have the trade than the aid. The aid is a short-term Band-Aid. We've lost in the last six years about $65 billion a year in farm operating profits. The trade payments of 12 to $14 billion are very helpful but they're much less than the total damage.The only real answer here is to go back to a system that is more open where our customers are allowed to buy our products.PEEK: Is there another market where some farmers are selling soybeans in particular right now? I can't imagine 16 million tons are just going to go to waste.HECK: We certainly hope they don't. We're carrying the extra inventory at our own expense. We are making more sales to other countries but losing 1.3 billion customers in China is something that you just can't make up.PEEK: Right.HECK: So our leftover inventory at the end of each year keeps going up. It will be years getting this straightened out even if we have an immediate trade resolution.BARTIROMO: Have you been promised anymore help from the government?HECK: No. It's on a year by year basis. Our government and the soybean farmers, both hope that we work this out and further payments aren't necessary.BARTIROMO: Yes.HECK: But in the -- in the meantime, with no profits, we have -- we have bills to pay and it's very helpful to the ag industry and the rural communities to have these market payments that at least allow farmers to pay their bills.BARTIROMO: So what you're saying is you support what the president has done even though it's been a major hit to your business? How do you think this gets resolved?HECK: Well, China and the United States are really natural trading partners. Unfortunately, they're also natural rivals. But we need to have this rivalry issue settled and go back to trading.China benefits from buying our food. We benefit from buying Chinese products. And hopefully at one of these trade meetings the presidents of the two countries will get together and agree to trading rules.But we can't have the Chinese state trading enterprise model where the government just comes out and says well, we're not going to buy beans --BARTIROMO: Understood.HECK: -- or the ag products. That's the definition of unfair trading practices.BARTIROMO: Ron, it's great to get your insights this morning. Thanks so much.HECK: Thank you.BARTIROMO: We'll be watching. Ron Heck, soybean farmer.Technology giants are under fire again meanwhile over privacy concerns. Forcing Instagram to cut ties with one of its marketing partners. Grady Trimble is live in Chicago this morning with details there. Grady, Good morning to you.GRADY TRIMBLE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria. Not such a good morning for anybody who likes tech and social media and wants privacy. This time around, Facebook's Instagram as well as Microsoft's Cortana the voice assistant and Skype are getting attention for all the wrong reasons.First, Business Insider reports one of Instagram's vetted advertising partners was able to collect user data from their stories including their location as well as personal bios and pictures. You might know, stories are supposed to disappear after 24 hours.Instagram sent the start-up hyper a cease and desist and told Business Insider HYP3R broke its rules. HYP3R for its part denied doing so according to the publication. This of course comes a year after Cambridge Analytica, that whole scandal in which that company got access to user data on Facebook to target them with political ads. Facebook as you know owns Instagram.And in other tech news, Vice is reporting Microsoft hires contractors to listen to Skype calls as well as some things people say to the voice assistant Cortana. An unnamed contractor told Vice he's heard intimate private conversations. The source says contractors listen only when people are using the translation function and they're there to help with the artificial intelligence to make sure that the translation is correct and to improve that function.But Maria, I think it's safe to say at this point anything you do online, anything you do on your phone, you better assume that it's public.BARTIROMO: Yes, all right. Grady, thanks very much. We'll be watching what happens next. Grady Trimble with the latest there in Chicago.Coming up, Samsung rolls out its new phone, the details on the iPhone competitor and when you can get your hands on it.Then, it is that time of the year, back-to-school. Can you believe it? Parents spending a lot on these supplies. We're going to tell you what they are, next hour. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Puerto Rico swears in its third governor in less than a week. Lauren Simonetti with headlines now, Lauren.SIMONETTI: Wow. OK. So the U.S. Territory Secretary of Justice Wanda Vazquez was sworn into office yesterday. This after the island's Supreme Court ruled last week's swearing in of Pedro Pierluisi was unconstitutional. Outgoing embattled Governor Ricardo Rossello had appointed Pierluisi days before stepping down, a move the courts disagreed with.Well, Samsung has unveiled its new Galaxy Note 10 smartphones, plural, two of them, one smaller than the first Galaxy Note 10 which was released back in 2011 and then also a bigger one. The updated models offer more battery power and other features.Although, they don't have the head phone jack. Pre-orders start today. The official release is set for August 23rd. They start at $950.Well, the Emmys are following the Oscars lead, producers deciding not to have a host at this year's awards ceremony. The Fox Network will broadcast the Emmys next month. And they say that some big names in Hollywood were considered but the producers decided they had too much to do without worrying about a host. So if you remember, the Oscars were hostless back in February. Show moves faster. Viewership went up 12 percent. So we'll see if that's going to happen this time too.It's also some big anniversaries, it's the 30th anniversary of "Seinfeld", I think the 25th of "Friends". So I think there's a lot to get to and they'll do it without a host.BARTIROMO: Yes and it worked out well the last time.SIMONETTI: Worked out really well.MCDOWELL: The only reason -- the only reason the Oscars ratings were up is because of Gaga and Cooper. Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga.BARTIROMO: Yes, good point.PEEK: What a scene that was.BARTIROMO: Good point, they almost kissed right there at the piano.MCDOWELL: I have watched that movie, "A Star is Born" probably 12 times.PEEK: It's so fabulous.BARTIROMO: Me too. I keep watching it over and over again because now it's on.MCDOWELL: It is that good. It's on HBO.PEEK: It's so good.BARTIROMO: It's so good.All right, coming up, the first day of school is looming, back-to-school shopping already reaching fever pitch. The top trends for fall, right after this break.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. And it is back-to-school shopping. It is big business. Parents on pace for some heavy and hefty spending. This year it's expected to hit $80.7 billion, just back to school. That's according to the National Retail Federation.Joining me right now is the founder of OMG Accessories, Anne Harper. Anne, it's great to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.ANNE HARPER, FOUNDER, OMG ACCESSORIES: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Bringing some products around as well. What are you expecting this back-to-school season?HARPER: Well, this is actually been one of our biggest years ever. Year over year for the last two years, we've seen a 30 percent increase in our sales.BARTIROMO: Terrific. And you brought some products that you sell through what, Target, give me the stores that you're --HARPER: We sell department stores like Nordstrom, Dillard's, Von Maur and then we do a huge off price business with T.J. Maxx, Burlington, Ross Stores.BARTIROMO: Are these the most popular products so far?HARPER: Right now, unicorns are the craze, still to this day. We definitely think they're here to stay. And this is what we're selling just tons of.BARTIROMO: For what age?HARPER: We target seven to 14.BARTIROMO: OK. And so it's funny that something comes up and it's like it just takes off like fire, like in this year it's unicorns.HARPER: You know what? The last 2-1/2 years have been unicorns.BARTIROMO: OK.HARPER: But we definitely mini backpacks are very, very popular, cross bodies, anything hands-free. Everyone has their phone, kids have phones, something in their hands. So anything really that you can, you know, be hands-free.BARTIROMO: What are you expecting? Because you know, we have this conversation ongoing about whether or not we're to going to see an economic slowdown. Do you see any expectations that consumers will spend less this year on these kinds of things?HARPER: We really have just continually seen growth with the products. I think that the customer is -- you know, our girl is on social media 24/7 and she knows what she wants. And this is -- this is what attracts her, so she's asking mom to buy it and mom's buying it.BARTIROMO: So broadly the state of retail same thing or are you seeing the state of retail change?HARPER: I think this demographic in specific is like -- is really key because they are just young and ready to purchase. They know what they want. They're making the decisions right now. And they're making it easy for their parents to kind of go out and buy them what they want.BARTIROMO: Where do you produce these products? I want to understand what the impact of tariffs has been. But do you produce where?HARPER: So we do produce a lot overseas in China. We also other countries in Southeast Asia. We have definitely diversified our supplier base so that, you know, we are not so heavily impacted by the tariffs.BARTIROMO: OK, so have you seen an impact yet? What has been the cost of the tariffs to your business?HARPER: We really have found just better ways, we're smarter about how we manufacture. So really overall, we have not been impacted, I really have to say.BARTIROMO: Were there any plans to move your production out of China, given this fight?HARPER: Yes, I mean, we were definitely very prepared for this to happen, a couple years even prior to the increase. So since we were prepared for this, we really were able to not be have -- you know, haven't be heavily impacted.BARTIROMO: Why were you expecting even before the fight happened?HARPER: Just you know, there's always been rising costs in China over the last several years, so we moved outside of China, just so that, you know, we were secure in keeping the cost down.BARTIROMO: I see.HARPER: Also, our volume has tremendously increased due to the demand of the product. So given the volume increase, we're able to work with our manufacturers on keeping the cost down.BARTIROMO: All right, real quick, give me the prices of some of these things as people go shopping for their kids, seven to 14 year old.HARPER: So, yes, seven to 14 year old. Price points start at $12.00 and go up to the $50.00 range for the big, large backpacks.BARTIROMO: All right, they look good.HARPER: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Anne, it's good to have you on the show.HARPER: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Anne Harper, OMG.Still ahead, A-Rod is here in the studio MLB MVP, along with Barstool Sports CEO Erika Nardini will join me to talk about the corp podcasts and all things baseball.

You don't want to miss any of those gentlemen.But, to the Futures this morning, 159-point loss on the Dow Futures, this after stocks soared yesterday after President Trump delayed tariffs on certain Chinese goods until December 15th. The delays include goods like smartphones, laptops, toys and video games, the president commenting on the move.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're doing this for Christmas season, just in case some of the tariffs would have an impact on U.S. customs, but so far (INAUDIBLE)The only impact (INAUDIBLE) collected almost $60 billion from China, compliments from China.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: China feeling the impacts of the trade dispute, posting weak economic numbers with its jobless rate reaching the highest on record, you also have other indicators, factory production, consumption and property investment much lower than expected.John, answer or try to answer my question earlier, so there's a trade delay on the tariffs on some goods, there is another meeting scheduled for -- is it next month in Washington, on the trade negotiations, but is the world economy slowing so much that our moves with China don't matter at this point?JOHN LONSKI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S CAPITAL MARKETS: They're very much is that danger right now and the reason why the market is off today is because of bad economic news from China, and the troubling news from Germany, my goodness. We've had negative interest rates in effect for quite a while in Europe, and yet the German economy is contracting, that's kind of scary.MCDOWELL: It is. Market-wise, Kevin, what do you make of this move? Yesterday, I was talking to Rachel, our producer this morning, and she said, oh, OK, a delay in tariffs is now the -- is the new interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. What do you make of the market now and maybe in the next six months to a year?KELLY: Yes, we're actually heading into a more volatile time of the year for the stock, September and October 10, to be very choppy, so I think the market is trying to get its footing now. You're seeing outsize moves even in August, as a precursor, but I think it's important to note that Germany has been slowing for four months now, right?So, that is a troubling trend, and especially with China coming out with the slowest growth in industrial production in 17 years, we have the world's largest economies are slowing, even look at our GDP print compared to last year.And so I think the market, right now, is showing you where you need to be and that's in treasuries, because they have been one of the best performing asset classes over the past, you know, six weeks, eight weeks during this troubling time.MCDOWELL: Can we take a look at the 30-year yield, I think, and I want to ask you this, Kevin, you would still buy the 30-year yield, I think that might be a record low on the 30-year yield. And would you still buy treasuries at this point? 1.3 percent is the record low on the 10-year, I know that.LONSKI: Definitely, I think we're going to have the 30-year yield go under two percent fairly soon, and I think we're going to set a new low for the 10-year treasury yield, I think if that's headed towards a range of one to one and a quarter percent, given the recent troubling news we have on the economic front.You know what's interesting about the 30-year yield. Remember, that is a 30-year bond, the Fed funds rate is an overnight rate, Fed funds at 2.1. percent is greater than that 30-year bond yield of -- which is now over two percent, that's telling me, you have a lot of rate cuts in the pipeline.MCDOWELL: So, essentially, the federal government, that -- they have to pay more -- you have to pay more to borrow on the very, very short end that you have to pay to borrow for 30 years.LONSKI: And a treasury bond market is making it loud and clear to Federal Reserve policymakers that it's high time to begin cutting rates with some aggressiveness.MCDOWELL: So you would buy treasuries here even with yields on where they are?KELLY: Yes, I actually had a meeting with an institutional investor yesterday, and he's been -- that's all he's been doing. He's been buying it up. He looks at the market, he's like, no-brainer trade, getting in -- getting into the shorter-end of the curve actually, he's not going longer and because as you can see, he's not being compensated for that.And that's the biggest problem, right? If we look at our 30-year, at over 2 percent, you look at Germany's 30-year, which is negative, the clear choice is to be in the U.S. treasury market.LONSKI: I'll add something, as a Federal Reserve cuts interest rates, it becomes more attractive for foreign investors to put their money in U.S. treasuries because as the Fed cuts rates, the cost of hedging, the cost of removing exchange rate risk from this particular move into dollar- denominated treasuries is lower.MCDOWELL: OK. I want to get Kristen in here, and this is -- this is very interesting, I saw this yesterday, it broke while these protests were breaking out in Hong Kong. Americans' views of China are changing, a new survey from Pew Research found that 60 percent of Americans have an unfavorable opinion of China, and compare that to 47 percent last year.A dramatic increase there, and it's just -- it's a number of different things then the unfavorable view has gone up, what do you make of this and politically, as well?KRISTEN SOLTIS ANDERSON, COLUMNIST, WASHINGTON EXAMINER: Well, I think this is being driven by a mix of economic security and cultural forces.Economically, there's been so much attention placed on our trade relationship with China, on the fact that the President says, hey, we've been getting a bad deal from them and that's really began to resonate for a lot of folks that may not think about issues like trade, that often.You also have, sort of, security issues, again, with folks, sort of, beginning to think more about Asia and the Security in that region with North Korea being in news more often, sort of, an understanding increasingly among voters that China's got to play a role if we want to resolve that situation.And finally, things like what we are seeing in Hong Kong, what we are seeing with the Uyghurs in China, sort of, stories about the Chinese government not treating their people very well, does not sit particularly well with Americans who believe that the interaction between the person and the government will be a little different.MCDOWELL: Can I ask you a question in terms of China and also Americans overwhelmingly agreed in this Pew Research poll that China's military expansion is a negative development for the U.S., but where do voters sit and the American people sit, will they side with President Trump even if the economy weakens?And I only point too that the yield on the 2-year and the 10-year, just briefly inverted for the first time since 2007. And that, historically, I think every recession since World War II is at least been proceeded by an inversion between the 2 and the 10.Again, that means 2-year rates are higher, or the yield is higher than 10- year, it's been that way on the 3-month to the 10-year since the spring, for the most part. But where -- before we move on to the discussion about the inversion, where do Americans sit in terms of the tug of war between doing the right thing with China but also an economy that looks -- certainly slowing here in the U.S.ANDERSON: Well, I think there are limits to the amount of short-term pain people are willing to take on an exchange for some, sort of, long-term gain that the president promises might be there.Typically, when you ask people if you approve of how the job the president is doing, he does about 10 points better on the question of how do you think of is handling of the economy versus just handling of the job overall.So, it's fascinating to wonder what would the hypothetical situation look like where let's say the economy was doing worse, was not doing as well as it's doing now, where people do not give the president as much credit for the economy, what his overall job approval be in the low 30s.Similarly, if you scale back on some of the things like the tweets, the things that maybe swing voters don't love as much, with an economy like this at the moment, could his job approval overall be higher, it's interesting to think of those two hypotheticals.MCDOWELL: What do you make of this inversion?KELLY: Yes, I think it's actually signaling worldwide problems and growth overseas, I mean, if you look at the U.S. economy, the consumer confidence is still elevated because look at the job's market, right?MCDOWELL: No, let's focus on the positive.KELLY: Right, right, right, we're -- I mean, we're 70 percent of services economy and people feel good, right? And so, I think, one of the reasons why the tariffs were delayed is because this latest round -- latest round of tariffs, actually hit towards the consumer side of the ledger.The first one -- the first round of tariffs were more on the enterprise side, this would've hit the Christmas shopping season, the holiday shopping season, goods would've been impacted. That would've hit consumer confidence because all the prices would have actually gone up, so I think, that's why you saw the delay.MCDOWELL: And President Trump essentially said that. The Wall Street Journal editorial page calls it a tacit admission that trade wars aren't cost-free to consumers despite some of the messaging that's come out in the last --KELLY: But tariff means going to be tariff man, right? He loves them.MCDOWELL: Right. I always point to that, like, he calls himself tariff man and the trade wars are easy to win, which is proving to --LONSKI: You know, getting back to what I said earlier, I mean, we are not helpless in the face of a treasury yield curve inversion. We have an inverted treasury yield curve because short-term interest rates are too high, and the Federal Reserve can simply go ahead, cut rates, and get rid of that yield curve inversion very quickly. You know, they did it back in 1998.MCDOWELL: Yes, they did.LONSKI: Summer of '98 and it worked. There was no -- there was no recession.MCDOWELL: During the Russian --LONSKI: They took their time with the -- they tolerated. The longer they tolerate the inverted treasury yield curve, the risk of recession, rose, and in fact, it rose by -- that we actually had an economic downturn.MCDOWELL: And I'll just point out that was during long-term capital management collapse, the Russian debt default, it was also during the impeachment proceedings against Bill Clinton between July and September, the S&P fell over 19 percent and it recovered that and then some by the end of the year, so --LONSKI: And those rate cuts were in the context of real GDP growth in excess of four percent.MCDOWELL: OK. So, do you think the Fed cuts 50 basis points or half a one percent in September?LONSKI: Why not cut -- yes, I think they might, very well cut by 50 basis points if we keep getting this troubling news. If we get a disappointing report on jobs in early September for August, that gives them, I think, strong reason to go ahead and cut by half a percentage point.MCDOWELL: Does it rescue the economy, though?LONSKI: Reduces recession risk, will it guarantee the continuation of this economic recovery? Well, that's problematic.MCDOWELL: Kevin, what do you say before we go to break?KELLY: Yes, you can't escape recessions, it's only a matter of time.MCDOWELL: OK. Do you think we'll get -- go into a recession?KELLY: Within the next 18 months.MCDOWELL: Just in time for people going to the polls, Kristen, we'll discuss that coming up, and more on the chaos in Hong Kong, China denying a U.S. Navy visit to its port as President Trump urges calm, the latest. Plus, done deal, CBS and Viacom set to become a giant in online streaming, details next.MCDOWELL: A shake-up at the New York jail where Jeffrey Epstein died, Cheryl Casone has the details, hey, Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, Dagen, good morning. The warden at the Manhattan jail has been transferred out and two guards placed on leave, following the disgraced millionaire's apparent suicide last weekend.Those guards are also suspected of falsifying records showing that they were checking on inmates and Epstein's unit every 30 minutes, or maybe they were not. And then new reports say the guards fell asleep on the job as well. FBI agents conducting a sweep off that jail, that's today.Well, the FBI is investigating an ICE office shooting, as a targeted attack. This bullet hole from one of several shots fired at the building in San Antonio, they can see, agents believe the gunman knew exactly where to aim. There had been, at least, four anti-ICE attacks across the country in just less than a month.And finally, the new Viacom-CBS combo has its eyes set on streaming. Viacom-CBS says it's going to invest more on movies and T.V. shows, in an attempt to take on Netflix, Hulu, and the new Disney Plus streaming service.Now, this mega merger, putting big name franchisers front and center. The newly recombined Star Trek T.V. and film series will be joining forces with Mission Impossible, that should help the company take on the Marvel, Disney juggernaut.But Disney, obviously, excuse me, Dagen, obviously, the question here is there's so much competition with Netflix and Hulu and Amazon Prime which I have all of, and that they're kind of linked to the game. That's the question mark this morning.MCDOWELL: Right. And then don't forget about all the -- like, HBO properties and the NBC properties that are put together. It's OK, you called me Disney, that's fine.CASONE: Disney Dagen. Sorry.MCDOWELL: Disney, Goofy --KELLY: No, you're a princess.CASONE: Said with love.KELLY: I meant that in the best way possible.MCDOWELL: Kevin Kelly, there is never --KELLY: Never mind.MCDOWELL: Not now, not ever, anything princessy about me. Don't let -- don't let your lives be defined by a tiara on your head or a man on your arm, as my mother said. But, thank you for making me laugh.KELLY: You're welcome.Coming up, tapping a rapper, the NFL has turned to Jay-Z to help smooth out social justice tensions with players, what else is on the horizon? Plus, Twitter slap fight, the founder of Barstool Sports challenges Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to a debate over unions, stay with us.MCDOWELL: Breaking news right now, the difference when the yield on the 2- year treasury and the 10-year treasury yield, that part of the yield curve inverted for the first time since 2007. So, what does that mean? It means that the 2-year yield is higher than the 10-year yield.That turns the world of banking upside down and also historically since World War II, it's been a pretty good indicator of recession. This happening, this part of the yield curve inverting for the first time since 2007, that was right before the financial collapse. That is taking the broader market down with it.Joining us now, Crossmark Global Investments chief market strategist, Victoria Fernandez, Victoria, what do you make of this?VICTORIA FERNANDEZ, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, CROSSMARK GLOBAL INVESTMENTS: I mean, we've been waiting for this to happen, we knew it was probably coming, but I'm not sure it's a recession signal at this point in time, I know, historically, it has been, but we are, what, a basis point, inverted at this point in time, let's see if we get some more relief coming.The CPI numbers were higher than expected, if you look at the trend in CPI, that 3-month average, you're at 2.8 percent annualized on that number, so maybe that pushes the longer-end up a little bit, going forward. I wouldn't make a recession call based on this slight inversion, but it's definitely something the Fed's going to be watching.MCDOWELL: John, we talked about the Federal Reserve needing to act, so the Federal Reserve needs to take the Fed funds rate, which is at two to two and a quarter, right now --LONSKI: Yes, right.MCDOWELL: -- down to where the 10-year is right now of 1.6 percent, but with the consumer prices going up yesterday, for the second straight month (INAUDIBLE) prices rose three-tenths of one percent, that is the strongest two-month gain in more than a decade. So, is the Fed in a bind or not?LONSKI: I don't think people are very worried about price inflation at this point in time. Inflation expectations very well contained, if you look at the treasury bond market, look at the five-year tips, the expected rate of inflation over the next year is running at about 1.5, 1.6 percent.This recent gain, and I think it's going to be a brief jump by the CPI is not going to prevent the Fed from responding to an increase risk of recession. That's on the front burner inflation is way off in the back burner in some place.MCDOWELL: Kevin?KELLY: You know, it's interesting I look at in the inflation side, is that healthcare inflation actually went up and that's a broad concern because we actually have an aging population. We have also seen housing go up faster than the rate of inflation.Inflation is everywhere, especially in consumer's pocketbooks, every single day, and I keep my eyes wide open with what's going on, not only the inverted yield curve, but also copper has been exceptionally weak, oil has been exceptionally weak.So, when I take all these things in aggregate, I say, OK, I need to get more defensive in my portfolio. I've been getting into the data centers, the cellphone towers, the distribution centers, the real estate assets that have a lower correlation in the market and more defensive.And that's how I've been positioning my portfolio. I don't know where Victoria, where you think investors should be. But, given all those concerns, I mean, that's where I want to be.MCDOWELL: We will talk about how strong the consumer has been and where service of the economy. We're going to get Macy's earnings out later this morning, we get Wal-Mart tomorrow, retail sales tomorrow morning.So, with that as the backdrop to Kevin's question, how are you allocating your money?FERNANDEZ: Sure, i mean, consumer has been the key this whole year, right? And we've been talking about that and obviously department stores have struggled, Wal-Mart will be a key that we're going to look at, and the retail sales as Dagen mentioned.When we're talking to our clients, we're saying let's find opportunities in this market, right? So whether that's doing a dividend play, a global dividend play, whether that's using options to take advantage of volatility in the market, do these things to find a place for staying fully invested because we are longer-term investors.Don't trade on the headlines, take a longer-term outlook, put some more value, maybe some core positions in your equity portfolio. I wouldn't go full on defensive because as we know, it only takes one tweet, it takes one event to have the market shift.MCDOWELL: This is something I've said before and I only acknowledge that I do repeat myself, but the data -- the markets were already weak before the inversion of the 2 and the 10-year treasury. China's jobless rate hit the highest level ever recorded.Factory production consumption, property investment, much lower than expected. Germany's economy is contracting, so we are fighting this trade war. However, be careful of us winning it, because you have the entire world that is slowing down, if not contracting, and it will take the United States with it, yes or no?FERNANDEZ: No, absolutely, and I think that's why we're seeing rates move as low as they are, it's, you know, importing all of that from the rest of the world, so we had the U.K. in contraction, as you said, we had Germany this morning. The Eurozone, as a whole, was positive. That number came out, I think they were 0.2 percent this morning on GDP. But as a whole, we are importing that slowdown.That's what the Fed is saying was their biggest reason for lowering rates. I'm not sure at this point that lowering it another 50 basis points is going to help that business investment and that CapEx, rates were low and they haven't been investing at this point, I'm not sure 25 basis points shifts that for CapEx.MCDOWELL: Really, really quickly, Kristen, I want to bring you in here on this point, Jon Hilsenrath was talking about this yesterday, that more and more -- he had been going through the earnings conference calls and comments from CEOs being asked about how are you preparing for a recession, what are they saying about the potential of a recession.Yesterday, GM and Ford at a conference were talking about planning for a possible economic downturn, maybe the CEOs are getting asked about it, but the more that people, regular folks, hear the word, recession, does that change their attitude about the economy?ANDERSON: Well, at the moment, when I talked to voters in focus groups, the first question I always ask, what's a word to describe how you feel about how things are going, and even folks that will acknowledge that they feel personally, economically OK.They are not worried about losing their job tomorrow, things that they might have been worried about 10 years ago, they do say things like it feels uncertain, it feels fragile, there's already a sense out there, I think, priced into a lot of the polling numbers, that people say things are good now.But I don't know that they're going to stay good with one tweet, with one event around the world, all of that could change.MCDOWELL: Or a market selloff. John, you wanted to say something real quick?LONSKI: Yes, I just want to say something, let's not forget that when we get lower interest rates, lower short-term interest rates almost guaranty lower longer-term interest rates. And with that, we're going to get more refinancing activity.The month of August has been a typically strong in terms of corporate bond issuance, a lot of that is to refinance outstanding debt at lower interest rates. And by the way, recently, applications for mortgage re-financings are running higher, 85 percent year-over-year.So, that's putting some extra cash in these savings accounts of households.MCDOWELL: I have some pushback from Stephanie Pomboy on the housing issue but you're going to have to wait for that. I'll get to it later on this hour. She was tweeting about it last night. So, John, good to see you, and Victoria Fernandez, thank you so much for being here.FERNANDEZ: My pleasure.MCDOWELL: Coming up, Hong Kong mayhem, more protests ahead, as flights, again, disrupted at the airport this morning. How the U.S. is responding?And Boeing sales lag, the world's largest aerospace manufacturer risk falling behind competition months after the 737 Max jets were grounded, the fallout, ahead.MCDOWELL: Welcome back. I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Wednesday, August 14th. Your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern Time.Breaking news, a recession signal flashing. The yield on the 10-year Treasury falling below the yield on the 2-year Treasury. Why is this a recession signal? Because basically, banks, for the most part, it make -- it's impossible for them to make money, lending money.Again, you borrow on the short end and lend on the longer end. It disrupts the banking system. But it also is a signal the fact that people are diving into 10-year treasuries that it's a symbol of economic weakness on the horizon.Futures already lowered this morning. But this move into treasury is in this inversion in the yield curve, pushing stocks down even further. 225 point loss on the Dow Futures. This after yesterday's broad rally sparked by President Trump delaying some China tariffs.But again, delay just -- does not get rid of uncertainty. We should point that out. Apple yesterday is adding 58 points to the Dow. Because again, smartphone tariffs delayed and the new 10 percent tariffs delayed until mid-December.Checking on the global market action. In Europe, you have losses across the board. The selling picking up steam. Germany's economy contracting in the most recent quarter and the DAX in Germany falling 1-1/3 percent.The economists and the government blaming tensions between the U.S. and China, as well. As the possibility of a no Brexit deal. Speaking, of China and Asia overnight, markets were broadly higher following on the rally here in the United States. The some weakness in China's economy that we've been talking about as well.And onto the turmoil in Hong Kong, on hold for now. Protesters are still at the airport after flights were disrupted for two days in a row. We have the latest there.And more trouble for Boeing, plane deliveries falling in another airline forced to cut more flights as the 737 MAX remains grounded.And the NFL teaming up with Jay-Z. The music superstar looking to tackle social justice issues in the aftermath of the anthem protests.And Congressman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez challenged to a debate over unions. More on the Twitter spat she's having with Barstool Sports founder, Dave Portnoy.And a warning for streaming fans. Binge-watching might be bad for your health. We'll tell you why. Is that the sitting or is it what you eat when you're binge-watching two seasons of The Crown, just asking for a friend.Our top story this half-hour. Hong Kong unrest. China now denying a request for two U.S. Navy ships to visit Hong Kong. Protests have stretched through a 10th weekend and shut down the Hong Kong airport Monday and Tuesday.President Trump tweeting on this yesterday. "Our intelligence has informed us that the Chinese government is moving troops to the border with Hong Kong. Everyone should be calm and safe.Joining me now, retired U.S. Army brigadier general, author of the book, Double Crossfire. General Anthony Tata. General, good to see you as always.BRIG. GEN. ANTHONY TATA (RET.), FORMER SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION, NORTH CAROLINA: Good to see you, Dagen.MCDOWELL: What do you make of the situation in Hong Kong? Again, it is very precarious?TATA: Yes, Dagen. We have to remember that Hong Kong was under British rule for over 150 years. And in 1997, it was transitioned to the one country, two systems rule under China, and it's a limited democracy.And so, with that background, really what we're looking at is a free-market democracy that is coming into clash with the communist rule in China. And, you know, the chief executive there -- Lam. They're represented, their governor, so to speak. Introduced a bill that would extradite criminals to China and the people on the ground there, the citizens of Hong Kong are concerned that this is a slippery slope and rightfully.So, that political prisoners can then be extradited today China and it would be the first domino in authoritarian rule coming into Hong Kong. Is that's, that's what the led the people of Hong Kong, were used to liberty, used to freedom, use to free markets to give very, very concerned.And you see the passion with which they're protesting and their holding American flags, and U.K. flags in the streets. And so, we are a symbol of democracy and that China sitting on the Hill that President Reagan talked about.And now, China is forbidding U.S. warships to from coming into port. The U.S. Navy, which has never been an issue before. And I understand China's concern about to having the United States in there -- in the ports there to further appear -- have Hong Kong appeared ally with the United States. So, it's a -- it's a tense situation right now.And chairman -- the chief executive Lam, she can stop this right now by withdrawing that legislation and becoming a leader of her people as opposed to a proxy for China.MCDOWELL: But China would -- that would be a symbol of weakness, potentially to mainland China, to Beijing.TATA: Yes.MCDOWELL: But the China -- Beijing, clearly wants control of the banking system in Hong Kong. And the Wall Street Journal called yesterday's protest a propaganda victory for Beijing, as it tries to turn the public against what have been overwhelmingly peaceful protests.To that point, do you think President Trump, needs to speak out against this Chinese crack-down forcefully?TATA: I think the president is walking the fine line that he has to walk in the middle of trade negotiations that impacting entire country and even the world. And the protests right now that could be easily resolved.And so, what I would expect the president to continue to do is support the people in Hong Kong. But also not try burn the bridge with China. It's a very delicate negotiation happening here, and he should not throw out the baby with the bathwater, so to speak.All the hard work on the negotiations happening with the trade deal should not be thrown out to try to, you know, have a #campaign on Twitter with Hong Kong. I mean, people will forget about this in a week, you know, if it's resolved peacefully?MCDOWELL: General, good to see you. Thank you so much for being here this morning. General Anthony Tata.TATA: Thank you, Dagen.MCDOWELL: More fallout from the grounding of Boeing 737 MAX jet. Cheryl Casone has the details there. Cheryl?CASONE: That's right, Dagen. Boeing deliveries fell to an 11-year low last month. The aerospace company has basically shift 258 planes this year, that's down from 417, just a year ago.(INAUDIBLE) Airbus is now on track to pass Boeing as the world's largest plane maker. And grounding of 737 MAX being felt at Norwegian Air. The budget carrier going to cut six flights between Ireland and the United States. That starts on September 15th.Well, the NFL is teaming up with Jay-Z. The rapper helping the league's smooth tensions with players over social justice issues. He's going to also help expend NFL's entertainment offering because they actually have a lot of them, and that includes the Super Bowl half-time show.Jay-Z's rock nation going to play a major role in that. Jay-Z, by the way, once rapped "I said, no, the Super bowl. You need me, I don't need you." But now they're together.And then, there is this Barstool, challenging Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to a debate. All start when Barstool Sports founder, Dave Portnoy, caught -- he basically caused a series of tweets that cause a lot of interesting stuff, antiunion message on Twitter.Well, a writer responded, he would help Barstool staffers to unionize. Well, Portnoy snapped back that he would fire anyone on the spot who contacts that writer. The congresswoman chimed in saying, Portnoy could face legal action."If you're a boss tweeting firing threats to employees trying to unionize, you are likely breaking the law and can be sued in your words on the spot." Portnoy then responded. I hope they're keeping up with all of this. That he would like to debate the congresswoman. Ocasio-Cortez has not accepted the offer.Of course, Dagen, if there is a big debate, it should likely be tomorrow.MCDOWELL: Thank you, Cheryl.CASONE: Throw that out there. Yes.KELLY: We all should be the bar for that debate?MCDOWELL: What do you make -- what do you make of this? Again, oh, the discourse on Twitter.KELLY: Yes, she refuses to partake in any debates because I think she's smart, she doesn't want to be like Icarus, right? She doesn't want to fly too close to the sun and get burned. So, I don't think we should hold our breath to see the Congresswoman engage in any thoughtful debate any time soon. She feels comfortable on Twitter with her thumbs typing away.And Dave Portnoy is obviously trying to get her to engage in that debate, and I don't think it will happen.ANDERSON: Yes, there's a strong incentive to be engaged to punching up -- might not be the right word. But, to getting more high profile fight on social media, because then-people engage, what I think this is rooted in a little bit is the really tough economics of online publishing these days.So just -- I think, earlier this week, the Ringer.com, a web site that I love reading. I mean that's --KELLY: Yes.ANDERSON: They do a lot of strange coverage.(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: Right here -- right here, Bill Simmons --ANDERSON: I love the ringer, they unionize. And I think that sort of --(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: Rewatchables.ANDERSON: Oh, very much.MCDOWELL: OK, all right. Go ahead.ANDERSON: I think that's what sort of spark this. That all this other sports and sort of online publishing platforms, are they now facing pressure for their writers to unionize as well?And so, you know, but it's a very tough business to be in for sure.KELLY: Yes.LONSKI: You're exactly right. Unions do not work at highly competitive evolving industries. It's a big mistake, it could end up costing jobs.MCDOWELL: I was in a union of -- it was a union-related to a reporting job that I had. And my issue always was last hired, first fired. I was part of that, so, there was no incentives.There's -- you work hard and you try to move up. And if there are layoffs, it doesn't matter how hard you've worked. Your performance didn't matter, that was my personal issue. I lasted maybe a year on that job because I hated it.Coming up, raising the smoking age. One city wants to do just that to curve teen vaping. That story ahead.Plus, streaming setback. Why binge-watching T.V. shows could be hazardous to your health? Dr. Mike, here coming up.MCDOWELL: Headlines across America. The San Francisco Chronicle reporting: "San Francisco's school board reverses course and decides to save controversial mural." An about face from the San Fran school board voting to obscure the mural depicting George Washington's life rather than destroy it. Critics say the art is outdated; preservationists argue removing it is censorship. The controversies surrounding how slavery, white settlers and native Americans are shown.The Denver Post writing: "Health advocates push Denver to raise tobacco purchase age to fight growing epidemic of teen vaping." The Tobacco 21 proposal would raise the sales age of tobacco to 21. It would also add a city-wide licensing and enforcement system, bringing tobacco in line with alcohol and marijuana.And the Casper Star Tribune says: "Fight over Taco Tuesday heats up in Taco John's hometown." Taco John's has been protecting its Taco Tuesday slogan since it trademarked it 30 years ago. The Cheyenne-based chain now going after a brewery near its national headquarters, sending it a cease and desist order for using the phrase "promote a weekly food truck." The brewery says on social media: it's comical. Taco John's would go after a business that is not (INAUDIBLE) profit from its tacos.Again, when you're fighting over that, you really have no problems. Coming up, meltdown caught on camera. YouTube apologizing for deleting the viral video of CNN Anchor Chris Cuomo confronting a heckler. The fallout straight ahead. Plus, bad bine-watching. Experts are warning T.V. fans to layoff excessive streaming. Stay with us.MCDOWELL: Your health and your screen time. Neurologists say binge- watching T.V. goes beyond affecting your physical activity; it could be hurting your brain as well. Joining us now Dr. Mikhail Varshavski, AKA Dr. Mike, please explain -- bearer of bad news.DR. MIKHAIL VARSHAVSKI, FAMILY MEDICINE: Well, you know it's funny. I hate to talk about this because I, myself, even occasionally do binge- watch. We talked about it earlier we all have our shows, but this is not healthy for the mind and the body. Number one, it's a socially isolating activity. You're usually doing it without interacting with other people which is going to hurt you. Number two, you're usually doing it at the expense of your sleep, because you're staying up late at night watching these shows, obviously that hurts your mind.And finally, it's a sedentary activity. When you're not moving, you're increasing your blood pressure, you're adding those pounds, you're actually hurting the mind when you're in a sedentary position. So, the solution to this is to limit your binge-watching. If you're going to be doing this, try limit the amount of episodes you watch. Netflix does a really good job at saying: are you still watching after a few episodes? That's like medical advice right there. It's literally telling you: get up off up that couch, move around some, and then you can come back to --KELLY: So, the lawyers have something to do with that, right? I mean, Netflix, right? Their lawyers were like, we probably should put this disclaimer in there.MCDOWELL: But is binge-watching that big of a problem?VARSHAVSKI: It's a huge problem. Huge problem. Because when people sit down, these shows have become so addictive. They're essentially hacking your neurology. They're trying to figure out how to keep you watching with these shows. They're made in such a way where there's little tie-off at the end that makes you want to watch the next episode. If you're not watching, you're not getting that dopamine hit, all of a sudden, you feel sad. So, it makes you watch --UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is there a different space on what type of show it is? Like am I doing more damage to myself if I'm binge-watching a show like "Big Little Lies" or "Breaking Bad" -- something that's really stressful versus, say, binge-watching the "Great British Baking Show" which is like completely (INAUDIBLE) activity.MCDOWELL: Which is so relaxing.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's so soothing.MCDOWELL: "The Great British Bakeoff" is the most relaxing, soothing television program in the history of television.VARSHAVSKI: I've got to check that out, apparently.MCDOWELL: You know, the worst thing that happens is somebody's souffle falls. So, it is --VARSHAVSKI: So, low risk, calming, maybe even hear people chewing -- there's a little ASMR effect.KELLY: Sounds good for the brain to me, doc.VARSHAVSKI: Well, I think you guys are spinning it. I think you're just spinning it to the spin zone right now. But look, if we're going to be sitting for four, five hours at a time, that's unhealthy. The new slogan where: sitting is the new smoking, does have some truth to it. And we need to be aware of it and get ourselves up --KELLY: If binge-watching is wrong, I don't want to be right.VARSHAVSKI: I like that.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What about people that stare at their devices for hour after hour. I mean, that's got to be bad too?VARSHAVSKI: Equally as bad too, especially the devices are hacking your mind even in a worse way. All those notifications, those likes, they condition you to want more of that and when you experience social interaction in real life outside of the phone, you almost lose the sense of how to be normal in these social settings. We see that in children a lot.MCDOWELL: I actually thought about this over the weekend just because of the outrage and the uproar that is you see over and over again on social media and the need for attention and people doing outrageous things saying outrageous things for that attention? Were we all narcissist? Was it just switched on by social media? Do we all have that built into us? Or did social media create that narcissism and (INAUDIBLE)?VARSHAVSKI: I think the best answer to that is socialism is a drug. When people use cocaine, they want more of it. Social media gives you the same dopamine hit that cocaine gives you and we want more of it. And the problem with it, is when we use too much screen time, we forget that the outside world exists and we lose that social interaction that's key for -- to keeping us healthy.KELLY: It's the validation part, that juice the dopamine part, right? Is that what it is?VARSHAVSKI: It's the validation. It's the fact that are notifications are lighting up.MCDOWELL: Attention.VARSHAVSKI: Attention, yes.MCDOWELL: It's like, you become addicted to the attention, negative or positive.VARSHAVSKI: What's sad is we're learning our brains are actually hackable by other people. And the companies that are doing this best: Google, YouTube, Facebook, all these companies are doing a really good job at it.MCDOWELL: You're going to do a story about fitness trackers?VARSHAVSKI: Yes.MCDOWELL: I want to touch that. Do the fitness trackers actually improve your health? We got about a minute.VARSHAVSKI: Well, what's interesting about fitness tracker is doctors, like myself, got really excited about it. Well now, patients are going to be in charge of what's going on with their fitness trackers. But the outcomes aren't there. They used the fitness tracker, they may take a few more steps but in reality: blood pressure doesn't change, cholesterol doesn't change, weight doesn't change. Maybe a few more steps here and there. So, we're trying to figure out how to use fitness trackers with certain apps, or with monitoring by your family medicine physician in order to get these health outcomes. But so far, kind of been disappointing.MCDOWELL: If you want to lower your blood pressure, watch the "Great British Bakeoff." Binge-watching it. I don't care what people say. Dr. Mike, it's really good to see you. Thank you so much. Dr. Mikhail Varshavski, please come back very soon.Oh, he told me: "Man Hunter", the second season, starts Friday. We have breaking news this morning: a recession signal flashing. The yield on the 10-year treasury falling below the two-year treasury yield for the first time since 2007. Stocks melting down. Also, this meltdown caught on camera: YouTube apologizing for deleting the viral video of Chris Cuomo, more when we come back.Load-Date: August 14, 2019End of Document

Sentury halts plans for U.S. plantRubber & Plastics NewsJuly 15, 2019Print VersionCopyright 2019 Crain Communications All Rights ReservedSection: Pg. 5; Vol. 48Length: 762 wordsByline: Bruce DavisDateline: LAGRANGE, Ga. BodyChina's Qingdao Sentury Tire Co. Ltd. has indefinitely put on hold plans to build a car and light truck tire plant in the U.S., according to various sources close to the project.The company-which sells tires under the Delinte, Groundspeed, Landsail and Sentury brand names-had disclosed plans in September 2016 to invest $530 million to build a plant in Troup County, Ga., capable of producing 12 million car and light truck tires a year at full capacity. The project represented up to 1,000 jobs.Sentury originally projected the plant would be operating by 2018 but to date only minor site preparation work has been carried out, local sources indicated.Sentury officials in China and the U.S. did not respond to multiple requests for comment.An office set up by Sentury Tire North America in LaGrange has closed and Rami Helminen, a former Nokian Tyres P.L.C. executive who was hired in 2017 to head up the project, is now working in the U.S. for Finrenes Oy, a Finnish biomass-to-fuels company.Late last year the company consolidated separate U.S. sales organizations, one attached to the Georgia plant project and one reporting directly to the parent company in China, under Miami-based Sentury Tire USA Inc.The Development Authority of LaGrange posted a statement on its Facebook page May 22 stating that the "project is on indefinite hold" until the company can secure the financing necessary to complete the work.The agency cited the uncertainty of an Initial Public Offering in China as the reason for delaying the U.S. factory project."Unfortunately with all of the uncertainty with the trade relations between the U.S. and China, the Chinese Government Agency that approves IPOs in China put Sentury's IPO on hold indefinitely," the agency's statement said. "The IPO is critical to Sentury being able to finance the project."Since disclosing the project in 2016, Sentury Tire has said little publicly about the project, citing confidentiality restrictions related to the IPO, proceeds of which were designated in part to fund the construction of an aircraft tire plant in China."We are proud of the confidence Sentury Tire has shown in making Georgia the primary choice for their first U.S. manufacturing facility," Pat Wilson, commissioner of the Georgia Department of Economic Development, said in a statement. "While the company has not been able to meet the aggressive timetable first proposed for constructing the plant, Sentury's leadership has pledged to continue working to secure all necessary financing needed for the project."Delays like this, while unfortunate, are understandable whenever a business enters a new international market with this level of investment. We continue to work closely with the LaGrange leadership to ensure the community is kept well informed and updated on the progress of this project."The state of Georgia and LaGrange remain fully committed to the project and look forward to working with Sentury Tire on a new timeline for construction of their manufacturing plant and first production of Georgia-made tires for the U.S. market."In the meantime, Qingdao Sentury is using a factory near Bangkok, Thailand, to supply customers in the U.S. The plant, in which Sentury invested $400 million, is rated at 12 million car and light truck tires a year.Sentury Tire USA maintains warehouse distribution centers in Miami; Memphis, Tenn.; and Southern California.This development is the second setback involving a Chinese tire maker that had announced plans for a U.S. plant. In June 2018 Guangzhou Vanlead Group Co. Ltd. was forced to put on hold indefinitely plans it had announced in 2017 to invest $1 billion in a tire plant in South Carolina.Guangzhou Vanlead, a China state-owned entity that controls Wanli Tire Group, had proposed building a tire plant in Orangeburg County, S.C., capable of producing 6 million consumer tires annually in the eight-year project's first phase.Sources at the Orangeburg County Development Commission confirmed in June 2018 that the project was in "neutral," although the OCDC didn't rule out completely that it may still come to fruition.A third China company, Triangle Tire Co. Ltd., disclosed plans in late 2017 for a pair of plants to be built near Rocky Mount, N.C.-one for passenger/light truck tires and one for truck/bus tires.At last report, the company had begun clearing land at the site, work that was interrupted last September by the heavy rains that accompanied Hurricane Florence as it drove inland through the Carolinas.Jane Ho, European Rubber Journal, contributed to this report.Load-Date: July 18, 2019End of Document

China to close Pro-market policy advocacy instituteCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 27, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 862 wordsBodyBeijing, Aug 27. (Dow Jones) -- In China, an independent think tank that has been a rare bastion of liberal economic thought will close its doors, citing government pressure at a time when President Xi Jinping's campaign to control dissent .Beijing municipal authorities accused the Unirule Institute of Economics of committing regulatory violations and issued orders forcing its closure, the panel said in a statement Monday. While Unirule intends to file legal claims against the orders, the institute will cease its activities under its name and begin to liquidate its parent company, according to the statement.Beijing-based Unirule was founded in 1993 to promote economic liberation and democracy in China, building on Deng Xiaoping's attempt to carry out market-style reforms following the deadly crackdown on pro-democracy protests Tiananmen Square in 1989.His work has often clashed with communist Party orthodoxy -- clashes that have deepened since Xi took office and followed an increasingly authoritarian agenda."We no longer have room for survival," Sheng Hong, Unirule's chief executive, said in an interview. "We have no choice but to close."The demise of Unirule, which had been increasingly dying from government interference, underscores Xi's intolerance of criticism of his vision of a highly centralized government leading China's rise with a powerful economy governed by state.Some observers fear that the silencing of independent voices like Unirule will deprive China's leaders of useful political perspectives, now that they are grusing a persistent slowdown in the world's second-largest economy and the striving struggle with the United States. These setbacks have fueled criticism of Xi's leadership within the party's elite.Unirule's closure further limits the already small window for open discussion of alternative paths to China's economy, at a time when they are so needed, said William Kirby, professor of Chinese studies at Harvard University. "Right now, jealous officials apparently can't go wrong by taking extreme measures to suppress the debate," he said.The Unirule Institute, whose name refers to the Chinese concept of "universal rules" on humanity, was created by a group of academics as a platform to expose ideas that are for the market, including the dismantling of China's state sector, greater rights to private property and the rule of law. Its founders include Mao Yushi, a leading free-market economist who was honored in 2012 by the libertarian Cato Institute in Washington with the Milton Friedman Prize for Advancing Liberty.Over the years, Unirule became a respected voice in China's intellectual and political circles, and was even consulted by some government agencies and state-owned enterprises. He held regular seminars in which in-house experts and guest speakers discussed verysuch as China's history, urban development and health care.His research fellows included prominent academics such as Xu Zhangrun, a law professor at Tsinghua University who was suspended by the school in March pending research on his writings that criticized Xi's leadership."Unirule has become a symbol of the struggle of liberal voices to find space today in China," said Julian Gewirtz, a Harvard University researcher who studies Chinese economic reforms. "Many of its members are not ashamed to discuss their work with foreign thinkers, exactly the kind of 'foreign influence' that Xi's administration seeks to reduce."Unirule's fate became increasingly uncertain as other liberal groups, including an influential Chinese magazine, succumbed to government pressure under Xi's tutelage.In the last two years, Unirule suffered the eviction of several offices and the closure of its electronic sites and social media accounts. The authorities also revoked the commercial license of a Unirule-affiliated company, and in November cited national security concerns when they banned Sheng, the executive director, and his deputy from traveling to the United States to attend a symposium Harvard University on China's economic reforms.In an attempt to avoid further disruptions, Unirule offered commitments to government officials, including a promise to refrain from arguing about Communist Party leadership members or their families, according to a person familiar with the Conversations.But in June, a Beijing civil affairs office issued a crackdown on Unirule, and in early July a branch of Beijing's corporate regulator district said it revoked the commercial license of Unirule's parent company, accusing it to administer the institute's e-page without permission.Unirule said he believes the orders are illegal. The Beijing government did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the matter.Sheng said Unirule has fired most of its staff as it expects authorities to rule out the institute's legal challenges. "China's government says it supports the rule of law," said the 64-year-old investigator, who plans to continue his research work. "But in reality, it doesn't adhere to the legal principles."Translated by Luis Felipe CedilloEdited by Michelle del CampoCopyright © 2019 Dow Jones &Company;, Inc.

HUAWEI DISPUTES U.S. CLAIMS IN ARGUING UNCONSTITUTIONALITY OF NDAA BANInside the ArmyAugust 19, 2019Copyright 2019 Inside Washington Publishers All Rights ReservedLength: 1046 wordsBody Posted Aug. 15, 2019 Lawyers for Huawei are disputing claims by the U.S. government to argue that a ban on its products under the Fiscal Year 2019 National Defense Authorization Act violates the Constitution, in a case that sets up a legal showdown over issues with broader implications for addressing cybersecurity threats from China.The dispute centers on Section 889 of the FY-19 NDAA, which Huawei says violates the Constitution's prohibition of a "bill of attainder," or a legislative declaration of guilt by a company or individual."Section 889 -- over Huawei's denials and without affording Huawei an administrative hearing or judicial trial -- singles out Huawei and legislatively determines that Huawei is 'controlled' by or 'otherwise connected' to the Chinese government and Communist Party and thus is supposedly their tool for carrying out cyberattacks and cyberespionage," states a legal brief filed on behalf of Huawei on Wednesday.The filing is the latest salvo in a lawsuit initiated by Huawei in March with the U.S. District Court for Eastern Texas in requesting that Section 889 of the NDAA be struck down as unconstitutional.The Justice Department filed a motion to dismiss in July, citing the government's ban of Kaspersky Lab products based on national security concerns as justification for the action against Huawei, while rejecting the company's claims about the unconstitutionality of Section 889 by arguing the Supreme Court has already resolved the issue in past related rulings.Huawei, in its latest filing, counters those and other claims by the government that support the purchasing ban."In contrast, Section 889 erects sweeping and permanent restrictions on purchases of specified Huawei equipment by all federal agencies and grant and loan recipients, and on use of such equipment by all federal contractors," the brief argues in describing how Section 889 differs from the government's actions against Kaspersky in 2017.Huawei's lawyers go on to argue that the NDAA "marks Huawei and its employees as disloyal tools of the Chinese government and Communist Party, thereby also chilling purchases of Huawei equipment and services not covered by the law; it is not tailored to the non-penal purposes of national defense or government network security; and its legislative history reveals the declared intent to impose the 'death penalty' on Huawei for alleged past misdeeds and associations and to drive it out of the country.""In its brief, the government reimagines Section 889 as a law that does not adjudicate Huawei as blameworthy or tainted, and that merely seeks to prevent the Chinese government from exploiting Huawei products used by federal agencies, contractors, and grant and loan recipients," the brief argues. "But Section 889's text and legislative history belie that revisionism, showing that Congress made a factual judgment -- disputed by Huawei -- that, based on its alleged past misdeeds and associations, Huawei is a law-breaking, disloyal security threat subject to the direction of the Chinese government and Communist Party, and imposed permanent restrictions on Huawei on that basis."The lawyers continue: "Indeed, Section 889 denies Huawei the executive and judicial process made available to other Chinese technology companies on the predicate factual questions and any means of escaping the statute's burdens, and in so doing casts further disparaging aspersions on Huawei.""In sum, Section 889 is punitive under all three modes of inquiry that courts use to assess punishment," according to Huawei's brief. "For these reasons, the Court should grant Huawei's motion for summary judgment, deny the government's motion, and declare unconstitutional the pertinent provisions of Section 889," the filing concludes.The Justice Department is due to respond on Sept. 10, in accordance with a court order, with oral arguments in the case slated for Sept. 19. Huawei's push for risk-management strategyThe lawsuit by Huawei could be seen as part of a broader campaign by the company to counter the U.S. government's approach to addressing cybersecurity threats from China.The government issued an interim rule Tuesday that implements the NDAA Section 889 ban on federal agencies, including the Defense Department, from purchasing Huawei products. That purchasing ban will be extended next year to private companies that wish to do business with the government.At a recent public meeting on the phase-two rules of the purchasing ban, Huawei lawyers argued the government should adopt a risk-management approach to foreign cyber threats, citing use of the National Institute of Standards and Technology's cybersecurity framework."Virtually all equipment manufacturers rely on a global supply chain and face security risks from a wide range of sources," said James Gauch, a lawyer at Jones Day who represents Huawei. "Excluding one or two vendors based on their national origin will not address these risks. Indeed, consolidating the number of equipment suppliers hinders rather than helps cybersecurity," Gauch said at a July 19 meeting hosted by DOD, the General Services Administration and NASA.Gauch asserted there is "no evidence" that Huawei "has participated in or been a party to malicious activity," while calling for a risk-based approach that would include product testing by an independent group.The joint meeting by DOD, GSA and NASA was called to get public feedback on a series of eight questions related to implementation of NDAA Section 889. Those questions included whether additional guidance was needed, the potential increased cost for the government, and if the prohibition would "impact your willingness to offer goods and services to the Federal government as of the stated effective date?" according to a June 3 Federal Register notice announcing the meeting last month.Other companies affected by the statute are ZTE, Hytera Communications, Dahua Technology and Hangzhou Hikvision Digital.The issue has become a key sticking point in trade talks with China, with the Commerce Department placing Huawei on a no-sell list for U.S. companies. The enforcement of that listing has been temporarily suspended while the trade talks with Beijing are tentatively slated to resume next month. -- Rick Weber   Load-Date: August 19, 2019End of Document

Chinese investment in the U.S. is depleted.CE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 2, 2019 FridayCopyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1113 wordsBodyCash flow from China to the United States used to be stable; unfortunately, the growing mistrust between these two countries has caused this flow to slow. Investment from China has plummeted by nearly 90% since President Donald Trump took power.This decline, the effects of which are perceived throughout the economy, is due to the number of US standards now stipulating stricter checks and the attitude towards Chinese investment is less open; Beijing also set more restrictive limits on overseas investment.All of these changes impact a wide range of industries, from Silicon Valley start-ups to the Manhattan housing market, as well as several state governments that worked for several years to attract Chinese investment, as well as doing it is clear that, after several years of pursuing a path of integration, the world's two largest economies are beginning to separate.Chinese investment in the United States showed steady acceleration over the years; resources were injected into the energy, agriculture, automobile and technology sectors, for example, which created new jobs in Michigan, South Carolina, Missouri, Texas, and other states. In view of the rise of the Chinese economy, both U.S. companies and state and local governments were trying to obtain some of these resources from China.But Trump's economic Cold War has helped reverse that trend.Foreign direct investment in the United States, which reached $46.5 billion in 2016, plummeted to $5.4 billion for 2018, equivalent to 88%, according to data from economic research firm Rhodium Group. Preliminary figures for mainland Chinese business investments through April this year indicate only a moderate rise from the previous year, with transactions worth $2.8 billion.It appears that several forces converge to produce these effects. In China, slowing the economy and strengthening controls on capital make it difficult for Chinese investors to buy U.S. products, according to some commercial, purchasing and merger advisors. Trump's fondness for imposing tariffs on Chinese goods and the strengthening of a regulatory group dedicated to gappile-examining foreign investment, particularly when Chinese investors are involved, have also helped to discourage companies from both countries.China, which has imposed tariffs against U.S. products as a retaliatory measure, may also have decided to reduce investment in response to Trump's strong economic measures.Concerns about America's openness to Chinese investment were exacerbated after the U.S. Foreign Investment Committee decided to reject several transactions that failed to overcome its detailed review. Because it was given more general powers in 2018, this group, led by the Treasury Department, can block a wider range of transactions, including investments and minority stakes in major technologies such as telecommunications and computing.As early as the year began, Chinese company HNA Group suffered a $41 million loss when U.S. regulators forced it to sell an office building in Manhattan for national security reasons, as they were concerned about its location, just a few trump Tower blocks.Less attractiveOther notable cases had already been presented in the early days of Trump's presidency, such as the failure of Broadcom's bid by Qualcomm and the sale of MoneyGram to a unit of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba last year. Nor is itapproved a contract between Lattice Semiconductor and an investment firm linked to the Chinese government.In some cases, the atmosphere of discouragement has benefited American companies. In June, UnitedHealth purchased the healthcare-sending technology company PatientsLikeMe after the committee determined that allowing the Chinese owner of the health company to have access to health data posed as a security risk. The price that was paid for the purchase was not disclosed.However, increased scrutiny has also made it difficult for U.S. industries to establish collaborations with Chinese investors, leading to cuts in certain sectors. The real estate sector, strengthened for a decade by Chinese investors, suffered a sharp decline due to deteriorating relations and tighter measures imposed by Chinese officials on investment in foreign real estate.A May report by Cushman &Wakefield; highlighted a growing "sell in sales" of commercial real estate in the United States among Chinese investors. In 2018, 37 real estate sales with Chinese buyers worth $2.3 billion were completed, but sales of commercial real estate were agreed for $3.1 billion. According to the report, the way HNA and hostile rhetoric towards business activities were treated have created a sense of annoyance among Chinese investors.Residential real estate in the United States has also been found to be less attractive to Chinese investors. Research recently released by the National Association of Realtors revealed that purchases of homes in the United States by Chinese buyers dropped 56% to $13.4 billion in the fiscal year ended March."The loss of Chinese investment could be felt especially in rural states where Chinese investors had bought factories and revitalized troubled businesses.""The scale of this decline is very noticeable, so it is possible to interpret these investors with less confidence in becoming real estate owners in the United States," explained Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the Realtors group.Less Chinese investment in the United States is unlikely to cause the u.S. economy to slump, as it accounts for only a small fraction of the investment made by the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, and Germany. Moreover, China remains the largest buyer of Treasury bonds; however, it is now only a $1.1 trillion in securities, according to the latest information from the Treasury Department.By contrast, receiving fewer investments could damage areas that were already economically disadvantaged and dependent on China's cash. States like Michigan had increasingly attracted Chinese investment, opening new factories and creating jobs in a region of the country that had struggled to recover from the Great Recession.Craig Allen, chairman of the U.S.-China Business Council, said the loss of Chinese investment could be felt especially in rural states where Chinese investors had bought factories and revitalized troubled businesses."The policy of not welcoming investors is beginning to have detrimental effects on relatively poor areas of The United States that need jobs," he warned."Officials in states and local areas keep telling the Chinese they are welcome," Allen said. "But what you hear from federal officials is completely different."Copyright Group of Diaries America - GDA/La Nacion/CostaRicaLoad-Date: August 2, 2019End of Document

Uighurs Can't Escape Chinese Repression, Even in EuropeAtlantic OnlineAugust 20, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1976 wordsByline: Ellen HallidayBodyBRUSSELS-In the comfortable living room of a family home near Antwerp, photographs from not so long ago recall the faces of the missing. A business man sits proudly behind the desk of the company he owns. A party of women smile and laugh as they share a cup of tea. Four brothers in sharp suits, with their arms spread across one another's shoulders, grin at the camera.One of them is Ibrahim Ismael. He and his family fled their home in Hotan, Xinjiang, in 2011. They are ethnic Uighurs, a minority in China but the biggest group in Xinjiang, China's largest and westernmost region, which borders eight countries. They cannot go home, where at least 1 million Uighurs are detained in camps that Beijing says are for "reeducation" (human-rights groups label them "concentration camps"). Nor can they freely campaign for Uighur rights in Europe. Conversations with Uighurs in Belgium, Finland, and the Netherlands reveal a systematic effort by China to silence Uighurs overseas with brazen tactics of surveillance, blackmail, and intimidation. Many of the Uighurs I spoke with did so on condition of anonymity out of concern for their families in China.Beijing claims that Xinjiang has always been part of China. Some of the province's main cities-Ãœrümqi, Hotan, and Kashgar-have been strategically important posts on the Silk Road, the legendary trade route that connected China, the Middle East, and Europe for centuries. But the region's history is more complicated. In 1949, separatists briefly declared independence for East Turkestan, the Uighur name for Xinjiang. Although it didn't last long-China took control shortly after the establishment of the communist state in Beijing that same year-the memory of self-governance and invasion lives on.Most Uighurs, though not all, are Muslim, and speak a Turkic language rather than Chinese. In the 1990s, a major separatist insurrection in the province and the recent collapse of the Soviet Union encouraged China to increase its control in the region. After the attacks of September 11, 2001, Beijing stopped talking about the Uighurs as separatists and started referring to its opponents in the region as terrorists; this discourse, linked to the Islamic faith of most Uighurs, helped China gain international support for its actions. When            violence broke out in Ãœrümqi shortly after the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the government cracked down harder than ever before. The state now            monitors the individual trustworthiness of each person. Points are lost for owning a Koran, so-called extremist behavior such as fasting during Ramadan, simply being Uighur, or having a family member living in a foreign country. Those who lose too many points are sent to a camp, often for an indeterminate length of time.[           China is treating Islam like a mental illness]The Uighur diaspora in Europe is relatively small-just a few thousand refugees, in addition to            several thousand more in Turkey. Some came on student visas, to France, Hungary, and the Nordic countries, and then stayed. Others, knowing it was a one-way trip, put their safety in the hands of smugglers. Ibrahim and his family paid $40,000 for a journey through Guangzhou, Malaysia, Thailand, and Turkey, before they could start a new life in Belgium. "I arrived with only $100 left in my pocket," he told me.At first, many Uighurs in Europe were reluctant to speak out. Although Ibrahim and his friends live in European democracies where freedom of speech is promised, they feared that their advocacy would lead to retribution for their families.One activist told me that when in the past he risked a snatched conversation on WeChat, the widely used Chinese social-media app, the state was listening. "You can hear that there is someone else there," he said . "If we greet our families with 'Salaam Alaikum,' they flinch and tell us to be quiet." The Uighurs I met told me that as surveillance and arrests in Xinjiang increased since 2017, the calls from relatives stopped altogether. "I didn't want to be an activist," says Halmurat Harri, a Uighur campaigner and Finnish citizen, whose parents were detained in Xinjiang in April 2017. "I'm just a son, who wants to speak to his mother." As the silence settled in, many in Europe began to feel they had no other choice but to go public.Halmurat was one of the first to challenge the Chinese demand for silence. In August 2018, he set off on a "Freedom Tour" of Europe to raise awareness of the detention of Uighurs, including his parents.Halmurat argued extensively and publicly that his parents' case did not fit with any official Chinese-government excuses for detaining Uighurs. They are retirees, so they don't need vocational training. They are secular, so can't be called religious extremists. His father even speaks fluent Chinese. Halmurat used social media effectively-and in December 2018, his parents were removed from the camp and put under house arrest. He thinks it is "highly possible" that his activism pressured the government to let them go-though they            were released just weeks before the Finnish president visited China.  [           When China convinced the U.S. that Uighurs were waging jihad]His story has inspired others to follow suit. Activists are now more numerous, more organized, and more energized than ever before. They run workshops, public meetings, and social-media campaigns to hone their strategies and win the attention of politicians. They are eager to share their stories and their grief. But their efforts have not gone unnoticed by Beijing.China wants to silence its critics, and so it confronts Uighur activists who live beyond its borders.The EU's border provides little extra protection: Uighurs in Germany, Finland, and Belgium also report being contacted by Chinese authorities. They say they are asked to spy or to reveal sensitive personal details including their home address, workplace, and national ID numbers. The offers, even if refused, breed distrust. Their friends, they are told, have accepted.Other forms of intimidation are more public. One Uighur man I spoke with reported that he took part in a protest march in Belgium that was followed by a Chinese consular car with blacked-out windows. Halmurat reports that demonstrators in Helsinki have been photographed. According to the World Uyghur Congress, an advocacy group that represents Uighur interests from Munich, Beijing uses such photographs to punish the families of the protesters who remain in China.Beijing has also sought to silence a network of scholars in Europe, who are working with Uighur activists to help tell their story. Vanessa Frangville, a French scholar at the Université Libre de Bruxelles, has found her work targeted by Chinese authorities. In November 2018, two Chinese officials delivered a letter from the Chinese ambassador in Belgium to the university two weeks after it published an online statement in support of Uighur academics. "The Embassy hopes that the University will be able to avoid being misled by false information, and withdraw from its website the motion and other unfounded articles on Xinjiang, in the general interest of the Belgian-Chinese friendly cooperation," the ambassador wrote.[           China's jaw-dropping family separation policy]In February 2019, two individuals dressed as students but identified, Frangville says, by police as Chinese consular staff, disrupted an academic conference in Strasbourg, France, that she organized on the situation in Xinjiang. The individuals distributed propaganda and discredited the panel. "That was kind of a traumatic incident, because they spread doubt about what we were saying," she told me. There have also been reports of similar disruptive incidents in Ireland and in Canada.The Uighur activists want Western leaders to pressure China over its human-rights record in Xinjiang, in the hope that Beijing may loosen control. The EU has urged Beijing to respect freedom of religious belief, freedom of expression, and the rights of ethnic and religious minorities. On May 3, as the U.S.-China trade war escalated, the Trump administration accused China of running "           concentration camps" and subsequently called its actions in Xinjiang the "           stain of the century."But European governments could also do more to safeguard activists living inside their borders. Authorities at times appear ill-prepared to protect Uighur activists. Shortly before he set off on his awareness-raising European tour, Halmurat's car was vandalized. Upon his return, it began to emit white smoke from the engine. When he reported the incidents to the local police, he found that they did not take his concerns seriously.In July, Halmurat traveled to Turkey to meet diplomats and discuss reported deportations of Uighurs to Tajikistan. Arriving at the Ankara airport after a flight from Istanbul, he noticed that two, then three, then four men were following him, always on their phones, in and out of the airport. They were Uighur, and spoke the Uighur language. When he came closer, he says, they switched to Turkish. Fearing for his safety, he called the Finnish Foreign Ministry and U.S. Embassy in Turkey. While U.S. officials gave information and reassurance, "I do not feel protected by my own country," Halmurat told me.While European Foreign Ministries are aware of the ways in which Chinese officials intimidate Uighur activists, they can do little to prevent it. In Europe's open, democratic societies, China can legally pressure critics through academia, political lobbying, and the media. The European External Action Service, the EU's foreign-policy arm, has a well-oiled operation tracking Russian influence in Europe, but has only more recently begun to pay more attention to the ways in which China makes use of these spaces to silence critics.To some extent, Uighur activists are vulnerable because Western societies are not aware of their situation. Many Europeans have never heard the word Uighur, and refugees like Ismael and activists like Halmurat find it hard to generate public support for their cause. "We need people to see us as they see Tibet," Halmurat said.Only two European countries-Germany and Sweden-guarantee that they will not deport Uighurs claiming asylum. Germany only changed its rules after deporting 22-year-old Dilshat Adil in what authorities called an "administrative error." He has not been heard from since. Rune Steenberg, a researcher at the University of Copenhagen, says that Adil's deportation is evidence of systemic apathy. "Don't believe that Western governments are good, fair, or want your best," he warns Uighur activists. "They're not as bad as others, but they are not as good as you hope."For Ibrahim and his family, life in Europe is much better than it was in Xinjiang. He is employed as a long-distance truck driver, his three children are in school, and the family can practice their faith at home without retribution. But they are torn in tw between the opportunities of their European future and the pain of knowing that their new life may have contributed to the suffering of their family in Xinjiang.Whether they are active campaigners or not, Uighurs living far from Xinjiang and farther yet from Beijing cannot escape Xi Jinping's long arm of influence. Small gestures reveal the spirit of independence that will not be cowed. "The strong bully the weak," Ibrahim tells me, as he puts on his shoes and heads out for work. "What China is doing is a test." On the living-room floor, in the doorway of his home, Ibrahim treads on a barely visible photograph that bears the face of Xi. In Belgium, he has merely taken a step. In China, he would have committed a crime. Xi's faded features stare blankly upward, his image worn away by the passing feet of those he tries to silence.Load-Date: August 21, 2019End of Document

5 things to know for August 6: Mass shootings, US-China trade, Venezuela, KashmirCNN.comJuly 30, 2019 Tuesday 5:51 AM ESTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: USLength: 981 wordsByline: By Doug Criss, CNNBodySinger Khalid plans to hold a benefit concert to help those affected by the mass shooting in El Paso. And there are ways you can help the victims (both in El Paso and Dayton), as well.Â Here's what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door. (You can also get "5 Things You Need to Know Today" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.)1. El Paso mass shootingEl Paso came together last night, two days after a gunman brought unspeakable horror to the Texas city. People attended a handful ofÂ vigils to remember the 22 people killed when a shooter attacked shoppers at a Walmart. People likeÂ Jordan and Andre Anchondo. The young couple, with their 2-month-old son in tow,Â were shopping for school supplies when the shooting started. The couple was killed, but the baby survived because his mom shielded him from the gunfire. You can read more about other victims of the massacre here.And there were stories of heroism, too, like the Walmart employee and customer who helped 140 people escape the violence. The gunman, who has been charged with capital murder, showed no remorse or regret when he was arrested, police say. President Trump, who addressed the nation about the shootings there and in Dayton, Ohio, will visit the city tomorrow. That announcement is being met with mixed reactions.2. Dayton mass shootingMeanwhile, in Ohio, a Twitter account that appears to belong to the gunman in the Dayton shooting retweetedÂ extreme left-wing and anti-police posts, as well as tweets supportingÂ Antifa, or anti-fascist, protesters. The mass shooting early Sunday morning in an entertainment district in Dayton left nineÂ people dead. Police still haven't determined what led the gunmanÂ to kill innocent people.Many of the people who died in Dayton were simply out celebrating milestones and achievements in their lives. Lois OglesbyÂ had given birth last month. Logan Turner just last week had celebrated his 30th birthday. Nicholas Cumer was a week away from completing an internship at a cancer treatment center. But theirÂ lives were brutally cut short after just 30 seconds of gunfire. Click here to read more about theÂ victims of the Dayton shooting.3. US-China trade warA new front has opened up in the trade war between the US and China: currency. The Chinese government devalued its currency, letting the yuan fall below its 7-to-1 ratio with the US dollar for the first time in a decade. So, what the heckÂ does that mean exactly? Just know it's not good. The move is interpretedÂ as China retaliating after the President threatened to slap a 10% tariff on $300 billion worth of Chinese goods.Â The Trump administration later labeled China a "currency manipulator."The result of all this financial gamesmanship? Stocks plummeted worldwide. Here in the US, the Dow had its worst day of the year, closing down 767 points. Today will probably be ugly, too. Asian stocks were down across the board this morning, and Dow futures don't look so hot, either. CNN Business'Â Matt Egan says this whole trade war is starting to get out of hand.Â Click here for the latest.4. VenezuelaThe US is increasing the pressure on Venezuela, big time. President Trump announced that the US would expand its sanctions against the South American nation (through an executive order) to impose a total economic embargo.Â The embargo freezes assets of Venezuela'sÂ government and associated entities and prohibits economic transactions with it, withÂ a few exceptions.Â The situation in Venezuela has deteriorated significantly over the past few years, with food and medicine shortages causing a humanitarian crisis that's forced many to flee. And there's a political crisis going on, too, withÂ embattled President Nicolas Maduro and the opposition leader, National Assembly President Juan Guaido, fighting for control of the country. (Guaido is recognized as Venezuela's interim president by dozens of countries.)5. KashmirTensions are sky-high right nowÂ in one of the most militarized places in the world: the disputed Kashmir region, which is claimed by both India and Pakistan. The part of the region controlled by India was on lockdown yesterday, with prominent politicians put under house arrest, tens of thousands of new troops deployed and a broad communications blackout in effect. All this comes as India preps to change the way it runs the disputed region.The government of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said it was going to revoke what's known as Article 370, a 70-year-old measure thatÂ gives two Indian states in the disrupted region a certain level of autonomy. Revoking Article 370 would give India more power in the part of Kashmir it controls. Pakistan hates this idea and so do the opposition parties in India.Â Click here to read more about Article 370 and learn why Kashmir means so muchÂ to both India and Pakistan.Â TODAY'S NUMBERS20 yearsThe prison sentence given to Cesar Sayoc, the man who pleaded guilty to sending pipe bombs to prominent Democrats and members of the media, including CNN$1Â millionThe amount of money donated by a former coal tycoon to coal miners in eastern Kentucky whose company stopped paying them after it declared bankruptcyBREAKFAST BROWSEGood neighborsWhen a New Jersey man was in danger of losing his home, his neighbors got busy and raised $50,000 so he could keep it.Light as a rockWant to see a skyscraper that seems to defy gravity?

China charges Australian writer Yang Hengjun with spyingCNN.comAugust 26, 2019 Monday 6:13 AM ESTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: AUSTRALIALength: 690 wordsByline: By Angus Watson and Steven Jiang, CNNDateline: Hong Kong BodyChinese-Australian writer Yang Hengjun has been arrested on espionage charges in Beijing, seven months after being detained in southern China.His charges were announced by the Australian government. Yang's Melbourne-based lawyer, Rob Stary, said few details had been released about the case beyond the spying charges."We don't know whether he's accused of spying on behalf of a third party actor -- a foreign government such as Australia or the US," Stary said. "We know him as a blogger and democracy activist -- so we can't conceive of any other actions outside of his role as a political agitator."Stary said the spying charges were worrying. Espionage can carry the death penalty in China, though Stary said it was "not within our contemplation that this case will attract that penalty."A former official with the Chinese foreign ministry, Yang, 53, also holds Australian citizenship, and was known to spend most of his time in the United States. He also had a large following on Twitter, where he posted satirical commentaries and criticism of the Chinese government.He was detained in the city of Guangzhou in January, while he and his wife were visiting from New York, where Yang was a visiting scholar at Columbia University. Yang's wife, Yuan Xiaoliang -- a Chinese citizen with Australian permanent residency -- has been issued an exit ban preventing her from leaving China, Stary said.At a regular press briefing Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang confirmed Yang's arrest and said the case was "under further investigation."Stary said Julian McMahon, a high-profile Australian barrister, had been hired to assist with the case. McMahon previously represented the Bali Nine, accused drug traffickers who were sentenced to death in Indonesia in 2005.Diplomatic issueYang's detention in January came amid a period of rocky relations between Beijing and Canberra.The two sides were clashing on issues ranging from China's alleged attempts to influence the former's domestic politics, to Canberra's decision to ban technology by Chinese company Huawei from the country's 5G mobile networks and Beijing's rising ambitions in the South Pacific.Marise Payne, Australia's minister for foreign affairs, said in a statement that Canberra was "very concerned" about Yang, who was moved to a detention center in Beijing in July, after six months of house arrest."Dr Yang has been held in Beijing in harsh conditions without charge for more than seven months. Since that time, China has not explained the reasons for Dr Yang's detention, nor has it allowed him access to his lawyers or family visits," she said."We have serious concerns for Dr Yang's welfare, and about the conditions under which he is being been held."Geng, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, said Beijing "expresses its strong dissatisfaction over Australia's statement on the case.""I want to emphasize that China is a country with the rule of law. Australia should earnestly respect China's judicial sovereignty and must not interfere in China's handling of the case in any way," he said.Although Beijing denies any link between its detention of foreign nationals and bilateral disputes, critics say the cases have had a "chilling effect" on how foreigners view and deal with China."You start to hear people say, If my government has frictions with China, I'd better not be in China," Yaqiu Wang, a China researcher for the international advocacy group Human Rights Watch, told CNN earlier this year. "Other people feel, I'd better stay quiet and not say anything critical of the Chinese government in case something happens to me."In December last year, two Canadians -- former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor -- were detained and accused of stealing "sensitive information and other intelligence." Their detention came just over a week after the Canadian government arrested Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Chinese tech giant Huawei, on behalf of the US.Meng is facing charges of working to evade US sanctions on Iran.Correction: Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang confirmed Yang's arrest on Tuesday.Load-Date: August 28, 2019End of Document

NetLinkz Ltd (ASX: NET) announces it has signed a MOU with iSoftStone to establish a joint venture company in China to distribute and sell products developed from the Beijing IoT Lab.PR NewswireJuly 11, 2019 Thursday 4:35 AM ESTCopyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 647 wordsDateline: SYDNEY, July 11, 2019 BodyPR NewswireNetLinkz Ltd (ASX: NET) ('NetLinkz') is pleased to announce that today it has signed a MOU with ISS to establish a joint venture company based in Beijing, China to commercialise the IP (including NetLinkz's VIN and VSP) that is being developed in the IOT Lab in Beijing.NetLinkz announced to the ASX on 1 March 2019 that it had signed an agreement with ISS to establish an IoT Lab in ISS's Head Office in Beijing to jointly develop and commercialise NetLinkz's software for the market in China.After significant product development and collaboration with current ISS customers in the IOT Lab in Beijing, ISS and NetLinkz have made a strategic decision to set up a sales, distribution and customer support joint venture company to establish a recurring revenue model from the sale of products developed in the IOT Lab in Beijing to the China market.ISS and NetLinkz see significant business opportunity in the SD WAN market place with a focus on creating an infrastructure software solution business supporting the growth of IoT cloud to edge networking requirements in China. ISS has expertise in creating software in-a-box solutions and, with NetLinkz VIN and VSP software, the joint venture company will be able to provide a fully secure mesh network that has greater flexibility than MPLS for ISS customers and beyond.ISS have committed to purchase a minimum 100,150 VINs for their existing customers from the joint venture company.  Revenue for the joint venture company from the sale of the 100,150 VINS will be recurring monthly. Whilst pricing is confidential, the price for the 100,150 VINs will be higher than current prices paid by customers in the China Telecom Wuxi JAST pilot program. The joint venture company will announce the new branding names for VIN and VSP as well as its new products for China in the coming weeks.The joint venture company's focus will be on distribution and sales. It is separate to the development of products and markets in the IOT Lab in Beijing, which will continue to develop products for the China market using both NetLinkz IP and ISS's IP. A customer call support centre has already been established in the Zibobei City in the Shandong Province.ISS will be the controlling shareholder of the joint venture company (51:49) to allow product sales across all sectors in China including to Government, Government Agencies, State Owned Enterprises, China National Entities as well as private companies and foreign companies operating in China. ISS and NetLinkz will both contribute equity capital funds for the joint venture company. The joint venture company will be registered with the Chinese Government to ensure licensing and permits to sell the VIN and VSP incorporated products nationally.Most importantly NetLinkz will earn a royalty as well as dividends from the joint venture company.  About iSoftStoneiSoftStone is China's leading software and cloud based technology developer with a national footprint and over 55,000 employees, 1,000+ local and Global Corporate Customers including 90+ Fortune 500 Companies. iSoftStone has existing commercial relationships with Industry Leaders such as Huawei, China Telecom, China Unicom, China Mobile, Tencent, Alibaba and Baidu.About NetLinkz LimitedNetLinkz provides secure and efficient cloud network solutions.

I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Wednesday, August 7th, your top stories, right now, just before 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast.China trade turmoil once again, top story, China Central Bank setting its Yuan rate above the symbolic seven level, but still not at a low, not seen since 2008, what it all means for trade talks as the battle shifts a bit from tariffs to currency.Markets, this morning, continuing a firmer trade, adding to yesterday's gains, take a look. We're expecting a higher opening from the Dow Industrials today, better than 100 points. We've got earnings to take a look at. Disney reporting record revenue, but profit did take a hit and theme park attendance, actually, declined. We've got more on that, plus the details on Disney streaming service as well.Donald Trump headed to Dayton and El Paso, the president will meet with victims' families and first responders. There is a controversy as the president clashes with Democrats this morning, MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.We've got a big show this morning, joining the conversation, FOX Business Network's Dagen McDowell, former U.S. Army Special Operations and strategic adviser at WhiteFox Defense, Brett Velicovich and CFRA investment strategist, Lindsey Bell. Big show, lots to talk about this morning.Also on deck this morning, top tiered PGA Tour golfer, four-time major tournament winner, he's the number one right now, Brooks Koepka is here to talk about the big business of golf, ahead of the playoffs there.World Bank Group president, David Malpass is here on trade, and then, Bill Clinton's former chief of staff and McLarty Associates chairman, Mack McLarty joining us, to talk 2020, and Hawaii congressman 2020 presidential candidate, Tulsi Gabbard is here. We'll talk in Google, doubling down on Senator Kamala Harris, and 2020, a lot to come. Don't miss the three hours right here, as we kick it off.And we are looking at markets this morning, firmer tone, actually, 102 points higher on the Dow Industrials, S&P up 11-1/2, NASDAQ up almost 50 points. All three major averages rebounded yesterday on fading trade and currency fears, Beijing and Washington still in a trade stalemate, with China reportedly digging in for a drawn-out fight, pretty good market yesterday, Lindsey, your reaction?LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA RESEARCH: Yes, I mean, I'm actually surprised the market is taking everything that we've learned through the last couple of days in such good stride. Again, today, like you said at the top of the show, you see the Yuan being weakened.It has been weakened each in the last couple of days, not to the extent that we saw on Sunday night which sent the market into knee-jerk reaction.But, I think, what we're seeing here is that these two countries are in it for the long haul and I don't expect us to have any resolution before the end of the year, and my biggest fear, so we go to a point of no return, where we go too far and the economic impact around the global is really too far to come back from.BARTIROMO: It certainly will stoke uncertainty, Dagen, which you've talked about so much.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Right. Uncertainty that a Federal Reserve can't fix, I mean, uncertainty is the greatest enemy of business investment decisions, I'm stealing a quote, I think it's the head of titan steel who was quoted in the Wall Street Journal saying that last week.But, again, in a market, and I'm not talking about just the U.S. market, but in markets and economies that are -- markets overvalued, priced for perfection and economies that are highly leveraged and companies, in many instances, that are deeply indebted as well. It doesn't take much in that scenario to trigger, kind of, an irrational panic --BRETT VELICOVICH, STRATEGIC ADVISER AT WHITEFOX DEFENSE: Right, right.MCDOWELL: -- and maybe, I don't think any panics are rational, but it doesn't take much and the reason -- I'll point this out, yesterday, the reason that investors were so concerned about this sudden drop in the Yuan and other Asian currencies like the Yuan, is because of the dollar- denominated debts that are outside those countries.You have entities, banks, particularly in South Korea, that will then try to repay those debts with a devalued currency, with a cheaper currency, that in and of itself, could trigger a financial crisis and the domino effect around the world, so the stability and the currency was critical.VELICOVICH: Right, right. I do think that the market probably overreacted, definitely, with concerns that this trade war would escalate to a global currency war. And while the Chinese may be OK with a trade war, at least, now, and digging in.What they definitely don't want is a global currency war because, you know, in the end, it could hurt their own -- their own country citizens, they can make it so, obviously, they have less purchasing power overseas.And one thing Xi Jinping does not need right now are more people within his country, angry at him, and that could potentially hurt, you know, the Chinese economy (INAUDIBLE)BARTIROMO: But, I mean, they were devaluing their currency before the U.S. called them out, right?VELICOVICH: Yes.BARTIROMO: So, devaluing their currency, so --VELICOVICH: But that doesn't necessarily always work when you devalue your currency, right? Because, you know, in the end, it spells long-term trouble potentially for the Chinese government and the Chinese economy.And I think we did see them blink here, and the reason the market bounced back was -- what we saw that they tried to stabilize the currency and make it -- then basically reassure investors that everything was going to be OK and that they didn't specifically want a currency war to take place.MCDOWELL: Well, they're trying to prevent a capital flight out of the nation. That's what China cannot afford. And Xi Jinping, to your point, is in -- and we talked about this yesterday, Xi Jinping is in a position where he might -- he really can't negotiate with President Trump coming up on this 75th anniversary, I think it's in October of the People's Republic, that major anniversary for communist China, that -- that's --Because I know that you talked about this yesterday, that when are we going to get a trade deal, it could be after the election, because in the short run, that neither one of these men, these leaders, have a lot of negotiating power.VELICOVICH: Yes.MCDOWELL: Room to give, so to speak.VELICOVICH: And Xi Jinping has a strong man image to protect, I mean, he thinks in dynasties, right, centuries, we think -- we tend to think in years, so he has a strong man image to protect as well.BARTIROMO: Yes, and for sure. All right, then we've got earnings to talk about, Disney's profit dip, the company reporting disappointing third quarter numbers yesterday. Missing on earnings per share, and revenue, the 21st Century Fox acquisition is cited as one of the reasons for the miss.CEO Bob Iger says that costs related to Disney's upcoming streaming service, would weigh on the company, what's your reaction here, Dagen?MCDOWELL: That one of the things that hurt -- that dragged on Disney's results was the -- again, like you said, the acquisition of these Fox assets and Bob Iger started the call saying that it was the most complicated in his 14-year tenure as CEO. That's not good.Can you get -- again, these are assets, these are film assets and entertainment assets on the Fox side that had been lagging this year. They will rebound, but it kind of goes to the point that the entertainment business is very cyclical. And that investors, I think, are really waiting until the streaming service comes out later this year.That's the way that Disney will ultimately be able to monetize of the eldest content that it's acquired and owned and monetized all these entertainment assets.BARTIROMO: If I had to make a bet, I would be betting on Disney, I mean, I know Netflix has been super successful, but Disney has got incredible libraries after all of those acquisitions that it's done in the last decade.MCDOWELL: Right.BELL: Well, no, I think you're absolutely right. But the only concern for the near term is this is a stock that's up 30 percent year-to-date, right? And, you know, Bob Iger also made the comment on his call that it's going to take a couple of years for those streaming services to turn around just like Netflix and some of the others.They are spending a lot of money to invest in this portion of the business, to make it grow and this is what investors are betting on. They might be disappointed.MCDOWELL: Here's the kicker, and Disney said this yesterday, Disney Plus, which as stand-alone, is going to cost 6.99 a month. Disney Plus will come in a bundle, along with ESPN Plus and Hulu for 12.99, 12.99 a month that is the same price as Netflix most popular subscription plan. You know what Netflix doesn't have, live sports.VELICOVICH: Right.MCDOWELL: That's what you get with that -- with that bundle. That is a very competitive price and that is a very attractive option.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Highest premium -- probably the most important intellectual property on television, live sports.VELICOVICH: Sure, sure, but Iger did say on this call that this was the most important product the company has launched since his tenure. So, you can see how big of a deal it is for them to release a streaming service. And then, the other thing is that they have to scale it very quickly, OK?Consumers are about to be inundated with more and more of these streaming services, these paid to play things and I think he believes he's got to go quick, he's got to scale it very, very fast, otherwise, he's going to get beaten by some of these other networks.BELL: Well, for the same price as Netflix, you're getting less content. But to the point, it's like, people are going to pay for the sports and if you're a parent, the Disney, you know, all the different -- their assets there.MCDOWELL: You get Star Wars and sports for 12.99 a month, and that's not even including Hulu. Who can turn that down?BARTIROMO: It's true.MCDOWELL: And I've owned all of the streaming services at one point or another.VELICOVICH: Right, right.BARTIROMO: Very competitive.VELICOVICH: After a while, it seems like it gets more expensive than a cable bundle. Once you start seeing all of these --MCDOWELL: No, I don't have a cable. I shouldn't say owned, I've rented these streaming services.VELICOVICH: Yes.BARTIROMO: President Trump headed to Dayton and El Paso today to talk with victims' families days after the mass shootings in those cities, the president making the trip despite protests for some Democrats, including 2020 presidential candidate and El Paso native, Beto O'Rourke and Texas Congresswoman Veronica Escobar.President Trump tweeted on Beto O'Rourke last night. The president said this, Beto, phony name to indicate Hispanic heritage, O'Rourke, who is embarrassed by my last visit to the great state of Texas, where I trounced him, and is now even more embarrassed by polling at one percent in the Democrat primary, should respect the victims and law enforcements and be quiet. What a tweet.MCDOWELL: Well, Beto O'Rourke it -- his -- jump -- him jumping on this issue, it looks like that he is trying to benefit, politically, from these murders in El Paso, quite frankly, and that's the way it looks, not just the president, but it looks that way to many people.VELICOVICH: It's embarrassing. It's so disheartening to see these commentators on the left, basically say that the president of the United States is not welcome in Ohio or --BARTIROMO: It's just disgusting, you're right.VELICOVICH: -- in El Paso. It's embarrassing. And the president has time and time again, repeatedly, forcefully denounced hate and basically called for bipartisan support to help fix this issue, and he's already proven -- he's got a proven track record of doing something about this. After Las Vegas, people called for bump stocks to be banned.He put out legislation that banned bump stocks, so he's waiting for people to guide him and tell him what to do so he can help get this fixed.BARTIROMO: We talked about this yesterday. And, Dagen, you said -- you made the point that the president has done more, in terms of these shootings, from the bump stocks to talk about background checks, than President Obama has done, ever, certainly in his two terms.MCDOWELL: They also, in a bipartisan move in Congress, they've tried to close the loopholes and the National Background Check System. Because, again, it was after the Sutherland Springs shooting in Texas, that murderer had had a court martial related to -- a court martial related to domestic violence that the Air Force didn't report into the background check system.So, again, I think you have to step back and look at, is the government enforcing the laws as they are on the books right now?One big thing that will happen, I think, is that Congress will move forward on, at least, laying the ground work for national red flag laws or national -- what -- they have many names, but gun violence restraining orders where law enforcement and or a family member can go to a court and get an order to remove a weapon or weapons from an individual's home or person.VELICOVICH: Extreme risk protection.MCDOWELL: Right.(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: That's what they are also called. It's very tricky. You have to be careful about due process. But I do think that you will see something happen. Lindsey Graham has teamed up with Richard Blumenthal in Connecticut. Connecticut was the first state in the country in 1999 to have these orders in place. And so, I think that this is something that you will see happen.BARTIROMO: You would think that both sides could together on something like this. I mean --MCDOWELL: They're really complicated. I encourage people to read about them. They're extremely complicated, but I think that if you get some, sort of, standard, Lindsey Graham and Blumenthal are not even talking about a federal red flag law.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: They're talking about grants to these states in order to implement them. That shows less government overreach.BARTIROMO: Let's take a quick break. We want to take a look at earnings in markets this morning, but this quick break, and then taking on big tech, President Trump slams Google over alleged political bias, what he said and what he wants done, straight ahead on that.And then, SpaceX success, the company's Falcon 9 rocket taking off, three years after the first one exploded, back in a minute with a lot to come. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, Iran issuing a new stern warning, Cheryl Casone on headlines now, Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, Maria, in a speech broadcast live on state television, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said that peace with Iran is the mother of peace, war with Iran is the mother of all war. He also had this warning for shipping in the Strait of Hormuz.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HASSAN ROUHANI, PRESIDENT OF IRAN (through translator): If you want safety for your soldiers in the region, security would be for security, you cannot blemish our security and then expect security for you, peace for peace, oil for oil.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: This comes as tensions between Iran and the U.S. continue to rise, following President Trump's withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear agreement and re-imposition of sanctions. Rouhani, accusing the U.S. of engaging an economic terrorism, but he says he is willing to talk with the U.S. if all sanctions are lifted.Well, more Walgreens stores are closing, the company shutting down 200 locations. The announcement just after Walgreens announced closing 200 Boots locations over in the U.K. They also said the closings are part of a move to increase their operational efficiency. The stock is down more than 20 percent, year to date.An impressive video from SpaceX to show you, Elon Musk Space Company launched its Falcon 9 rocket into orbit on Tuesday. Video shows a drone ship which captures the rocket's fairing, which is part of protective cover that breaks off and it falls back to the earth after the rocket leaves the atmosphere.But, again, Elon Musk, actually doing pretty well, Maria, when it comes to SpaceX and these rocket launches. Things are turning around, it seems, for him.BARTIROMO: Sure he is. Cheryl, thank you so much. I want to talk Iran for a second, Brett, your thoughts on this new stern warning coming from Iran?VELICOVICH: Well, it's just more of the same from the world's largest exporter of terrorism. With Iran, it's all about rhetoric, you have to watch what they do and not what they say, necessarily, but the fact is, they are covertly at war with us and they've been covertly at war with us for years. They do this through their proxy forces.They just recently captured another tanker in the Gulf, supposedly smuggling oil. They're trying to tend almost as if they are the good guys all of the sudden, when really they're there to stoke chaos, stoke violence and hurt the U.S.And so, the one -- there's a few things I worry about when it comes to Iran, recently, I worry that China may start buying their oil and potentially give them an outlet to help boost their economy a bit, China's trying to form these new alliances particularly with the trade war.And the other thing I worry about is recent legislation where Democrats seem to be trying to weaken our ability to defend ourselves against Iran, because they are taking away the president's war powers to be able to act quickly, unilaterally, and do something at a moment's notice at a time when it's needed the most.BARTIROMO: But if we are attacked first, the president doesn't need to check with Congress.VELICOVICH: They're trying to basically take away the AUMF, the Authorization for Use of Military Force. He's going to have to work with Congress to do that. Now, I do believe in that legislation it does say that if we are attacked first, they can do something, but they seem to be weakening our ability to defend ourselves and I really -- I'm really concerned about.BARTIROMO: Yes, and it's certainly is concerning to see this accelerate.VELICOVICH: Sure.MCDOWELL: Really quickly, you know what would weaken our ability to really defend ourselves against Iran on the national stage, is green -- a Green New Deal and moving to fossil -- moving away from fossil fuels. Again, the rest of the world uses fossil fuels and Iran is one of the biggest producers, we are the biggest producer in the world.But again, you move away from that, you remove your ability to control the price of oil, which we now have in our -- basically, as a weapon, and you weaken us on the world stage. That's something that the Democrats don't talk about when they're talking about going into electric cars and flying birds to the west coast.BARTIROMO: Exactly.MCDOWELL: Literal birds.BARTIROMO: Oil at 53.40 this morning, unlike sweet crude. Quick break, and then, permission not granted, Twitter warning users their data may have been used for ads without an OK, the fallout coming up. Plus, market rally, stocks are rebounding after Monday's selloff.We are looking at gains this morning, and the momentum continues. We've got the outlook ahead of the opening bell when we come right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, markets are bouncing back, they certainly bounced back yesterday, after sharp losses on Monday, the meltdown, of course, heightened by U.S.-China trade tensions. Yesterday, Dow Industrials were up 311 points, and this morning, that momentum continues.Joining us right now is Russell Investment senior portfolio manager, Kevin Divney, and Kevin, it's great to see you this morning, thanks so much for joining us.KEVIN DIVNEY, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, RUSSELL INVESTMENT: Good morning.BARTIROMO: How did you react to that big selloff on Monday? As portfolio manager, did you buy into it or stepped aside?DIVNEY: We were already positioned knowing that the shock of a (INAUDIBLE) event was heightened this summer, so we've been very neutral between, say, growth and value and cyclical and defensive, going into earning season, we want to see how that came out.We're, sort of, trying to balance the line between being very cyclical and defensive here, but now, in an environment where its trade policy versus monetary policy. And the market really isn't processing earnings results yet. I think that's what we are looking through at the end of August, when does that start to get priced in?Not concerned from valuation level, the S&P 500 is about at fair value today, if you look at price to book versus returns on capital. And the earnings season has been relatively positive. We knew it was going to decelerate, but the margins have been pretty intact, record profit margins are staying there, and that's something we are looking for going into 2020.BARTIROMO: So, go through what happened last night, in terms of monetary policy.DIVNEY: Well, we had three other cuts in Asia, so now you see policy makers reacting to deceleration.And what is interesting and some people are calling it a three dimensional chess game between the administration and the Fed right now, is that they're trying to back them into a corner to continue to cut, to do these stimulative actions because of the trade policy, potentially amplifying already a decelerating global economy.We see that in Europe, the PMIs are below 50. The concerns in Asia, what's going on, and this, sort of, tailwind we have here is really just the U.S. consumer here in the U.S.BARTIROMO: Well, Dagen, you said earlier, and have been saying for a while, interest rate cuts are not going to save you out of where we are right now.MCDOWELL: Not where to the point that we've gotten the escalation of this fight because, again, a trade war has now have turned into what looks like a currency war, maybe not -- maybe not in the last day or so, but, again, how much juice, because we've already had longer-term interest rates falling since last year. And you have these incredibly attractive mortgage rates.How much juice would a short-term cut provide, in terms of lending and in terms of lower -- and, you know, and how much -- how much would it benefit Americans.DIVNEY: The benefit would be material if it was with corporate investment, because we have seen that slowed down and that is really because of visibility and confidence because of these policy actions that have been taken.So, if there's more clarification on the policy side that spurs investment, but also just with lower interest rates, that is something that could help spurs investment.MCDOWELL: But you won't get the corporate investment without the clarity on trade policy.DIVNEY: Exactly.MCDOWELL: So that means that an interest rate cut would do --BARTIROMO: Yes, and look at 10-year, though, I mean, 1.7 percent on the 10-year yield, that is extraordinary.MCDOWELL: It's lowest it's been since before President Trump was elected.DIVNEY: It broke 170 yesterday, the yield-curve inversion is another cause of concern, I think, you know, weeks back, when it converted, people are calling it a technical now if it stays inverted, if you go back to 1969, usually there's a recession 304 days after the yield curve staying there.So, the capital markets are telling us deceleration, you know, the tension we've had, really pose crisis at the capital markets, tend to be vigilantes by forcing policymakers into a corner and that's really not the best way for policymakers to be taking action.BARTIROMO: But you said earnings and backdrops still pretty good. Lindsey, what are the numbers, right now? How are we looking on the second quarter reporting season?BELL: Second quarter, like you said, has been very good. We are looking at 1-1/2 percent growth. We're looking for down two percent going into the earnings season. Second half numbers have come down, but my worry is 2020 expectations for over 11 percent earnings growth, like you said, we are seeing a deceleration, economically, around the globe. What happens to those numbers going forward?DIVNEY: The 2019 numbers have come down. A lot of the line for 2020 is still out there, so the guidance is really, really important. And that would be the concern. The good news or the, sort of, safety net right now is that the market's not incredibly expensive and that's the one thing that is, sort of, a haven for equity investors right now.BARTIROMO: All right, we will leave it there. Kevin, it's great to have you. Thanks so much.DIVNEY: Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: Kevin Divney joining us there. We'll take a break. When we come back -- well, first, let me tell you about President Trump just tweeted. He said this just a moment ago. South Korea has agreed to pay substantially more money to the United States in order to defend itself from North Korea.Over the past many decades, the U.S. has been paid very little by South Korea. But last year, at the request of President Trump, South Korea paid $990 million. Talks have begun to further increase payments to the United States.South Korea is a very wealthy nation that now feels an obligation to contribute to the military defense provided by the United States of America. The relationship between the two countries is a very good one, writes the president this morning.We'll take a break. When we come back, the president takes on big technology, slamming Google for alleged political bias, what he wants done coming up. And then hitting the road, Amazon self-driving robot ready to make first deliveries, where you can find them, straight ahead. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Wednesday, August 7th. Your top stories right now, 6:31 a.m. on the East Coast. Markets have a firmer tone today. Take a look. Futures showing the markets will add to yesterday's rally up 104 points on the Dow this morning. S&P Futures are up 11 and the Nasdaq Futures up 46.Yesterday, the market was able to gain back some of the losses suffered during Monday's big broad sell-off. Dow Industrials were up 311 points yesterday. 1-1/4 percent. S&P was up 37, and the Nasdaq was up 107, 1-1/3 percent yesterday.Global markets this morning look like this. As you just heard, we had a number of interest rate cuts in Asia. In the European markets, you had more signs of a slowdown. Germany reported industrial production fell more than expected in the month of June. It was down 1.5 percent month-over- month.Nonetheless, the DAX Index is up 160 points right now, 1-1/3 percent. FT- 100 in London up 60 points, and the CAC Quarante in Paris up 71.In Asia overnight, market saw slight losses except for Hong Kong which managed to end on the upside as a Chinese official said that Hong Kong is tracing its worst crisis in 20 years. Because we see that on the streets with all those protesters. And as I mentioned three interest rate cuts in Asia overnight.President Trump versus Google. He is doubling down on claims of political bias. He says he's watching the company very closely.And then, there is this. Twitter's privacy problems get worse. The company says it may have used user data for ads without permission. What a surprise. The social media is says, it is doing something about it and we will tell you about that.Plus this, the future is here. Amazon self-driving robots hitting the road, delivering packages. Find out where. Checkout that robot there.And top-ranked golfer Brooks Koepka. We go inside the big business of the PGA and look at how technology is being used to drive the sport forward. He's coming up later this hour. All those stories coming up.But first, our top story this half an hour. Online censorship. President Trump slamming Google and its CEO amid allegations of anti-conservative bias. The president says that the administration is watching Google closely.Here is what he told me back in June about tech companies in the 2020 election.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: Mr. President, you mentioned technology companies. How concerned are you that technology companies are censoring conservatives, and they are going to do this right up to the 2020 election?DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (via telephone): Well they're doing it to me on Twitter. I mean, what they did to me on Twitter is incredible. You know I have a -- you know, millions and millions of followers. But I will tell you, they make it very hard for people to join me in Twitter, and they make it very much harder for me to get out the message.BARTIROMO: Yes.TRUMP: Google was totally biased to the -- you know they talk about Russia because they had some bloggers.BARTIROMO: Well, somebody at Google said, they don't want what happened in 2016 to happen in 2010. They don't want it to happen again, right? Is that what you're referring to?TRUMP: Oh, shortly did. Let me tell you. They are trying to rig the election. That's what we should be looking at, not that the witch-hunt -- the phony witch-hunt which is proven zero.(END VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is Fox News senior judicial analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano. And judge, what you didn't hear in that sound bite -- It's good to see you, by the way.ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: Good morning.BARTIROMO: But what you didn't hear in that sound bite was me saying to the president, do you -- asking him, do you want to see legislation? Or do you just want to see competition on this market?NAPOLITANO: Now, how did he answer that?BARTIROMO: And he said, we will likely see legislation lead to competition.NAPOLITANO: Well, look. You know, I'm a free-market person, and I'm also a First Amendment person. Doesn't matter what I am, the First Amendment is very clear and the courts have been very clear. The government doesn't regulate speech.The president's complaints in my view are perfectly legitimate and widely held, and well-grounded. There's no question, but that this is happening. The question is, what remedy can there be?Can Congress possibly get involved and say that Google, you have to have more conservative opinions. I mean, the marketplace of ideas regulates speech. The government doesn't regulate speech. But by pushing this the way he is, he will -- he will make a lot of people aware of the fact that they are being subtly manipulated. When they Google something, they're not getting the answer that they're expecting, or they getting an answer that Google wants them to get.In the real world, you know, Google weren't worth what it is. And if there weren't the barriers to competition, there'd be another search engine that people that dislike Google and dislike its political manipulation could go to.BARTIROMO: Right.NAPOLITANO: But I realized the barriers to entry are extraordinary. We would require a fortune to establish something that could compete with Google.BARTIROMO: Well, Google has a 90 percent market share. I take it in terms of search. And you remember during 2016, and we were sitting here, we went to all the conventions and we were covering the election.You Googled anything about Hillary Clinton, you got great, beautiful news.NAPOLITANO: Yes.BARTIROMO: She was the best thing since sliced bread. You did the same thing for Donald Trump at that time, and it was, he's terrible, he's horrible, he's -- all negative stories. So, they did do that during 2016.NAPOLITANO: Well, the more the president points this out, the more consumers should be aware of what's going on. But I fear -- and people who believe in the freedom of speech should fear any effort by the government to tell Google how to run its business, and what speech it should advance, and what speech it should not advance. That's going to be done by the marketplace of ideas, state it differently.If people feel about Google the way the president does, they shouldn't use it and they should go somewhere else and some other search engine will (INAUDIBLE)(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: You don't have a choice, though. You don't -- you don't have a choice, though.BARTIROMO: 90 percent market share.MCDOWELL: But you don't have a choice. You know, if you put a search query into the taskbar of your Apple Safari browser on your iPhone, it is Google.NAPOLITANO: Yes.MCDOWELL: What you don't -- you do not have a choice in terms of -- you don't have a choice of who serves ads to all the web sites that you visit on the Internet. That two-thirds of the ads are served by Google and Facebook, roughly.BELL: We also (INAUDIBLE) with social media companies: Facebook, Twitter and the like. You start -- they start to understand what you like and what you're interested and they keep feeding you that news.NAPOLITANO: Right. Yes, yes.BELL: So you're not getting the other side of the conversation.BARTIROMO: Well, there's also the privacy issue in terms of that as well. Look I got to get to Peter Strzok. Because the former --(CROSSTALK)NAPOLITANO: Yes, I just read the complaint for you.BARTIROMO: The former -- I'm sorry?NAPOLITANO: I just read the complaint for you this morning.BARTIROMO: Oh, good. The former FBI agent is suing the bureau and the Justice Department over his dismissal now. He claims the agencies violated his First and Fifth Amendment rights.No mention of what rights he meant -- he broke when he spied on Donald Trump, but go ahead.NAPOLITANO: I would like to be president at his deposition. His examination before trial, where they go into all kinds of things about his own personal background. Here is his argument. He legitimately was reviewed by the aspect of the group in the FBI that hears complaints about senior FBI members and that group which is a non-political group that's been doing it for years and years and years, he gave the names, they're not names that any of us would recognize. Decided that his behavior did not warrant being fired.He then was fired and given you what he says happened to him. He then was fired because he expressed political opinions about the president. So, his argument is I was punished for exercising political speech which is protected under the First Amendment, and the FBI people that reviewed my behavior decided not to fire me, and I wasn't allowed an appeal which under the civil service law is he is entitled to.Prediction, there'll be some kind of monetary settlement here. Nobody wants a case like this to go -- to go to trial. He doesn't want all of his background, as I said, kiddingly, I'd like to be present at the deposition. He doesn't want to have to answer all those questions under oath: Did you say this? Did you say this? Did you do that?BARTIROMO: Yes.NAPOLITANO: What did you tell FISA? He doesn't want to go through that. Right. And he appeared he doesn't want to go through that.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Yes, I just say no mention of the abuse -- no mention of the abuse around the FISA Court.NAPOLITANO: Of course, not.BARTIROMO: So, that's comments.VELICOVICH: He deliberately sabotage the president of the United States.BARTIROMO: That's right.VELICOVICH: He's a counterintelligence professional that should know better.NAPOLITANO: of course -- of course.VELICOVICH: You should not -- you know, intertwined political dissent in your thoughts who is -- if you're a counterintelligence professional. That is sabotage by definition, and that's a criminal offense if you're in the intelligence community.NAPOLITANO: Well, that's why I don't think those will be tried. To be settled probably with some financial settlement.It's interesting what he's asking for. A return -- I can't imagine this happening now. A return to the position that he had at the time he was fired with an increase in pay.BARTIROMO: Yes, right. Because he did such a good job in that role.MCDOWELL: Because he can't get a job at MSNBC. Was that why?BARTIROMO: Yes, that's probably the next step. This whole story is so troubling.NAPOLITANO: Yes.BARTIROMO: And more is coming out. We're expecting the I.G. report around September. And, of course, Lindsey Graham's deep dive into the FISA abuse comments as well. Judge, it's really good to see you.NAPOLITANO: Pleasure, guys. All the best.BARTIROMO: Thanks so much. Judge Napolitano there. Coming up, Twitter privacy issues. The company admitting that it may have used data for ads without user permission. Details coming up.VELICOVICH: Surprise.BARTIROMO: And then the view from the top. I sat down with pro golfer, Brooks Koepka, yesterday. Talked golf and technology and life as the number one golfer in the world. That's coming up.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. North Korea issuing a new warning about this latest missile test. Cheryl Casone on headlines now. Cheryl.CASONE: Yes, that's right, Maria. North Korea launched another missile yesterday. This is the fourth in less than two weeks.North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, said that the test launches are a warning to the United States and to South Korea over this joint military drills that began this week. Now, North Korea says that Kim supervised a live fire demonstration of newly developed short-range ballistic missiles.Well, Twitter has revealed that it may have shared certain data without permission. Users to have clicked on ads since May 2018 may have had personal data send to Twitter's partners. Company reportedly also used data for personalized ads without getting an OK. Twitter said that it's working to make sure this never happens again.And then, now to Amazon. The self-driving delivery robot scout, you may have seen him if you're in Seattle. Well, they'll going to another neighborhood.The six-wheel robots are going to begin delivering packages in Irvine, California. Amazon begin testing robots in a suburb of Seattle at the beginning of this year. Now, the company says that scouts will be delivering orders Monday to Friday and only during the day.So, I guess, Maria, if you're a robot, you just don't want to work on weekends.You know what -- you know, but OK, got it.BARTIROMO: I like that. I want to use one of those. I think they look cool.MCDOWELL: No, it's because you need a person there to answer the calls and deal with the -- when the robot gets lost or wounds up with the --BARTIROMO: Yes, that's true.MCDOWELL: There's a need for people, still.BARTIROMO: That's good. We like that. Quick break, and then sitting down with number one, my chat with pro golfer, Brooks Koepka, we talked technology golf -- what it's like to rule the green. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Well, Tiger Woods may still be the top draw but Brooks Koepka is the top golfer in the world. Both PGA superstars taking their town's Jersey City, New Jersey this week, for the first leg of the FedEx Cup Playoffs. I caught up with Koepka at Liberty National Golf Club yesterday where the big tournament will take place.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: You are a very special individual and a special athlete, let's talk about that, number one in the world, four major titles in three seasons, how do you feel about all of this?BROOKS KOEPKA, PROFESSIONAL GOLFER: It's awesome. I want a good run right now. You know, it's kind of one of those things where you do don't want it to end, eventually it's going to. It's going to slow down but, you know, I'm enjoying the moment, I'm enjoying where I'm at and trying to make, you know, an impact and it's been a lot of fun.BARTIROMO: How do you stay there? Tell me that. I know that this is partly mental, it's partly physical, but how do you stay number one? What's going through your head right now?KOEPKA: When I first became number one, it was more about -- I just wanted to stay there, you know, that was the goal just to stay there. Yes, and then I lost it and got it back again. And ever since I got it back, it's been one of those things where I'm not trying to push too hard and not trying to put too much pressure on yourself, and you kind of get consumed with it, and that's kind of what I did in the beginning stages of it. But now, it's just relax and go play, still the same game I've played for 25 years now, and nothing has change -- just going to put the ball in the hole.BARTIROMO: So, is there something that you know that others don't? I mean, you're a champion, so when go out there, you know that you're among the best in the world, hands down. You've got others around you but what do you think about?KOEPKA: I don't think about anything, I just go out there and go win, go play the best I can each day and go play the best I can for that week. And you know, even if it comes up short, it comes up short. I gave it my all and there's nothing to be disappointed in if you gave it your all.BARTIROMO: How has the game changed? I mean, you've got new ways to show the game on T.V. You've got social media, you've got --KOEPKA: Oh, yes.BARTIROMO: -- technology, tell me how the game has changed from your standpoint?KOEPKA: It's crazy. There's so much technology. I really don't even use much of it. I mean, I understand how it all works, you can break it down into just about anything from, you start looking at half degree here from half-degree there, you know, in a full swing and the ball is going 300 yards and it goes off 15 yards off line. And it can get very complicated and you kind of get obsessed with it. I'm the kind of person, when I see those stats, I see the numbers, all of the technology involved in it and I kind of get consumed by it instead of actually going out and go play and just kind of let it come naturally to me.BARTIROMO: Yes, it feels like you don't put that pressure on yourself. You always say it's just golf -- you go out there and what's most important is you're feeling relaxed.KOEPKA: Yes, that's all growth. I mean, it's just a game at the end of the game at the end of the day. We're still having fun. I'm still having as much fun as I did when I was a 5-year-old kid, 10-year-old kid not making any money or not playing for major championships. It's still a game for me.BARTIROMO: And you grew up with it?KOEPKA: Yes, that's what makes the fun. You know, I grew up playing with my family and then obviously, you know, you start competing against guys a little bit older you, guys your age and then you get out here and then it becomes very real.BARTIROMO: So, here we are at the beginning of the playoffs, you say winning major events championships is easier than regular events?KOEPKA: Yes, I think so. That's a little too much pressure on themselves. You figure this on, there are 50 guys who said it were -- you know, a lot of them, they just want to win. And then, mentally, some of them just aren't strong enough and then from there, you've got a few that will play good. So, you only have to beat a certain amount of guys and guys just mentally get in their own way a lot of times.BARTIROMO: So, go back to your most recent huge win, a huge amount of opportunities comes your way with that right? Endorsements. How do you decide?KOEPKA: Yes, I mean, obviously, I start to partner up with brands that kind of go along the same viewpoints that I have. I think that it's fun; we get to meet so many different people. Golf is a game that everyone loves to play and you get them out there in the golf course for five hours and you really get to know somebody. So, it's been fun dealing with sponsors and dealing with different partnerships and meeting a bunch of people.BARTIROMO: Golfing has become really big business. I mean, I know it just didn't happen that way but it's happened over several years. Do you feel it as a player, do you feel it as the number one?KOEPKA: Yes, yes, a little bit. You know, you've got certain obligations you got to stick to and it's fun, each year seems to grow and grow as far as who you can meet, who you can bring into the game and that's what -- that's what I think everybody loves about this game: you see a lot of other athletes even when they're done playing they want to come in and play golf.BARTIROMO: It's funny because they're strong from other sports but they really love golf.KOEPKA: Yes, you know, we watch them all of the time and they end up watching us and all they want to do -- I mean, some of them are golf junkies so it's quite fun.BARTIROMO: You feel like you didn't get treated and respected by the media; you didn't get your due by the media last time.KOEPKA: Yes, I felt it there for a while. If there was a couple of other guys that have done what I've done over the couple of years, it feels like they're -- the dollar bill, (INAUDIBLE) or anything like that. You know, I get it, I get that I'm not on the golf course, not smiling all of the time, not the most approachable on the golf course and, you know, it's one of those things where that's my work. You know, I'm going out there not to please anybody on the golf course, I'm just going out to take care of business. I'm sure a lot of people -- you know, they might enjoy their jobs but at the same time when they're grind in computer, they may not be smiling. That's basically what I'm doing out here.BARTIROMO: Yes. And by the way, that's why you're winning.KOEPKA: Yes, exactly. I got to focus on what I got to do.BARTIROMO: You didn't do any equipment deals, tell me about that, why?KOEPKA: I just wanted to play with everything that I've got right now in the bag. I think it's nice to keep your options open, nice to have, you know, some company comes out with new driver, a new ball, new wedges, anything like that. I've got the opportunity to go out there and go test it and see if it's going to make my game better.BARTIROMO: So, the next, what, five months is really important to you, how do you prepare?KOEPKA: Yes, I mean, obviously, these few weeks will be important and then from there it's just, you know, I'm happy where I'm at. I'm happy where I'm at. I feel like everything has worked out well, I think that's why I've had so much success over the last few years being able to kind of pick and choose what I'd like to do. So, I hope it stays that way.BARTIROMO: Karma. You're a good man. Thank you so much for joining me.KOEPKA: Thank you.(END VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: All right. My thanks to the number one golf in the world, Brooks Koepka, more to come on that.

China threatens retaliation if US tariff hikes go aheadAssociated Press InternationalAugust 15, 2019 Thursday 10:42 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 480 wordsByline: By JOE McDONALD, AP Business WriterDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) - China on Thursday threatened retaliation if Washington steps up their war over trade and technology by going ahead with planned Sept. 1 tariff hikes on additional Chinese imports.Beijing will take unspecified "necessary countermeasures," the Cabinet said in a one-sentence statement. It gave no details or any indication plans for trade talks in Washington in September might be affected.The mounting tension has unnerved financial markets that worry the global economy will tip into recession.President Donald Trump says he plans to impose 10% duties on an additional $300 billion of Chinese imports, extending penalties to almost everything the United States buys from China.The Chinese announcement made no mention of Trump's decision Wednesday to postpone penalties on about 60% of those goods until Dec. 15. Among the products given a reprieve are mobile phones, laptops, video game consoles, some toys, computer monitors, shoes and clothing.Trade between the two biggest global economies has plunged, battering suppliers of goods from medical equipment to soybeans and threatening job losses. Chinese imports of U.S. goods fell 19% from a year earlier in July. Exports to the United States declined 6.5%.China's lopsided trade balance with the United States means Beijing almost has almost run out of imports that haven't already been hit with retaliatory tariffs. But Beijing has extended punishment for U.S. companies by delaying customs clearance for their goods and delaying issuing licenses in finance and other fields.Washington and Beijing are fighting over U.S. complaints China steals or pressures companies to hand over technology and improperly subsidies its industries.The U.S., Japan, Europe and other partners complain Chinese plans for government-led creation of global competitors in robotics, electric cars and other technologies violate Beijing's market-opening obligations.China offered to narrow its multibillion-dollar trade surplus with the U.S. by purchasing more soybeans and other exports. But negotiators are resisting pressure to roll back industry plans the ruling Communist Party sees as a path to prosperity and global influence.The talks broke down in May over how to enforce a deal. Beijing says Trump's tariffs must be lifted as soon as an agreement takes effect. Washington says they must stay to enforce compliance.Trump and President Xi Jinping agreed in June to resume negotiations but neither side has indicated a willingness to compromise. A round of talks last month in Shanghai ended with no indication of progress.By this point, the Trump administration has imposed 25% tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese imports.Beijing has retaliated by imposing punitive duties on $110 billion of American goods.

China charges Australian writer Yang Hengjun with spyingCNN.comAugust 26, 2019 Monday 11:26 PM ESTCopyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: AUSTRALIALength: 639 wordsByline: By Angus Watson, CNNDateline: Hong Kong BodyChinese-Australian writer Yang Hengjun has been arrested on espionage charges in Beijing, seven months after being detained in southern China.His charges were announced by the Australian government. Yang's Melbourne-based lawyer, Rob Stary, said few details had been released about the case beyond the spying charges."We don't know whether he's accused of spying on behalf of a third party actor -- a foreign government such as Australia or the US," Stary said. "We know him as a blogger and democracy activist -- so we can't conceive of any other actions outside of his role as a political agitator."Stary said the spying charges were worrying. Espionage can carry the death penalty in China, though Stary said it was "not within our contemplation that this case will attract that penalty."A former official with the Chinese foreign ministry, Yang, 53, also holds Australian citizenship, and was known to spend most of his time in the United States. He also had a large following on Twitter, where he posted satirical commentaries and criticism of the Chinese government.He was detained in the city of Guangzhou in January, while he and his wife were visiting from New York, where Yang was a visiting scholar at Columbia University. Yang's wife, Yuan Xiaoliang -- a Chinese citizen with Australian permanent residency -- has been issued an exit ban preventing her from leaving China, Stary said.Authorities in Beijing did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Yang's case. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs previously said: "(The) Chinese national security authority (is handling) the case in strict accordance with the law and (will) fully protects his legal rights."Stary said Julian McMahon, a high-profile Australian barrister, had been hired to assist with the case. McMahon previously represented the Bali Nine, accused drug traffickers who were sentenced to death in Indonesia in 2005.Diplomatic issueYang's detention in January came amid a period of rocky relations between Beijing and Canberra.The two sides were clashing on issues ranging from China's alleged attempts to influence the former's domestic politics, to Canberra's decision to ban technology by Chinese company Huawei from the country's 5G mobile networks and Beijing's rising ambitions in the South Pacific.Marise Payne, Australia's minister for foreign affairs, said in a statement that Canberra was "very concerned" about Yang, who was moved to a detention center in Beijing in July, after six months of house arrest."Dr Yang has been held in Beijing in harsh conditions without charge for more than seven months. Since that time, China has not explained the reasons for Dr Yang's detention, nor has it allowed him access to his lawyers or family visits," she said."We have serious concerns for Dr Yang's welfare, and about the conditions under which he is being been held."Although Beijing denies any link between its detention of foreign nationals and bilateral disputes, critics say the cases have had a "chilling effect" on how foreigners view and deal with China."You start to hear people say, If my government has frictions with China, I'd better not be in China," Yaqiu Wang, a China researcher for the international advocacy group Human Rights Watch, told CNN earlier this year. "Other people feel, I'd better stay quiet and not say anything critical of the Chinese government in case something happens to me."In December last year, two Canadians -- former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor -- were detained and accused of stealing "sensitive information and other intelligence." Their detention came just over a week after the Canadian government arrested Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Chinese tech giant Huawei, on behalf of the US.Meng is facing charges of working to evade US sanctions on Iran.Load-Date: August 27, 2019End of Document

Google refused to call out China over disinformation about Hong Kong - unlike Facebook and Twitter - and it could reignite criticism of its links to BeijingBusiness Insider USAugust 23, 2019 Friday 07:18 AM GMTCopyright 2019 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 870 wordsByline: ama@businessinsider.com,  (Alexandra Ma)Highlight: Google said it disabled 210 YouTube channels linked to a disinformation campaign about Hong Kong. It stopped short, however, of blaming China.BodyAly Song/Reuters• Google stopped short of calling out China after disabling 210 YouTube channels linked to a coordinated disinformation campaign about the protests in Hong Kong.• Twitter and Facebook also banned accounts on their platforms this week, but they clearly linked the perpetrators to the Chinese state.• Google's apparent reticence could ignite criticism, from prominent figures like Peter Thiel, of the company's ties to Beijing.• Earlier this year, Thiel described Google's relationship with China as "seemingly treasonous" and said the FBI and the CIA should investigate. President Donald Trump said he would look into those claims.• Google's ties to China have been under scrutiny in recent months after it was revealed that it was planning to develop a censored search engine in the country.• Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.Google's refusal to call out China after tackling a disinformation campaign around the Hong Kong protests - days after            Facebook and Twitter blamed China outright - could reignite criticism about the company's ties to Beijing.Google on Thursday announced that YouTube, a platform it owns, had disabled 210 channels on the platform.It said the reason was the channels' apparent ties to a coordinated influence operation around the Hong Kong protest movement, but the company stopped short of naming who was responsible.ANTHONY WALLACE/AFP/Getty ImagesFacebook, YouTube, and Twitter are all formally banned in China.Google has more activity in China than the other two companies, however. It operated there until 2010, when it pulled out, citing excessive censorship from the government.Until earlier this year Google had a secret plan, codenamed Project Dragonfly, to accept a degree of censorship in return for being allowed back in the Chinese market. It also has an artificial-intelligence research division based in China.Read more: Facebook and Twitter say they've detected a Chinese propaganda campaign targeting Hong Kong protestersGoogle announced that the Hong Kong disinformation network had been shut down in a Thursday blog post by Shane Huntley, a member of Google's security team.The post said the videos uploaded were about the Hong Kong protest movement, which the Chinese government is running a campaign to discredit.In the post, Huntley said the activity was "consistent with recent observations and actions related to China announced by Facebook and Twitter."But unlike Twitter and Facebook, Google made no mention of who could be to blame.GettyWhen Twitter announced its deletion of 936 accounts, it cited its own "reliable evidence" that the disinformation network was "a coordinated state-backed operation" based in China.Facebook, which detected five accounts, seven pages, and three groups sowing disinformation, said the campaign had "links to individuals associated with the Chinese government."Google declined to answer Business Insider's questions about why it did not say where the activity could have come from.The account removals appear to be part of a wider movement against state propaganda.Twitter on Monday also said it would no longer accept advertising from state-controlled news media, while Facebook said it had no plans to change its ad policies, Reuters reported.REUTERS/Tyrone SiuGoogle declined to comment when asked whether YouTube would follow in Twitter's footsteps.YouTube places disclaimers below its videos noting whether the uploader is part of a state-funded network, including the Chinese broadcasters Xinhua, CCTV, and CGTN.It does not include this disclaimer for the Communist Party-run newspapers People's Daily, China Daily, and Global Times.Google declined to comment when asked whether it would expand its labeling for Chinese state media.ReutersWhile it's not clear why Google isn't blaming Beijing for the disinformation campaign, the apparent reticence could ignite criticism of the company's ties to the country.Peter Thiel, the billionaire Silicon Valley investor who is a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump, has repeatedly attacked Google on the issue.He particularly criticized Google for conducting artificial-intelligence research in China while simultaneously refusing to join the US Department of Defense's AI initiative, known as Project Maven.GettyIn a July speech and            August op-ed article in The New York Times, Thiel - who is a director at Facebook - described Google's relationship with China as "seemingly treasonous."He suggested that the FBI and the CIA should investigate the links "in a not excessively gentle manner."Trump has promised to look into Thiel's claims. It's not clear whether the Trump administration has acted on these calls yet.Read all of Insider's coverage on Hong Kong here.NOW WATCH: 5 things wrong with Apple's lightning cableSee Also:• News Corp is reportedly releasing 'Knewz,' a Google News competitor that it hopes will help readers find news stories from more and different sources• MicrophoneGate: The world's biggest tech companies were caught sending sensitive audio from customers to human contractors.
